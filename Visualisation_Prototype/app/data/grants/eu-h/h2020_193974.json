{"id":"193974","title":"Multi-Scale Fluid Flow in DYNamically FRACtured Porous Reservoir","abstractText":"The unconventional recovery processes of oil and gas reservoirs raise significant costs and risks to the surrounding environment (including contamination of ground water, risks to air quality etc.) around the world and threatens to pose greater challenges in the future to meet the rising energy demand. The oil-gas industry is meeting this threat with developing diverse technologies that work by different mechanisms but share a common goal: to reduce risks for the surrounding environment and to increase the recovery factor of reservoirs. \n\nThe aim of this project would be to develop a new fully coupled framework as an extension of research INTERSECT simulator in which we can model dynamic crack propagation with the injection of high velocity fluid flow as observed in the hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) of unconventional reservoirs.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"642987","fundValue":"255374,28","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
