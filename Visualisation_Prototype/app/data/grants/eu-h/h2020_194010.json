{"id":"194010","title":"Radio technologies for 5G using advanced photonic infrastructure for dense user environments","abstractText":"In RAPID, we propose to use a centralized radio access (C-RAN) architecture to support high-capacity heterogeneous (3g, 4G and 60 GHz) radio access technologies through low-cost, but ultra-high-bandwidth photonic techniques for the fibre distribution. To meet the requirement to transport the high-frequency (and wide-bandwidth) wireless signals at low-cost, a novel coherent radio-over-fiber (CRoF) scheme is proposed in RAPID. Furthermore, for the mobile receiver, novel extremely low-cost (<10â‚¬) integrated transceivers will be developed based upon a SiGe technology. \nThe radio resource management of the heterogeneous network using the developed mm-wave and photonic technologies together with legacy 3G/4G wireless will be demonstrated in RAPID and the developed hardware will be tested in life-cycle assessments within different real life networks scenarios including a public stadium, an operators fiber-optic and wireless network, as well as in train, airport scenarios.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"643297","fundValue":"1549755","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"h2020"}
