{"id":"193956","title":"Development of Selective Carbohydrate Immunomodulators Targeting C-type Lectin Receptors on Antigen Presenting Cells","abstractText":"IMMUNOSHAPE aims at training a new generation of scientists that will be capable of combining state of the art synthesis and screening technology to develop new lead structures for highly selective glycan based multivalent immunotherapeutics for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases and allergy. To this end, we have set up a training program in a unique academic-industrial environment that will educate young researchers in scientific and practical biomedical glycoscience with the final aim to produce new talent and innovation in the field and improve their career perspectives in both academic and non-academic sectors. The unique combination of 10 academic groups with expertise in automated solid-phase carbohydrate synthesis, microarray based highthroughput screening technology, tumour immunology, structural glycobiology, multivalent systems and medicinal chemistry along with 4 industrial partners active in nanomedicine, immunotherapy, medicinal device development and the fabrication of scientific instrumentation will provide a multidisciplinary and multisectorial training to 15 ESRs in biomedical glycoscience and its industrial applications.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"642870","fundValue":"3811581","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
