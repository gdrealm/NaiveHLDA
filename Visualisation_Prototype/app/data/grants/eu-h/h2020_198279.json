{"id":"198279","title":"European Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Laboratory Infrastructure","abstractText":"ECCSEL aims at gaining recognition as a world-class research infrastructure based within leading European Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) institutions and knowledge centres. It will be due for registration in 2015, forming a legal entity allocating efforts and resources to selected scientific and technological aspects of the CCS chain. \nECCSEL will enable high-ranking researchers and scientists from all regions of Europe (and from third countries) to access state-of-the-art research facilities to conduct advanced technological research actions relevant to CCS. \nThe proposed project aims to :\n• implement ECCSEL as a not-for-profit organisation consistent with the European Research Infrastructure Consortium legal framework ;\n• initiate operations of ECCSEL as a world-class CCS research infrastructure in accordance with the principles developed during the preparatory phase;\n• develop the research infrastructure to an upgraded common standard in terms of quality of services, management and access provision;","grantUrl":"","grantId":"675206","fundValue":"3252279,6","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","dataset":"h2020"}
