{"id":"199320","title":"BiogasAction: Promotion of sustainable biogas production in EU","abstractText":"BiogasAction aim to serve as vehicle for the development of the European biogas sector and thereby contribute to the EU 2020 targets by focusing on removing non-technical barriers to widespread production of biogas/biomethane from manure and other waste. Central driver is the cooperation between different policy levels at EU, national and regional level. The project will boost biogas development in the target regions in conjunction with replication efforts & promotion at broad EU scale. BiogasAction key activity & expected impact:\n• A web portal containing EU-wide biogas market overview, technical biogas and biomethane information and experience of EU/national biogas projects, case studies and free on-line/off-line biogas tools\n• Biogas and biomethane intervention strategy plans in the 9 target regions\n• Replication of the project in 5 EU countries/regions \n• A guidance document for investors about financing biogas/biomethane project and reducing investment risk. \n• A guidance document for policy and decision makers and for local authorities/municipalities, to enable them to improve national framework conditions for biogas and biomethane deployment\n• Definition and support of a total of 50 high quality, sustainable biogas projects in the 9 target regions. \n• 3 peer learning European workshops focusing on key competence areas (80 participants), 1 European roundtable about advanced biogas applications, organisation of at least 1 national energy info day in each target region, with more than 100 participants/event\n• 3-4 events/training courses per target region for public administration aimed to improve the framework, including follow-up of the recommendations\n• 2-4 events/training courses per target region aimed to raise the public acceptance\n• A local training package incl. use of training material from previous projects \n• Series of 6-8 trainings in each of the 9 target regions on specific topics for biogas plant operators\n• Final event on project achievements","grantUrl":"","grantId":"691755","fundValue":"1999885","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
