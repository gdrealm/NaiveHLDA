{"id":"196610","title":"Coordinating an Observation Network of Networks EnCompassing saTellite and IN-situ to fill the Gaps in European Observations","abstractText":"ConnectinGEOâ€™s primary goal is to link existing coordinated Earth Observation networks with science and technology (S&T) communities, the industry sector and the GEOSS and Copernicus stakeholders. The aim is to facilitate a broader and more accessible knowledge base to support the needs of the GEO Societal Benefit Areas (SBAs) and their users. A broad range of subjects from climate, natural resources and raw materials, to the emerging UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be addressed. A tangible outcome of the project will be a prioritized list of critical gaps within the European Union in observations and the models that translate observations into practice-relevant knowledge. The prioritized list will include the research activities required to address these gaps. Ultimately, this will increase coherency of European observation networks, increase the use of Earth observations for assessments and forecasts and inform the planning for future observation systems through a sustainable approach that will survive beyond the end of this project.\n\nConnectinGEO has 4 major objectives:\na) Enable a European Network of Earth Observation Networks (ENEON) including space-based, airborne and in-situ observations networks. \nb) Provide a methodology to convert the knowledge needs into a coherent observation and measurement compendium for ENEON strategy and development. \nc) Apply the ConnectinGEO methodology to identify and assess the priority of gaps. \nd) Open the results of the project and exploit them beyond the project end.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"641538","fundValue":"999995,94","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","dataset":"h2020"}
