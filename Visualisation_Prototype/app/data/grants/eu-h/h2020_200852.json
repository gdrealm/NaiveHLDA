{"id":"200852","title":"Data Driven Dairy Decisions 4 Farmers","abstractText":"The Data Driven Dairy Decisions for Farmers (4D4F) thematic network will focus on the role which dairy animal and environmental sensors can play in collecting real time information to help make more informed decisions in dairy farming.\n\nThe network will develop a Community of Practice comprised of farmers, farm advisors, technology suppliers, knowledge exchange professionals and researchers who will work together to debate, collect and communicate best practice drawn from innovative farmers, industry and the research community to facilitate the co-creation of best practice.  The results will be communicated to farmers using best practice guides on the use of sensors and data analysis tools supported by videos, infographics and an online virtual warehouse of dairy sensor technologies.\n\nThe network will include the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) which can be tailored to individual farms to help farmers and farm advisors adopt dairy sensor and data analysis technology.  The SOPs will be developed by working groups of the Community of Practice including farmers, farm advisors, technology suppliers, knowledge exchange professionals and researchers, who will work together to develop farmer friendly SOPs.\n\nThe on line Community of Practice and published communication tools will be complimented by on farm events and workshops to help farmers and farm advisors implement innovative sensor and data analysis technologies.  The workshops and events will promote discussion between farmers and their peers on how best to use sensors and data analysis in their own businesses.  This will lead to local peer to peer support to facilitate the adoption of data driven dairy decision making.\n\nThe network will work closely with EIP Agri and at member state level it will work with existing EIP Operational Groups working on dairy data and sensors and, where suitable Operational Groups do not exist, it will work with local partners to develop new Operational Groups.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"696367","fundValue":"2105796,25","fundStart":"2016-03-01","fundEnd":"2019-02-28","dataset":"h2020"}
