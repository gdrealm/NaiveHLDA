{"id":"194165","title":"SemAntically integrating Genomics with Electronic health records for Cancer CARE","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to bring together subject matter experts from the academic and non-academic sectors to create a holistic informatics platform for rapidly integrating genomic sequences, electronic health records (EHRs) and research repositories to enable personalised medicine strategies for malignant melanoma treatment.\n\nThe consortium has engaged in a pre-proposal process with active clinical end users who have highlighted the need for more innovative approaches for the treatment of cancer - in particular the treatment of malignant melanoma, including inter alia the ability to rapidly query of geno-phenotype associations in melanoma such as the recently discovered rs2301641 SNP variability   with ABCB5 function and CDK4 gene indicators . \n\nHence we aim to develop a scalable HPC framework that allows the semantic interlinking between spatially distributed electronic patientsâ€™ health records, associated genomic sequences and published research, thereby allowing clinicians to make reasoned queries over vast knowledge bases for the diagnosis, treatment and management of malignant melanoma.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"644186","fundValue":"450000","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-11-30","dataset":"h2020"}
