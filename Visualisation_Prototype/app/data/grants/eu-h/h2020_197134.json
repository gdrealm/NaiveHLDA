{"id":"197134","title":"Advanced Lithium Sulphur battery for xEV","abstractText":"ALISE is a pan European collaboration focused on the development and commercial scale-up of new materials and on the understanding of the electrochemical processes involved in the lithium sulphur technology. It aims to create impact by developing innovative battery technology capable of fulfilling the expected and characteristics from European Automotive Industry needs, European Materials Roadmap, Social factors from vehicle consumers and future competitiveness trends and European Companies positioning. The project is focused to achieve 500 Wh/Kg stable LiS cell. The project involves dedicated durability, testing and LCA activities that will make sure the safety and adequate cyclability of battery being developed and available at competitive cost. Initial materials research will be scaled up during the project so that pilot scale quantities of the new materials will be introduced into the novel cell designs thus giving the following advancements over the current state of the art. The project approach will bring real breakthrough regarding new components, cell integration and architecture associated. New materials will be developed and optimized regarding anode, cathode, electrolyte and separator. Complete panels of specific tools and modelling associated will be developed from the unit cell to the batteries pack. Activities are focused on the elaboration of new materials and processes at TRL4. Demonstration of the lithium sulphur technology will be until batteries pack levels with validation onboard. Validation of prototype (17 kWh) with its driving range corresponding (100 km) will be done on circuit. ALISE is more than a linear bottom-up approach from materials to cell. ALISE shows strong resources to achieve a stable unit cell, with a supplementary top-down approach from the final application to the optimization of the unit cell.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"666157","fundValue":"6899233","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2019-05-31","dataset":"h2020"}
