{"id":"204905","title":"Search for a new light scalar particle in the K+→π+χ decay at the NA62 experiment at CERN","abstractText":"The Higgs boson was discovered at CERN in 2012 putting the last missing brick into the Standard Model that successfully describes phenomena up to the TeV energies. However, the Standard Model is incomplete offering no explanation for a range of phenomena, which motivates the development of various extensions. Some of these extensions predict the existence of new particles at low energy scale, and can be therefore tested in meson decays. The main aim of this project is to observe physics beyond the Standard Model in kaon decays through the search for a new light scalar particle χ in the decay K→πχ, χ→μμ- at the NA62 experiment at CERN.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"701386","fundValue":"195454,8","fundStart":"2017-07-03","fundEnd":"2019-07-02","dataset":"h2020"}
