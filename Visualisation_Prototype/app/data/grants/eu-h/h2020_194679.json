{"id":"194679","title":"Scaling of a midsized patented low energy, light weight, highly efficient actuator to meet the demands of smaller and larger scale functions","abstractText":"The Smart Actuator Company Ltd develops smart, RIFT Driven® actuators our first was delivered to market in Q3-2013.  The system is proven to use 25% less copper, be 80% lighter and 75% more energy efficient than our competitors.  Early success means that the first two years production scheduling is already sold to 90% capacity and The Smart Actuator Company now own global rights for the use of RIFT Technology in electrically powered actuators.  Put simply, we believe our technology is a game changing product capable of delivering benefits worldwide by dramatically reducing;\n• energy required to automate everyday tasks in many applications\n• volume of raw materials, including copper and magnets, used to    manufacture automated systems\n• inventory and therefore administration complexity\n• weight, thereby reducing fuel use in logistics and shipping\n• Carbon Footprint in manufacturing and distribution\n• need for sourcing manufacturing capability outside Europe","grantUrl":"","grantId":"650702","fundValue":"71429","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-01","dataset":"h2020"}
