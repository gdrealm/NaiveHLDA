{"id":"195244","title":"The persistence of relict populations under climate change","abstractText":"The rapid change in the Earthâ€™s climate is predicted to disrupt the conditions which determine the distribution of tree species, with the most dramatic impacts at species range edges. At the trailing-range edge, empirical knowledge of the structure and performance of populations is very limited despite its essential importance for accurate prediction of species distribution and conservation of species diversity. Here, I hypothesize that the trailing-range edge is partly comprised of a relict structure of populations that can stabilize the range-edge of tree species.  Through trait-based ecology and combining field, experimental and molecular approaches I aim to disentangle (1) the habitat, functional, genetic and demographic structure of trailing-range edge populations; (2) the mechanisms of local adaptation in early life stages; and (3) the associations between functional traits, demographic performance, habitat conditions  and the relict status of populations. PERS-RELICT-CLIM is the first project designed to gain a complete understanding of trailing-range edge structure and functioning and potential of populations for persistence under global climate change.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"656300","fundValue":"195454,8","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","dataset":"h2020"}
