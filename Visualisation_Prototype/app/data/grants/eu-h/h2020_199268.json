{"id":"199268","title":"Hybrid Membranes Incorporating Metal-Organic Frameworks","abstractText":"Research undertaken on ERC Advanced Grant 226593 (COORDSPACE) has delivered a new exciting range of metal organic frameworks (MOFs). These substances show ultra-high porosity and this makes them ideal for many high value commercial applications, including gas separations. Of specific interest is NOTT-300, a unique, porous solid with exceptional, selective, CO2 and SO2 uptake properties and remarkable acetylene vs ethylene, ethylene vs ethane, and CO2 vs CH4 separation abilities. We now target the incorporation of NOTT-300 into gas separation media to impart these systems with the extraordinary properties of NOTT-300 to fulfil an urgent unmet need within a range of industries. This project will develop and deliver a market-ready mixed matrix membrane (MMM) incorporating NOTT-300","grantUrl":"","grantId":"665632","fundValue":"147963,75","fundStart":"2015-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","dataset":"h2020"}
