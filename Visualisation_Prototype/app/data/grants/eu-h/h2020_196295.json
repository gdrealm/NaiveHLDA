{"id":"196295","title":"Health Condition Monitoring of Small Scale Tidal Generators Using Miniature Torque Sensors","abstractText":"By 2050, the size of wave and tidal energy is expected to reach an installed capacity of 100GW, which will be able to power 66 million European homes and also enable the EU to meet its target of reducing emission of green-house gases by 80-95% below 1990 levels. \n\nTidal generators are installed in very harsh environments of the sea-bed, where saline water, unpredictable tidal flow, marine debris and suspended particle impact can cause serious damage to generator blades and gearboxes. In addition, the unpredictable changing nature of load demand causes stresses on the tidal components.\n\nThe primary objective of the TidalHealth project is to commercially produce a direct torque measurement device attached to tidal generator shaft for overall condition monitoring of tidal power plants remotely. This will result in the reduction of operations and maintenance cost of the plants and thus improves the return on investment for tidal technologies.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"663953","fundValue":"71429","fundStart":"2015-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"h2020"}
