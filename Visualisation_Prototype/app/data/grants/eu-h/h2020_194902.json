{"id":"194902","title":"Low energy passenger comfort systems based on the joule and peltier effects.","abstractText":"The aim of JOSPEL project is the development of a novel energy efficient climate system for the optimization of interior temperature control management in electrical vehicles through an integrated approach that combines the application of the thermoelectric Joule and Peltier  effect, the development of an efficient insulation of the vehicle interior, the energy recovery from heat zones, battery life increase duration enhancement as a side effect of thermal management, battery consumption reduction by Peltier cooling integration,  innovative automated and eco-driving strategies and the electronic control of power flows. Main objective is the reduction of at least 50% of energy used for passenger comfort (<1,250 W) and at least 30% for component cooling in extreme conditions with reference to electric vehicles currently on the market.","grantUrl":"http://www.jospel-project.eu","grantId":"653851","fundValue":"6668288","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-10-31","dataset":"h2020"}
