{"id":"199240","title":"Large Scale Protein Library Screening Biosensor","abstractText":"In this application a platform is proposed that builds on preliminary work from ERC starting grant NanoP in order to develop a technology for high throughput electronic recognition of a large library of proteins using nanometer sized channels. These channel (or nanopore) dimensions are on the same order of magnitude as the proteins that we are using, making a natural confinement mechanism. Importantly, this allows for the efficient detection and screening of individual protein molecules and as will be shown in a high throughput manner. Here we propose to couple protein recognition to an electrical readout via a nanopore, that will result in improved prospects in efficiency, scalability, and sensitivity. Furthermore, this grant will allow for appropriate market research and IP landscaping to be performed in order to ensure the preferred option of setting up a spin-out company will be positioned correctly to ensure success.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"677677","fundValue":"149990","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","dataset":"h2020"}
