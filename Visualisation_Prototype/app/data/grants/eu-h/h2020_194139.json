{"id":"194139","title":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) as Elixirs against chronic Disease: OXidative regulatory mechanisms  In T cells and neutrophils.","abstractText":"We are proposing a four-year programme of knowledge transfer and networking between Aston University (ASTON, UK), Universitatsklinikum Erlangen (UKER, Germany) and Redoxis AB (Redoxis, Sweden). Our proposal targets an emerging area of biology, i.e. reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated regulation of immune responses; it brings together the application of small molecule candidate drugs to generate ROS, with use of innovative approaches to biomarker identification in models of chronic inflammatory disease. This research has significant potential for application in human health and is of particular relevance to the ageing population. Research training, innovation and knowledge exchange for early career researchers, achieved by combining our cutting edge expertise, is important to extend the EU’s reach in this emergent area. Interchange in this way will facilitate and promote our early career researchers to develop into tomorrow’s research leaders of redox biology in chronic inflammation. It will encourage new, cross-European collaboration between academia and industry ensuring that we maintain our leading position world-wide. \nThis tri-partite consortium brings together groups with highly complementary expertise to exchange knowledge and develop staff: ASTON – in the biochemical analyses of ROS, the effects of immune cell thiol oxidation in vitro and ex vivo and biomarker identification; UKER - in animal models of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis; and Redoxis - in development of novel drugs that stimulate production of ROS from the NOX2 enzyme as means to modulate chronic inflammation. The project objectives and challenges present a balanced mix between industrial application and basic science, which is focused on knowledge transfer and drug development. Through future collaborative funding, we anticipate far-reaching applications of redox modulators to manage chronic disease and increases in knowledge of both autoimmunity and ageing of the immune system.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"644035","fundValue":"144000","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2019-06-30","dataset":"h2020"}
