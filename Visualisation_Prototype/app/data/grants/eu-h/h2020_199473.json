{"id":"199473","title":"Power Density improvement demonstrated on a certified engine","abstractText":"SMA currently manufacture a 4 cylinder air cooled diesel engine. It will render this product more competitive in the market place if it has a higher power output (20%) and is lighter (10%). This proposal by Ilmor Engineering Ltd presents a program of work to achieve these objectives.\n\nIt is proposed to use start of the art analysis techniques and invent solutions for:-\n\na. Cooling the cylinder head.\nb. Improved strength coupled with simplified assembly and manufacturing of the crankcase.\nc. Improved layout of the engine with regard to the turbocharger position.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"686533","fundValue":"825357,5","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-11-30","dataset":"h2020"}
