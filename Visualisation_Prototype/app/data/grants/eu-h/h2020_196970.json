{"id":"196970","title":"Hybrid Electric Energy Integrated Cluster concerning Renewable Fuels","abstractText":"The targeted breakthrough of the HELENIC-REF project refers to the establishment of a new sustainable methodology for the water thermolysis at temperatures below 300oC and the immediate corresponding production of energy or fuels. The method is based on our preliminary experimental evidence of water thermolysis at 286oC in the presence of Fe3O4 nanoporous catalytic thick films, with the sustainable maintenance of the catalyst due to a new reduction method based on Lorentz force electrons generated by a magnetic field in the vicinity of the electric current heating the semiconducting catalyst. The method is used for the production of hydrogen and oxygen, as well as of fuels in the presence of CO2 in order to reduce CO2 to CO or even to hydrocarbons, (like Synthetic Natural Gas â€“ SNG) via methanation.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"665318","fundValue":"2578386","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","dataset":"h2020"}
