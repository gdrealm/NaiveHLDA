{"id":"194270","title":"LearnIng from Failure in a collaborative Entrepreneurship network","abstractText":"The LIFE project is about collaborative learning from failure in entrepreneurship and collaborative actions to bring entrepreneurship forward.\n\nAlthough cultural diversity is one of Europeâ€™s biggest assets, this also creates severe obstacles for entrepreneurs to scale their efforts at the pan-European level. The distributed markets, language barriers and decentralized policy leads to: lack of access to talent & relevant expertise, to sufficient financing and to adequate facilities & networks.\n\nHinged on a yearly Failing Forward conference, the project will \n- map out all the relevant stakeholders and programs in each of the partnering areas in a systematic way, making this available to all web entrepreneurs across Europe in one centralized platform,\n- identify, share and discuss best practices & success stories. \n\nThis yearly pan-European conference in Brussels will be complemented with local spin-off events in the partner regions, to \n-\tgenerate and grow awareness that failure is an inherent part of the process of entrepreneurship and innovation;\n-\tshare and celebrate the success stories that were built on incremental learning;\n-\topen up the existing startup support programs to web entrepreneurs from all over Europe.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"645000","fundValue":"413125","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
