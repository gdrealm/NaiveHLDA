{"id":"204145","title":"Prosperity through innovation and promotion of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans","abstractText":"PROSPERITY will:\n1. Produce a culture shift in terms of environment for SUMPs in member states and in the organisational culture of transport planning in city authorities.\n2. Get ministries and national agencies to play a national leading role on SUMPs, as in many member states these are the organisations from which cities take their main direction; where ministries are already playing this role, to support and strengthen their approach.\n3. To provide mechanisms and tools for Ministries to take this lead role.\n4. Analyse clearly the problems of (lack of) take-up of SUMPs – to understand from cities themselves why they are not taken up and then to help cities to address these barriers.\n5. Extend the existing 25-county EU-SUMP-network with at least two more countries\n6. Get more cities to take up effective high quality SUMPs – through cities’ involvement in the project and indirectly through more cities hearing about SUMPs in their country.\n7. Ensure that these SUMPs contain and will lead to implementation of a broad range of innovative sustainable transport measures.\n8. Build cities’ capacity to develop and implement SUMPs that genuinely reflect the spirit of the EU SUMP Guidelines, rather than being mandatory documents to fulfil a requirement linked to major transport infrastructure.\n9. Deliver a measurable impact.\n \nThe core concept of PROSPERITY is bringing ministries into the project, which will significantly enhance the visibility of the project at the national level and therefore increase numbers of cities active on SUMPs. Thus PROSPERITY will ensure that more cities commit to SUMPs that are in line with the EU SUMP Guidelines and that include a broad range of innovative measures. This will generate a high leverage factor, especially in regions and cities where take up is so far low and the impacts from transport are severe – therefore the majority of PROSPERITY activities is in such regions and cities - thus in southern, central-eastern and eastern Europe.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"690636","fundValue":"3188049","fundStart":"2016-09-01","fundEnd":"2019-08-31","dataset":"h2020"}
