{"id":"194740","title":"Retrofit all-Electric Bus for reduced Operator Operating costs in urban Transport (REBOOT)","abstractText":"The REBOOT project aims to significantly improve the competitiveness of European urban bus operators through the development of a retrofit all-electric drive system that replaces diesel engines. The objectives of our project include:\n\n• To develop a retrofit all-electric drive system, battery and recharger pack for an 18 tonne bus that weighs less than 2.2 tonnes (the weight of a diesel drive) with the capacity to travel 160km  \n• A final system price of €120,000 that delivers a payback to the operator within 3 years\n• To deliver an 80% reduction in fuel operating cost for bus operators \nIn Phase 1, our objectives include: \n• Conduct market sounding activities with at least 10 organisations comprising of customers, regulators and industry experts \n• Identify and establish strategic partnerships with at least 3 European industry partners in our value chain and 2 research institutions capable of enhancing the development and commercialisation of REBOOT\n• Identify and secure at least 1 location and operator for the pilot trial / demonstration of REBOOT \n• Evaluate an initial technology concept design using a design simulation package\n• Conduct a comprehensive review of the IP landscape and identify management strategies","grantUrl":"","grantId":"651630","fundValue":"71429","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"h2020"}
