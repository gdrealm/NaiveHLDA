{"id":"198371","title":"Integrated design and novel tooling and process optimisation of microwave processing of composites","abstractText":"SIMUTOOL will develop a simulation platform for the manufacturing of composites through microwave MW heating. The simulation will include the electromagnetic field coupled with heat transfer mechanisms that take place during the production process. It will also include the process control loop which will enable the optimum design of the manufacturing process.\nOne of the major outputs of the simulation platform will be the successful design of a ceramic matrix composite tool with a MW absorbing layer in order to maximise the energy saving potential of the MW heating process.\n\nThe project addresses the manufacturing issues of MW heating of composites which stem from the lack of understanding of the basic physics of the process (the most important item being how carbon fibers interact with the microwave field). The project will increase the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the MW heating of composites process to 6-7.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"680569","fundValue":"3412276","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2019-02-28","dataset":"h2020"}
