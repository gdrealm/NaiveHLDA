{"id":"194189","title":"Smart Ambulance: European Procurers Platform (SAEPP)","abstractText":"The objective of this project is to create and collate a consensus of agreement from Ambulance Users and Procurers on the core technology-centric features which, if correctly integrated into a suitably re-designed ambulance, would allow them to demonstrate, evaluate and deliver new models of in-community healthcare delivery, with the primary objective of avoiding unnecessary hospital attendances (& thus admissions) and the associated patient distress and hospital costs. Such a consensus would form the basis of a future PCP for the envisaged vehicle, and such a PCP Specification is in fact an output of this proposed work.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"644329","fundValue":"443600","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"h2020"}
