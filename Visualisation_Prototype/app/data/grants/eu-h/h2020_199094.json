{"id":"199094","title":"Support to the Europe PMC initiative – Co-funding grant for the 2016-2021 period","abstractText":"The proposed coordination and support action will provide continued support to the European Research Council (ERC) in the implementation of its Open Access strategy for projects funded in the Life Sciences domain. It follows on from the projects “Support towards the Europe PMC initiative – Contribution for 2014-2016” (ERC-EuropePMC-1-2014) and “Support towards the Europe PMC initiative – Contribution for 2013” (ERC-EuropePMC-SUP-2013) which allowed the ERC to offer the benefits of Europe PubMed Central (Europe PMC http://europepmc.org/) to its funded researchers for the first time in 2013. \n\nThe proposed project concerns the giving of a grant to EMBL-EBI for the purpose of ensuring the further development and maintenance of Europe PMC, beyond the work done as part of ERC-EuropePMC-SUP-2013 and ERC-EuropePMC-1-2014, for the period 1st April 2016 – 31st March 2021 (60 months). Support towards this project is requested from the ERC on a co-funding basis.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"699257","fundValue":"6071428,57","fundStart":"2016-04-01","fundEnd":"2021-03-31","dataset":"h2020"}
