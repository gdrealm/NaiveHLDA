{"id":"195664","title":"THz Muti-Gb/s System in Package","abstractText":"'The goal of 'THz Muti-Gb/s System in Package', i.e., 'TMGSiP' project is to develop a fully integrated 120GHz radio front-end for Multi-Gb/s radio links with state-of-the-art SiGe BiCMOS technology. This will be done with a completely new cross-cutting design methodology for silicon-MMIC, e.g. the development of wideband receiver and transmitter, including on-chip antenna and novel packaging concepts. This will enable a big improvement in the functionality (complexity of RF MMICs), performance (data rate), component size (fully-integrated compact MMIC with integrated antennas), low power, and cost over existing III/V communication systems.\nThe projectâ€™s ambition is to realize a THz SiP analog front-end with integrated antennas for a line of sight communication link with data rates up to 40Gbps centered around 120GHz and bandwidth of 20GHz with range up to a few meters. Due to the huge available bandwidth only simple low-order modulation schemes like QPSK will be considered.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"658764","fundValue":"195454,8","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","dataset":"h2020"}
