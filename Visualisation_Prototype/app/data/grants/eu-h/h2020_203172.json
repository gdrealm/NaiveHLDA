{"id":"203172","title":"ONLINE Platform for Smart Specialisation Policy Advice","abstractText":"This project aims to develop an e-policy platform augmented with a toolbox of applications and online services, which will assist national and regional authorities in the EU in elaborating or revising their smart specialisation agenda, in terms of policies and strategy. The platform will leverage existing methodologies, initiatives and tools developed by the EC for the RIS3 strategy, but it will also investigate, develop and test new and innovative technologies, tools and services aiming to strengthen the European capacity for knowledge-based policy advice.\n\nThe platform and the accompanied services will constitute an online mechanism for policy advice, integrated with a well-defined, commonly accepted and broadly used methodology for regional policy (RIS3 Guide). Data and sources of information to feed the platform and the services will be collected from institutional websites, RSS feeds, online databases, newsgroups and web forums, social networks data, web analytics, content management systems, measurement scoreboards, focus groups, and other online mechanisms for collaboration and policy co-design, and assessment. Taken together, these elements and architecture of integration will offer online all the necessary tools, methods, and roadmap to assist the elaboration, implementation, and impact analysis of smart specialisation policies.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"710659","fundValue":"3889000","fundStart":"2016-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","dataset":"h2020"}
