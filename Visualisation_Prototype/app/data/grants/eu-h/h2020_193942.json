{"id":"193942","title":"Around the Caspian: a Doctoral Training for Future Experts in Development and Cooperation with Focus on the Caspian Region","abstractText":"The main goal of this project is to train the next generation of experts on the Caspian region in order to establish, and make sustainable, a network of excellence. This will be achieved through an integrated PhD programme on the Caspian that boosts the researchersâ€™ theoretical, empirical and administrative skills, a thing that will make them extremely competitive for employment in both academic and non-academic sectors but also confident and knowledgeable enough to start their own projects. The training will enhance the research skills of the ESRs while also giving them a first-hand experience with a partner operating in a different environment, thus learning how to apply their skills to different fields and sectors. We expect our network and training to become a leading voice on issues related to the Caspian region both in academia and other sectors.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"642709","fundValue":"3811357,08","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
