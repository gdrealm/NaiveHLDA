{"id":"193162","title":"Underwater Time Of Flight Image Acquisition system","abstractText":"UTOFIA will offer a compact and cost-effective underwater imaging system for turbid environments. Using range-gated imaging, the system will extend the imaging range by factor 2 to 3 over conventional imaging systems, while at the same time providing video-rate 3D information. This will fill the current gap between short-range, high-resolution conventional video and long-range low-resolution sonar systems.\n\nUTOFIA offers a new modus operandi for the main targeted domains of application: marine life monitoring, harbour and ocean litter detection, fisheries and aquaculture stock assessment, and seabed mapping.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"633098","fundValue":"5716971","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","dataset":"h2020"}
