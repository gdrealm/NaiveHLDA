{"id":"194302","title":"Imaging analysis in all lighting and off weather conditions","abstractText":"The objective of the I-ALLOW project is therefore to study, design, develop and test an innovative approach which improves the safety of population and infrastructure in day time, night time and all-weather conditions by proving a state of the art multi-spectral imaging and processing system.\nI-ALLOW will be able to:\n•             A low cost single sensor imaging solution with versatile capabilities. \n•             Image in low light (night-time) conditions.\n•             Image in standard light (day-time) conditions.\n•             Image in harsh weather conditions (rain, snow, smog).\n•             Object detection based on multispectral data.\n•             Object detection based on 3D range data.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"645262","fundValue":"2409223","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","dataset":"h2020"}
