{"id":"195700","title":"Anisotropic High-Density Carbon Nanotube Coatings for Thin-Film Electronics","abstractText":"This project proposal aims at developing a new manufacturing technology for processing nano-materials by combining emerging scientific insights in nanoparticle assembly with scalable production processes. Our goal is to establish the first scalable technology to make thin-films comprising densely packed aligned Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) of highest quality. These films will be fabricated by controlled wet deposition and transfer techniques, and used as a high-performance material for device fabrication. On the longer term, the same principles could be extended to the production of transparent conductors, sensors, and to variety of other applications. As a demonstrator, horizontal CNT-interconnects targeting a resistivity below 100μΩ•cm will be fabricated. At this value CNT become a viable alternative to Copper in Microelectronics. This disruptive push of CNT-interconnects into commercially competitive specifications will be enabled by: the superior quality of the CNTs used in the CNT-films, advances in their transferring, the skillset of the host-group in nanoparticle’s assembly and manufacturing processes and the 7-years expertise of the applicant in CNT-interconnects. The network of both participants in various European countries and the assistance of IMEC (Belgium), partner organization to this project, will facilitate the implementation of this research for enabling a true industrial impact on EU economy.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"659001","fundValue":"183454,8","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","dataset":"h2020"}
