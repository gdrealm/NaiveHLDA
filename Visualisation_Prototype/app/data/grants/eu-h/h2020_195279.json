{"id":"195279","title":"Delivering Hydroacylation: A General and Enantioselective Process","abstractText":"This proposal outlines the development of a suite of truly general hydroacylation catalysts that demonstrate high levels of functional group tolerance, enantioselectivity, broad applicability and ease of use in the laboratory. These advances will be achieved by the development of a new modular ligand system, based on the small-bite angle hemilabile diphosphines. By achieving these advances hydroacylation will become a general and robust disconnection for the synthesis of fine and bulk chemicals, new materials and target molecules.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"656493","fundValue":"183454,8","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","dataset":"h2020"}
