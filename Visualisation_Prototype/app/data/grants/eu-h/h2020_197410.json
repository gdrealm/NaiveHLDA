{"id":"197410","title":"Photo Voltaic Fully Integrated and Automated Line","abstractText":"Teknisolar is developing a series of efficient, cost-effective and totally innovative technology solutions to manufacture high quality and low cost solar panels that will contribute to decarbonise and make more efficient the European energy system in a sustainable way. \n\nThe panels we intend to produce are expected to give a strong contribution to: \n\n1. Reaching the grid parity with fossil and nuclear energy sources in the large scale power generation\n2. Reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint in the solar panels manufacturing technology\n\nTeknisolar projectâ€™s ambition is now to demonstrate the ability to produce, in an industrial large scale plant, highly efficient panels using new generation solar cells, which can ensure higher efficiency for a life that is at least double, compared to that of inferior imported products. We intend then to build a fully automated PV manufacturing line, able to produce special PV panels with over 20% more efficiency at relatively low cost, offering the chance to easily achieve the grid parity.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"684528","fundValue":"71429","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
