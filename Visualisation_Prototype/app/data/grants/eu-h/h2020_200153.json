{"id":"200153","title":"Sharing Cities","abstractText":"Sharing Cities has four key objectives.  \n1) To achieve scale in the European smart cities market by proving that properly designed smart city solutions, based around common needs, can be integrated in complex urban environments.  This will be done in a way that exhibits their true potential and allows for the significant scale-up and consequent increase in social, economic and environmental value. \n2) Adopt a digital first approach which proves the extent to which ICT integration can improve and connect up existing infrastructure, as well as the design and running of new city infrastructure.  This will also allow for the creation of a new set of next stage digital services which will help citizens make better and beneficial choices around energy efficiency and mobility, which when scaled up will enhance the city’s ability to hit key targets for mobility, housing, energy efficiency and resilience, and economic development. \n3) Accelerate the market to understand, develop and trial business, investment and governance models, essential for the true aggregation and replication (through collaboration) of smart city solutions in cities of different sizes and maturities. In doing this, we intend to accelerate the pace by which we make transformative improvements, and enhance sustainability in communities. \n4) Share and collaborate for society: to respond to increasing demand for participation; to enhance mechanisms for citizens’ engagement; to improve local governments capacity for policy making and service delivery through collaboration and co-design; resulting in outcomes that are better for citizens, businesses and visitors.  These will be delivered by a range of expert partners across 8 work packages.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"691895","fundValue":"28045835,09","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2020-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
