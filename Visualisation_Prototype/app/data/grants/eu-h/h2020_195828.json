{"id":"195828","title":"Large Area Nanoparticle Deposition System","abstractText":"I intend to travel to the University of Oxford and the lab of Dr. Moritz Riede and build a second generation version of the Large Area Nanoparticle Deposition System (LANDS) that I have designed and built during my PhD studies at Stanford\nUniversity in the USA. This will be a flexible, particle-agnostic system that will be capable of depositing uniform films of nano- and micro-particles from solution. It is designed to emphasize scalability, high throughput and large area film uniformity and will be compatible with low-temperature flexible plastic and foil substrates and the devices built on them.\nOnce complete, I will initially use the LANDS to deposit nanostructured thin films of metal nanowires to form transparent conductive electrodes for photovoltaic applications. I will continue to develop and explore the use of such metal nanowire films as replacements for industry standard transparent conductive oxides such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) especially in flexible devices.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"659667","fundValue":"183454,8","fundStart":"2015-08-12","fundEnd":"2017-08-11","dataset":"h2020"}
