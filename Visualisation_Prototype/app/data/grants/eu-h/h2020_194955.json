{"id":"194955","title":"Manipulation of Flow Characteristics Using Laser Energy Deposition","abstractText":"Travelling at high speeds entails overcoming adverse effects, such as regions of high heat transfer and surface pressures, unsteady shock waves, fluid-structure interactions, together with the requirement of drag reduction. One method of flow and flight control is energy addition. It is the objective of the proposed study to utilise this technique for the development of:\n1) mitigation schemes for the avoidance or modification of localised regions of high heat transfer and surface pressure of high-speed vehicles.\n2) methods for controlling local flowfield characteristics and the location of shocks e.g., in engine inlets, and wing-fuselage junctions.\nThe research program combines both branches of research, namely, experimental and numerical. It aims to advance the frontiers of supersonic and hypersonic aerothermodynamics and propulsion and it will firmly establish a UK/European lead in research on laser energy systems for flight and flow control of high-speed vehicles. This programme will be supported by the excellent research environment provided by the host, Prof Kontis, University of Glasgow UK, with state-of-the-art facilities for research development, testing and training. This programme also will benefit from the strong links between the host group and leading UK and international research groups.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"654318","fundValue":"195454,8","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","dataset":"h2020"}
