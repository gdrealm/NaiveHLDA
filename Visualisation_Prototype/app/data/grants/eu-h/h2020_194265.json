{"id":"194265","title":"Towards a flexible software-defined network ecosystem","abstractText":"The focus of the project is to enable added-value services to be provided thanks to SDN, on top of Internet Exchange Points and other network interconnnection fabrics. The services would relate not only to the flexibility of the interconnection fabric, but most importantly to enable the content and data centre ecosystem that is present at the interconnection fabric to collaborate.
