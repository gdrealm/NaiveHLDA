{"id":"200419","title":"Intelligent investment analysis of early-stage companies","abstractText":"The European startup ecosystem is booming. It has attracted more than $3.5bn of venture funding in Q3 2015, the highest in 5 years. A major factor fueling this growth is a higher-resolution venture finance industry, which has opened up the traditional Venture Capital (VC) space to new types of early-stage investors: angels, crowdfunding networks, accelerators and micro-VCs.\n\nThe challenge these early-stage investors face is the lack of commercially available business intelligence tools to support the decision-making process. The high-risk nature of early-stage investing increases the odds of mis-allocating capital and is raising concerns from industry professionals and regulators alike.\n\nCrowd Analytics is a first-of-its-kind large-scale data analytics and visualisation platform that helps investors assess the risk profile and investment-readiness of early-stage companies. The system collects structured and unstructured data from a number of public and private sources, correlates them using proprietary algorithmic analysis, deduces relevant insights and presents them to the user in an intuitive and structured manner.\n\nThis results in reliable, data-driven insights across the complete spectrum of early-stage investment opportunities that will be offered through a subscription service.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"719483","fundValue":"71429","fundStart":"2016-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","dataset":"h2020"}
