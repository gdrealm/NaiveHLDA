{"id":"193845","title":"EWIT: Developing an e-waste implementation toolkit to support the recycling and the secondary raw material recovery strategies in metropolitan areas in Africa","abstractText":"Urbanization is on the rise in Africa and this trend is expected to continue in the future. The fast growing use of technology is creating a rising e-waste stream, for which there is limited recycling capacity. Waste management infrastructures and public awareness of the health issues is largely non-existent. Basic environmental precautions are almost absent and health and safety regulations are loosely enforced. Improvements are therefore urgently needed to combat related health issues, alleviate poverty and develop the local recycling sector.\nEWIT project’s aim is to address these challenges, assisting African municipalities in the implementation of effective e-waste management systems for their communities.\nThe project will develop a comprehensive mapping of the baseline data of African metropolitan areas related to e-waste management, analyzing the most relevant experiences, processes and legal tools available. It will then deliver a dynamic and easy to use information and service portal to offer guidance and practical support for the design and development of e-waste collection and recycling systems.\nEWIT will generate the expected impacts through 5 coordinated work packages. The working model is based on two different set of workshops, one led by “Cities” and the other by “Experts”. Tools, implementation models, policies and procedures will feed a dedicated information and service platform called “E-waste implementation toolkit”. This dynamic and easy to use internet portal will be a strategic source of knowledge for decision makers at industry and local government level. Dissemination will play a key role to assure that the project’s deliverables are well understood and ready to be applied. \nEWIT will define the conditions and actions necessary to implement effective waste recycling systems in metropolitan areas, increasing recycling opportunities for entrepreneurs, generating new jobs and improving environment and health protection of local communities.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"641660","fundValue":"1641750","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","dataset":"h2020"}
