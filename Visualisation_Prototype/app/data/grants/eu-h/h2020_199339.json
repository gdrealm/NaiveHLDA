{"id":"199339","title":"Perovskite Light Emitters","abstractText":"Metal halide perovskites have recently astonished the research community and garnered a mass following to realize extremely high efficiency low cost photovoltaics. This work was largely catalyzed by outputs from the ERC-Stg HYPER, but in addition to solar cell applications, these materials could also be near perfect light emission materials for displays and lighting. This POC grant will formulate a strategy to move the perovskite materials and device research towards commercial exploitation as light sources. Within the project an assessment of the impact perovskite nanocrystals could have in the current lighting market will be undertaken, and a strategy to capitalise upon exiting Oxford IP and how best to develop foreground IP will be formulated. To complement these activities, a demonstrator perovskite light source will be created. From the derived information on IP and business development, a business plan will be delivered which will be taken to the investor community following successful completion of the POC project. This project will therefore enable the transition for perovskite light emitting nanocrystals from University research to a commercial venture.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"693144","fundValue":"149983","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","dataset":"h2020"}
