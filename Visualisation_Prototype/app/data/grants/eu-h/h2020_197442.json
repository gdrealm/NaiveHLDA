{"id":"197442","title":"Creating and enhancing TRUSTworthy, responsible and equitable partnerships in international research","abstractText":"The goal of the TRUST Project is to catalyse a global collaborative effort to improve adherence to high ethical standards around the world.  \n\nAchieving equity in international research is one of the pressing concerns of the 21st century. Many international groups and organisations are working on governance frameworks and standards to guide research activities after progressive globalization. However, their efforts are disparate and lacking a guiding vision. In an interdisciplinary collaboration between multi-level ethics bodies, policy advisors, civil society organisations, funding organisations, industry and academic scholars from a range of disciplines, this project combines long-standing, highly respected efforts to build international governance structures with new exciting network opportunities between Europe, India, Sub-Saharan Africa, China and Russia. \n\nTRUST will open up new horizons in improving adherence to high ethical standards in research globally. The project's strategic output are three sets of tools based on participatory engagement covering all continents: (1) a global code of conduct for funders, (2) a fair research contracting on-line tool and (3) a compliance and ethics follow-up tool, which takes limited resources into account.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"664771","fundValue":"2651258,75","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","dataset":"h2020"}
