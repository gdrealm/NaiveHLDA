{"id":"198195","title":"World class Science and Innovation with Neutrons in Europe 2020 – SINE2020","abstractText":"Today’s society is being transformed by new materials and processes. Analytical techniques underpin their development and neutrons, with their unique properties, play a pivotal role in a multi-disciplinary, knowledge-based approach. Industry and the neutron research community must however work together more closely to enhance their innovation potential.\nNeutrons are only available at large scale facilities (LSF’s), presenting specific challenges for outreach. National and European initiatives have combined to create a user community of almost 10000, mainly academia-based users, which is supported by an ecosystem of about 10, often world-class national facilities and the European facility, the Institute Laue Langevin. Europe leads neutron science and is investing almost 2B€ in the European Spallation Source (ESS), its construction, like Horizon 2020, spanning the period 2014-2020.\nSINE2020, world-class Science and Innovation with Neutrons in Europe in 2020, is therefore a project with two objectives; preparing Europe for the unique opportunities at ESS in 2020 and developing the innovation potential of neutron LSF’s.\nCommon services underpin the European research area for neutrons. New and improved services will be developed in SINE2020, by the LSF’s and partners in 13 countries, in a holistic approach including outreach, samples, instrumentation and software. These services are the key to integrating ESS in the European neutron ecosystem, ensuring scientific success from day one. They are also the basis for facilitating direct use of neutron LSF’s by industry. Particular emphasis is placed on the industry consultancy, which will reach out to industry and develop a business model for direct, industry use of LSF’s in 2020, and data treatment, exploiting a game-changing opportunity at LSF’s to adopt a common software approach in the production of scientific results.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"654000","fundValue":"12080866,25","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2019-09-30","dataset":"h2020"}
