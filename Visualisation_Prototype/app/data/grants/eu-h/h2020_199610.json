{"id":"199610","title":"Multi-instrument analysis of Rosetta data â€“ Establishing a new paradigm for cometary activity","abstractText":"The MiARD project will use a wide range of data sets from the Rosetta mission (including the Philae lander) to refine the 3D topography of specific areas of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to study the activity and changes caused by subliming volatiles as the comet nears the Sun, to make inferences about the nature of the top 10 cm of the surface of the comet, to assess whether the landing site on the comet is representative of the entire comet, and to create an improved outgassing model. The new knowledge will be used to improve models of cometary orbits and dust generation in order to allow better hazard assessment.\nA strong emphasis will be placed upon  public communication activities, making full use of the visual nature of the data products to be produced by the project.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"686709","fundValue":"1688423,75","fundStart":"2016-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-08-31","dataset":"h2020"}
