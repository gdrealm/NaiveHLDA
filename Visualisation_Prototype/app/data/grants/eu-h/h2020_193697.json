{"id":"193697","title":"European Curation of Astromaterials Returned from the Exploration of Space","abstractText":"Sample return missions (SRMs) are a critical next step in our exploration of the Solar System and are identified as strategic missions by international space agencies. Europe has a very strong legacy in the curation and research of precious extraterrestrial materials. To maintain European leadership and ensure high-level involvement in future SRMs, a dedicated European Sample Curation Facility (ESCF) to receive and curate returned samples from the Moon, asteroids and Mars, is of critical importance.\nEuro-CARES will focus on 5 key themes for developing a ESCF:\no Planetary Protection- protocols and methods for future SRMs\no Instrumentation and Analytical Methods- in the fields of cosmo/geochemistry and biosciences\no Facilities and Infrastructures- to curate sensitive extraterrestrial or biological materials\no Analogue Materials- that are most appropriate and can be used in ‘end to end’ SRM planning\no Portable Receiving Technologies- used to move samples whilst retaining  scientific integrity and bio-containment (for Mars samples)\nUsing the 5 key themes Euro-CARES will:\n1) Evaluate and critically assess the state of the art within Europe and internationally to identify critical requirements for the ESCF\n2) Determine and verify European readiness levels to identify where investment is required and opportunities for European leadership in scientific and engineering fields related to curating extraterrestrial samples\n3) Engage with scientific, industrial, governmental and public stakeholders through community workshops, conferences, publications and educational opportunities\n4) Deliver recommendations and roadmaps defining the steps necessary to deliver a ESCF to ensure high-level involvement in future ESA and international SRMs\nEuro-CARES comprises a team of scientists and engineers from across Europe with internationally recognised expertise in astrobiology, biosciences, cosmo/geochemistry, extraterrestrial sample curation, planetary protection and space exploration.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"640190","fundValue":"1999999","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
