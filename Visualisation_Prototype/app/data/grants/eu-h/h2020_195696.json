{"id":"195696","title":"Leggett-Garg test of a vibrating carbon nanotube","abstractText":"Despite the undeniable success of quantum mechanics, the boundary between quantum and classical mechanics remains unclear. Leggett and Garg devised a class of inequalities that provide the script for a quantitative test to determine whether a macroscopic object would indeed be at all times in one of its distinct states or whether quantum mechanics would prevail. I will perform the first Leggett-Garg test on a massive moving object: a carbon nanotube resonator. This ambitious experiment would be a key accomplishment in mapping the persistence of quantum features in systems of increasing macroscopicity.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"658989","fundValue":"183454,8","fundStart":"2016-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","dataset":"h2020"}
