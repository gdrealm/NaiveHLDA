{"id":"194737","title":"Digital Rights Management Infrastructure For 3D Printed Artifacts","abstractText":"The OWNER-CHIP project will enable a Digital Rights Management (DRM) platform to connect brand owners of digitised assets with 3D printing bureaus. OWNER-CHIP will authenticate the manufactured product with a unique, embedded verification technology developed in stage 2 of the project; protecting the brand owners / IP licensors from counterfeiting and enabling added functionality and enriched content via mobile phone and gaming platforms (digital-physical extension).\n\nOWNER-CHIP will initially focus on the $10Bn per annum character merchandising segment; the OWNER-CHIP technology will enable Things3D to revolutionise this market with its disruptive DRM platform.\n\nThings3D is a young innovative company that needs support to be first-to-market with their DRM platform. The EC support will enable development of the missing technology needed to realise their revolutionary concept and turn it in to a robust, innovative solution that places the EU at the heart of the character merchandising industry.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"651604","fundValue":"71429","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"h2020"}
