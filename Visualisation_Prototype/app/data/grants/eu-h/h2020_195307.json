{"id":"195307","title":"Nano-Copper Iodide: A New Material for High Performance P-Type Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells","abstractText":"p-Type dye-sensitized photocathodes (p-DSSCs) are a new type of solar energy device.  They promise to increase the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by enabling tandem cells that absorb light at both electrodes, in similar fashion to multi-junction semiconductor PV.  However, no component of the p-DSSC is fully optimised, and the nickel oxide (NiO) substrates used as the p-type semiconductor appear to be a particular weak point, due to their inefficient charge transport.  In this project, we will develop new copper(I) halide electrodes which transport charge much better, and will potentially form the heart of new, efficient p-DSSCs.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"656658","fundValue":"195454,8","fundStart":"2015-09-03","fundEnd":"2017-09-02","dataset":"h2020"}
