{"id":"193248","title":"Point-of-care microfluidic device for quantification of chemotherapeutic drugs in small body fluid samples by highly selective nanoparticle extraction and liquid crystal detection","abstractText":"The decision-making in chemotherapy nowadays depends on standard methods that are liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) followed by mass spectrometry or capillary electrophoresis; both are labour- and cost-intensive and can be performed only in dedicated hospitals and laboratories. This lead to a minimal therapeutic drug monitoring in patients and hence that 30-60% of drugs are administered without clinical benefits.  \n\nWe propose to develop a point-of-care device for quantification of chemotherapeutic drugs in small body fluid samples by highly selective nanoparticle extraction and liquid crystal detection incorporated in microfluidic lab-on-chip device (optofluidics based) allowing the real-time drug monitoring. This will improve the therapeutic outcome and reduced health care costs.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"633635","fundValue":"5240708,13","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2019-04-30","dataset":"h2020"}
