{"id":"196647","title":"KiWi Power Limited’s Revolutionary, Low Cost, Demand Response Platform (KDRP)","abstractText":"CHALLENGE: Demand response (DR) is central to the successful evolution of a new low carbon electricity system in order to deliver grid flexibility & stability, however it is progressing slowly in the EU due to technological barriers which prevent widespread uptake: high in cost hardware (€4.000 - €6.000); not specifically designed for DR → lack critical functionality (e.g. wireless communication, integration of renewables); & not sufficiently open for wider industry participation.\n\nPROPOSED SOLUTION:  To address the need for innovations that overcome principal barriers to DR, this project seeks to advance KPLs Energy Management Platform, KEMP, from a prototype demonstrated in a relevant environment (TRL6) to complete & qualified commercial prototype (TRL8).  KEMP is a low cost, automated ancillary services platform which consists of: [1] Unique hardware: multi-asset control; first platform to integrate renewable assets; wireless communication between assets → reduced installation cost; & sec. by sec. meter readings – requirement for Frequency Response programmes.  [2] Innovative software: cloud based – for greater scalability; flexibility & remote monitoring,  forecasting model - for integration of renewables; & optimisation engine - to  max. revenues.\n\nEND USERS: [1] Initial target = large scale commercial & industrial (C&I) orgs with high MW capacity (>1MW) e.g. financial, telecoms, hospitals, hotels etc. Asset types: DRUPS systems & HVAC. [2] Secondary target = SMEs with low MW capacity (50kW< capacity < 1MW) incl. Water Pump Stations, Small Data Centres, Retail Stores. Asset types: Variable Speed Motors, HVAC, UPS systems etc.\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES: tech validation, market analysis, economic & business assessment, operational  capacity analysis. Activities will be delivered within a 4 month period, & result in a comprehensive feasibility report detailing the next steps towards development & commercialisation, forming the basis of the SMEI Phase II Business Plan.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"662782","fundValue":"71429","fundStart":"2015-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","dataset":"h2020"}
