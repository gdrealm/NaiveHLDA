{"id":"195093","title":"Hydrophobic Ionic Liquid Technologies","abstractText":"HyLITE (Hydrophobic Ionic Liquid Technologies) aims to enhance established European strength and capability in the research and development of ionic liquid materials by targeting to production of new ionic liquids with specific, tailored, properties that are technologically functional and environmentally acceptable and can be manufactured from sustainable resources. Optimised atom efficient synthesis will produce new hydrophobic ionic liquids that contain only carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen atoms and so have low environmental impact and can be used as non-polluting extraction solvents in liquid/liquid separations springboarding sustainable innovation within industry and academia.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"655334","fundValue":"183454,8","fundStart":"2016-01-18","fundEnd":"2018-01-17","dataset":"h2020"}
