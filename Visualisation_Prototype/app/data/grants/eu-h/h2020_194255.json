{"id":"194255","title":"Scalable and Secure Infrastructures for Cloud Operations","abstractText":"The SSICLOPS project will focus on techniques for the management of federated private cloud infrastructures, in particular cloud networking techniques (within software-defined data centres and across wide-area networks). Key deliverables from the project will include a meta data description language for workloads, resources and policies, a flexible scheduling system using meta data, workload-specific adaptations to TCP/IP stacks, and data center performance analysis tools.\nAddressing topics, such as dynamic configuration, automated provisioning and orchestration of cloud resources the SSICLOPS projects will investigate high-performance, vertically integrated network stacks for intra/inter-cloud communication and efficient, scalable, and secure intra/inter-DC and client-facing transport mechanisms. \nThe project will design, implement, demonstrate, and evaluate three specific use cases, namely a cloud-based in-memory database, the analysis of physics experiment data, and the prototypical extension of network stacks for a telecom provider in the SSICLOPS testbed.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"644866","fundValue":"6937123","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","dataset":"h2020"}
