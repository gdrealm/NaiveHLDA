{"id":"200033","title":"Regional turboprop loads control through active and passive technologies","abstractText":"A number of active and passive Loads Control and Alleviation concepts and technologies will be proposed, developed and evaluated. Aerodynamic design of an innovative spoiler will be undertaken, followed by a detailed aerodynamic characterisation of the spoiler and aileron capability for active loads control alleviation, conducted by means of CFD simulations and Wind Tunnel Tests. Novel passive loads alleviation concepts, such as passively morphing aerofoils using thickness and stiffness tailored skins or memory polymer skins and passively floating flaps, are going to be investigated and evaluated. A structural concept for an aeroelastic winglet for passive loads alleviation in manoeuvres and gusts will be developed.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"686804","fundValue":"499350","fundStart":"2015-12-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","dataset":"h2020"}
