Creative people without prior 3D expertise will get icon-driven tools to experiment and play with 3D. Creativity professionals will be able to add richness and semantic-awareness to 3D models by harnessing human experience and state-of-the-art object detection. Researchers in the humanities will be able to take advantage of the creativity platform, usability and usage outcomes to further their research into co-creativity.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"687757","fundValue":"3744875","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
