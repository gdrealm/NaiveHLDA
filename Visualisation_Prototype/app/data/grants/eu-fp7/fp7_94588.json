{"id":"94588","title":"Next generation atom chips. Planar microwave traps for experiments with cold atoms and ions/electrons","abstractText":"'The scope of this project is the experimental implementation of the next generation atom chip. Atom chips consist of planar microstructures (several �m down to 100 nm), which generate the magnetic/electric fields for confining and cooling of neutral atoms. Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) can be regularly achieved on atom chips. The key feature of the new chips will be trapping of neutral atoms by means of microwaves. These interact with the atomic hyperfine structure and will be locally generated on the chip�s surface using planar transmission-lines, like microstrips, slotlines and coplanar waveguides. Remarkably, the novel microwave traps will enable the simultaneous trapping of neutral atoms and charged particles with a single common technology for all trapped species. The resulting atom-ion chip will become a powerful tool for studying several topics in atomic physics: collisions of ultracold atoms with ions/electrons, charge-transfer reactions, sympathetic cooling of charged particles by cold atoms, hybrid quantum computation schemes with atoms and ions, etc. The project will also focus on the improvement of the precision of some fundamental constants, like atomic masses and electronic g-factors, through the implementation of matter-wave-interferometry tools for charged particles, similar to those demonstrated for neutral atoms on chips.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"250465","fundValue":"45000","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
