{"id":"109333","title":"Global initiative on gene-environment interaction on diabetes/obesity risk","abstractText":"'The overall goal of InterConnect is to establish a global network that will facilitate the co-ordination of population research on the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the aetiology of obesity and diabetes. We aim to establish mechanisms for identification and classification of studies and the data that they hold and create a forum for harmonization of methods as a foundation for optimizing the use of existing data for the study of gene-environment interaction. We aim to establish a funders� forum and a forum for stakeholders and bring these groups together with subject-specific researchers and methodologists to create an appropriately governed framework for sharing existing data, harmonizing the addition of new data and planning new studies.\n\nWith the involvement of strong funders� and stakeholders� fora in InterConnect from the outset, the project will provide a network to link, co-ordinate and eventually integrate EU funded research activities with those in other continents. InterConnect will provide a forum for exchange of information and best practice between projects. This will be relevant both to the research community and also the funders. The engagement of stakeholders and our dissemination programme will ensure that the knowledge that is ultimately gained through collaborative work in this network will be translated into policy, social and economic benefits. Through its work on an ethical and legal framework, InterConnect will create a sustainable framework that will facilitate data sharing that is transparent and dynamic.'","grantUrl":"http://www.interconnect-diabetes.eu/","grantId":"602068","fundValue":"2338607.16","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
