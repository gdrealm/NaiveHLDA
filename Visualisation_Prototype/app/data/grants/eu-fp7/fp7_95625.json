{"id":"95625","title":"New Synthetic Reactions for Antitumor Natural Products","abstractText":"'This project seek to study potential advances in organic synthesis and to apply such advances to the elaboration and study of natural products or natural product congeners of novel biological activity. This project has three main goals of broad relevance. The first is the development of new chemistry, (both in terms of strategy as well as specific reactions) to assist in the synthesis of complex target systems. The second is the application of this chemistry to the synthesis of potentially useful anticancer agents bearing a priviledged and natural-ocurring dipyrrolo[1,2-a:1&amp;apos;,2&amp;apos;-d]pyrazine core. Thus, natural products such as phakellins, phakellstatins, palau&amp;apos;amine, spirotryprostatins and structure related to natural products provide the focus for our synthetic efforts. Finally we hope to evaluate, albeit on a qualitative basis some notions as to the mode of action of these substances. It is anticipated that such studies will help to clarify chemical possibilities which might be of relevance to drug activation. This project provides an excellent framework to the transference of chemical efforts to medicinal research in diseases of global impact, such cancer is nowadays.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253205","fundValue":"250229.8","fundStart":"2010-05-03","fundEnd":"2013-05-02","dataset":"fp7"}
