{"id":"87783","title":"Bio-Inspired Self-assembled Nano-Enabled Surfaces","abstractText":"'Advanced nanofabrication can produce now nano-structures similar in size with single biomolecules or their self-assembled architectures. Capitalising on this strategic opportunity, BISNES focuses on the design, fabrication and implementation of biomimetic nanostructures which complement biomolecular surfaces and modulate the biomolecular activity. The BISNES project will (i) develop software products for the representation and quantification of bimolecular surfaces, especially those that self-assemble in long-range nano-aggregates, interacting with artificial nanostructures; (ii) design and fabricate nanostructured surfaces and objects that complementary replicate biomolecular surfaces; and (iii) design, fabricate and implement novel hybrid bio-devices which exhibit quantum-leap increase in capabilities (e.g., sensitivity, response time, cost) or entirely new ones. The project will deliver demonstrated technical solutions with impact on a wide range of applications and products: ultra-sensitive bio-diagnostics and drug discovery devices; inherently bactericidal surfaces, medical devices for the in vitro study of amyloid and cytoskeleton proteins central to critical disease (e.g., neurodegenerative diseases, cancer); and hybrid nanodevices that exhibit new electromagnetic properties useful for future IT devices. The research consortium has the critical mass of knowledge and experimental capabilities, as well as the right combination of activities (academia and industry, both SMEs and industry end-user), which allows us to follow the complete innovation path from fundamental science to its implementation in demonstration devices.  BISNESï¿½ cross-disciplinary approach of will synergise the European first-class position in nanofabrication and biomolecular engineering, through cross-field applications and will contribute to the consolidation of the high added-value of European biomedical, advanced manufacturing and IT industry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"214538","fundValue":"4632181.08","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
