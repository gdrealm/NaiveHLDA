{"id":"88069","title":"Directed Evolution in Femtolitre Microreactors - Exploring 'Promiscuity Space'","abstractText":"'The �vastness of sequence space�, i.e. the extremely large number of possible permutations in even the smallest catalytic proteins, requires evolutionary shortcuts. In this project the candidate will interconvert members of a promiscuous catalytic superfamily into one anotehr and differentiate a multi-specific enzyme into mono-specific mutants.  Ultimately it is hoped that directed evolution experiments will have implications for the definition of �phylogenetic relationships� for catalysis.  To this end the candidate will set up biochemical assays for hydrolytic reactions in small emulsion droplets (diameter: 2-20 um) and explore whether (i) these assays can be carried out in such in vitro compartemnts , (ii) whether it is possible to measure kinetics in these droplets oand (iii) carry out directed evolutino experiments with a sreening system of unprecedented capacity. In addition to tehse technical aspects, the candidate will also charcterise the mechanism of the wild type enzyme and its mutants.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"221761","fundValue":"177173.03","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
