{"id":"96644","title":"New C-H activation chemistry for complex heterocycle synthesis","abstractText":"'The discovery of new catalytic processes is one of the pre-eminent drivers of current chemical research. The chemistry of tomorrow must be sustainable, using processes that are quicker, cheaper, cleaner and greener, and it must be innovative ï¿½ new molecules are in constant demand to power the advances in medicine, materials and agriculture that structure our society. Catalytic chemistry that activates C-H bonds for synthetic manipulation speaks to both sustainability and innovation, offering near complete superiority over classic stoichiometric processes. This proposal presents new ideas for C-H activation that target heteroaromatic molecules, a fundamental class of compound having vast application in chemistry and biology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252904","fundValue":"173240.8","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
