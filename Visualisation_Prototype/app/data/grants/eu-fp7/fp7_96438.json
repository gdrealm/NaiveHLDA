{"id":"96438","title":"\"European Union, China and Free Trade Agreements in the Asia Pacific\"","abstractText":"'The aim of this project is to provide an overview of developments in free trade agreements (FTAs) in the Asia Pacific, and to focus on how these interplay with the political economy strategies of diverse actors in the area. This will be achieved by compiling a database on FTAs in the region and correlating variables to establish policy trends, and by undertaking comparative studies of the FTA strategies in the area of China, as the key regional economic power, the EU, as the world�s largest market, and New Zealand, as small economy in the region very active in FTAs. Given the small economic gains of many FTAs involving small economies, or a large and a small economy, the project will focus on political reasons for FTAs and clarify the rationale for these, including the possibilities that FTAs may be a less scrutinized and resisted path to extend an elite liberalization agenda in the region; a way to reconcile divergent domestic interests by extending partial liberalization whilst retaining protection of key sectors (especially in the case of larger actors); that these may be utilized as a longer-term strategy to attract the bigger players and secure a more influential position in the future; or that they may result of particular perceptions and beliefs regarding the situation. The implications of this will enhance our understanding of FTAs as political strategic tools. The presence and actions and reactions of the larger players will enable conclusions to be drawn regarding soft and even unintended power, in the sense that players such as the EU and China could be affecting policies in the Asia Pacific region (as well as each others�) even before they actively engage in negotiations and specific strategies with third parties, thus providing a more nuanced view of the power capabilities of the EU and China in this part of the world as well as of the FTA phenomenon. Wider implications of the project include enhancing information on the utility of FTAs, better info'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254239","fundValue":"249950","fundStart":"2011-02-04","fundEnd":"2014-04-03","dataset":"fp7"}
