{"id":"187669","title":"Electronic Structures Sono-Engineering of Semiconductor Nanoparticles for Efficient Solar Energy Exploitation","abstractText":"'This research aims to harness ultrasonication as innovative thermal treatment tool to effectively engineer the electronic structures of colloidal particles. The main objectives of this project are: 1) to develop various interfacial strategies to establish a general and innovative low cost ultrasonication based thermal treatment protocol; 2) to gain novel and effective sono-engineering methodologies for introducing intrinsic/extrinsic defects in seminconductor nanoparticles; and 3) to acquire innovatively enhanced photovoltaic behaviors of from the sono-engineered semiconductor nanostructures.\nThe anticipated thermal treatment will be easy, cheap, easily accessible, and feasible for massive production in comparison with conventional black-body-radiation-based thermal treatment. This will enable one to gain in-depth insight to the physics of acoustic bubbles and especially the energy release during bubble collapse and to effectively transform existing semiconductor particles to be photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical more active for efficient storage and conversion of solar energy and exploitation, thus making a significant step forwards in solar energy exploitation.\nThe proposed project is a multidisciplinary one, and the results of the project can be of great interest for scientists and engineers from diverse areas including colloids and interface science, material science, nanotechnology, condensed matter physics, sonochemistry, electrochemisty and photovoltaics. According to the project objectives, the proposed project contributes to the �Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and new Production Technologies (NMP)�, one of the themes of the 7th European Framework Cooperation Programme. Successfully carrying out of this project will result in significant economic, environmental and strategic impact to energy industry and our sustainable society.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"622091","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
