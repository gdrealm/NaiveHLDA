{"id":"104527","title":"Stellar HYdrodynamics Nucleosynthesis and Evolution","abstractText":"'Stars, massive stars in particular, play a key role through the light they shine, all the chemical elements they produce and the supernova explosions that mark their death. Stars are complex 3D laboratories that relate to many scientific disciplines: nuclear & astro-physics, applied mathematics and computer science. Unfortunately stars cannot be modelled fully in 3D. The best way to model them is to develop synergy between 3D and 1D models to improve 1D stellar evolution models.\n\nThis programme will tackle this multi-disciplinary challenge, which is out of reach of individual research groups. For this purpose, my team, with the help of a network of world leading experts in their respective disciplines, will use an innovating approach using and extending techniques from other disciplines such as Monte Carlo simulations (regularly used in other disciplines of physics) to develop a unique suite of software tools able to: (1) simulate the most complex processes in stars,\n(2) apply these models to stars of all masses and (3) use stars as virtual nuclear physics laboratories.\n\nThis unique software suite will provide a pipeline for the fast production of comprehensive datasets (superseding currently limited ones) that will guide and provide a framework of analysis for large European nuclear physics experiments (FAIR at GSI, D) and astronomical observing facilities (ESO VLT, E-ELT & ESA GAIA) thus enhancing the return on these huge investments. The SHYNE software suite will also boost the innovation cycle of future developments in stellar modelling far beyond the term of this grant and will enable the resolution of many challenging questions and unsolved problems such as: What is the fate of the most massive stars known to date? How frequent are pair-creation and electron-capture supernovae? How much of each chemical element do stars produce? The multi-disciplinary SHYNE programme will thus have a wide ranging impact in science and benefit Europe at many levels.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"306901","fundValue":"1407265","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
