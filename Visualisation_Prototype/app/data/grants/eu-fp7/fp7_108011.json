{"id":"108011","title":"Polymeric ligands for molybdenum and rhenium clusters","abstractText":"'PolyMoRe will establish viable technology for a new class of tailored materials that will address pressing global demands in human healthcare and sustainable industrial development. Both sectors are priority areas in EU policy. Specifically PolyMoRe will bridge the gap currently preventing commercial exploitation of nano-sized metal clusters (MeCs) � unique materials with superb properties (photoluminescence, photoredox activity etc). To fully exploit the terrific potential of MeCs, methods will be developed to incorporate them into organic polymers to create novel materials with a plethora of applications that include bioimaging, cancer treatment, LEDs and solar cells. These materials will provide alternatives to expensive and environmentally harmful materials currently in use. Thus PolyMoRe will contribute significantly to the development of a �knowledge-based� economy that will create wealth and improve well-being in the EU. The knowledge that results from PolyMoRe will promote the EU as a leading centre for both academic and industrial research in healthcare and materials science. Another key objective of PolyMoRe is to provide a unique training for a highly skilled female researcher (returning to science after a short career break to start a family) with extant expertise in synthesis/manipulation of MeCs. PolyMoRe will significantly complement her existing skills in inorganic chemistry by training her in organic/polymer synthesis, modern analytical techniques and biotechnology, where the host institution, associate institutions and the company �Deliverics� have leading expertise. This will leave the Fellow uniquely qualified to pursue a high profile academic/industrial career as PI within the EU thus tackling the shortage of materials developers with genuine interdisciplinary skills. An additional legacy of PolyMoRe will be a new collaboration between the Fellow�s former research group in Russia, world-leaders in metal clusters, and Aston (UK).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327440","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
