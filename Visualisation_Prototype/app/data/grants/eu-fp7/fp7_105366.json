{"id":"105366","title":"Strain Localisation in Magma","abstractText":"'The tendency of geomaterials to localise deformation is a measure of �the fragility of the Earth� � a threshold to the occurrence of geological hazards. At volcanoes, the remarkable, unpredictable and alarming occurrence of eruptions, switching from low-risk effusive to high-risk explosive eruptive behaviour is a direct consequence of strain localisation in magma (SLiM).\n\nA deformation mechanism map of magma subjected to strain localisation will allow numerical models with higher accuracy, which, coupled to an understanding of the mechanics driving the monitored geophysical signals precursor to failure, will enhance eruption forecasts.\n\nWe propose a truly innovative and interdisciplinary approach to a description of SLiM. This collaborative study will pioneer in the integration of efforts from field geologists, experimentalist, mineralogists, petrologists, seismologists, and numerical modellers to underline the effects of microscopic processes responsible for the large-scale impacts of strain localisation in magma during transport and eruption.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"306488","fundValue":"1908000","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
