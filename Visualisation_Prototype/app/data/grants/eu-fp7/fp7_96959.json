{"id":"96959","title":"High Temperature Nanoindentation and Micropillar Compression as Methods for Studying the Deformation Behaviour of Hard Coatings","abstractText":"'The aim of this project is to explore the use of high temperature nanoindentation and micropillar compression as methods for studying the deformation behaviour of hard coatings. The development of methods for material testing at high temperature is particularly important in hard coatings as the drive for dry machining at ever greater rates increases the service temperatures of materials whose flow stresses are both rate and temperature dependent. The fellowship will allow a scientist from one of the world-leading groups in the field of advanced hard coatings based at Montanuniversitï¿½t Leoben, Austria, to cooperate with a group in the University of Cambridge, where both techniques have been used to study the deformation behaviour of brittle materials over a range of temperatures and which was the first to demonstrate the possibility of micropillar compression at elevated temperature.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252520","fundValue":"130430.6","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
