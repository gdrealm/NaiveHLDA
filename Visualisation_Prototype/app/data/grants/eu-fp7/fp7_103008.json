{"id":"103008","title":"Determination of novel molecular cross-signalling mechanisms between bacteria and plants leading to enhanced crop production","abstractText":"'This IIF fellowship will enable Prof. Xiaoguang Liu a highly experienced senior researcher of Chinese nationality at Jiangsu University (China) to provide essential transfer of knowledge whilst undertaking research in the UK which will be paramount to strengthen future collaborative links between the fellow and the host lab. The IIF research project will be carried out in the laboratory of Prof. Miguel C�mara in Nottingham. As a result of a Royal Society/NSFC International Joint Project, Profs Liu and C�mara carried out two brief exchange visits resulting in the realisation of the critical need for transfer of knowledge from Prof Liu to the host institution to guarantee the viability of their long-term collaborative research. Prof Liu will provide state of the art transfer of knowledge to Prof. C�mara�s laboratory on technologies required to study cross-signalling mechanisms between beneficial bacteria and plants leading to biocontrol and crop growth promotion. In return Prof. Liu will acquire advanced knowledge on the study of bacterial signalling networks. This will enable host and fellow to address the current lack of understanding of the impact bacterial signal regulatory networks have on crop yield and defence against diseases through a long-term collaboration. The research will exploit the translational synergies and complementarities between fellow and host institution which will be key for their life-long learning and that of the numerous researchers from the ERA collaborating with the host laboratory and hence leading to the fast transfer of this knowledge into Europe. This IIF project will enable the establishment of a long-term joint research between the Universities of Jiangsu and Nottingham reinforcing the scientific excellence and competitiveness of the ERA in the area of crop sciences with a view to improve agricultural sustainability and adaptation to climate changes.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"297882","fundValue":"278807.4","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
