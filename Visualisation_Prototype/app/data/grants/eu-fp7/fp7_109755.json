{"id":"109755","title":"International Collaboration on Integrated Photonics Technologies for Advanced Bioapplications","abstractText":"'The proposed �iPhoto-Bio� is an international research staff exchange programme - �International collaboration on integrated photonics technologies for advanced bioapplications�. It aims to create a worldwide networking and knowledge transfer between six world-leading universities/institutes from five different countries: the United Kingdom, Spain, Brazil, China and the United States.\n\nThe objective of the proposed programme is to establish long-term stable research cooperation between the partners with complimentary expertise and knowledge. The project objectives and challenges present a balanced mix between industrial application focused knowledge transfer and development and more far-looking studies for potentially ground-breaking applications by exploiting new emerging opportunities with integration of photonic components, micro-nano-bio systems, functional techniques, and innovative materials for advanced biosensing and biomedical applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612267","fundValue":"252000","fundStart":"2014-03-15","fundEnd":"2018-03-14","dataset":"fp7"}
