{"id":"105508","title":"ADVANCED TOOLS FOR EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT AND BIOMONITORING","abstractText":"'A-TEAM is a major co-ordinated supradisciplinary study. It seeks to develop understanding of a variety of aspects related to external and internal exposure to selected chemicals using a single, well-characterised human cohort (the �A-TEAM�). Its overriding hypothesis is that current approaches used to monitor human exposure to consumer chemicals can be substantially improved by filling gaps in scientific data and understanding upon which current practices are founded. A-TEAM�s main research goal is to further understanding of how and to what extent consumer chemicals enter humans, and of how we can best monitor the presence of such chemicals in our indoor environment, diet, and bodies. Our vision is that such enhanced understanding of the underpinning science will lead to more effective approaches to monitoring human exposure to chemicals within Europe, thereby improving assessment of risk associated both with recent and current-use consumer chemicals, as well as those under development, and leading ultimately to more sustainable approaches to the use of chemicals. Our principal objectives are to provide robust scientific information that will allow better understanding of:\n(1) how we can identify at an early stage, chemicals likely to accumulate in Europeans;\n(2) how to monitor chemicals in our external environment in a way that best reflects what accumulates in the body;\n(3) the relative importance of different exposure pathways to overall exposure for selected consumer chemicals of toxicological concern;\n(4) how contact with chemicals in our external environment translates into their presence in our bodies and how best to monitor this presence\nAs well as contributing significantly to scientific knowledge; A-TEAM contributes substantially towards the training and development of the next generation of researchers thereby facilitating future advances in knowledge well beyond the lifetime of the ITN.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"316665","fundValue":"4246566.83","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
