{"id":"104944","title":"An innovative very low-cost thermo-electric technology for large-scale renewable solar energy applications","abstractText":"'The aim of the INNOVTEG project is to create nano-structured thermo-electric materials based on (low cost and abundant) sulphur with carefully controlled structure and properties.\n\nBy doing this our consortium will create a step-change in the application of thermo-electric technologies for large-scale solar renewable applications in the EU by developing thermo-electric at massively reduced cost (�5.20/kg).\n\nThe technologies developed will be particularly suited to building integrated renewable systems.\n\nThis will enable us to create a very low-cost thermo-electric system suitable for building integration that can achieve an output of ~30Wp/sq.m and a power generation cost of �533/kWp (significantly less than the corresponding cost of ~�3,000/kWp for PV systems) across a range of European climatic conditions.\n\nIn so doing, the InnovTEG technology will offer greatly improved environmental performance due to improved reduced dependence on fossil fuels, reduced emissions (CO2, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulates) at a cost that is affordable to the end-user.\n\nIt is expected that the InnovTEG project will generate ~�200m million business growth for its SMEs within a 5 year period creating more than 171 jobs.\n\nThe project results are expected to benefit other SMEs in the renewable energy, materials processing and electronics industry sectors.\n\nIn addition, the technology has the capability to reduce CO2 emissions by 208,000 tonnes of CO2 per year 5-years post-project.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"315019","fundValue":"1732921.4","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
