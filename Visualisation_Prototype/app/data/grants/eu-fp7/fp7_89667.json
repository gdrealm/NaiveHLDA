{"id":"89667","title":"Training in sources, sinks and impacts of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Arctic","abstractText":"The NSINK Initial Stage Network training network targets one of the most vital, interdisciplinary problems facing future Arctic environmental management: namely the enrichment of Arctic terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by reactive atmospheric nitrogen from low latitude emission centres. This problem will greatly exacerbate ecosystem response to climate change, and urgently requires holistic, sources to sinks type studies of nitrogen dynamics. Thus training in atmospheric sciences, snow physics, hydrology, biogeochemistry and aquatic/terrestrial ecology is necessary, bringing UK, Norwegian, Swedish, Austrian and German expertise (already operative in Svalbard) into a single interdisciplinary project at Ny �lesund, the site of Europe�s most significant high Arctic environmental monitoring infrastructure. Further, in order to constrain recent change in the nitrogen accumulation in this environment, training in the interpretation of ice core and lake sediment archives will also be offered, and a reanalysis of instrumental observations collected over the last 15 years will be undertaken. NSINK will therefore prepare talented researchers for careers as independent scientists/practitioners across a range of environmental sciences (e.g. biogeochemistry, atmospheric sciences, hydrology) and related sectors either in academia or in industry. The scale of the NSINK ITN is significant (nine Early Stage Researchers, three Experienced Researchers, four training partners and 9 associated or industrial partners) because it addresses the demand for training in this area resulting from the urgent science problem and a major growth in public interest in the environmental sciences that is being experienced by universities across the entire EU.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"215503","fundValue":"2656767","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
