{"id":"102335","title":"Supramolecular Architectures in Microcapsules through Microdroplet Production","abstractText":"'The objectives of the SMARTuCAPS proposal is to build upon an unexpected outcome from an ASPiRe project and verify that the idea has both market potential and capacity to be moved towards pre-commercialization. SMARTuCAPS are hollow capsules that are assembled from a highly novel supramolecular building block approach that uses a high-throughput manufacturing platform. SMARTuCAPS overcome the limitations of other microencapsulation technologies by combining simple fabrication and quantitative loading of a wide variety of encapsulated materials with a modular building method that yields tailored products with unparalleled functionality. Preliminary research suggests that SMARTuCAPS have an opportunity to add value within markets that include electronic displays, diagnostics, paints and coatings, oil and gas additives, carbonless paper, textiles, food industry, fragrance, pharma & medicine. The commercialization strategy for SMARTuCAPS is to identify suitable markets that are experiencing strong growth to find companies that may be interested in licensing the technology. Market analysis will combine a preliminary brainstorming workshop and technology development with strategy professionals to identify a broad range of potential applications. The SMARTuCAPS will then be subjected to a more rigorous market study using external consultants to make recommendations on the best markets and the way forward to pre-commercialisation. Technical validation and research will then quantify the physical properties required and further develop the technology towards the identified markets. The project will be managed by a team that is suitably qualified to execute the proposed activities and an external steering committee that is highly experienced in proof of concept projects. The work outlined in the SMARTuCAPS proposal will lead from outputs of the ASPiRe project, investigate the potential market opportunity, and strengthen the technology towards achieving pre-commercialization.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"297504","fundValue":"163157.7","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
