{"id":"94802","title":"Novel Organocatalysts for Asymmetric Addition of Me3SiCF3 to Carbonyl Compounds","abstractText":"'Molecules containing fluorine (F) atoms have very important roles in medicinal chemistry. F atoms impart certain properties to the biological activity of a drug, such as making it easier to absorb by the body (bioavailability), and greater potency (metabolic stability). On the other hand, being able to produce specific enantiomers (�mirror images�) of a molecule is also critical, as enantiomers often have very different biological activities. There is a great need to produce optically active molecules containing F atoms, especially for producing drugs and crop protection. One of the most important fluorinated groups is the trifluoromethyl (CF3), which appears in many compounds possessing potent bio- and physicochemical properties, for example efavirenz (antivirotic) and befloxatone (antidepressant). Currently, there are no effective means of achieving enantioselective trifluoromethylation of carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones). In this project, new methods will be developed for the direct asymmetric introduction of CF3 into organic molecules. By designing a brand new class of chiral metal-free phosphorous-containing catalysts to facilitate these reactions, we will provide a way to synthesize optically pure CF3-containing products from carbonyl compounds, in just one step. Successful implementation of the scientific program will enable Dr. Sheshenev to realize his full potential as an independent researcher and reach his ambition to an academic career in the European Union. At the same time, it will also directly benefit the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries, by enabling them straightforward access to non-racemic fluorinated building blocks of considerable interest, from readily available starting materials. This will raise the profile and maintain the competitiveness of European research in the highly topical areas of asymmetric catalysis and organic synthesis.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252247","fundValue":"180603.2","fundStart":"2010-12-06","fundEnd":"2012-12-05","dataset":"fp7"}
