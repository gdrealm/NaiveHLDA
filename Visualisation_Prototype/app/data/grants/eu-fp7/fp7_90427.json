{"id":"90427","title":"European Network on Directed Evolution of Functional Proteins","abstractText":"'This project intends to use directed evolution as tool to reproduce Nature&apos;s remarkable ability to generate molecular machines - in particular enzymes � that perform at levels near perfection. By harnessing the forces of Darwinian evolution in the laboratory we want to (i) screen large and diverse genome libraries for protein with new and useful functions, (ii) optimize existing proteins for applications in medicine, biotechnology and cell biology and (iii) provide a better understanding of how existing enzymes evolved and study enzyme mechanisms in general. The proposed Network brings together leading academic and industrial groups with diverse and complementary skills: the development of a variety of innovative biotechnology tools for the generation and exploitation of large genomic and man-made libraries, expertise in mechanistic enzymology and an unrivalled technology platform including phage display, in vitro compartmentalization, ribosome display, selective protein labelling and high-throughput screening that will be key to achieve the ambitious goals of this project. The project is a continuation of a highly successful framework 5 network. The partnership has now been extended by two successful SMEs at different stages of their development and one of Europe�s premier medium-sized biotech companies that are keen to utilise and market the expected results of this collaborative effort.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"215560","fundValue":"2400000","fundStart":"2008-10-15","fundEnd":"2012-10-14","dataset":"fp7"}
