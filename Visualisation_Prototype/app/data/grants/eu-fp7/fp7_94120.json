{"id":"94120","title":"Transport related Air Pollution and Health impacts ï¿½ Integrated Methodologies for Assessing Particulate Matter","abstractText":"TRANSPHORM brings together leading air quality and health researchers and users to improve the knowledge of transport related airborne particulate matter (PM) and its impact on human health and to develop and implement assessment tools for scales ranging from city to Europe. Over four years, TRANSPHORM will aim to develop and implement an integrated methodology to assess the health impacts of PM air pollution covering the whole chain from emissions to disease burden. The objectives will be: (i) To improve our understanding of transport sources of size-resolved and speciated PM air pollution including non-exhaust, shipping, aviation and railways; (ii) To improved emission factors of ultrafine particle number (PN0.1) and mass fractions of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 for key transport sources; (iii) To conduct targeted measurements in Rotterdam, Helsinki and Thessaloniki for source apportionment, exposure assessment and model evaluation; (iv) To quantify exposure to airborne PM in urban environments resulting from traffic, road, shipping, rail and aviation; (v) To improve and integrate air quality dispersion and exposure models for urban and regional scales including long-range transport; (vi) To develop new concentration-response (CRF) linking long and short-term ambient residential exposure to size-resolved and speciated PM with key health endpoints; (vii) To develop and implement integrated assessment tool to investigate and analyse the whole chain of processes for selected cities and Europe; (viii) To incorporate micro-environmental PM concentrations, time-activity patterns, and estimates of internal dose into the health impact assessment; (ix) To conduct integrated health assessment of selected European cities; (x) To design and implement mitigation and adaptation strategies for European and international policy refinement and development; (xi) To exploit the results of TRANSPHORM through global dissemination and interactions with stakeholders.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"243406","fundValue":"9227610.28","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
