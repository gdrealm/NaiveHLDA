{"id":"107154","title":"Novel low cost catalyst for direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis","abstractText":"'The discovery of the catalytic properties of gold has advanced understanding of the fundamental properties of catalyst materials and has opened new avenues for catalyst design and reaction control.  However, the price of gold is a significant barrier to commercial uptake and implementation.  A discovery arising from the ERC Advanced grant �After the Goldrush� (ERC-2011-AdG-291319) offers the prospect of a new generation of catalyst materials that have all the beneficial features of gold-based catalysts, but utilising much cheaper metals.\n\nThe proposed programme (LOWCOSTPEROXIDE) will bring to pre-commercial stage a selective, efficient and cost-effective catalyst system for the direct synthesis of the valuable commodity chemical, hydrogen peroxide, from hydrogen and oxygen.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"335037","fundValue":"166372.8","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
