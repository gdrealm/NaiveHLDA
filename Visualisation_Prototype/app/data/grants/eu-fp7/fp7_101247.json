{"id":"101247","title":"Nano- Electrospun Filter for Efficient Liberation & Encapsulation of acticides for water treatment in transportation applications","abstractText":"'In recent years, word of aircraft water quality issues has spread, generating negative media coverage, attracting the attention of regulators worldwide, and giving airline passengers a new cause for concern. Health enforcement agencies are currently in the process of drafting new, more stringent quality regulations for aircraft potable water and the world's other regulators will follow suit.\nAircraft potable water is typically loaded from municipal systems which are susceptible to contamination. While municipal water quality has always been a concern in some parts of the world, it is now becoming an issue in North America as well. As recent outbreaks of waterborne disease in carries Canada and the US illustrate, dependence on any municipal water supply carries an inherent risk. Even when the source water is clean, contamination can make its way into a water supply during ground handling because of contaminated water trucks, contaminated hoses, or from improper handling procedures by ramp crew.\nThe aircraft water system itself can be the source of contamination. Microorganisms can grow within the water tanks, water lines, and even the water filters. This situation is exacerbated by the standard, air pressurized water systems that allow water to remain still in the tank and distribution lines until a faucet is opened and the water begins to move. Bacteria thrive in such conditions, which also encourage bacterial regrowth almost immediately after system cleaning.\nThe present project aims to provide an advanced treatment system which will make use of core/sheath polymer nanofibres which are filled with biocidal substances. This will provide a way of maintaining a constant level of biocide in the water without the need to dose or measure the quantities present. In addition the nanofibres will provide a means of physical entrapment for viruses.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"286061","fundValue":"1073477.49","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
