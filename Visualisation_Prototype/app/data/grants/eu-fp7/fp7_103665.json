{"id":"103665","title":"\"Demonstration of a large, high temperature, flexible printed circuit board\"","abstractText":"'This Project aims to support Rolls Royce in the design of a of high temperature flexible PCB and through trials of flexible laminates manufactured from existing and brand new advanced polymers progress the temperature at which a flexible printed circuit can operate from the current state of the art maximum of 200�C into the desired range of 260�C (minimum) up to 400�C (target).\n\nThe Project also aims to develop the materials and manufacturing processes that enable this high temperature performance in a large format, such that the required overall length of 5m can be implemented in a single piece multilayer printed circuit, without joints.\n\nValidation to TRL6 is to be achieved through coupon tests on representative hardware in a bespoke environmental chamber, subjecting the coupons to combined heat and random vibration loading, supported by full size PCBs integrated and tested at engine level.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"296701","fundValue":"596054","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
