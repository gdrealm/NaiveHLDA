{"id":"107112","title":"Euro-Mediterranean Urban Voids Ecology","abstractText":"'The research project focus on the existing voids produced by current shrinking cities at the\nEuro-Mediterranean coastline. These cities, developed in the last 50 years as the main touristic destination of Europe, are now in many cases transformed in empty landscapes stopped by the present economic crisis. The voids of these abandoned territories are not more anomalous interferences within the urban fabric, but unlimited spaces disfiguring the littoral.\nVoids not only understood as the spaces that were not developed, but also as the thousands of square meters of Real Estate speculative developments that remained half-built, converted in future ruins. These terrain vagues, where everything is possible, could be reactivated with new strategies of urban experimentation, interpreted as complex systems of social, environmental, economical, topological, and symbolical relationships.\nThis work intends to develop a comparative research on several Case Studies along the Euro Mediterranean littoral. A Case Study is the cities of the Spanish Mediterranean coastline. Large areas of real estate developments aimed for sun and beach tourism have been abandoned. Many industrial areas built during the Industrial Revolution at the Spanish littoral are now converted in ruined post?industrial voids with heritage values, surrounded by empty Real Estate developments. The recycling of these Post?industrial spaces could contribute as future cultural and economic magnets to the reactivation of these degraded areas into productive and ecological landscapes.\nNew recovering strategies should be found for the post-economic crisis landscape at the Mediterranean coastline, in order to offer new alternatives of development for the local population, in close interaction with the environment. The Landscape and the Ecology Urbanism could offer useful instruments to understand and explore the adequate intervention systems and economic reactivation strategies for these abandoned areas.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"331084","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-03","dataset":"fp7"}
