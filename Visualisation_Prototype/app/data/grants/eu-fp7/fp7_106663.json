{"id":"106663","title":"\"Titanium Aluminide Turbochargers � Improved Fuel Economy, Reduced Emissions\"","abstractText":"'The TiAlCharger project aims to create a cost-effective, mass producible, low inertia titanium aluminide turbocharger assembly providing:\n\n� Weight savings of 60%\n� A reduction on mass moment of inertia of 36% (compared to Nickel super alloys that are the current state of the art)\n� Operation at temperatures >950�C\n� Increased fuel to air ratios thereby improving vehicle efficiency by an additional 5% and reducing  CO2 emissions reduced by 8%.\n\nThe technologies behind this innovation are Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Electron Beam Welding (EBW). The EBM process has the potential to fabricate a turbine wheel from successive layers of powder allowing a hollow, lightweight, low-inertia rotor-wheel to be formed. The TiAl wheel will be joined to the steel shaft using the EBW process, the challenge being to create a weld between dissimilar materials that is robust enough to withstand the vibrations, high temperatures and rotational speeds present in a turbocharger. This fabrication method provides the possibility to manufacture turbocharger wheels from TiAl, which (if of the required quality) retains its strength at high temperatures, expanding the usage of turbochargers to a broad range of engine types.\n\nThe project will enable our SME consortium to:\n\n� Create a new IP protectable product giving us greater security from ever decreasing margins\n� Direct increased sales and revenues worth an estimated �58 million, creating/safeguarding ~176 new jobs p.a, by year 5 post-project (EU market)\n� Supply into a market technology that is expected to expand from 20% of US cars to over 85%, representing the potential to increase European exports by over >�200m by 2020.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"315226","fundValue":"1548216.28","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
