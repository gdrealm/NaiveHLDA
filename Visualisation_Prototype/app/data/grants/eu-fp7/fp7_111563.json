{"id":"111563","title":"Sofc Apu For Auxiliary Road-truck Installations","abstractText":"'SAFARI aims to design, optimise and build 5 100We SOFC stacks, and to integrate then into 2 truck cab power systems comprising both rapid heating planar SOFC from ALM and microtubular SOFC from ADE, together with a battery and appliances found in a modern truck manufactured by IVECO.  Additional components of the system are a gas processor to clean up the molecules from liquefied natural gas (LNG) plus other equipment for Balance of Plant (BoP) and heater/chiller.  All these components will be constituents of a fuel cell unit which will first be tested in the lab and , after further miniaturisation, in a truck platform.  SAFARI is primarily focussed on trucks at HAR who run a fleet of LNG trucks, but the project will also consiser other options including buses and delivery vehicles using LNG.  Trials will be undertaken in the UK especially  to comply with approvals for codes and standards, as well as assessing the economic fleet potential.  LNG was selected as the fuel because it is increasing in importance for trucks across the EU, with lower costs and much lower emissions than diesel trucks. Also, LNG is widely available throughout the EU with long-term supplies guaranteed for the next two centuries.  The SOFC was chosen because it can operate readily on LNG, while providing low emissions, low noise and good heat/chilling available. In addition it is modular with potential for extending truck applications.  The main benefit for the truck maufacturer is reduced emissions fom LNG boil-off.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"325323","fundValue":"2425214.6","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
