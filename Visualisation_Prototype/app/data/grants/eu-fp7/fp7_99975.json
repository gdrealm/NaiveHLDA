{"id":"99975","title":"Hyperbolic random graphs","abstractText":"'The theme of this project is the development of the theory of random geometric graphs on spaces\nof constant negative curvature. These are the hyperbolic random graphs. The aim is twofold.\nFirstly, this theory is a natural next step on the theory of random geometric graphs, which has\nbeen developed during the last 15 years and has mainly focused on geometric graphs on\nEuclidean spaces. The second and perhaps most timely aim is to exploit hyperbolic random\ngraphs as a model for real-world networks. The rapid development of the Internet over\nthe last 15 years and its vast impact on a globalised world has brought the search for a\nmodel of real-world networks into the forefront of Science.  Recent work has shown that hyperbolic\nrandom graphs exhibit properties that are observed in real-world networks. This work is based on\nheuristics and computer-aided simulations.  The main task of this project will be to verify\nrigorously these observations and explore further the role of spaces of negative curvature as\nnatural host spaces, which can accommodate structures that represent social relations and\nhierarchies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"293619","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
