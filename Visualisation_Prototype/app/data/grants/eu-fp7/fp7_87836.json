{"id":"87836","title":"Seamless Communication for Crisis Management","abstractText":"'SECRICOM is proposed as a collaborative research project aiming at development of a reference security platform for EU crisis management operations with two essential ambitions: (A) Solve or mitigate problems of contemporary crisis communication infrastructures (Tetra, GSM, Citizen Band, IP) such as poor interoperability of specialized communication means, vulnerability against tapping and misuse, lack of possibilities to recover from failures, inability to use alternative data carrier and high deployment and operational costs. (B) Add new smart functions to existing services which will make the communication more effective and helpful for users. Smart functions will be provided by distributed IT systems based on an agents� infrastructure. Achieving these two project ambitions will allow creating a pervasive and trusted communication infrastructure fulfilling requirements of crisis management users and ready for immediate application. The SECRICOM solutions are based on four technological pillars: (1) Secure encrypted mobile communication on existing infrastructures (GSM, UMTS networks) � secure push to talk systems. (2) Improved interoperability among various existing communicating systems, creating recoverable networks and seamless connectivity. (3) Introduction of distributed systems and the agent paradigm forming a smart negotiating system for parameterization and independent handling of requests suitable for rapid reaction use. (4) Security based on trusted hardware enhancing the confidentiality of data and the privacy of users. The SECRICOM will assure interface from systems currently deployed for crisis management to systems of new generation which will be defined in next decade such as SDR. Important impact is to enable seamless and secure interoperability of existing hundreds thousands radios already deployed to ensure the protection of invested resources and adaptivity to future development and emerging technologies.'","grantUrl":"http://www.secricom.eu/","grantId":"218123","fundValue":"12424827.51","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
