{"id":"104546","title":"Advanced Microwave Plasma Gasification of pig and cow manure for cost-effective biogas generation","abstractText":"'The livestock sector in Europe is facing a problem: The manure it generates cannot all be used as fertiliser because excessive amounts of manure to land can lead to surface and ground water contamination through the accumulation of minerals in the soil, as manure contains high amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus. The EU has legislated to place severe restrictions on the quantity of organic manure that can be applied to land (170 kg N/ha/year). Farmers are facing increasing costs to export manure off-farms the current level of spreadlands is inadequate to meet the limits. There is an urgent need for the livestock farming community to develop a method of removal and reuse of animal manure such that the economic and legislative burden on them may ease through the development of an environmentally-friendly technology. Current technologies require very high capital investment that is out of reach of most of the farming community. Our project involves the pyrolysis of manure using microwave induced plasma (MIP) technology allowing a rapid release of biogas.'","grantUrl":"http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/BLT/BEST/RFM/PlaGasMic/index.htm","grantId":"315604","fundValue":"1482071.2","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
