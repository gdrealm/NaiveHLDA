{"id":"107844","title":"Re-discovering a Periodic Table of Elementary Circuit Elements","abstractText":"'In DiscoverTable, Wang (the local host) and Chua (the fellow) will further extend their advocated tables to cover not only the �ideal� elements but also non-ideal elements with additional state variables, which will reflect the latest advance in modern information technology (IT) because most of real-world molecular and nano-electronic elements have multiple state variables. The importance of a circuit element table is similar to that of Mendeleev�s Periodic Table of Chemical Elements in Chemistry. Such a table would help us categorise the existing circuit elements and predict new circuit elements.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"332059","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
