{"id":"110276","title":"\"Alpha-helical Barrels: Exploring, Understanding and Exploiting a New Class of Protein Structure\"","abstractText":"'Recently through de novo peptide design, we have discovered and presented a new protein structure.  This is an all-parallel, 6-helix bundle with a continuous central channel of 0.5 ï¿½ 0.6 nm diameter.  We posit that this is one of a broader class of protein structures that we call the alpha-helical barrels.  Here, in three Work Packages, we propose to explore these structures and to develop protein functions within them.  First, through a combination of computer-aided design, peptide synthesis and thorough biophysical characterization, we will examine the extents and limits of the alpha-helical-barrel structures.  Whilst this is curiosity driven research, it also has practical consequences for the studies that will follow; that is, alpha-helical barrels made from increasing numbers of helices have channels or pores that increase in a predictable way.  Second, we will use rational and empirical design approaches to engineer a range of functions within these cavities, including binding capabilities and enzyme-like activities.  Finally, and taking the programme into another ambitious area, we will use the alpha-helical barrels to template other folds that are otherwise difficult to design and engineer, notably beta-barrels that insert into membranes to render ion-channel and sensor functions.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"340764","fundValue":"2467844","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
