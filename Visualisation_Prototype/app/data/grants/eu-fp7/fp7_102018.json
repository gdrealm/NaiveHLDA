{"id":"102018","title":"New Generation of Functional Cellulose Fibre Based Packaging Materials for Sustainability","abstractText":"'The NEWGENPAK ITN is an interdisciplinary research training network of 8 European universities, 3 research institutes and 6 enterprises, three of which are Full partners. Its primary aim is to create a European training network designed to improve the career prospects of its 10 ESRs and 2 ERs in both the public and private sector. The network will deliver a joint multidisciplinary research training programme which will encourage and foster the growth of the researchers� skills in scientific expertise, technological knowledge and professional aptitude. The key vehicle in this strategy is a supervised personal, original research project in a critical aspect of sustainable packaging.\nThe network has been designed to achieve the following objectives (i) to conduct top-level research and training and devise innovative solutions for specific EU needs in the area of sustainable packaging, (ii) to advance the state-of-the-art in wood cellulose based sustainable packaging in three specific areas (a) next generation packaging composites, (b) cellulose-fibre based active packaging and (c) environmental, economic and societal aspects of packaging production, (iii) to educate the next generation of researchers inside a broad European research training network which includes universities, research centres and industry, thereby accelerating the researchers� advancement to team leader status, (iv) to improve the career prospects of ERs and ESRs through complementary training such as; writing and presentation skills; language, effective communication and collaboration; project management and finance; project/product cycles; entrepreneurship; IPR, (v) to create an integrated, long-term sustainable packaging research and training base in the EU by bringing together universities, research institutes and industrial players active in key research disciplines.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"290098","fundValue":"3190329.03","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
