{"id":"104821","title":"Adaptive RF front-end for 4G communication systems and beyond","abstractText":"'ARTISAN programme is founded on the expertise of the two renowned research groups at QUB and Bell Labs. Its primary goal is to train RF technology researchers to PhD level in the area of wireless infrastructure hardware.\n\nARTISAN capitalises on the partner strengths � QUB�s research excellence in the fundamental RF technologies and Bell Labs Ireland�s strong track record in exploiting innovations to create novel RF hardware architectures. This alliance will produce researchers who will give European industry the capabilities to invent and commercialize RF innovations needed for existing and future wireless systems to meet explosive demand in telecommunications.\n\nCentral to the training programme are the four research projects to investigate and implement innovative architectures, circuit designs and technologies for high-performance RF front-ends. These core areas include:\n- multiband power amplifier architectures;\n- adaptive multiband antennas with tailored radiation characteristics;\n- electrically tunable electrochromic materials and substrates;\n- passive intermodulation mitigation in passive and tunable components.\n\nThe resulting flexible, low cost RF hardware solutions will aid the development of the next generation of wireless systems and cater for the efficient re-use of the existing spectrum in small-cell deployments.\n\nQUB and Bell Labs will jointly deliver annual training events including general and specialist courses and workshops relevant to the ESRs� personal development and research. Leading external experts will be invited as visiting researchers to contribute to the research and training activities.\n\nARTISAN is the first research collaboration between Bell Labs and QUB which creates potential for training researchers, technology innovation, future lasting joint research activity and commercial exploitation.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"316426","fundValue":"1174366.71","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
