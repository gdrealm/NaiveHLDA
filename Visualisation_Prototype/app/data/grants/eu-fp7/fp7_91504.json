{"id":"91504","title":"Multi-Gigabit European Research and Education Network and Associated Services (GN3)","abstractText":"The objective of this proposal is the creation of a leading edge network supporting a much enhanced range of both network and added value services targeted at end-users across the Gï¿½ANT service area. A principal goal will be to create a portfolio of seamless multi-domain services. In contrast to its predecessor, GN2, much more emphasis is placed on service development and service introduction.Initiatives are planned in the areas of multi-domain network service operation, where it is planned to organise quick and efficient provisioning of advanced services, develop operational support crossing management domains and security to ensure service integrity and protection of network resources. This will be complemented by the development of end-user services in a federated environment which will focus on the creation of generic 'meta-services', particularly in the context of security as well as further developments in the area of Roaming Services.Individual Tasks within the Joint Research Activities (JRAs) will be of shorter duration and more targeted than in GN2. The initial JRAs will deal with a critical analysis of future networking technologies as well as research into new services both from the point of supporting the development of new services as well as researching into enhancements to the emerging service portfolio (monitoring, mobility and resources management).These will be supported by Networking Activities (NAs) dealing with both internal and external project communications. A particular emphasis of the NAs will be to support and encourage the take up of services among end-users by working closely with NRENs. The need to develop this theme co-operatively with other world regions is recognised by the inclusion of an activity specifically targeted to achieve this.A committee of the NREN proposers (NREN Policy Committee) deals with overall policy and a Project Board (Executive Committee in GN2) oversees its implementation. This will be strengthened by the cr","grantUrl":"http://www.geant.net/pages/home.aspx","grantId":"238875","fundValue":"177677472","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
