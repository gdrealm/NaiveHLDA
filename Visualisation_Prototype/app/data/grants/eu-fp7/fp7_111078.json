{"id":"111078","title":"Complex ideal and non-ideal quantum plasmas","abstractText":"'The proposed research collaboration brings together 3 European and 2 overseas nodes, thus combining expertise from established top researchers in the field of Plasma Physics and Nonlinear Dynamics. We shall focus on Quantum Plasmas, an exotic state of matter, describing many-body systems of interacting charged particles (electrons, ions) occurring as ultra-high density and low-temperature conditions. These systems, though of wide relevance in astrophysics, are also realised in laboratory experiments via ultra-high intensity laser interactions with matter. A comprehensive investigation of the dynamics of linear and nonlinear excitations occurring in Quantum Plasmas is proposed. Ideal quantum plasmas will be studied by part of the proposed consortium within dedicated work programmes, while non-ideal ultra-dense plasmas will be investigated by the other work programmes. Our aim is to elucidate the conditions for the existence of electrostatic and electromagnetic waves of various forms in quantum plasmas, and to study their propagation dynamics and stability profile. Coherent structures are nowadays observed in laser-plasma experiments in the ultra-high intensity, high-density and lowtemperature\nquantum regime in the forms of pulses, shocks, laser cavitons, electric potential double layers, and phase-space holes, among others. The interpretation of such structures is still at an early stage, despite the tremendous potential impact of quantum plasmas in future industrial and technological applications. Our research should foster future developments in this promising field.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612506","fundValue":"84000","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
