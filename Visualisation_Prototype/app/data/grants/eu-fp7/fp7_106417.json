{"id":"106417","title":"Integrated biomolecular methods to control mosquito-borne diseases","abstractText":"'Mosquitoes transmit some of the world's most serious diseases. The most important disease vectors are members of the subfamilies Anophelinae and Culicinae. Anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria, filarial parasites , and a few arboviruses. There are 30 genera in the Culicidae subfamily, but the medically important mosquitoes are Culex, Aedes, Mansonia, and Annigeres (Culex would be important in Europe for West Nile Disease and Avian malaria), while (Aedes would be more important in Tropical countries). Over the last 45 years, the use of chemical pesticides such as dichlorodiphe-nyltrichloroethane (DDT), gammaxane, malathion, and chlordane has been the method of choice for mosquito control, and the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and the affordable pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine combination have proved successful in lowering morbidity and mortality. In addition, the emergence of pesticide and drug resistant mosquitoes, coupled with a clearer appreciation of the long-term detrimental effects of powerful chemicals to non pest insects and concern about accumulation of pesticides in the food chain and environment, has high lighted the need to quickly develop an alternative. A promising alternative is biological control. So, this project would focus on non-chemical methods of control mosquitoes'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"299374","fundValue":"278807.4","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
