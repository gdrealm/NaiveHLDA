{"id":"103248","title":"Bridging the gap in nanoparticle-based enzyme biosensing","abstractText":"'There is growing commercial interest in bio-responsive materials because of their many applications, such as in medical\ndiagnostics at the point of care and in drug discovery and development. Our developed assay technologies manipulate\nthe properties of gold nanoparticles and enzyme-based reactions to detect enzyme activity. Most diagnostics target either\nexpressed antigens (immunodiagnostics) or DNA (molecular diagnostics).\nOur bio-responsive nanoparticle technology can offer a sensitive, specific and affordable platform for the development of rapid\npoint-of-care tests based on simple colour readouts. Additionally one of the great advantages of our technology is the fact\nthat, in addition to diagnosing disease, it can also potentially help in the search for new drugs to treat those diseases. In\ncontrast to methods that simply measure enzyme concentration, our method actually measures enzyme activity. In this ERC\nPOC our expected outcomes include a number of important commercial milestones and technical developments to expand\nthe platform to other diseases and test its application in high throughput drug screening. This value\nwill carry through in both licensing and spin-out, since these issues are fundamental to any business venture. Furthermore,\nwe propose a balanced plan that includes technical research combined with commercial investigations and identification\nof appropriate industrial partners. At the conclusion of this work, we will be in a much stronger position to immediately\ncommercialise this technology, bringing its benefits to the broader healthcare market.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"309518","fundValue":"165889.34","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
