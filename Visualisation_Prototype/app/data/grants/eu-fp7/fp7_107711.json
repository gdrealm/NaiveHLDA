{"id":"107711","title":"Compressive Sensing Frequency Diverse Array With Applications to Two-Dimensional Localization of Targets","abstractText":"'Frequency diverse array (FDA) is a new beam scanning idea that would enable range-angle-dependent beamforming. Different from conventional phased arrays, the FDA employs a small frequency offset compared to the carrier frequency across the array elements. The use of frequency offset generates a beampattern that is a function of range, time and angle. This provides a potential to suppress range-dependent clutter or interferences and two-dimensional (range and angle) localization of targets. However, the range and angle of targets cannot be directly estimated from the FDA beamforming output due to the inherent ambiguity. In this project, we aim to develop a practical compressive sensing (CS) FDA scheme for range-angle estimation of targets. The focus is placed on the CSFDA signal processing. CS theory addresses the accurate recovery of unknown sparse signals from underdetermined linear measurements and has found a wide range of applications. Our key idea is to design new FDAs based on the CS technique and develop practical algorithms to estimate the range-angle of targets. This project will deal with mathematical derivation, signal processing algorithm design, performance analysis, and numerical simulation of new FDAs based on the CS technique. The outcomes of this project would vastly improve the quality and efficiency of existing array signal processing systems, and contribute to the affirmation of Europe as the foremost leader in information and array signal processing technologies. The resulting scheme may also provide two-dimensional localization of targets, which is not accessible for conventional phased arrays.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"326672","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-01-27","fundEnd":"2016-01-26","dataset":"fp7"}
