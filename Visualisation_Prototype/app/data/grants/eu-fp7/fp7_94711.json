{"id":"94711","title":"\"Neighboring and the Geopolitics of Ethnically \"\"Mixed Cities\"\"\"","abstractText":"'This proposal is an extension of my intellectual development and research experience towards my attempt to establish an interdisciplinary centre for the study of urban politics. My previous work was widely acknowledged and explored in Israel and the US, but so far it has had no visibility in the EU due to lack of resources. Academically, this research proposal aims to fill the empirical and theoretical lacunae in the existing body of knowledge that deal with contested cities in Europe and elsewhere by offering a new interdisciplinary perspective about how people and communities use, appropriate, and claim the everyday space of their neighbourhoods while advocating their own values and rights. Beyond the empirical input of this research, its intention is to contribute to the existing knowledge in urban studies and to the formulation of a theoretical basis concerning the relevance of geopolitics to the study of cities. Additionally, this project intends to add to the growing literature on cities such as Belfast, Berlin, and Brussels by contextualizing the very specific�and perhaps exceptional�case of Israel within the existing experience, academic knowledge, and research on other cities.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252369","fundValue":"174903.2","fundStart":"2010-07-12","fundEnd":"2012-07-11","dataset":"fp7"}
