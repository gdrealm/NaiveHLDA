{"id":"189980","title":"SUPREME","abstractText":"This project is about observing the amount of fungal spores in the atmosphere from harvesting. This will be done by further developing an unmanned airborne vehicle (drone) to sample airborne spores and use this in field studies. These data will be combined with existing data to explain fungal spore emissions from harvesting by developing a mechanistic mathematical model. Afterwards the mechanistic model will be implemented in an existing atmospheric transport model in order to explain the atmospheric transport of these fungal spores in the landscape as well as beyond the landscape.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"630745","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2018-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
