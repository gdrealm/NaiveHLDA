{"id":"88301","title":"Monolithic Adsorbent Columns for Extracorporeal Medical Devices and Bioseparations","abstractText":"'The aim of the project is to manufacture novel composite 3D monolithic adsorbent columns for use in extracorporeal medical devices for blood purification (haemoperfusion), therapeutic apheresis and cytapheresis and in bioseparations for analytical and commercial applications.  It brings together a multidisciplinary consortium of specialists in different areas of synthetic, polymer and surface chemistry, biomedical and biological sciences, engineers and bioengineers, immunologists and medics united by the aim of developing new and efficient means of treatment of patients with currently incurable diseases. It is comprised of 3 SMEs, 3 universities and a medical hospital from 4 EU countries. The main objectives of the project are: to synthesise a range of novel monolithic polymer cryogels ; iito synthesise polymer monoliths (non-functionalised and functionalised with bioligands) with embedded porous cellulose or activated carbon microparticles; to design monolithic adsorption columns for  extracorporeal blood purification from molecular solutes and target cells; to evaluate in vitro their biocompatibility and assess mechanical, physical and physicochemical parameters of the monolithic adsorption columns in an extracorporeal circulation; to test columns for their efficiency and selectivity of cytapheresis and adsorption of biological macromolecules in model systems, and with dialysate, ultrafiltrate and whole blood; and to explore a range of future applications for this technology in critical care medicine'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"218242","fundValue":"2060881","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
