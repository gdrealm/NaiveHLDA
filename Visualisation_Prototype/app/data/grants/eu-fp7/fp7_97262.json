{"id":"97262","title":"COST-EFFECTIVE HAND-HELD DEVICE FOR RAPID IN-FIELD DETECTION OF FLAVENSCENCE DOREE PHYTOPLASMA IN GRAPEVINES","abstractText":"'VITISENS proposes the development of an innovative hand-held device that integrates the three steps for accurate detection of nucleic acids (extraction, amplification and detection) in a single platform with a cost below �1000  �10/test. This in-field tool will allow non-technical staff to easily detect the Flavescence dor�e, the most destructive phytoplasma disease of grapevines. The incidence of this disease is epidemic and rising rapidly in many European countries, straining grape and wine producers already struggling to maintain global competitiveness.\nCurrently available laboratory techniques for detecting the disease are expensive, time-consuming and require trained personnel as well as expensive equipment in centralized laboratories, and in many cases carry the risk of sample contamination. Overcoming portability, heterogeneity, risk of contamination and ease of use limitations rely on the ideal integrated design of the platform within a closed disposable cartridge while overcoming the expense of current methods relies on the amplification step, done under isothermal conditions by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as well as on the development of a low cost robust fluorescence reader.\nThe technology will directly benefit European winegrowers by limiting disease spread and reducing the number of vines destroyed. Wine quality and crop yield will increase, while production costs related to the systemic use of pesticides and the production of healthy vines will be reduced. Other benefits extend to vine nurseries being able to issue quality certificates of planting material, and to authorities when monitoring disease occurrence.\nManufacturer SMEs will benefit from accessing new markets with new portfolio products, generating new income sources and from the innovative character of the system, which can be further applied for detecting other pathogens.'","grantUrl":"http://www.vitisens.eu/","grantId":"262032","fundValue":"1445333.49","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
