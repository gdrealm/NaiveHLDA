{"id":"89659","title":"Process intensification methodolgies for liquid-liquid systems in structured equipment","abstractText":"'This project has the objective to develop and validate a design methodology & criteria for dealing with two-phase liquid/liquid-reactions leading to a new generation of flexible and high-performance process equipment (micro through to meso structured) for continuous manufacturing.  This generic approach will be developed by the project members and will involve practical, theoretical and modelling aspects. The devices developed will be applied to 2 different industrial systems to show the wide applicability to the chemical industry: the mononitration of benzene and the cyclization of b�ionone. Micro and meso-scale reactors will be operated at scales relevant to commercial production to demonstrate improved selectivity, yield and specific performance. A state-of-the-art experimental research facility will be designed and constructed; this will be modular, flexible and expandable to ensure flexibility of process and operation. Having developed an improved fundamental understanding of these multiphase processes and the design and operation of appropriate micro/mesostructured environments, the partners will codify this learning, in the form of a �toolkit�, to identify the most suitable continuous processing methods for any liquid/liquid system. This will allow operators to improve the sustainability of chemicals production by selecting intensified process methods that are both eco-efficient and offer increased safety. The partners are drawn from six countries and include a knowledge transfer company, two SMEs, two manufacturers of equipment and three potential end-users thereof. Manufacturers of two complimentary continuous processing systems (micro and meso-scale) will combine forces with three end-users (two of whom in fact are engaged on pre-competitive research. The project,will develop an e-learning course and a practical demonstration on a educational micro system to train process technologists in the toolkit of methodologies developed during the project.'","grantUrl":"http://www.fp7pills.eu","grantId":"214599","fundValue":"5622342","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
