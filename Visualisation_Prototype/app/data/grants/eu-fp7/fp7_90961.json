{"id":"90961","title":"Collaborative European effort to Develop Diabetes Diagnostics","abstractText":"'CEED3 (Collaborative European Effort to Develop Diabetes Diagnostics) has as its central objective, the development of diagnostic tools to differentiate specific subgroups of diabetic patients to allow individualisation of patient care. CEED3 will achieve this by integrating basic science findings from animal models, cell studies, and large scale genetic studies with clinical observations and testing of patientsï¿½ phenotype. The development of diabetes diagnostic tools will involve a clearly defined process of discovery of potential novel genetic and non-genetic biomarkers, validation within test and population based data samples, development of a clinical application and then dissemination of this application. The areas of focus for the diabetes diagnostics will be three areas where there is potential for considerable improvement in care and reduction in the burden of diabetes: the identification of patients with specific subgroups of monogenic diabetes, the identification of non diabetic and diabetic subjects with initial pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction at high risk of rapidly deteriorating glycaemia and the detection of diabetic patients at increased risk of vascular complications. For each of these patient groups the identification of the subgroups will result in improved clinical care by allowing treatment to be tailored for the individual patient. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to make a rapid translation from scientific discoveries to improved care for diabetic patients. CEED3 has assembled the best researchers, clinical samples and technical expertise in Europe to realise this goal.'","grantUrl":"http://www.ceed3.org/","grantId":"223211","fundValue":"3830004","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
