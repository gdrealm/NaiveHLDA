{"id":"97626","title":"Novel Wave Phenomena in Magnetic Nanostructures","abstractText":"'The creation of artificial super-structure in magnetic materials represents an excellent opportunity to modify their spectra of excitations and hence to design novel so called meta-materials with unforeseen properties, functionalities, and applications. Photonic, plasmonic, and phononic crystals and semiconductor superlattices are typical examples of exploitation of this concept for controlling light, acoustic wave and electron propagation and scattering in electronic and opto-electronic devices. However, the use of magnetic materials with periodically modulated properties offers two obvious additional benefits. Firstly, they facilitate creation of magnetic field controlled non-volatile electromagnetic devices. Secondly, they facilitate exploitation of the intrinsic excitations of magnetic materials ï¿½ spin waves (magnons). Hence, significant international research efforts are now devoted to the areas of magneto-photonics and magnonics, respectively. The proposed academic exchange aims to establish and support multilateral transfer of knowledge and expertise among several European and international research teams striving to advance the aforementioned research fields.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247556","fundValue":"333000","fundStart":"2010-05-03","fundEnd":"2014-05-02","dataset":"fp7"}
