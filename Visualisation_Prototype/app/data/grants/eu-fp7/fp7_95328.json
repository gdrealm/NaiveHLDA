{"id":"95328","title":"Rydberg Interactions at Nanostructured Surfaces","abstractText":"'The applicant will move from France to the UK to carry out novel experimental studies of the interaction and ionization of laser-excited Rydberg atoms and molecules at a nanostructured metallic surface under UHV conditions. Of primary interest is to understand how the charge transfer process occurring is dependent on the spectroscopically selected quantum states of the Rydberg species, the electronic and geometrical structure of the surface, and on the relative sizes of the nanoparticles and the Rydberg orbital. The experimental work will be backed up with theoretical wavepacket calculations of the Rydberg electron dynamics. The Fellow will transfer his expertise and experience built up in atom-chip, ultracold atom and molecule experiments in Physics laboratories in France and China to the Oxford host research group and its collaborators, while gaining new experience and knowledge of surface science, molecular laser spectroscopy techniques and theory in the Chemistry department at Oxford. The objective is to prepare him for interdisciplinary experimentation in the future, and for an academic career. He will be enrolled on the Preparation for Academic Practice course at Oxford in support of his objective to obtain an academic career.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253532","fundValue":"179603.2","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
