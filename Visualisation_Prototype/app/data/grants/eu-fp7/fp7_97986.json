{"id":"97986","title":"Acoustic Design Of High-lift Architectures","abstractText":"'Regulation of the sound production of aircraft is becoming stricter, in part due to an increase in the noise generated due to the rising numbers and size of aircraft. As a result identification and reduction of the major sources of sound, particularly in the take-off and landing phases when the aircraft is close to population centres, is paramount. High lift devices, particularly during the landing phase, are a major source of airframe noise. As a result there is a requirement for a tool to allow the acoustic properties of a high-lift configuration to be determined buring the design process. The purpose of this proposal is the development of such a tool.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255783","fundValue":"200001","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
