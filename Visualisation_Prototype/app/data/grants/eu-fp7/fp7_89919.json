{"id":"89919","title":"THE REACTIVITY AND TOXICITY OF ENGINEERED NANOPARTICLES:  RISKS TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH","abstractText":"'NanoReTox will identify the potential risks to the environment and human health posed by free engineered (i.e. manmade) nanomaterial by comprehensively addressing five key questions:  (1) How does the environment into which nanoparticles are released affect their physicochemical properties and their bioreactivity? (2) How does this impact on their ability to interact with and/or penetrate mammalian and aquatic cells and organisms (bioavailability) and will bioavailability result in toxicity?  (3) Is there a pattern of cellular reactivity and/or toxicity related to physicochemical properties, i.e. a hierarchy of activity?  (4) What combination of conditions discovered in (1-3) above are most likely to pose a risk to human health and the environment? (5) How can this information be incorporated in a risk assessment model?   We have assembled a team of experts from across the EU and the US whose combined expertise can address these questions in depth, and therefore comprehensively cover the scope of research topic NMP-2007-1.3-2 ï¿½ Risk assessment of engineered nanoparticles on health and the environment.'","grantUrl":"http://www.nanoretox.eu","grantId":"214478","fundValue":"5186154","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
