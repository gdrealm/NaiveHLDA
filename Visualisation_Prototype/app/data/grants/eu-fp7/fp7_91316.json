{"id":"91316","title":"One Planet Economy Network: Europe","abstractText":"'The goal of the One Planet Economy Network Europe project (OPEN: EU) is to help transform the EU economy to a One Planet Economy by 2050. As the world�s largest economy, Europe must embark upon an immediate and major transformation to avert dangerous climate change and prevent ecosystem collapse. Currently, the impact of the European economy is nearly three times larger than what is required for a sustainable world. A shift to a more sustainable future for Europe must be achieved by building an economy that respects all environmental limits and is socially and financially sustainable.   CSOs are well placed to help catalyse this transformation through bringing insights, concerns and issues into the public debate and making them communicable, relevant and timely. The achievement of a One Planet Economy will require a range of actors to come together to deliver this transformation. In this context the �convening power� of major CSOs is a significant asset.  Through a project consortium of CSOs and RTD performers, OPEN: EU will:  1. Build the evidence base and enhance sustainable development indicators by developing an academically robust and policy relevant �footprint family� (Ecological, Carbon and Water footprints);  2. Build the application by developing a new scenario modelling tool for evidence-based policy, increasing the policy relevance of sustainable development indicators and helping CSOs to illustrate the links between economic growth and environmental degradation to policy makers and the public;  3. Build capacity through a new One Planet Economy Network � an online network of decision-makers, CSOs and businesses leaders. This will provide a forum for the visions, knowledge and interests of different stakeholders and facilitate dialogue and debate on solutions to achieve a One Planet Economy. The network will enable a targeted dissemination of communication materials, workshop programme and website to CSO�s, policy makers and other key audiences.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"227065","fundValue":"1522744.4","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
