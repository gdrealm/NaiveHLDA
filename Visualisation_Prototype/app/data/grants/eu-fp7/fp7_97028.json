{"id":"97028","title":"Controlling terahertz radiation using layered superconductors","abstractText":"'Terahertz (THz) science and technology have received growing interest in recent years due to its many important applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine, including THz imaging and spectroscopy, medical diagnostics, environmental control, as well as chemical and biological identification. Therefore, the main objective of the project is devoted to theoretical investigations of the emission and propagation of THz radiation in layered superconductors. Although several optical and semiconducting THz devices were proposed, the THz gap is still hardly reachable by either electronic or optical devices. The main problem for the application of these devices in miniaturized electrons is their rather large and complex assembly and difficult tenability.\n\nSuperconducting devices employing Josephson effect is considered as the unique opportunity for a single chip multifunctional THz devices, which can be conveniently manipulated by varying an in-plane magnetic field and/or an out-of plane electric current. Recently, the first high-temperature superconducting emitter has been experimentally implemented (Science. 318, 1291 (2007)) and output THz power was relatively strong. In this project we intend to focus on basic and advanced mechanisms that are potentially useful for controlling THz radiation in either artificial superconducting/non-superconducting multi-layers or high-temperature layered superconductors (natural multilayers). This project within the Work Program will give a great opportunity for the young scientists to collaborate and bring significant input to THz science and technology in EU.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253057","fundValue":"179603.2","fundStart":"2011-11-20","fundEnd":"2015-02-07","dataset":"fp7"}
