{"id":"90898","title":"Wealth and poverty in Shakespeare and Dickens","abstractText":"'The research aims to analyse the representation of money and poverty in England in the period of the first and second Poor Laws. It will focus on two specific moments in the history of the representation of money and poverty and the policies relative to the latter: the literary representation of wealth and poverty in 16th �17th century and 19th century England in the work of William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens and the corresponding policies regarding poverty (the first and second Poor Laws). The research objective is to explore the relation between the representation of money and the concept of poverty in these two crucial moments for the legislation on poverty, in order to extrapolate a theoretical model for the analysis of the relation between the representation of poverty and knowledge production. This project will allow the researcher to consolidate and expand her area of expertise. In previous work the researcher has focused on 13th century French-Italian, 17th century Holland and 19th and 20th century German philosophical production regarding the concept of money and the concept of poverty in relation to knowledge. In this project the researcher will analyse 16th�17th century and 19th century England, with a focus on the literary representation of money and poverty and the governmental techniques of management of poverty issues. This research will contribute to the formation of a complete framework for the conceptualisation of money and poverty in Europe from the Middle Ages to the present day, a framework which she will use to address the critical issue of the representation of wealth and poverty in current debates in European Philosophy, thus strengthening her position in the European scientific community. A dissemination strategy has been devised to ensure that findings will lead to new publications, new resources for research, team work and for the production of thought.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219460","fundValue":"161225.98","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
