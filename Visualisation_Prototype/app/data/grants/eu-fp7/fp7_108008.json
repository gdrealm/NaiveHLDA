{"id":"108008","title":"Hybrid polymer-peptide hydrogels for Cell Therapy","abstractText":"'This project, entitled �Hybrid polymer-peptide hydrogels for Cell Therapy� (HYCELT) will produce cost-effective neuronal stem cell (NSC) scaffolds for central nervous system regeneration using a fibrous gel that has all the necessary requisites for fast clinical translation: cell-instructive, biocompatible, injectable and biodegradable. Finding a perfect methodology to heal spinal cord damage is a challenge of current times. Peptides are used for this purpose because they are biocompatible, biodegradable and will produce suitable gelatinous environments for cell growth at extremely low concentrations. The target of HYCELT is to demonstrate this technology in vitro, with follow-on work focussed on in vivo studies in appropriate animal models and in collaboration with clinical scientists to produce a global therapy that will change the lives of thousands of people suffering from irreparable spinal cord injury. HYCELT brings together a talented young fellow with a background in polymer hydrogels with an internationally blossoming group in polymer nanotechnology and well-established UK groups in peptide/materials science and biomaterials. HYCELTs multidisciplinary solution will exploit polymer-peptide hydrogel system also be applied in the vast field of drug delivery. Moreover as it will be developed in concert with Merck Serono (Italy), the biotechnology world-leaders in the field of therapeutics, it will be immediately applicable to living system. The supervisory team has been selected from experts at Aston, Sheffield and Merck (Rome) to provide a multidisciplinary training programme for the fellow and to ensure success of the ambitious research targets of HYCELT.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"326835","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
