The use of rotaxane and catenane cavities as binding domains for the recognition and sensing of guest species because it remains underdeveloped which is surprising given their unique three-dimensional topological interlocked cavity design. In addition the host-guest binding and the molecular machine like behaviour of such mechanically bonded molecules will be studied.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235536","fundValue":"181350.76","fundStart":"2009-09-14","fundEnd":"2011-09-13","dataset":"fp7"}
