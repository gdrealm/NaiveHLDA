{"id":"85264","title":"intelligent 3D content extraction and manipulation for film and games","abstractText":"i3Dpost will improve quality and reduce the cost of high-level media production by applying intelligent technologies to the extraction of structured 3D content models from video. This will enable the increasingly automatic manipulation and re-use of characters, with changes of viewpoint and lighting. The research will advance the state of the art in 3D video production, 3D motion estimation, post-production tools and media semantics. The result will be film quality 3D content in a structured form, with semantic tagging, which can be manipulated in a graphic production pipeline and used across different media platforms.nIntegration of multiple view 3D video analysis with on-set production will allow the creation of video quality actor and set models. Postproduction tools will be extended to robustly separate and manipulate scene elements. On-set capture of actor performance will be instrumented in a structured form for processing and rendering in a conventional graphics production pipeline whilst maintaining the visual quality of faces, body, and clothing movement. The representation of performance will enable the modification in postproduction of camera view, movement, and lighting to render novel content.nStructured representation will facilitate the retargeting of actor performance to different platforms for production of highly realistic characters in games enabling a new generation of interactive entertainment. Multiple view 3D video analysis will result in  extensions to the OFX plug-in standard. Users will be media industry professionals in film and TV production and postproduction, games development, and advertising.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"211471","fundValue":"4253229","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
