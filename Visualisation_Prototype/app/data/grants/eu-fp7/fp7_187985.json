{"id":"187985","title":"\"Oocyte activation and human infertility: Identification and characterisation of a critical oocyte-borne receptor, and effects of laboratory procedures upon key proteins involved in oocyte activation\"","abstractText":"'Mammalian sperm activate the oocyte at fertilisation by triggering a calcium-mediated pathway via PLC?, a sperm-specific phospholipase. PLC? deficiency is linked to human infertility, a condition that affects 1 in 7 couples. While intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can rescue many types of male infertility, 1 ï¿½ 5% of cases fail due to PLC?-deficiency. While artificial activating agents are available, such chemicals do not initiate activation in an endogenous manner. Recombinant PLC? thus represents a safer therapeutic option. However, we do not yet know how PLC? interacts with oocyte-based factors in order to regulate functionality. Current opinion is that an unidentified protein resides within the ooplasm upon vesicles containing the substrate for PLC?. Identifying this factor, and optimising the manner in which oocyte activation deficiency (OAD) can be diagnosed and treated, is a key clinical remit. Of equal concern is that the host laboratory showed that clinical treatments, such as cryopreservation, can cause detrimental effect upon PLC? in human sperm. Consequently, this proposal has two objectives: 1) identify the oocyte-factor that interacts with PLC? via the use of protein-protein interaction technologies, and 2) evaluate the impact of clinical procedures upon gamete proteins that play a critical role during activation. Research will involve human gametes sourced from the Oxford Fertility Unit, along with murine and bovine animal models. The proposal is targeted to (a) improve our understanding of PLC? function, (b) establish whether the oocyte-interacting protein represents a novel diagnostic marker for OAD, and (c) develop our understanding of how clinical procedures can influence proteins in human gametes. While the proposal is primarily targeted to human reproductive medicine, results will be equally applicable to animals of economic interest, such as the controlled breeding programmes used for equine and bovine species.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"626061","fundValue":"299558.4","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
