{"id":"90702","title":"Natural Interaction with Projected User Interfaces","abstractText":"'The overall aim of NIPUI is the development of ways of interacting more naturally with computers, using projected user interfaces.  Building on the proposed fellow's research expertise in augmented reality, the project will develop interfaces based on virtual information projected on real objects (such as sheets of paper), and interaction modalities based on projected virtual characters.  The project has three principal objectives:  Development of a projected user interface to enable cooperative working and linking to content in the context of multiparty meetings. The host group has a large research effort in the automatic interpretation and extraction of information from multiparty meetings.  In NIPUI, we shall combine the fellow's expertise in augmented reality and projected interfaces, with the host's expertise in speech recognition and content extraction.   Development of controllable projection units for the projection of virtual documents onto real paper - handheld, as well as on the tabletop.   Projecting virtual documents onto real paper could be a useful alternative to projecting them onto the tabletop. As people subconsciously pick up a piece of paper to have a closer look if they think the content is interesting, this feature could make interaction more intuitive and at the same time provide valuable feedback to the system.    Enhancement of projected user interfaces to involve the projection of virtual characters onto room surfaces using controllable projectors. Virtual characters may provide a novel, powerful and fun user interface, particularly when combined with speech technologies such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, spatial audio using microphone arrays and directional speakers, and spoken dialogue systems.  Interfaces based on virtual characters have the potential to engage people in more personal interactions than is possible with a conventional GUI.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"221125","fundValue":"169390.93","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
