{"id":"107927","title":"Knowledge Transfer of Smart Optical Fibre Sensor Technology","abstractText":"'The proposed knowledge transfer project on Smart Optical Fibre Sensor Technology (SOFST)via this International Incoming Fellowship (IIF) programme will bring the knowledge and expertise of the Marie Curie IIF Fellow Dr Qizhen Sun from the University of Huazhongin Chinawith the integration of the advanced optical fibre devicesfabrication technology and sensing applications of the EU host ï¿½ Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies (AIPT) of Aston University to (1) develop advanced fibre grating and nano-micro structure based sensor platform; (2) explore speciality optical fibres for high function and multi-parameter sensors; (3) utilise functional nano and bio coating materials for sensor performance enhancement; (4) develop fibre laser based sensor systems for high resolution detection; (5) develop label-free on-line fibre sensor detection systems for food quality and security control.  Together with proposed collaboration with 4 academic and 4 industrial co-hosts in Europe, the outcome of this project will not just enhance the EU leading position in smart fibre sensor technology but also the competiveness in commercialisation and wide range applications of this technology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"328263","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-03-06","fundEnd":"2016-03-05","dataset":"fp7"}
