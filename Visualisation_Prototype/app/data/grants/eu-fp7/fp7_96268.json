{"id":"96268","title":"New Frontiers in Quantum Dots Science: Assembly and Functionalisation","abstractText":"'This project will investigate a diverse range of octanuclear zinc sulfide nanoclusters as Quantum Dots (QDs). Compared with colloidal QDs whose distribution are random over space, these stoichiometric crystalline nanoclusters exhibit uniform cluster size and long-range periodic ordering which are vital for the study of quantum confinement effects. A simple and successful scheme to assemble them has been reported by the applicant and the goal of this project is to further assemble and functionalize this system, explore their fascinating optical properties and create a new research frontier in biological applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254349","fundValue":"241289.6","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
