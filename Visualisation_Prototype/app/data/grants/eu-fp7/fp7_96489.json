{"id":"96489","title":"Alternative splicing of NADPH-Oxidases as a mechanism for seed dormancy regulation","abstractText":"'This project brings together a top-class, young researcher from Germany, Kerstin M�ller with two world-leading experts on complementary aspects of seed biology: Prof. Mike Holdsworth at Nottingham University UK and Prof. Allison Kermode at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada. The project will work on the very active and timely field of alternative splicing during seed after-ripening and its connection with the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Seeds can enter a state of dormancy in which they fail to germinate under ideal conditions. Dormancy can be broken by after-ripening (air-dry storage at room temperature). The mechanisms underlying this economically and environmentally important process are not understood. Alternative mRNA splicing might play a role in dormancy regulation in seeds: it would be a flexible and fast way of reacting to changes in the environment. The superoxide-producing NADPH-Oxidase AtrbohB is alternatively spliced in seeds depending on developmental status and the presence of ABA, and atrbohB mutants fail to after-ripen. The proposed interdisciplinary project will investigate mRNA-splice forms and superoxide production by rbohs in Arabidopsis and two other selected species during after-ripening and germination and focus on the the relation between ABA signalling, rbohs and alternative splicing in Arabidopsis seeds. This research will uncover novel findings on after-ripening and alternative splicing which will be published in international journals and at conferences. Long term collaboration will be set up between the Simon Fraser University and Nottingham University. Kerstin M�ller will gain valuable experience in both state-of-the-art laboratory techniques as well as a range of complimentary skills whilst working in Canada, from which Nottingham University and the European Research Area in general will benefit both by transfer of knowledge and by promoting the Europe-based career of a promising young scientist.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252343","fundValue":"235690.2","fundStart":"2011-04-27","fundEnd":"2014-04-26","dataset":"fp7"}
