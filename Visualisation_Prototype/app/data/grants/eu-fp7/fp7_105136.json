{"id":"105136","title":"Epigenetic Training Network - Innovative techniques and models to understand epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis of common diseases","abstractText":"'Despite the past century witnessing considerable advances in our understanding of genetics, the success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in detecting putative causal variants has been tinged with disappointment as the effects found have been modest. Epigenetics promises a novel biological foundation of a new way of looking at common diseases because it responds to the environment and governs gene expression - thus potentially mediating a path from environmental effects to gene expression to behavior. The primary objective of the EpiTrain Research Training Network is to promote integrative training-through-research in the field of epigenetics, especially of young researchers, both pre- and post-doctoral level, within the frame of high quality international collaborations. By integrating academic and private institutions with specializations in technological, analytical and computational aspects of epigenetic research, the training program will not only provide insights into research techniques and paradigms complementary to the individual projects, but will also strengthen professional skills and enhance the career prospects of the fellows.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"316758","fundValue":"3816547.8","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
