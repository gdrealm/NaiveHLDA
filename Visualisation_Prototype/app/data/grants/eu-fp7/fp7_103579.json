They interact very effectively with the surrounding environment by exchanging energies and mass flow across their cuticles making use of specific micro structures and functions to achieve the perfect energy balance.\n\nThe proposed international research staff exchange programme of �BioApproNFS Wett� brings together five leading universities from four different countries to collaborate in the research area of biomimetic approaches of natural functional surfaces and the extreme wettability.  The aim of the proposed programme is to facilitate research staff exchange between the leading institutions in biomimetics so that complementary and synergistic skills can be acquired as per the needs and skills offered by the respective partners. These can then be exploited in the future through initiatives as part of the international joint laboratory that will be established through this project. The programme will have major benefits for early staged researchers from high education institutes and also the industrial companies from both Europe and China. Through research collaboration and staff exchanges, the state-of-the-art technologies of studying biomimetics (or bionics), such as micro scaled fabrication, functional nanoparticle coating, hierarchical micro & nano structure, and surface wettability will be studied and/or applied.  Major programmes of the research staff exchanges include research visits, training for early staged researchers, and organising regular open research seminars, workshops and conferences. The dissemination and exploitation will be based on joint research publications and open seminars where the industrial community will be actively encouraged to attend.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"295224","fundValue":"220500","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
