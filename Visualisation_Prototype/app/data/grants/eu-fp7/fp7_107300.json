{"id":"107300","title":"Mapping and Manipulating Interfacial Charge Transfer in Polymer Nanostructures for Photovoltaic Applications","abstractText":"'The goal of the proposal is to develop unique capability and understanding of electroactive materials and their composites, for photovoltaic applications, through the use of emerging nanoscale electrochemical imaging techniques. By combining the strong background and experience of the Fellow (Josh Byers) in materials science, with the impressive facilities, equipment, infrastructure and expertise at the Host Institution, exciting new directions in hybrid photovoltaic materials will developed and explored. Nanostructured organic and inorganic materials are attractive for potential low cost photoelectrochemical energy generation for large scale exploitation. However, these materials are characterized by nanoscale features (typically tens of nmï¿½s), and it has only now become possible to study their electrochemical response on a similar length scale using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), recently invented  by the Host Institution. The Fellow will join the Host group to expand the current capabilities to include high resolution photoelectrochemical imaging to study in detail the local (photo)electrochemical processes that occur at the interfaces of electrode materials for next generation photovoltaic devices (eg. dye sensitized solar cells), elucidating the impact of nanoscale morphology and structure on activity. Exploiting the nanoscale dimensions of the SECCM system, new methods for fabricating conjugated polymer nanostructures and composites will also be investigated to develop novel electrode materials. Through a combinatorial approach made possible by SECCM, these materials will be studied in-situ following their fabrication. The results of the project will provide a new view of photovoltaic devices at the nanoscale, ultimately allowing the rational design of improved solar cells. Dissemination to a wide audience is planned to maximise impact and opportunities in Europe.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329953","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
