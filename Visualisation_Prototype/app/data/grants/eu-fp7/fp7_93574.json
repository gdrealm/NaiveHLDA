{"id":"93574","title":"Support for realising new Member and Associate Statesï¿½ potentials in transport research","abstractText":"'TransNEW is a Horizontal Activity for the implementation of the Transport Programme.  It is a Coordinating and Support Action aimed at supporting transport research activities in the New Member States. It contributes to the implementation of the Framework Programme and to the preparation of future Community research and technological development. It also stimulates, encourages and facilitates the participation of the New Member States and particularly SMEs in those countries in national, regional and European research. TransNEW has one primary focus to assess, analyse and define strategies for realising New Member and Associated States potentials in transport research. This is absolutely in line with the Integration/Efficiency Topic TPT.2008.8. TransNEW aims to map the transport research capacities in new Member States (and Associated States) by analysing their transport research activities to establish their recent patterns of collaboration. With this information evaluated by Mode and by Activity this will then be used to maximise the benefits of transport research at regional level and at a mode level.  TransNEW covers all the transport modes including Aeronautics and aims to evaluate research capability in order to support the involvement of New Member States in a number of topics and potentially exploit the synergies between Air transport and surface transport modes. Through mode evaluation, TransNEW will assess the research actors who can make an active contribution to the common (transport research) objectives of advancing competitiveness, anticipating and responding to the socio-economic and environmental challenges of the transport system.   TransNEW will cluster the research capacity results by Activities.  The five Activities are: 1. Greening - environmental impacts of transport and climate change 2. Enhanced integration of transport modes 3. Safety and Security 4. Transport system efficiency and Mobility 5.
