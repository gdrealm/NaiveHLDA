{"id":"95462","title":"Short chain fatty acids and GPR43 in human health and disease","abstractText":"'These studies will determine the physiological impact of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which activate the G-coupled protein receptor 43 (GPR43) as dietary supplementation in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Non-digestible carbohydrates (NDC) are carbohydrates which are indigestible in the small intestine, but are broken down in the colon by the fermentation process of bacteria. SCFA are the major products of carbohydrate fermentation and bind to a receptor called GPR43 which is expressed on adipocytes, immune cells, pancreatic beta-cells and enteroendocrine cells that release appetite-suppressing hormones glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). Therefore, it is suggestive that this receptor provides a cross-talk between different organs and tissues, linking metabolism with the innate immune system. These studies aim to test the hypothesis that administration of the SCFA propionate reduces appetite by inducing anorectic gut hormone release, improves glucose stimulated insulin secretion, reduces body weight, induces adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and regulates activation of the immune system and systemic inflammation. Should these studies prove positive then this work will propose a novel treatment option for obesity and type 2 diabetes.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"256365","fundValue":"75000","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
