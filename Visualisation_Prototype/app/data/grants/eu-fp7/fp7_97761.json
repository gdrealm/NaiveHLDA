{"id":"97761","title":"Models for Ageing and Technological Solutions for Improving and Enhancing the Quality of Life","abstractText":"'The aim of the project is to accumulate the expertise for mathematical and computer modelling of ageing processes, including forecasting models for prevention and rehabilitation, and implementation into technological solutions (monitors,  telecare, recreational games) and instruments (surveys, assessment tools), which could contribute to the improvement and enhancement of the quality of life in later life, and the assessment of impact of factors, such as demography, mobility, health, food, lifestyle, and others to the ageing process. Objectives � Using expertise, observations and knowledge accumulated by the partners, establish factors for ageing related to this programme � Investigate associations between factors, including associations between cognitive and physiological factors � Evaluate appropriate techniques for mathematical and computer modelling of selected ageing processes � Using expertise, observations and data accumulated by the partners, develop models � Establish requirements for visualisation and develop appropriate software tools � Implement models into technological solutions and use feedback and observations to improve the models � Study the impact of these solutions for improvement and enhancement of quality of life � Educating, training of early stage researchers and further development of experienced researchers All WP � Disseminate results and good practice widely including health communities and patients communities The project is multi-disciplinary and includes specialism from mathematics and statistics, physics, computer science, psychology and sociology, nursing and health.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247541","fundValue":"189000","fundStart":"2011-01-20","fundEnd":"2014-01-19","dataset":"fp7"}
