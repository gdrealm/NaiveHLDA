{"id":"90612","title":"Functionalised Carbon Nanotube Electrochemical Sensors","abstractText":"'This proposal is for a highly promising young scientist from Spain, Aleix Garcia-G�ell, to carry out research and high level training in electrochemical nanoscience, in the renowned Electrochemistry and Interfaces Group at the University of Warwick (UK). The project will greatly enhance the expertise of Garcia-G�ell in nanostructured materials, and applications thereof, and take him in significant new directions in the area of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) materials. Specifically, the project will consider novel ideas for a new generation of electrochemical and electrical sensors based on SWNTs and will allow Garcia-G�ell to become expert in state-of-the-art nanoscience techniques. The Host Group has recently established that SWNT random networks have very interesting electrochemical properties, including a step change in detection sensitivity, and it is now opportune to build significantly on this work to: (i) develop a detailed understanding of the electrochemistry and conductance of SWNTs at the nanoscale; and (ii) optimise the use of SWNT network and array devices for high sensitivity detection in solution, including bioanalysis. Surface functionalisation will be key part of the programme and Garcia-G�ell will bring to bear his expertise, developed in Barcelona and through collaborations in the USA and Germany, on functionalisation strategies using metal nanoparticles and bilayer membranes. The programme is an excellent match of complementary skills of the Fellowship candidate and Host Group and will yield new scientific breakthroughs which will have substantial benefits to European science in this important area. The Fellow will have the opportunity to develop complementary skills essential for career development, through training programmes at the University of Warwick. He will benefit considerably from the extensive network of collaborators of the supervisors and their experience in mentoring young researchers.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"236885","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2009-07-20","fundEnd":"2011-07-19","dataset":"fp7"}
