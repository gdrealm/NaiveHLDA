{"id":"101690","title":"\"Mobile Cloud Computing: Networks, Services and Architecture\"","abstractText":"'The overall objective of the MONICA project is to accelerate the transfer and deployment of research knowledge between European countries and China in order to obtain better understanding of mobile cloud computing in terms of its networks, services and architecture. In particular, the transfer of knowledge, mainly as a result of researcherï¿½s mobility, will focus on a new vision of mobile cloud computing paradigm. This new vision advocates the seamless integration of both arms of a mobile cloud computing platform, each locating at the different layers, namely, cloud computing at the application layer and mobile wireless networks at the network and transmission layer. This integration calls for cross-layer information exchange of the two layers to create a mobile cloud computing system where mobile network operators, service providers and end users all benefit. This staff exchange programme will also help develop new research links and deepen and strengthen the current research links amongst the partners and help build up long-term, world-class research in this exciting new research field of mobile cloud computing.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"295222","fundValue":"361200","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
