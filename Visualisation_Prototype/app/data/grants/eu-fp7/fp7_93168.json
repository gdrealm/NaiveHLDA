{"id":"93168","title":"Carbon Dioxide Capture and Hydrogen Production with Membranes","abstractText":"'Hydrogen membrane reactors are an attractive technology for pre-combustion carbon dioxide capture in both coal and gas fired power stations because they combine the efficient conversion of syngas into hydrogen fuel with capture of the remaining carbon dioxide in one reactor. The carbon dioxide is produced at high pressure, reducing the compression energy for transport and storage. CACHET II project will develop innovative metallic membranes and modules for high capacity hydrogen production and separation from a number of fuel sources including natural gas and coal. The DICP membrane developed in FP6 project CACHET along with novel seal and substrate technology will be scaled up and undergo long term stability testing. An optimisation design tool will be built to include the relationship of all key operating parameters; this tool will be used to specify an optimised pilot and commercial membrane module design. The project will research novel binary and tertiary palladium alloys for improved durability and permeance for application to solid based fuels derived syngas and high temperature integrated reforming processes. Fundamental research on high temperature sulphur removal systems will enable sulphur tolerant membranes to become an economic possibility.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"241342","fundValue":"5235327.6","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
