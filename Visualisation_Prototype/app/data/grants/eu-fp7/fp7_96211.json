{"id":"96211","title":"Sastravid - a new paradigm for the study of Indian philosophical texts","abstractText":"'The aim of the present project is to transform the way Indian philosophical texts are currently studied. To do this we provide a philosophical analysis of a set of central works from the Indian tradition, a set well known for its demanding content and the conceptual complexity of the arguments it contains. This analysis will incorporate a set of cutting-edge methodological principles, the most important of which is the intricate interlinking of conceptual analysis and its textual basis. These principles will be encoded in a web-based electronic tool that will be developed during the course of the project. This tool, called Sastravid, incorporates an example of the new research paradigm and at the same time facilitates further academic research based on the same approach. Its aim is to provide a key that unlocks the contents of Indian philosophical texts by bringing together the information contained in commentarial works, both ancient and modern, in a way that makes it easily accessible from the text itself. Apart from structuring the works, providing commentarial background and linking texts to other texts the present project develops a radically new way of analyzing the text's conceptual contents. This analysis is linked directly to the texts themselves, which makes it easy to switch between philological and philosophical modes of research. This linkage between conceptual and textual analysis embodies a radically new way of thinking about Indian philosophical texts that is located at the very frontier of the discipline and has never been applied to the study of philosophical texts before. It pushes the study of Indian philosophical works beyond the domain of mere textual scholarship into the emerging field of research studying Indian philosophy as philosophy.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"263281","fundValue":"736782.98","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
