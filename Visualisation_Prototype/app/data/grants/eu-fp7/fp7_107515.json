{"id":"107515","title":"Observation of the Higgs production mode in the ttH channel at ATLAS","abstractText":"'On the 4th of July 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN independently announced the discovery of a �Higgs-like� particle. This remarkable discovery is of tremendous importance to our understanding of the Universe. The discovered particle cannot yet be confirmed as the Higgs boson because several of its properties must be measured and compared with the theoretical predictions.\n\nIn the proposed programme, the fellow aims to address the nature of the �Higgs-like� particle by measuring some of its properties by analysing the proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment. He will work on the observation of Higgs production in association with a pair of top quarks (ttH) followed by the Higgs decay to bottom quarks (H->bb). The observation of this challenging channel will be possible with the large dataset being accumulated in 2012. The analysis performed on this channel will contribute to the measurement of the Higgs coupling to the top and bottom quarks. The fellow will use the same channel to measure the CP parity of the particle, a key parameter for confirming its nature.\n\nThe fellowship will be carried out in the Particle Physics group within the Physics Department at Royal Holloway University of London. The group was one of the founding members of the ATLAS collaboration in 1992 and has a broad research programme. In particular the host has a strong experience in Higgs and top physics which are both relevant for the project.\n\nThis fellowship will allow the candidate to restart his research career in particle physics. During the two years of the project, the fellow will learn all tools and techniques required for completing an analysis in the ATLAS experiment, and more in general for working at LHC. By the end of the Fellowship will be an independent and experienced researcher.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"330255","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-14","dataset":"fp7"}
