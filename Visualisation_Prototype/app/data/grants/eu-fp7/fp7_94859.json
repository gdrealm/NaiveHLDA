{"id":"94859","title":"Sustainable routes to shaped nanoparticles for selective catalysis","abstractText":"'The IIF project NANOTUNE aims to design novel palladium nanoparticle-based catalysts with tuned particle properties, and use them to control the selectivity of catalytic reactions. Changes to the support and addition of second metals will be used to tune the electronic properties of the nanoparticles. In addition, the particle shape will be varied using templating species such as organic ligands or changing the porosity of the support. By a combination of these techniques, it will be possible to design a catalyst to give high catalytic selectivity. The catalysts will be tested in the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen, and chemoselective hydrogenation of substrates relevant to the fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industries. The reactions were selected on the basis of their relevance to the sustainability and economic development of Europe. A high-level understanding of the shape and surface chemistry of the nanocatalysts will be achieved by using advanced characterisation methods, including solid state NMR, X-ray synchotron techniques, high resolution TEM and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Work in these areas will be in collaboration with the academic sector, both in the UK and Europe. The Fellow, Dr. Elena Cristina Corbos, is currently working in Japan, and will move to the UK and bring knowledge of the preparation of modified supports and DRIFTS catalyst analysis to the EU and to the host. The project has the potential to impact significantly on the future economic and sustainable development of the EU. Synthesis of catalysts with controlled properties is in line with the vision of the knowledge economy, which is a key part of the EUï¿½s future prosperity. Increased selectivity of catalytic reactions will improve sustainability, with fewer raw materials and energy required for the same yield of product.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252242","fundValue":"173240.8","fundStart":"2010-05-17","fundEnd":"2012-05-16","dataset":"fp7"}
