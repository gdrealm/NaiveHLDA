{"id":"104011","title":"Mid-Infrared Fibre Lasers","abstractText":"'The key goal of MIDIR project is the knowledge transfer from the Marie Curie International Incoming Fellow Dr J. Li with strong background in fibre laser science and technology and unique knowledge and skills in the specific area of mid-infrared (mid-IR) fibre lasers to the EU host � Photonics Research Group (PRG) of Aston University in establishing a new research direction and training the young post-docs, Ph.D and Master students. MIDIR will also aim the knowledge transfer to 4 EU co-host Universities: Leeds Univ., Heriot-Watt Univ., Tamper Univ. and Universie de Mons � to collaboratively research in novel mid-IR fibre laser science and technology. In addition, Dr J. Li will carry out industry placement with two EU industrial co-hosts - Arden Photonics and DUOMO Ltds specialised in optical fibre equipments and in manufacturing and supplying gas safety equipment and CO2 monitors - to explore the applications and commercialisation.\nWe have defined five objectives for knowledge-transfer: (1) Research knowledge transfer; (2)  Research methodology and Skill transfer; (3) Training and co-supervision to Aston Ph.D students; (4) Establishing long term international collaboration; (5) Intra-Europe knowledge transfer. The proposed novel research in mid-IR fibre lasers will be embedded into the activities within these five workpackages.\nDr J. Li�s expertise and knowledge can be integrated with the Aston PRG advanced fabrication technology to develop novel mid-IR fibre lasers and contribute to the science, technology and applications in this area. The proposed intra-Europe collaboration with the four Universities and two industrial companies will not just lead to new development of advanced high power mid-IR fibre lasers but also enhance the EU leading position in this research area and competiveness in commercial market. Furthermore, the proposed overall training programme will forest the next generation scientists and engineers for Europe research community and industry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"299333","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2013-02-22","fundEnd":"2015-02-21","dataset":"fp7"}
