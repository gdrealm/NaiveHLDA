{"id":"111135","title":"DAtacommunications based on NanophotoniC Resonators","abstractText":"'A key challenge for the 21st century is, therefore to provide billions of people with the means to access, move and manipulate, what has become, huge volumes of information. The environmental and economic implications becoming serious, making energy efficient data communications key to the operation of today�s society.\n\nIn this project, the Principal Investigator will develop a new framework for optical interconnects and provide a common platform that spans Fibre-to-the-home to chip-to-chip links, even as far as global on-chip interconnects. The project is based on the efficient coupling of the Photonic Crystal resonators with the outside world. These provide the ultimate confinement of light in both space and time allowing orders of magnitude improvements in performance relative to the state of the art, yet in a simpler simple system- the innovator�s dream. New versions of the key components of optical links- light sources, modulators and photo-detectors- will be realised in this new framework providing a new paradigm for energy efficient communication.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"337508","fundValue":"1495450","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2018-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
