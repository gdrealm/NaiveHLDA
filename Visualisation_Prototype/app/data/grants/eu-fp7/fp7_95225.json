{"id":"95225","title":"Nonlinear Plasmonic Metamaterials","abstractText":"'The main goal of the proposed research project is the modelling and theoretical analysis of a new class of artificial metamaterials exhibiting a strong nonlinear optical response at visible and near-infrared frequencies.The promising properties of these new photonic materials are assisted by surface plasmon polaritons supported by the metallic subunits forming the metamaterial. The nonlinear response can be due not only to the metallic nanostructures, but also to the presence of nonlinearities in the substrate or embedding layer. The investigation on nonlinear plasmonic metamaterials combines three of the most active and fruitful research areas in photonics during the last decade: plasmonics, metamaterials science and nonlinear optics. Despite of the crucial importance of nonlinear effects in current photonic applications (such as laser and imaging technologies), nonlinear processes have not been yet incorporated into the metamaterial approach. In my research, I will take advantage of nonlinear effects to develop metamaterials at visible and near-infrared frequencies by overcoming the high absorption that electromagnetic fields suffer when propagating within metallic structures. The study of nonlinear plasmonic metamaterials may lead to the discovery of novel optical properties not found in nature. The profound comprehension of the fundamental physics behind these new photonic materials lies at the core of this proposal. However, the technological implications of this research project are clear. Nonlinear plasmonic metamaterials will open the way to the design of actively controlled and multi-functional optical materials which are the first step towards a new generation of highly effective optical devices such as switchers, routers, intelligent surfaces and subwavelength imaging devices.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253626","fundValue":"180603.2","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
