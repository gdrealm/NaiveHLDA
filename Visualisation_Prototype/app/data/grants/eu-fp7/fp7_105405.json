{"id":"105405","title":"\"Human Rights Beyond Borders: The extraterritorial application of international human rights law - comparative legal, historical and theoretical approaches\"","abstractText":"'This project will provide detailed, comprehensive, independent and authoritative explanation and critical appraisal of the extraterritorial application of human rights law, covering both civil and political rights and economic social and cultural rights, including the right to development.  It will do this through analysis of both the law itself, and the cognate theoretical ideas and historical context.  In its path-breaking cross-disciplinary orientation, the combined focus on law, theory�economic, social and political�and history will provide entirely novel ways of thinking about both the subject-matter and the cognate theoretical and historical ideas.  Equally, the full-spectrum comparative treatment of human rights� not only civil and political rights but also economic, social and cultural rights�will provide new and innovative insights on the extraterritorial aspects of each area of law.  Although the project will provide a more up-to-date treatment of the law, and a more sustained and even-handed treatment of the full range of human rights, than is offered in existing scholarship on the topic, more fundamentally the profoundly different methodological approach adopted will take ideas about the topic into entirely new terrain.  The project is concerned with a radical innovation in analysis on the subject when compared to existing scholarship, in offering for the first time a cross-disciplinary analysis of the law through the application of theoretical and historical methodologies, and also an analysis of the broader theoretical and historical trends implicated in the relevant areas of law.  The more ambitious methodological treatment in the project will break new ground in moving fully beyond exclusively or predominantly �black letter� analyses of the law in existing scholarship, but in a manner that is then able to move back from the broader perspective to provide radically novel insights into that law drawn from it.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"313474","fundValue":"1111752","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
