{"id":"89845","title":"Strategic Management of Emergent Nanotechnologies","abstractText":"'The proposed research programme sets out to investigate the multi-faceted nature of the management and development of emerging nanotechnologies through the integration of a variety of conceptual perspectives as well as different levels of analysis. It responds to the declared need for there to be a better understanding of the changing role of knowledge and technology in the creation of a competitive Europe. Advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology create such system of emerging technology innovation where the agents strive to reconcile the potential benefits of radical technological, economic and social change together with their associated uncertainty, ambiguity and instability. Emergence of nanotechnology represents a significant opportunity for researchers to investigate how different agents develop dynamic capabilities and create new business models. This proposal will enable the study of how individual agents engage with the strategic and wider social and economic context in order to explore opportunities offered by nanotechnology. It also offers an ideal setting to study the collaborative nature of emergent technology innovation more generally. Although this project is rooted in the social sciences it requires for serious attention to be paid to the practice of science and technology. This research programme represents the nucleus of a wider research agenda that is taking place at the host institution. This research on the business and managerial aspects of nanotechnology innovation will complement world class research in the area of nanotechnology. By so doing it will create knowledge relevant to scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, managers and research policy makers. The project also supports the ambition of the applicant to continue an international career within the European research area and as such embody the ideals of the Marie Curie programme.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"224801","fundValue":"45000","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
