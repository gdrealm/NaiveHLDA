{"id":"101433","title":"Second Generation Unit Load Device to improve the Security and Efficiency of the Aerospace Logistics Industry","abstractText":"'The SAFEGUARD project presents a new technology to improve the security and efficiency of air cargo through the research and development of a second generation Unit Load Device (ULD). With 1 million ULDs around the world worth over 900 million Euros, they are a crucial element of the global aviation industry. For example, in 2009, 80 million tonnes of air cargo was carried by the existing ULD fleet. However, 26 million tonnes of this cargo (33%) was transported on passenger aircraft and industry experts agree that air cargo is the weak link in the supply chain. Considering the potential security problems around the global air cargo supply chain, there is an urgent need to review and improve existing technological solutions. Over the last 20 years, incremental improvements have primarily focused on weight reduction, which has resulted in compromised security within the supply chain. The research and development of the SAFEGUARD technology will result in a step change improvement in the security of air cargo supply chain, in addition to large economic savings and logistics improvements for airlines. The proposed technology will overcome the existing security concerns in the supply chain, as well as reducing the ULD weight, minimising supply chain imbalances for ULD availability and the current high maintenance requirements. Following the research program, the new technology will enable our SME consortium partners to jointly commercialise a new product, with forecast revenues of 105 million Euros to 2020 and significant advancements in air cargo supply chain security.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"285843","fundValue":"1320357","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
