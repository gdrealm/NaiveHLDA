{"id":"95637","title":"Peptide Crystal Engineering with Lanthanide Complexes","abstractText":"'Crystal engineering will be used to combine rare earth complex chemistry with peptide synthesis in order to prepare new crystalline supramolecular and polymeric materials. Rare earth containing metallopeptides with luminescent and magnetic properties will be targeted as model compounds for applications in medical and biochemical research (e.g. biological imaging, contrast agents, etc). This approach will involve interdisciplinary collaborations to produce and analyse new materials for medicinal or biological chemistry. The preparation of peptides as molecular building blocks for the synthesis of supramolecular compounds will demand specialist expertise in different sectors of chemistry, biology and physics. The solvent-less green synthesis of coordination polymers, supramolecular frameworks and materials will also be developed as a new direction in existing projects, which the applicant initiated during the Marie Curie Fellowship. New molecular solid-state synthesis will present the potential to initiate local and international collaborations with academia and industry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"256547","fundValue":"45000","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
