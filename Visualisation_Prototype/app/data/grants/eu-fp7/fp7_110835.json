{"id":"110835","title":"Sustainable intensive pig and poultry production","abstractText":"'Production diseases compromise health and welfare, generating inefficiencies which impact adversely on profitability, environmental footprint, antibiotic use and product quality.\nThe PROHEALTH project will develop understanding of the multi-factorial dimension of animal pa-thologies linked to the intensification of production and use this to develop, evaluate and disseminate ef-fective control strategies to reduce impact.\nIt will address production diseases of pigs and poultry raised in a wide range of EU intensive systems, using both epidemiological and experimental approaches to consider the extent of, and the risk factors associated with diseases, the influence of genotype and its modification by early life experience, and the dynamic influences of the environment on disease. The mechanisms underlying differences in disease susceptibility will be explored at different levels. Improvement strategies for diseases including neo-natal mortality, gut and respiratory disorders, leg and metabolic disorders will be evaluated in farm scale tests, and data from diverse systems used to model whole-chain socioeconomic implications of disease states and their alleviation.\nThe consortium has expertise in veterinary science and epidemiology, physiology and immunology, ge-netics, nutrition, socioeconomics, welfare and production science of pigs and poultry. The 10 academic, 1 association 4 industry and 7 SME partners cover the full European geographic range to derive meaningful epidemiological data and test interventions across diverse production circumstances.\nDissemination activities will encompass all stakeholders in the food chain and establish new e-learning tools. PROHEALTH will deliver novel diagnostics for the propensity to develop production diseases and their occurrence, and multifactorial improvement strategies that can be applied to produce better quality products in a welfare friendly manner and improve competitiveness and sustainability of EU pig & poultry systems'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"613574","fundValue":"11996170.4","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2018-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
