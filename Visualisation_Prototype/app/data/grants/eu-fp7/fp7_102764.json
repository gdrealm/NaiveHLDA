{"id":"102764","title":"Aza-Claisen-Sakurai Approach to Cyclopentylamines","abstractText":"'Cyclopentylamines are ubiquitous compounds within nature and many pharmaceutical products. Their synthesis can be problematic with length and unselective sequences plaguing them. We aim to overcome this shortcoming by developing a new approach whereby we couple two well known reactions; the Aza-Claisen (or Aza-Cope) rearrangement and the Sakurai allylation.\nThe expected outcomes of this research are a new method which is both rapid and selective for the synthesis of cyclopentylamines. We also intend to achieve the total synthesis of the compound (-)-Altemicidin, a highly substituted cyclopentylamine which exhibits potent antitumor and acaricidal properties.  Any compounds produced will be screened against various disease states either here at Queenï¿½s using the Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology or with our academic and industrial partners.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"298780","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"2012-07-04","fundEnd":"2014-07-03","dataset":"fp7"}
