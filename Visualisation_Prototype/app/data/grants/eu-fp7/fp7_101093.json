{"id":"101093","title":"Suite of integrated models for electrical aircraft drives","abstractText":"'To enable technology selection, system architecture design and energy-optimised control of the electrical motor drives and distribution systems on board a future regional aircraft, a suite of SABER models will be developed and validated. These models will contain sufficient fidelity to enable investigations to be undertaken into the behaviour and energy efficiency of alternative electrical drive solutions and technologies over a range of electrical system architectures and operating scenarios.  The primary function of the models will be to assess power and energy usage.\nTo meet these objectives, a consortium of the Universities of Manchester and Bristol will create a suite of inter-connectable SABER models, comprising dynamic models of the machine, power converter and controller that include copper, iron and harmonic losses in the machines, and conduction and switching  losses in the converter.  The models will be scalable over the expected operating ranges of voltage, power and speed in a future small aircraft, and, through the use of average-value modelling techniques, will provide rapid simulation times. The dynamic motor control strategy will be used to inject representative disturbance effects to the models, to account for parameter uncertainties.  The models will be used to identify / devise optimum control and operating strategies to minimise energy use. Both partners draw on extensive experience of working with airframe manufacturers and equipment suppliers.\nAccurate parameterisation is identified as key to accurate loss modelling. Thermal modelling will be incorporated into the component models, validated by calorimetric tests and supported by other experimental work. The generated models will be validated against test data taken from existing prototype drive systems, representative of the state-of-the-art aircraft developments.  Suitable test-based methods for obtaining the electromagnetic and thermal model parameters will be defined and demonstrated.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"278407","fundValue":"348602.4","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
