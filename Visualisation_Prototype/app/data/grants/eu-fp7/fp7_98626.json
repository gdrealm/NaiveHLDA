{"id":"98626","title":"A new generation of fibre-based diagnostic sensors","abstractText":"'The BiognostiX project will develop technologies and flexible manufacturing methods for the fabrication of inexpensive biodiagnostic sensors on fibre-based substrates (e.g. paper or card).\nFabrication will be based on fluid-jet techniques, allowing the sensor platforms to be reconfigurable (customisable) at the point of manufacture to perform different biodiagnostic test functions including quantitative immunoassay.\nThe deposition of selected reagents and materials for the capture, labelling and indication of analyte levels in a biological serum sample will be spatially reconfigurable during manufacture, so as to be suitable for different biodiagnostic tests and/or different test methodologies.\nThis will be combined with innovative microfluidic matrix structures for the transport of fluids to different spatial areas on the test platform.\nThese will also be configurable (for example by creating channel blocks or applying wetting agents) to give a highly flexible manufacturing technology for biodiagnostic tests, enabling, for example, simultaneous multi-analyte testing and combinatorial test development.\nFor quantitative analysis the sensor platforms will be coupled to portable optical readout equipment capable of fast and accurate analysis, and suitable for Point-of-Care (POC) use (for example hospital bedside, doctorï¿½s surgery or home testing).\nThe application focus in the project will be on POC immunoassay for the detection and quantification of disease markers in medical, veterinary and other diagnostic applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"263061","fundValue":"4725690","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
