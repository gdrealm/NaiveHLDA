{"id":"106648","title":"UrbanIxD: Designing Human Interactions in the Networked City","abstractText":"The UrbanIxD Coordination Action project will define and consolidate a coherent research community working in the domain of technologically augmented, data-rich urban environments; with particular focus on the human activities, experiences and behaviours that occur within them. The Coordination Action will employ a 'Critical Design' methodology to explore social and technological issues that will be important to future FET research agendas. This Critical Design methodology will act as a catalyst for reflection and examination, leading to a high-profile public outreach programme, including an exhibition, and will enable the production of an informed Research Agenda output. This Agenda document will use the exploratory design activities carried out across the duration of the project to reflect upon emergent issues, and synthesise these into a focussed statement on future research directions.<br/>Interaction Design, in an urban context, is an increasingly important field of research. City populations are currently in a state of rapid flux. Conurbations are fast becoming a hybrid of the physical environment and the digital datasphere. How we, as physical beings, will connect with, interpret and adapt this increasing dataflow residing in our cities is already becoming a significant research question. The UrbanIxD Coordination Action will take a human-centred view of the concerns, experiences and behaviours that may occur in cities of the future. In order for advances in ICT to make the progression into real, transformative benefits for Europe's citizens, industry and society, there is a need to investigate the real, embodied and situated nature of interaction with these networked, and essentially heterogeneous, city environments. This is a challenge that can only be addressed through increasing interdisciplinary understanding and collaboration.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"323687","fundValue":"538457","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
