{"id":"106830","title":"\"DEVELOPMENT OF MODULAR CONSTRUCTION FOR SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, STABILITY AND SEISMIC APPLICATIONS\"","abstractText":"'Modular construction is used in housing and residential buildings because it is fast to construct and of high quality. This proposal provides the research necessary to extend two types of modular building systems into  high-rise building applications where means of providing stability and in some areas, seismic resistance are very important. In addition, the proposal will lead to quantification of  the sustainability benefits and acoustic performance, that affect the use of modular construction in the residential building sector.\n\nWith this information, it is possible to develop design guidance to support the use of these modular systems and to create new markets in high-rise and mixed use buildings. The research will involve full-scale physical tests on modules and on groups of modules, and supprted by  finite element analyses as well as on -site measurements of performance. The tests will cover the basic structural performance of the modules and their connections and in particular, their  robustness to removal of supports. This will aslso simulate the loss of support and tying action in seismic events. The structural guidance will be presented in the form of application rules to Eurocode 3.\n\nCase studies and architectural information will be presented to support the use of the modular systems in practice. This will extend to building typologies using the developed modular systems.\nseminars and other dissemination activities will be carried out to exploit the results of this research and to create market awareness.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"315274","fundValue":"1298917.85","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
