Accordingly VideoSense provides for:  i) Fostering increased sustainable relationships between existing national research groups ii) Momentum building by integrating existing researchers and resources to push forward new paradigms and the knowledge basis for the resolution of ethically guided, sense-ful, selective, useful, cost�effective solutions to society�s surveillance needs iii) Establishing a Virtual Centre of Excellence and expandable framework, based on Pan European integration of complementary expertise and optimisation of shared, flexible modular and inter-connected resources including knowhow, laboratories and people to support collaborative research and agenda setting, iv) Two external Boards of Industrial and Scientific Advisors to keep the targeted research focused and responsive to the needs of the European citizen, society and industry vi) Establishing a standard framework for Ethical Compliance Audit Management based on a suitably evolved Compliance Audit Maturity Model (CAMM) and associated Training and Certification services as both a service to organisations and revenue streams to ensure longer term sustainability of the Centre.'","grantUrl":"http://www.videosense.eu/","grantId":"261743","fundValue":"6580513.04","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
