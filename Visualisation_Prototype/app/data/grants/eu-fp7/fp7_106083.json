{"id":"106083","title":"A new type adsorption-resorption cycle for the combined power generation and refrigeration driven by low grade heat","abstractText":"'A new type of combined cycle of power generation and refrigeration, which is driven by the low grade heat such as the waste heat from chemical engineering factory and combustion turbine, and the low grade heat from solar energy, is proposed in the proposal. This new type cycle mainly includes two high temperature adsorbers with high temperature salt as adsorbent, and two low temperature adsorbers with low temperature salt as adsorbent. The working processes mainly include desorption and resorption processes. The desorption process of high temperature adsorber generates electricity, and the resorption process between two types of adsorbers, i.e. low temperature and high temperature adsorbers, generates refrigeration effect. In order to improve the power generation and refrigeration efficiency, a superheater and a precooler are designed in the cycle. Compared with traditional Rankin cycle that utilizes water as working media for power generation, this new type of combined cycle utilizes ammoniate salt as working media, thus it has higher efficiency because the temperature for desorption process of the ammoniate salt varies in the process of heating, and the average heating temperature of new type cycle is higher than that of water media in the Rankin cycle, which has an isothermal heating phase while the water vaporizes. If compared with combined absorption cycle for power generation and refrigeration, which is based on the Kalina cycle, this new type cycle not only has simple structure, but also has higher refrigeration efficiency for the reason of resorption refrigeration process, and it also has higher reliability because there are very less liquid ammonia exists in the system.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253106","fundValue":"120144.8","fundStart":"2010-12-06","fundEnd":"2011-12-05","dataset":"fp7"}
