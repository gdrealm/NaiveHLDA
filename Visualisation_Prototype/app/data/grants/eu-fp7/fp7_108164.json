{"id":"108164","title":"Probing the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization with the history and fluctuations of the hydrogen 21-cm line","abstractText":"'One of the frontiers being explored by astronomy today is the\nperiod between approximately 400000 years after the Big Bang, from\nwhich time we can detect the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nradiation, and around one billion years after the Big Bang, when\nearly galaxies and quasars start to become visible to current\ninstruments, such as ALMA and the Wide Field Camera 3 on HST. The\nmost promising observational probe of this period is the redshifted\n21-cm hyperfine line of atomic hydrogen.\n\nThe LOFAR telescope is now operational, and from its site in the\nNetherlands will be able to detect 21-cm radiation from the latter\npart of this period, the 'epoch of reionization' (EoR). Foreground\nradiation at the same frequency is several orders of magnitude more\nintense than the cosmological signal, however. Moreover, the data\nwill have low signal-to-noise and be filtered through a complex\ninstrument. As one of the core members of the LOFAR EoR key\nproject, I have developed techniques to extract information about\ncosmology and reionization from the data, and applied them to\nsynthetic EoR observations. During the fellowship, I will continue\nto develop and extend these methods with the help of the expertise\nin data analysis and novel statistical methods at UCL, begin to\napply them to the real data which will start to arrive during the\nperiod of the fellowship, and use them to learn about the EoR.\n\nOther experiments are being proposed which would be able to probe\nearlier parts of this period, the 'dark ages' and the 'cosmic\ndawn'. I am a co-investigator on a satellite mission, the Dark Ages\nRadio Explorer (DARE), which will be proposed to NASA's 2013\nExplorer program. It would take a complementary approach to\nLOFAR's, observing the sky-averaged 21-cm signal (rather than its\nfluctuations) at even lower radio frequencies, with the aim of\nlearning about the very first stars and black holes. Analysing its\ndata presents a different challenge, and will also require novel\ntechniques.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327999","fundValue":"299558.4","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
