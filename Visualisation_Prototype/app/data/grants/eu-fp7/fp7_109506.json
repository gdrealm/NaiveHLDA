{"id":"109506","title":"Industry and Doctoral Training in Vote Advice Applications","abstractText":"'Doctoral and Industry Training in Voting Advice Applications\n\nIn a review of current survey research, Roger Tourangeau (2004) wrote that �Surveys reflect societal change in a way that few other research tools do� (p775). Surveys and the analyses of survey responses are the bread and butter of research into the most challenging social problems. However, the random probability sample survey is sensitive to changes in both technology and lifestyle. From increases in personal wealth, higher mobility, language diversity brought about by immigration and technological changes such as the introduction and widespread adoption of mobile phones has led to challenging methodological issues for survey research. The Doctoral and Industry Training network merges technological advances in online tools with state of the art research on political behaviour to develop new methodologies and techniques for collecting and analysing social data to address this challenge in social research.  In VOTEADVICE, we bring together an industry at the forefront of online vote advice applications and doctoral training by a leading UK university to deliver doctoral and complementary training to 3 early stage researchers.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"608085","fundValue":"880775.72","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
