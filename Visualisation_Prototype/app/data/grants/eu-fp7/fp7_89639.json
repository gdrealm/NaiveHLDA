{"id":"89639","title":"The Development of Indicators & Assessment Tools for CSO Values-based projects in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)","abstractText":"'This project involves five very different Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) involved in Education for Sustainable Development in a very wide range of project types coming together to investigate two main aims, with academic assistance: 1) to develop more useful indicators to measure the impact of value/behaviour change elements in their ESD projects � at the project level. This will enable them to better prioritise their resources across a wide range of project types. A considerable range of value-based projects will be considered, involving SMEs, communities and schoolchildren. The newly developed project level impact indicators will be related to those for other levels, e.g. regional, national; and those used in academic arenas.  It will be necessary to particularly focus on the development of less established SD indicators such as ' well-being' which are can be strongly affected by spiritual/faith-based values and activities (Clark and Lelkes, 2005). Indicators for this have been difficult to quantify so far in mainstream discussions, but by focussing at project impact level we believe some can be defined and refined, with CSOs working with academics. Some schools of thought suggest that reinforcing local values will lead more effectively to behaviour changes, leading to larger SD impacts; without ways to measure, such ideas cannot be tested.  2) to improve the environmental impact of projects through advice at ground level. Three of the CSO participants in this proposal are faith-based whose projects generally focus on social issues more than environmental ones. The RTDs will be asked to outline possibilities to increase the projects� environmental impact within their current context, leading to suggestions and guidelines for such CSOs to allow them to be more effective at environmental impact even when this is not their main focus.    Researchers officers will work extensively in the field on CSO projects, with CSO staff, for both aims.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"212237","fundValue":"1005203","fundStart":"2009-01-20","fundEnd":"2011-04-19","dataset":"fp7"}
