{"id":"87505","title":"NanoPorous Anodic Oxides for Functionalization of Metal Surfaces","abstractText":"'The project examines the mechanisms of formation of nanoporous anodic oxides. Nanoporous anodic oxides are important to the protection of metals against corrosion and wear. They have attracted renewed interest due to the potential for long range ordering of pores, with applications in nanotechnological systems. Currently, long-range pore order is achieved empirically. However, the proper understanding of growth mechanisms will enable systematic tailoring of oxide properties. The researcher will participate in a collaborative activity, involving the host organization, The University of Manchester, and Institut des NanoSciences de Paris, located within Universitï¿½s Paris 7 et 6. The experimental work will focus on the relative contributions of oxide dissolution and oxide flow in the generation and ordering of pores. It will adopt tracer procedures, newly-developed in Manchester, with precise determination of compositions, morphologies and structures of porous oxides by a wide range of surface analytical and electron microscopy tools. These will include ion beam analyses, using facilities in Paris, with new methods of data analysis by multi-spectrum fitting. The researcher will be integrated into a large Light Metals activity, providing excellent opportunities for career development, including personal skills, networking, research management, supervision, and international collaboration. Further, the experimental programme provides a major diversification of the researcher's expertise and experience.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219913","fundValue":"178307.05","fundStart":"2008-04-15","fundEnd":"2010-04-14","dataset":"fp7"}
