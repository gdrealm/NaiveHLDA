{"id":"88240","title":"Regionalism in Early Islamic Law and Piety","abstractText":"'The proposed project is to investigate regionalism in early Islamic law and piety. Early biographical sources regularly classify jurisprudents geographically, and interregional controversy was an important feature of early legal thought and practice. Dr Tillier will come to Oxford for two years to undertake a series of collaborative studies with members of the Faculty of Oriental Studies, above all Dr Christopher Melchert. The outcome will be to make important advances in several fields of current debate, primarily among specialists in early Islamic history but also among students of Islam in general and even the wider educated public. It will also enhance Dr Tillier's skills in several fields and promote European scholarly collaboration.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219480","fundValue":"170142.1","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
