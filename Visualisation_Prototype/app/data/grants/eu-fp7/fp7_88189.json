{"id":"88189","title":"\"Rapid, robust & scaleable platform technology for fully automated reference laboratory grade Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based diagnostics regardless of global setting\"","abstractText":"'RANGER addresses the HEALTH-2007-2.3.3-4: Innovative point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests for influenza call by providing a innovative solution to the immediate need for a rapid, robust, cost effective & user friendly POC diagnostic for influenza.  We will develop the following real-time PCR system: 1)  A robust, portable system allowing testing at the POC anywhere in the world  2)  Raw sample to result automation of the entire test process including sample preparation  3)  Parallel processing of multiple samples & different sample types (aspirates & swabs) in a modular, user-friendly system 4)  RAPID & simple positive/negative result to the end user 5)  No need for an external computer or laboratory equipment  6)  Low cost consumable & reagents with a target cost of < ï¿½10 per test 7)  Sample preparation & freeze dried reagents pre-packaged into an ambient stable consumable to eliminate cold storage chains 8)  High confidence PCR results providing sensitivity & specificity equivalent to reference laboratory assays    a. Suitable for the diagnosis of early stage infections where viral titres can be low    b. Applicable to late surveillance & can be used to confirm the results from lower cost, low performance screen tests such as antibody assays that have low sensitivity and specificity.     c. Simultaneous identification of specific influenza strains & viral subtypes using multiplexing real-time PCR assays will also allow exclusion of related respiratory diseases 9)  Surveillance Management software & geographical data using GPS, allowing health authorities to manage early stage epidemics. The RANGER consortium includes WHO reference sites for human influenza diagnostics & world leading companies to develop and validate a POC influenza diagnostic system within 2 years. This system will allow health systems to be better prepared for epidemics by enabling early identification of infection and thus timely implementation of containment/treatment strategies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"201569","fundValue":"4170658.6","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
