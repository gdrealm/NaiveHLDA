{"id":"102772","title":"Multifunctional Magnets Through Rational Design","abstractText":"'The aim of this project is to rationally design innovative multifunctional magnetic framework materials using new metalloligand and organic radical groups.  This will  lead to tailored magnetic properties with potential application in a range of fields, such as data storage, computing and spintronics.  The metalloligand and radical groups are specially designed to impart specific magnetic interactions and function to the frameworks.  This has the two-fold advantage of not only using the material for sensing external stimuli, but post-synthetically modifying the magnetic properties of the materials.  The highly innovative goal is the realisation of multifunctional materials for applications in fields where tailored and tuneable magnetism is advantageous'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300462","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"2012-11-19","fundEnd":"2014-11-18","dataset":"fp7"}
