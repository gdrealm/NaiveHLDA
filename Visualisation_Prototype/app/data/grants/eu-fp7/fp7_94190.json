{"id":"94190","title":"Accessing Medicines in Africa and South Asia","abstractText":"'The main aim of the proposed research is to investigate how the interplay of patent regimes, pharmaceutical regulation, availability of drug production facilities, health care infrastructure and service provision, and engagement by foreign donors influence appropriate, affordable access to medicines in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. We aim to map patterns of production, distribution, supply and consumption of medicines within seven health care areas ï¿½ HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Reproductive Health, Tuberculosis (TB) control, Mental Health, Pain Management and Diabetes. We also plan to investigate the strategies and influence of selected Indian producers who are active as exporters, partners in joint ventures, or as direct producers in the selected South Asian and African countries.'","grantUrl":"http://www.amasa-project.eu/","grantId":"242262","fundValue":"3888729.37","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
