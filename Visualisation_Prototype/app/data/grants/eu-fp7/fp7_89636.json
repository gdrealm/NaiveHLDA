{"id":"89636","title":"More Integrated Systems Safety Assessment","abstractText":"'The increase of aerospace systems complexity has meant that by using existing methods for systems development, industry has reached a barrier to innovation and a risk to the competitiveness of products. This is characterised by an increasing time to market for new technologies, increasing costs to demonstrate proof of safety, a greater demand for skilled resources and a limitation on design iterations, which means there is less time to optimise designs that are compliant with safety targets. MISSA aims at filling this gap and providing methods and infrastructure that accelerate the convergence toward optimal system architecture that integrate safety constrains. To reach this goal, MISSA will focus on 4 main enabling contributions that are naturally linked together in the design process. � In the very preliminary design phases, when aircraft functions have been allocate to systems, MISSA will first provide methods and tools that support design and installation optimization � Secondly, MISSA will support the accurate definition and assessment of a systems organic architecture against the safety requirements resulting from the early design phases � Thirdly, MISSA will provide means for dealing with detailed system architecture and design � Finally, MISSA will develop a software infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of information needed to achieve the above three points. Thus MISSA will Develop Methods and tools to help safety engineers to collect, navigate, and manage information, structure their arguments, express their ideas, and most importantly find solutions to problems in an efficient, auditable and exhaustive way.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"212088","fundValue":"5956346.02","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
