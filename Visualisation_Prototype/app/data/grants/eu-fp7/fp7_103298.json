{"id":"103298","title":"The mechanism by which cohesin controls gene expression","abstractText":"'How cells retain, lose, and regain developmental plasticity is poorly understood due to ignorance of the molecular mechanisms regulating gene expression. Each gene is regulated by a unique set of factors and as a consequence the trans-acting factors and cis-acting chromatin modification states regulating a given gene are extremely rare. Transcription is affected by events taking place many thousands of base pairs away from the start, a property enabling developmental and evolutionary plasticity, presumably made possible by DNA looping or translocation of factors along chromatin. Most factors regulating a given gene function at many other genes, complicating interpretation of the consequences of altering the activity of such factors. It is difficult to exclude the possibility that phenotypes are knock-on effects. This could be surmounted if it were possible to observe individual genes in real time in three-dimensional space and to analyse the immediate consequences of altering the activity of regulatory factors. Of these, those capable of inter-connecting DNAs or of translocating large distances along chromatin are of interest. Cohesin is such a factor, composed of three core subunits, a pair of Smc proteins and a kleisin subunit, that interact with each other to form a huge tripartite ring, within which it is thought chromatin fibres are entrapped. In proliferating cells, cohesin�s primary function is to connect sister chromatids during DNA replication until the onset of anaphase, possibly by virtue of co-entrapment within a single ring.  However, cohesin is present in most quiescent cells and it is becoming clear that it also regulates gene expression and recombination. This proposal has two goals: To image gene expression on polytene chromosomes and to investigate cohesin�s role during ecdysone-induced transcription. The advantage of this system is that we can use micro-injection of TEV protease to inactivate cohesin.  A second goal is to develop the TEV system to'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"294401","fundValue":"2421212","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
