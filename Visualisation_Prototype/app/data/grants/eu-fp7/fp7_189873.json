{"id":"189873","title":"Media Aggregation and Plotting Platform","abstractText":"'In February 2011, the four-year ERC funded project Forensic Architecture (FASLW) was launched, exploring the role of spatial evidence within the law. In the first 24 months we have collaborated with the world�s foremost organisations in the field of human rights and achieved highly successful results in the production of spatial analysis for the investigation of human rights violations. While the cases we have been engaging with are disparate, our work for each of them has required the creation of composite visualisations (maps, timelines, digital models or a combination of these) which bring together dispersed fragments of information in multiple media formats and translate them into a comprehensible account or narrative, told from different perspectives.\n\nHaving recognised the efficiency of such innovative visualisations for legal and advocacy purposes, as well as the vivid interest they have provoked among our collaborating institutions and the news media that have published them, we now propose to develop a tool which will make the specific know-how we have acquired through FASLW accessible to a wide range of specialist and non-specialist users. This tool, which we call Media Aggregation and Plotting Platform (MAPP), will be a digital interface specifically designed to source, combine and visualise multiple forms of information into a single interactive display.\n\nMAPP will be initially developed for use by human rights organisations, providing them with a highly efficient research and advocacy tool. But its strong features built for specific purposes � including a wiki function allowing remote witnesses/reporters to upload additional data and collaboratively enrich the mapping platform � could then turn MAPP into a valuable tool in a variety of expanded contexts, including research, education, journalism, activism, and public debates.\n\nOur experience with FASLW indicates that digital mapping and data visualisation are to become essential media of communication, not only in the specific field of human rights legal and advocacy campaigns, but more generally in addressing the spatially intertwined situations that characterise our globalized world. MAPP will contribute to constructing and disseminating a new language for engaging with such contemporary issues.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"620291","fundValue":"161666.2","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
