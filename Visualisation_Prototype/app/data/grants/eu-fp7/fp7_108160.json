{"id":"108160","title":"TRANSITION METAL-NHC COMPLEXES FOR SMALL MOLECULE ACTIVATIONS","abstractText":"'The coordination chemistry of 3d transition metals with covalently tethered N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands is almost completely unexplored. In this project, we will develop a completely new and stereo-electronically more versatile type of NHC ligand functionalized with anionic amido or phosphido donor groups. Our ligands will enable the development of a new family of three-coordinate complexes of low-valent chromium, manganese iron, cobalt and nickel, represented by 1 and 2. The three coordinate complexes will possess intrinsically interesting molecular and electronic structures, and we will develop their reactivity towards a range of small-molecule activation reactions.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"326032","fundValue":"299558.4","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
