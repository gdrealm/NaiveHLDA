{"id":"109953","title":"The development of a high power density RAPID response on demand water HEATing technology","abstractText":"'The RapidHeat project utilises emerging materials science applied in the power electronics industry and an efficient heat management system to develop a modular, high flow rate, on demand, in line water heater for flexible and rapid response to hot water demand. Its low cost, light weight and small size will enable flexibility in the design of hot water systems minimising cost and energy consumption. Furthermore, zero heat loss will be produced from our RapidHeat technology which goes beyond standards set by the EuP directive.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"604846","fundValue":"1420927.45","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
