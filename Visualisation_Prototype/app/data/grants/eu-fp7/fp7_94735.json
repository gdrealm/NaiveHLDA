{"id":"94735","title":"Developmental programming and the costs of reproduction","abstractText":"'The costs of reproduction lie at the heart of life history theory, and their magnitude determines key biological processes such as how rapidly animals age, the effort that parents devote to offspring care, and the intensity of social conflicts. But what determines just how costly reproduction will be? Using a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating experimental work in the laboratory and theoretical analyses, we propose to investigate how the developmental environment in early life influences the costliness of reproduction, and to determine the knock-on effects for senescence, parental care and social evolution. The multidisciplinary nature of the project will additionally enable training in new scientific techniques, specifically theoretical modelling, experimental design, immunological methods and laboratory work with an insect model.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252120","fundValue":"171740.8","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
