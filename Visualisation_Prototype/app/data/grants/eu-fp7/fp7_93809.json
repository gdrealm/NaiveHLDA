{"id":"93809","title":"Enriched Network-aware Video Services over Internet Overlay Networks","abstractText":"Future networked media applications will be multi-sourced, highly interactive distributed meshes of HD and 3D multi-sensory channels. While high-quality user-centric applications such as these offer tremendous advantages to their participants and to society at large, they present a major headache to ISPs as they demand unprecedented quantities of network resources in unpredictable locations. The traditional solution of pre-provisioning sufficient network resources everywhere is no longer economically viable given the huge capacities required. If these services are ever to become a reality then a fundamentally different approach is required.nENVISION proposes a three-pronged, cross-layer solution where: i) intelligent overlay applications are optimised for true end-to-end performance at a global scale according to the actual capabilities of multiple underlying ISPs; ii) network resources are dynamically mobilised to where they are most needed; and iii) the content, the way it is accessed and distributed is adapted on-the-fly to what the network is able to deliver.nThe ENVISION cross-layer approach, where the problem of supporting demanding services is solved cooperatively by service providers, ISPs, users and the applications themselves, delivers both content-aware networks and network-aware applications and is therefore at the heart of Objective ICT-2009.1.5.nENVISION will research and develop novel algorithms, mechanisms and protocols for its three pillars of investigation. It will build upon and extend the current SoA, validating its proposals experimentally through simulations and testbed prototypes. The consortium has the experience, skills and resources to achieve such ambitious results and also the proven means for disseminating its outcome to the scientific and wider communities. The consortium plans to promote the ENVISION interface as a standardised means for cooperation between applications and ISPs for realising demanding multimedia services.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"248565","fundValue":"5712608","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
