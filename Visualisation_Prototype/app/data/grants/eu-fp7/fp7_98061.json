{"id":"98061","title":"Molecular Nanomagnets based on Rhenium(IV) and Manganese(III)","abstractText":"'In the multidisciplinary field of Molecular Magnetism, Single-Molecule Magnets (SMMs) represent the smallest possible magnetic device and hence a molecular bottom-up approach to nanoscale magnetism. SMMs are obtained synthetically by chemists and are studied in depth by physicists and theoreticians, since SMMs can act as an exceptional nano-laboratory for studying (predicted) fundamental quantum magnetic phenomena, including quantum tunneling of the magnetization, quantum phase interference, spin parity effects and quantum coherence.\nThe current record value of the effective energy barrier to magnetization reversal for SMMs based on d-transition metal complexes is 86 K, which was recently obtained by Dr Brechin and co-workers for a hexanuclear Mn(III) complex; this Mn6 molecule exhibiting a spin S=12 ground state. In line with these recent results, we will explore the magnetic exchange interaction between Re(IV) (5d) and Mn(III) (3d) ions in octanuclear Re(IV)2Mn(III)6 systems. The over-arching aim of our research program will therefore be the introduction of the highly anisotropic Rhenium(IV) ion into Mn6 molecules in order to obtain a new energy barrier record value.\nGiven that no Re(IV)-Mn(III) compound has ever been reported, this project is clearly original and timely. Having in mind that systems involving 5d metal ions have been much less explored, we are confident that our research program will provide new insights into the magnetism of molecular cage compounds. Overall, our research proposal, MONARHEMAN, will establish an effective and innovative approach for the development of novel 3d-5d based Single-Molecule Magnets.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"272659","fundValue":"209092.8","fundStart":"2011-09-06","fundEnd":"2013-09-05","dataset":"fp7"}
