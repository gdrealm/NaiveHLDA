{"id":"94754","title":"New bioactive agents based on natural products","abstractText":"'More than 1 in 3 people in the EU will develop cancer during their lifetime. Despite huge investment, insufficient new bioactive molecules are emerging, and there is urgent need for a different approach to research in this area. Drawing inspiration from Nature, the Fellow will investigate natural products with anticancer potential. The objective of the IEF is to support the career development of a talented researcher, to improve and develop her skills in preparation for an independent scientific career. The research objectives are to exploit the medicinal activity in naturally occurring quinones in an interdisciplinary programme involving chemical synthesis of the natural compounds and analogues, and their biological evaluation, maximizing the synergy between the Fellow and the Host Laboratory. The objectives will be measured against: � development of innovative chemical routes to bioactive quinones, including natural products and analogues; � biological evaluation of novel compounds as potential therapeutic agents; � publication of high quality papers; � establishment of research collaborations between UK and Italian groups. The project brings together complementary scientific communities in research aimed at developing novel therapeutic agents, particularly for cancer. The substantial training element will be of huge benefit to the Fellow in establishing her independent academic career by complementing and reinforcing her medicinal chemistry background with synthetic organic chemistry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252173","fundValue":"173240.8","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
