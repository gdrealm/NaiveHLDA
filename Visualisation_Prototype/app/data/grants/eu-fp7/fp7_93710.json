{"id":"93710","title":"Multi-Role Shadow Robotic System for Independent Living","abstractText":"The project focuses on the development and prototyping of remotely-controlled, semi-autonomous robotic solutions in domestic environments to support elderly people. In particular, the SRS project will demonstrate an innovative, practical and efficient system called 'shadow robot' for personalised home care.nnMost elderly people want to live in the familiar environment of their own residence for as long as possible. However, not many can live with their adult children and therefore, at some stage, often late in life, have to live alone. Studies show that some forms of home care are usually required as they advance in years.nSRS solutions are designed to enable a robot to act as a shadow of its controller. For example, elderly parents can have a robot as a shadow of their children or carers.  In this case, adult children or carers can help them remotely and physically with tasks such as getting up or going to bed, doing the laundry and setting up ICT equipment etc. as if the children or carers were resident in the house. This objective will be realised through the following SRS innovations:n1) A new intent-based remote control mechanism to enable the robots to be tele-operated over a real-world communication network robustly. 2) An adaptive automation mechanism to enable a highly efficient task execution for remotely controlled service robots. 3) A new robotic self-learning mechanism to enable the robots to learn from their experience.  4) A safety-oriented framework derived through extensive usability and user acceptance studies that enable service robots to be effectively deployed into home care applications.nThe shadow robot prototypes created with EU support in the SRS project will be tested at the 'S.Maria Nascente' Centre in Milano and the IZA Care Center in San Sebastiï¿½n. The final solution will be further developed by Hewlett-Packard and other industrial partners of the consortium for a worldwide market with significant potential and volume.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247772","fundValue":"5136039","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
