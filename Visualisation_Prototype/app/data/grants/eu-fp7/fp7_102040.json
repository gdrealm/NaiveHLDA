{"id":"102040","title":"After the Ice: Postglacial hunter-gatherer lifeways","abstractText":"'The period of rapid global warming that took place at the end of the last Ice Age in NW Europe must have posed dramatic challenges for hunter-gatherers. This project aims to integrate high-resolution records of palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental change with the remarkable and newly emerging archaeological record of postglacial sites around palaeo-Lake Flixton, (Yorkshire, UK).\nStar Carr was first excavated in the 1940/50s and has since become internationally famous in the archaeological world for its remarkable discoveries. The site had been situated on the edge of a lake and the peat which had subsequently formed allowed excellent preservation of rare organic remains, a wooden platform of �brushwood�, a wooden platform/trackway made of split and hewn timbers (the earliest evidence of systematic carpentry in Europe) and the discovery of the oldest known structure/house in Britain. Recent excavation reveal that the site is much larger than previously imagined, the excavated area to date constituting less than 5% of the total occupation area. In addition, a less well-known site on the nearby Flixton Island also has potential to provide important information on occupation and adaptation to climate change during the early phases of the postglacial.\n\nThere are 4 reasons why this site merits extensive excavation now.   1, The site is under serious risk of disappearing forever due to peat desiccation and fluctuating water table with unprecedented levels of acidity (below pH 3.0) which have seriously affected the organic remains;   2, I have assembled a strong team of interdisciplinary researchers;   3, further excavation will significantly push forward the frontiers of knowledge;  4, pilot studies demonstrate that palaeoclimatic and environmental proxy data survives and can be directly linked to human occupation episodes. It is a race against time, but here is still important and rare data to be collected from the Lake Flixton before it is too late.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"283938","fundValue":"1497780","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
