{"id":"188917","title":"Decentralised Citizens ENgagement Technologies","abstractText":"D-CENT will accelerate innovation in the use of the Internet to help communities share data and collaborate to address major societal challenges.  Despite its huge potential to transform everyday democratic decision making or to enable citizens to shape their own economic destiny, today's Internet is becoming highly centralised.nD-CENT will accelerate the development of practical alternatives, through experiments creating useful new tools for direct democracy and economic empowerment, as well as research.  It brings together world-class technological designers and academics with communities.nD-CENT will create a bottom-up, decentralised, open platform for collective awareness based on integrating already successful open-source codebases.  Its first  practical experiments will address democratic engagement, building on Europe's largest experiments in direct democracy � the Open Ministry linked into parliament in Finland, and the involvement of the whole population in shaping a new wiki-constitution in Iceland � as well as one of Europe's most dynamic social movements, in Spain.   These will show how millions of citizens can become engaged in day-to-day deliberation, and decision-making.nIts second cluster of experiments will connect these new approaches to empowerment to economic platforms.  Freecoin, a new disruptive digital social currency based on Bitcoin, will be deployed in Finland, Iceland and Spain to encourage the sharing economy and to extend, scale and link up community currencies.  Our aim is that these tools will then be spread to currencies currently being implemented in France, the Netherlands, and the UK, creating the building blocks for an economy that links exchange to trust, deliberation, and collective awareness.nD-CENT will provide civil society with immediately useable digital tools for social innovation and sustainability.  But it will also grow longer-term alternatives to today's highly centralised platforms and power structures.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"610349","fundValue":"2543071","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
