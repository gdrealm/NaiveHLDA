{"id":"110470","title":"Development of hemodynamic solutions in Renal Dialysis Venous Access Failure","abstractText":"'The ReDVA project proposes to perform a joint industry-academia research programme to overcome the scientific and technical barriers to the understanding, development and adoption of technologies to combat the significant clinical problem of the failure of renal dialysis venous access. The partnership will capitalise on the exchange of complementary inter-disciplinary knowledge and expertise between research intensive industrial partners and leading academic research centres in Renal Medicine, Vascular Biology, Vascular Surgery, Medical Physics, Clinical Imaging, (CT,MRI and Ultrasound), Imaging Contrast Media, and Computational Fluid Dynamics. This collaboration brings together the translational aspects of vascular biology, physics, applied medical physics, engineering, and clinical trials The translational approach is targeted at developing vascular surgical, medical therapeutic and medical device strategies to improve the performance and longevity of renal dialysis venous access which underpins the life supporting haemodialysis techniques used in patients with kidney failure and renal replacement programmes. Through active and ongoing knowledge transfer the partners anticipate that this synergistic and intra-sectoral multi-disciplinary research partnership will create significant momentum, enduring relationships, visionary researchers and a roadmap towards significant European market share, as well as delivering on truly excellent scientific objectives.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"324487","fundValue":"2635228.47","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
