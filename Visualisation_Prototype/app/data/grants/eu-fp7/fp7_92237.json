{"id":"92237","title":"International sensor development network","abstractText":"'This ITN project will train young investigators to enable them make significant advances in the field of in situ sensor technology. It will bring together 15 research groups and 2 industrial partners from across the European Union. The ITN will provide training for 16 PhD students, early stage researchers (ESRs) and 1 Postdoctoral student, experienced researcher (ER). The programme will combine the strengths of the leading marine and engineering research groups in the EU, and through a structured and extensive programme of collaboration and student exchange, will provide a powerful, cohesive marine sensor development programme. Fundamentally, the outcome of this ITN will be to equip Europe with a network of young scientist/engineers, who will share a common technical culture and approach, and who will ultimately enable the monitoring of our fragile yet rapidly changing marine environment.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"237868","fundValue":"3751495.77","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
