{"id":"88671","title":"Prediction of protein flexibility and its role in protein-protein interactions and binding specificity","abstractText":"'Recent studies show that protein function is not only determined by the static folded three-dimensional structure, but also by the distribution of the populations of its conformational sub-states within different environments. A detailed investigation of interacting protein interfaces requires - beyond the knowledge of their structure - information about their flexibility and the range of accessible conformations of the native state and complexed states. Additionally, successful protein structure prediction has demonstrated the suitability of �building blocks� (prototype fragments) as embodiment of local biological and physicochemical features. It is expected that the overall dynamics of protein structures can similarly be assembled from fragment flexibilities embedded in a known protein fold. Therefore this proposal focuses on developing a fast fragment-based method to predict the dynamics of a native or designed protein structure, which will be used to determine or define function in interaction networks and binding specificity in protein-ligand complexes. Specifically, the dynamics of prototypical fragments from a representative protein set will be sampled by molecular simulations; a flexibility predictor will be designed, implemented using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and trained on dynamic profiles of the prototypical fragments; by using the flexibility predictor protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions will be investigated. For protein-protein interactions the flexibility of all known high-resolution protein structures will be predicted and made publicly available. To study flexibility as determinant of ligand-binding specificity, comparisons between the conformational sub-space of protein-ligand complexes and the space of all accessible conformations of the unbound components will be performed.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"220256","fundValue":"161225.98","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
