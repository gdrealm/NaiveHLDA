{"id":"102565","title":"The public health implications of neoliberal policy and management on professions and vulnerable populations","abstractText":"'This project will explore the impact of global fiscal changes on social work practice and interventions to develop best practice models. The project focus is on the impact of neoliberalism on social work in the partner countries. Neoliberalism for this study refers to international economic frameworks that support social, cultural and political policies and practices that promote the management of services through these frameworks.\n\nThe aim of the project is to collect data on the current delivery, training and policy in the six partner countries in order to transfer knowledge and develop best practice frameworks. The consortium will use the knowledge exchange embedded in the project to provide an analysis of the different social work policies and practice in each partner country. This will then be used to create a best practice framework for teaching and delivery of social work using the core benefits identified in each partner organisation and country.\n\nThe project will be delivered through seven core work packages. Research to understand social work through training and in practice in each of the consortium organisations and their countries as a whole forms the basis of this project. Exchanging knowledge and expertise across the consortium through teaching workshops, collaborative working and first-hand experience of social work in each country.\n\nThe consortium partners are wide-ranging geographically and in experience (U.K, Finland, Italy, South Africa, India and Russia) this diverse expertise is the catalyst to bring together current policies and draw together best practice. The varied host country backgrounds and current financial status make these partners ideal for effective knowledge sharing and the development of new global social work best practice models.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"295203","fundValue":"220200","fundStart":"2012-03-24","fundEnd":"2015-03-23","dataset":"fp7"}
