{"id":"110622","title":"ACCRETING BLACK HOLES AND COSMIC FEEDBACK","abstractText":"'The black hole at the centre of every massive galaxy bulge appears to\nplay a controlling role in the final stellar mass of that bulge. This\nis especially true for the most massive galaxies at the centres of\ncool core clusters where X-ray observations clearly show energy being\nfed back into the surrounding gas which would otherwise cool and form\nmore stars at high rates. Although the total energy budget for this\nphenomenon is clear, the details by which the processes operate are\nnot. This proposal aims to further our understanding of how accreting\nblack holes generate and feed back energy into the surrounding gas,\nhow it is dissipated and establishes a heating / cooling balance and\nhow the black hole, galaxy and feedback co-evolve. The work will focus\non the broad iron line and X-ray reflection spectral and reverberation\ncomponents which we have discovered in the spectra of accreting black\nholes, on X-ray imaging spectroscopy of cool core clusters of galaxies\nand on the filamentary nebulosity commonly observed around the central\ngalaxy in such clusters.  The work will involve X-ray observations\ntogether with data from other wavebands where relevant. We shall also\nconsider theoretical aspects of the problem and  interpret\nthe whole phenomenon. The current X-ray telescopes (Chandra, XMM and\nSuzaku) are now mature and we understand how to use them optimally,\nparticularly with longer exposures.  Major new data are coming from\nNuSTAR (launched 2012), which is now opening up the hard X-ray band,\nand from ASTRO-H (to be launched 2014) which will open up the iron-K\nband to high spectral resolution and thus direct measurement of the\nvelocity field of the hot and cold components of AGN Feedback.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"340442","fundValue":"2498064","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
