{"id":"95837","title":"\"SCIENCE-POLICY INTERFACES FOR BIODIVERSITY: RESEARCH, ACTION, AND LEARNING\"","abstractText":"'SPIRAL aims to enhance the connectivity between biodiversity research and policy making. Although conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity are fundamental requisites of human well-being, the biodiversity issue raises unprecedented challenges regarding science-policy interfaces. The project proposes state of the art interdisciplinary research on science-policy interfaces for sustainability governance at the theoretical, methodological and practical levels. This will support the design, implementation and operation of the 'real-life' institutional designs that are currently emerging to interface biodiversity research and sustainability policy. The project will also provide an opportunity for the main actual or potential policy actors and stakeholders in biodiversity science-policy interfaces to learn, share experiences and network. SPIRAL will deliver a series of practical products for the benefit of users involved in interfaces, including workshops, networking opportunities, handbooks, policy briefs, targeted synthetic reports, an internet pilot platform, and a dedicated website. Overall this will allow scientists, policy-makers and other stakeholders to capitalise on a better understanding of science-policy interfaces and implement better practices.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"244035","fundValue":"1737134","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
