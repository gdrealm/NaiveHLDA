{"id":"186988","title":"A European Maritime e-Compliance Cooperation Model","abstractText":"e-Compliance will build upon strengths created across numerous EU projects in order to facilitate tighter integration and co-operation in the fragmented field of regulatory compliance in the maritime domain. Regulations are created by numerous different bodies, with little co-operation between them. As such, there is a significant lack of cohesion between the vast array of regulations and the possibility of conflicting regulations is very real. By creating a model for managing regulations digitally and creating services for all the different stakeholders, e-Compliance can harmonize these regulations and allow for co-operation between the different stakeholder groups. Not only will this improve the quality of regulations, but it will also reduce the burden for those having to enforce the regulations as well as those who must comply, resulting in a regulatory regime that is more effectively implemented. e-Compliance will also develop capabilities to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the current active regulations and allow preparation for regulations that will take effect in the future.\n\n","grantUrl":"","grantId":"321606","fundValue":"4404956","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
