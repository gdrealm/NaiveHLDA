{"id":"101336","title":"ADenoViruses as novel clinical treatments","abstractText":"'ADVance  is designed to integrate 8 leading academic centres and 4 private companies under a single umbrella to create an opportunity to train young scientists in adenovirus (AdV) research. Our full partners and industrial partners represent internationally leading academic centres of excellence in key facets of research into the basic biology of AdV and their application as vectors for clinical protocols in cancer, cardiovascular disease and vaccination that is unique as a training opportunity. Our academic and private sector full partners represent a key areas critical to improved understanding of adenovirus biology and development of key underpinning technology for translational AdV research at the highest level and will create a training opportunity of the highest calibre. The training components are further complemented by our associated partners EASCO that will integrate into ADVance a broad interdisciplinary training and dissemination program. This will ensure the very best training in scientific and key non-scientific skills for each recruited ESRs and ERs. We have also recruited Glen Nemerow as a visiting researcher for his depth of understanding and experience in AdV research over many years. ESR will benefit extensively from the complementarity between the host institutes and strength in depth in training for future careers as well as elevated long term research links for host institutes and companies in the longer term. The network research training is based on a group of well defined and highly innovative research projects applying state-of-the-art methodologies.  ADVance will allow lasting collaborations between partners, with and extensive plan of inter-partners secondments of ESR/ERs, which will and create a critical mass of focused adenovirus biologists and translationnal scientists and allow our recruited young researchers to start an excellent career in this field'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"290002","fundValue":"3861450","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
