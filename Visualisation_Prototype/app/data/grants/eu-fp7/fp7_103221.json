{"id":"103221","title":"Do nutritionally poor environments promote sociality? Testing a long-standing hypothesis in two socially plastic insect groups","abstractText":"'Why individuals cooperate is an evolutionary puzzle.  One longstanding\ntheory is that nutritionally poor environments reduce individualsï¿½\nchances of breeding independently, forcing cooperation with other\nindividuals. The proposed project will focus on testing this in the\nfield, using socially plastic species - insects that can be social or\nsolitary: Acacia thrips (Thysanoptera) and Halictine bees\n(Hymenoptera). Working with Stephen Simpson at the University of\nSydney, a pioneer in nutritional approaches to ecological questions,\nand Jeremy Field, at the University of Sussex, a world leader in\nsocial evolution research, in field populations of both insect groups\nI will test firstly whether social behaviour occurs more often on\nnutritionally imbalanced food plants, and secondly whether\nexperimentally imbalancing the nutritional composition of food causes\npreviously independent breeders to decide instead to cooperate.  If\nsuccessful, this will open up a paradigm that has been theorized but\nnever rigorously tested, representing a major contribution to social\nbiology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"299506","fundValue":"282786.9","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
