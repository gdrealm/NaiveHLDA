The focal\npoint of the program is the career development of the individual fellows.The\nprogramme is characterised by transparency and openness, granting the fellow\nfreedom to choose the research project, host organisation and host supervisor.\nGuided by a personal career development plan, a one -to-one mentoring\nprogramme and reintegration opportunities. CF provides a\ncomprehensive program of support for the fellow to embark on a long -term\nscientific career responsive to changing market needs.
