{"id":"105268","title":"Crossing Boundaries: Knowledge and Technology Transfer and Innovation","abstractText":"'CrossingBoundaries aims to develop, through a programme of staff exchange, a new international & multi-disciplinary research community working in exploring the processes, challenges & implications on innovation performance of knowledge & technology transfer across national boundaries.\nThis research community will focus particularly in addressing five research questions:\n1.\tWho are the actors involved in the process of knowledge & technology transfer for the purposes of innovation across national boundaries?\n2.\tWhat are the processes of knowledge & technology transfer across national boundaries & how do these differ according to the actors involved?\n3.\tHow do contextual factors (such as institutional divergence, cultural differences & geographic distance) influence the processes of knowledge & technology transfer across national boundaries?\n4.\tHow do organisational factors (such as technological capabilities, & the absorptive capacity of the firm) influence the processes of knowledge & technology transfer across national boundaries?\n5.\tWhat are the implications for policy & policy transfer for innovation?\nThe programme will contribute in the development of theoretical constructs in addressing the five research questions above, & provide an evidence base drawn from the experience of the countries involved in CrossingBoundaries that could be used to inform future research & policy. The proposed project will also develop country case studies that explore specific aspects (territorial, organisational and policy) aspects of these issues.\nAn important aim of the programme is to create an enduring partnership and future collaborative research. This will be achieved in two ways. Firstly, the development of cross institutional doctoral supervision partnerships that will develop new researchers (augmenting the research community). Secondly, the involvement of the partner institutionï¿½s research and international officers in the programme of exchanges.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"318928","fundValue":"194300","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
