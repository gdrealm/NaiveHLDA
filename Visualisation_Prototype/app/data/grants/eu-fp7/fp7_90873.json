{"id":"90873","title":"SUBCOMPONENT SELF-ASSEMBLY AS A ROUTE TO NEW STRUCTURES AND MATERIALS","abstractText":"'In the following proposal, we will investigate new means of creating complex structures and materials using subcomponent self-assembly. In the first part, we ask fundamental questions about how structural complexity, including topological complexity, may be created using self-assembly. In the second part, we propose to synthesize a series of metal-containing oligomeric and polymeric species. The properties of these oligomers will be studied, to see if the polymers generated using the same methodology might be of use as conductive molecular wires.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"221238","fundValue":"175472","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
