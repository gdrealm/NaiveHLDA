{"id":"90285","title":"Radio technologies for short range gigabit wireless","abstractText":"The GigaRadio IAPP will establish a partnership between Infineon Technologies Austria AG (IFAT), the Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT) at Queenï¿½s University Belfast (QUB) and DecaWave. ECIT is a cross-disciplinary research institute and incorporates a globally recognised research group in microwave and millimetre wave technology. Infineon is a top 10 vertically integrated semiconductor company. DecaWave is a fabless semiconductor SME that is developing semiconductor solutions for short range wireless communications. The GigaRadio project will undertake research into technologies for wireless high speed data transfer between devices at 60GHz. Each of the project participants has complementary capability within different elements of wireless transceiver design. ECIT is a recognised leader in microwave front-end circuit design and antenna design. Infineon is a recognised pioneer in novel semiconductor materials, devices and packaging for wireless communications. DecaWave has extensive knowledge of the baseband and MAC architectures of short range wireless communication systems and is an active participant in the standards activity for 60GHz Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs). The combined capability of the participants represents significant synergy in the field of 60GHz transceiver design and this will be reinforced through the secondments of staff between the industrial and academic partners. The research and development activities will deliver novel front-end technologies which will be commercialised by the industrial partners. These technologies will enable the widespread adoption of high data rate communication at 60 GHz and with an initial application focus on domestic distribution of uncompressed High Definition (HD) video content.The key technical output from GigaRadio will be a pre-commercial 60GHz transceiver system demonstrating short range communication at 3Gbps.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"230652","fundValue":"1305749","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
