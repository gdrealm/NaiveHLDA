{"id":"100628","title":"The Earliest Commentaries on Paul as Sources for the Biblical Text","abstractText":"'This project will develop a new approach to the textual history of the Pauline Epistles by exploring the biblical text of the earliest commentaries in Greek and Latin. Each author's treatment of their source gives insights into their compositional practices, their attitudes to the Bible and the differing versions of the New Testament known to them. Detailed verbal analysis of the quotations will identify the form of text originally used and situate it within the wider textual tradition. Studying the subsequent transmission of these commentaries in their manuscripts and in other writers will reveal how they were altered or adapted to bring them into agreement with later textual norms and practices. It will also show the development of a hierarchy of authority, first for the biblical and then for the authorial text. The methodology pioneered by the project offers a new paradigm for using biblical quotations and Christian writers to reconstruct early forms of the New Testament text.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"283302","fundValue":"1499233","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
