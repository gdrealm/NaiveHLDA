{"id":"105059","title":"European Doctorate in Image Sensors with Optical Nanotechnology at Glasgow and Awaiba","abstractText":"'Digital cameras designed with CMOS image sensors are one of the fastest growing sectors of the consumer electronics market. With increasing number of pixels and improving image quality, they have found applications in a range of systems from mobile handsets to space observatories. Despite this growth, they still suffer from limited dynamic range and poor colour discrimination abilities. Furthermore, increasing number of pixels have led to increasing power dissipation in these sensors. This project would train early stage researchers in the design of image sensors utilising optical nanotechnology, in particular plasmonic filters. These filters would help improve the colour response of the next generation of sensors. More importantly, the project would also develop a large format high intensity imager, which would be useful for improved radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer. The network would provide training and research opportunity to ESRs in an academic, industrial as well as clinical environment.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"317497","fundValue":"1467957","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
