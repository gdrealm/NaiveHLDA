{"id":"91208","title":"Religion in selected writings of Voltaire","abstractText":"'The main objective of this project is to contribute to the definitive publication and diffusion of the work of Voltaire (1694-1778). His vast output has only been partially edited according to strict philological and critical principles, and often only the most famous works have been studied in any depth. A complete knowledge of all of Voltaire�s works would be of the utmost importance in spreading, upon strict and uniform philological criteria, the complex thought of a philosopher: an overall study of these works will furnish a clear and complete picture of the development of Voltaire�s ideas about religion, particularly with regard to the Jewish religion. My work will therefore highlight the links between Voltaire&apos;s anti-judaic texts and the rest of his work, using the Jewish religion as a connecting thread. I will work as a fully integrated member of the academic team preparing the �uvres compl�tes de Voltaire / Complete works of Voltaire for publication. This team aims to produce the first ever complete and fully scientific edition of the writings of Voltaire. In detail, I will myself edit the Sermon du Rabbin Akib (1761), Cat�chisme de l�honn�te home (1763), Les derni�res paroles d�Epict�te (1766), Note sur les juifs (1760s), Fragment sur les juifs (1760s) and Lettre sur le Messie (1760s), and I will assist with other Voltaire works regarding Jewish religion. This project will immeasurably deepen our understanding of Voltaire as a writer and thinker. As part of a long-standing endeavour to re-edit and thus make available Voltaire�s writings to a worldwide audience, my proposed study will illuminate an area of European Enlightenment thought which will be of significance to all scholars working in this area.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235472","fundValue":"164269.69","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
