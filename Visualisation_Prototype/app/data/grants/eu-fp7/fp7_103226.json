{"id":"103226","title":"Integrated Single-photon Sources in Silicon","abstractText":"'The breakthrough field of quantum information science seeks to manipulate and control quantum mechanical phenomena to enable us to realise revolutionary technologies such as ultraprecise measurement, and quantum computing and simulation. However in the highly promising optical implementation of these technologies there is a severe limitation that hampers research: there are no scalable sources that can produce single-photons on command.\n\nThe science goal of this proposal is to create a deterministic source of single-photons for applications in quantum information processing. We will develop an integrated silicon and laser-written waveguide photonic-chip platform that provides a scalable solution to the problem of single-photon generation. Modern silicon-photonic manufacturing platforms will enable us to create a photon-pair generation and wavelength filtering system in a single chip. Many of these probabilistic sources are arranged in an array so that detection, feedforward and routing can deliver single photons to an output with very high certainty. The performance of our completed source will be benchmarked in landmark quantum metrology  and measurement based computing experiments and in the future our system will find applications in commercial areas such as quantum cryptography and more fundamental fields of research such as optical quantum computing.\n\nThis fellowship will enable an academic with an outstanding track record in waveguide physics and single-photon source research to join a world leading group in optical quantum science. The prospective fellow brings with them many collaborative links and 8 years of research gained in a leading Australian universitiesï¿½ research consortium. This project will result in the exchange of knowledge and expertise through its innovative research program, and will be the seed for new avenues of cooperation between EU and Australian research institutions.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300353","fundValue":"270145.8","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
