{"id":"96262","title":"Biological interaction and the intermittent character of Evolution","abstractText":"'The objective of BioInteraction is to gain mathematical insights on the intermittent process of biological evolution, where periods of ecological stability are punctured by brief phases in which the biological system readjusts by eliminating networks of species and generating new ones. BioInteraction will confront such process from the perspective of statistical physics, the branch of science that yielding the most advanced tools for linking individual-level interaction to complex aggregate phenomena. Darwin�s insights regarding the interplay between the everyday interacting ecology and long-term evolution have received relatively little attention due to the great complexity involved in such process. The increasingly globalised nature of our world, however, is revealing that an understanding of systems comprising many interacting agents is a result that needs to be delivered by research if some of the most important issues facing us from an environmental, energetic and social point of view are to be met. Within this Project the fellow will start from a successful interacting framework for the mathematical study of evolution which has been developed by the host (the Tangled Nature model), in order to probe ways of characterizing evolution by observable quantities, as well as by studying in depth the process of information feedback between individual genotypes and phenotypes. For the fellow the biological nature of the Project will represent a definite paradigm shift with respect to his background in the study of social systems: the common substrate of statistical physics, however, will allow him to build a personal and independent contribution, while acquiring a wealth of new skills. Such valuable scientific cross-fertilization will add to the Project�s opportunity of securing a scientific bond between two important European regions (UK and Italy) which the fellow has been carefully setting up through the course of his career.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251947","fundValue":"165540.8","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
