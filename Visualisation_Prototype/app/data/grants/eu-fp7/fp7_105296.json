{"id":"105296","title":"Enhanced Network Security for Seamless Service Provisioning in the Smart Mobile Ecosystem","abstractText":"The goal of NEMESYS is to research and develop novel security technologies for seamless service provisioning in the smart mobile ecosystem. Mobile and smartphone security is a fast moving field, where new vulnerabilities and resulting attacks need to be detected and analyzed as fast as possible. The attacker is always a step ahead, managing to obtain vast amounts of information by hacking computers and committing other forms of cybercrime, resulting in a billion dollar business which increases exponentially with more than 1 billion Internet users today. It is now evident that, in order to advance in the field of cyber security and counter these cyber attacks, we must become proactive and work on predicting threats and vulnerabilities to build our defense before threats materialize, rather than chase after attackers without ever being able to catch up. Thus NEMESYS will gather and analyse information about the nature of cyber attacks targeting smart mobile devices, so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken to combat them. These vulnerabilities are due to the heterogeneity of wireless interfaces, supported platforms and offered services, and we will adopt the honeypot scheme for the main types of smart phones and devices. We will develop an infrastructure to gather, detect and provide early warning of attacks on mobile devices and, eventually, understand the modus operandi of cyber-criminals that target mobile devices. By correlating the extracted information with the known patterns of attacks extracted from wireline networks, we plan reveal and identify the possible shift in the way that cyber-criminals launch attacks against smart mobile devices.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"317888","fundValue":"3839421","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
