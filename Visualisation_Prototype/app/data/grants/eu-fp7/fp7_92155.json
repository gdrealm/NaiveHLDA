{"id":"92155","title":"Sustainable ecosystem services and livelihoods through aquaculture development","abstractText":"'The inter-disciplinary project �Sustainable ECOsystem services and LIVelihoods through Aquaculture development� (ECOLIVA) aims to examine the links between ecosystem services, sustainable livelihoods and production of aquatic commodities, using the case of shrimp farming in Thai mangrove ecosystems. This project, implemented as an Intra-European Fellowship hosted by York University, UK, will enable the applicant to broaden her existing experience of agricultural economics and aquaculture development with ecological and environmental economic approaches. Her training in the application of material flow analyses and environmental valuation techniques will be complemented by the development of novel methods of investigation applied to the evaluation of environmental degradation from aquatic production and socio-economic impacts resulting from variations in ecosystem services provision. Expertise and formal academic training from the host will widen her research remit and provide her with the necessary skills to resume an academic career. The project will increase European research capacity in applied ecological/environmental economics and modelling, and facilitate joint environmental conservation and livelihood improvements through sustainable aquaculture development. In the short-term, the applicant will strengthen her research potential enabling her to reach her immediate career objective: an academic research position. Project outputs will also indirectly contribute to the Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, and Biotechnology Theme of the FP7 Cooperation Work Programme and the creation of a European �Knowledge-based bio-economy�. In the medium to long terms, addressing knowledge gaps related to the implementation of payments for ecosystem services for aquatic and global sustainable development will strengthen European research in this upcoming field and boost its visibility and competitive advantage amongst other research and development institutions worldwide.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235835","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
