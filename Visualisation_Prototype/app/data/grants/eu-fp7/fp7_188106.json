{"id":"188106","title":"\"Value based entrepreneurship: A study of the cultural, organizing and leadership dynamics of social entrepreneurship\"","abstractText":"'The proposed study aims to facilitate the development, sharing and transfer of knowledge on the organizing and leadership practices of social ecopreneurs in Poland and the UK. Many fundamental structural and moral foundations of social life are eroding. Social entrepreneurship and activism may provide the much needed thrust for change. Self-organization and social entrepreneurship are on the verge of becoming a massive global phenomenon, which highlights a need for in-depth research into their organizing, leadership and ethical processes and practices. The project aims to examine and propose new ways of theorizing leadership and organizing within the context of value-based ecopreneurship and leadership. The research objectives take on a sharp focus in todayï¿½s society because of the challenge social ecopreneurs play in creating viable organizations with a social mission to create and maintain sustainable communities that support well-being. Tasks, relationships and accountability are less clear than in business organizations and require a deeper, more nuanced understanding of leadership and organizing processes. Ethical leadership and action is integral to these community-based organizations.  This will require a longitudinal research project, based on in-depth qualitative data collection that will develop and advance theory, practice and potentially methodology. The study will explore and compare Polish and UK organizations adhering primarily to an ethical system concerned with sustainability and ecology. Such a comparison has not been done before, yet is apposite because of cultural, economic and organizational differences. Comparing the value-based organizing and leadership activities in different cultural contexts will provide data for ecopreneurs, who are beginning to organize internationally, educators now developing courses on global organizing and leadership, and policy makers involved in establishing conditions to facilitate international cooperation.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"627429","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
