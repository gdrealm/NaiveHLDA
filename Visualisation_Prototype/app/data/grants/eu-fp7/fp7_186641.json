{"id":"186641","title":"\"Gold(I)-Containing Metallopolymers: Synthesis, Self-assembly, and Applications\"","abstractText":"'The incorporation of metal centers into polymers represents a promising approach to various new advanced materials. A wide range of metallopolymers containing different metals have been developed and studied. However, soluble, high molecular weight gold(I)-containing metallopolymers and their potential applications are virtually unexplored, although molecular gold(I) complexes have been extensively investigated over the past two decades and have shown promising applications in self-assembly, sensing, light-emission, catalysis, and biomedicine. The planned work in this proposal includes three aspects: (i) design and synthesis of three different types of gold(I) metallopolymers, (ii) investigation of the self-assembly of the gold(I) metallopolymers, and (iii) studies on sensing and light-emitting applications.\n\nDr. He brings with him his extensive and detailed knowledge of gold chemistry and luminescent gold materials obtained during his Ph.D and postdoctoral research. By working on this project in the Ian Manners lab at Bristol, in the UK, Dr. He will become an expert in the field of metallopolymer-related materials research. Thus, the complementary and essential expertise of Dr. He and Prof. Mannersï¿½ group will allow the proposed project to succeed. The experience will be of great benefit to the future independent academic career that Dr. He intends to take up at the end of the 2 year fellowship.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"628938","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-11-10","fundEnd":"2016-11-09","dataset":"fp7"}
