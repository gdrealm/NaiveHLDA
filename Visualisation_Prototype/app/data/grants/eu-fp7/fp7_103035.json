{"id":"103035","title":"Measuring Magnetic Monopoles Using Quantum Metrology in Diamond","abstractText":"'This proposal seeks to develop state of the art quantum metrology in diamond to probe a magnetic monopoles in spin ice. It will accomplish this by establishing an interdisciplinary collaboration between two world-leading groups, the Yacoby group at Harvard and the Bramwell group at the London Centre for Nanotechnology at University College London. Since the Harvard group purchases the diamond samples commercially, and this fellowship will allow the transfer of their expertise, it offers a particularly sustainable route to the permanent integration of the knowledge in the EU. The results of this fellowship promise to be extremely intersting from both a fundamental and technological perspective, and it is expected to lead to several high profile publications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"302902","fundValue":"271943.7","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
