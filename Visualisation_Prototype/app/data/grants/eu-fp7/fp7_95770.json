{"id":"95770","title":"C4 photosynthesis transcriptomics","abstractText":"'C4 photosynthesis concentrates CO2 around RuBisCO and so increases the efficiency of photosynthesis. In the vast majority of C4 species the biochemistry of photosynthesis, and also the cell biology and development of leaves is altered. Despite these complex changes, the C4 pathway has evolved at least 45 times independently. Because C4 photosynthesis is more efficient in C4 plants, it has been proposed that engineering the C4 pathway into C3 crops such as rice would be beneficial for productivity. For this to be feasible, we need a better understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying C4 photosynthesis. I aim to investigate mechanisms generating cell specific gene expression in C4 plants, and will use C. gynandra, the most closely related C4 species to the C3 model Arabidopsis. I will generate comprehensive profiles of transcript abundance in mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath (BS) cells using laser capture microdissection and Illumina sequencing. I will also generate knock-down lines of C. gynandra for 20 transcription factors that we have identified as candidates for maintaining patterns of gene expression required for C4 photosynthesis. The project will significantly increase our understanding of basic mechanisms underlying C4 photosynthesis, and therefore may facilitate introduction of C4 traits in C3 crops.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253189","fundValue":"179603.2","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
