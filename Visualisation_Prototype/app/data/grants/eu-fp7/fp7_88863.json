{"id":"88863","title":"European Universities in the area of Knowledge. Collaboration and networks in teaching and research","abstractText":"'The overall fellowship objectives are twofold: � First to consolidate the outcomes of the EIF research project through: - the organisation of workshops in which results will be disseminated and future collaboration possibilities will be discussed. Organised at the University of Sheffield, where the fellow has been offered a permanent appointment as lecturer in Higher Education and Lifelong Learning, these workshops will involve a number of participants in the EIF EUROTAC project, researchers in the field, representatives from policy bodies operating in the higher education (HE) policy sector and colleagues from the EIF host institution (i.e. University of Oxford). It is hoped that the workshop will be instrumental in providing fieldwork sites for the two projects to initiate during the three-year fellowship; � Second to build on the EUROTAC project which mainly focused on the topic of Joint Masters programmes as a collaborative response to the Bologna Process and other convergence agendas in Europe by: a- using part of the ERG grant as seed-corn funding to initiate a research project on interdisciplinary collaboration, with a particular focus on international capacity building initiatives in interdisciplinary fields involving the social sciences; b- exploring the feasibility of a comparative and longitudinal project on inter-institutional academic and research collaboration in Europe and prepare research proposals for substantial funding (i.e. ERC Starting Independent Researcher Grants).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"231010","fundValue":"45000","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-30","dataset":"fp7"}
