{"id":"109866","title":"Light-Matter Coupling in composite Nano-Structures","abstractText":"'The academic exchange aims to establish and support multi-lateral transfer of knowledge among several European research teams and teams from Russia, Ukraine and Armenia, striving to advance the research on Physics of Light-Matter Coupling in Nanostructures. This programme will combine unique expertise of partners in Nonlinear Physics and Optics, Materials Science, Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Computer Science, to perform theoretical and experimental research on formation, manipulation and collective dynamics of coupled matter-field states � exciton-polaritons � in photonic crystals, atomic and semiconductor bandgap structures. New methods to produce composite materials and low-dimensional structures integrated with semiconductors will be developed, including nano-structuring of semiconductor films and granular metal films on the surface of semiconductor hetero-structures, synthesis of semiconductor materials in nano-porous dielectric matrices. Specific features of polaritonic spectra and dynamics in these structures will be studied, and the local enhancement of light-matter coupling due to nano-structures will be analyzed. New methods of manipulation of coupled matter-field states at polariton level for quantum and classical optical information processing and storage will be developed.\n\nDuring this project, several local research links already established between participating organisations will be brought together on the whole new level to form the functional research network. The complementary expertise of all the parties in this network will be crucial to tackle the cross-disciplinary scientific problems associated with studies of light-matter coupling in nano-structures. Formation of this network represents an enormous added value for the research within the individual groups and at the European level.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612600","fundValue":"248900","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
