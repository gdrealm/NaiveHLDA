The ultimate aims are: to generate wider and deeper understandings of the state of the world; to develop approachs and methods capable of spanning the current physical and intellectual divides; to use these developments to expand our capacities to meet future and critical challenges facing the world.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247555","fundValue":"366128","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
