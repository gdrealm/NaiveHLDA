{"id":"89940","title":"COordination of NANOMETrology in Europe","abstractText":"'Nanotechnology has the ability to become the most promising technology advance for the 21st Century. It offers a huge potential of applications and economic benefits, which may contribute to the European economy.  Scientifically and economically, nano-metrology is an indispensible part for nanotechnology which must develop hand in hand with the developments of nano-science and ï¿½technology.   The programme of work set out in this project will address the need within Europe to develop the required measurement frame to successfully support the development and economic exploitation of nanotechnology.  A pan-European coordinated response to the emerging needs of nanotechnology defined required from the National Metrology Institutes to provide a suitable measurement framework for the effective commercial development of nanotechnology. To address this requirement a European Strategy Plan for Nanometrology will be delivered in consultation with key stakeholders.  5 European Action Groups in Nanometrology will be implemented to address the need to put in place a process chain for the dissemination of metrology techniques as well as traceability to national standards and internationally harmonised standard methods specific to the particular nanotechnology area addressed.  Educational programmes addressing nanometrology across Europe will be reviewed, a future training needs analysis completed and recommendations for training curricula made. Training will be provided in basic nano metrology concepts as well as standardisation.  European capabilities review will be completed and a directory published. Exisitng and future requirements for large infrastructures as well as capbility gaps will be assessed. Traceability and metrology in industry will also be addressed.  This project will take input from a range of stakeholders including National Metrology Institutes, research institutes, industry, regualtory and standards bodies as well as the EC.'","grantUrl":"http://www.co-nanomet.eu","grantId":"218764","fundValue":"1500119","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
