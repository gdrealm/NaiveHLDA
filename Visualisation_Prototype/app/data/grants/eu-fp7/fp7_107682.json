{"id":"107682","title":"Polarized light from highly phosphorescent metalomesogens","abstractText":"'Phosphorescent cyclometalated transition metal complexes  are attracting continously growing attention as highly efficient emitters for organic light emitting devices (OLEDs), bioimaging, sensors, and photocatalytic reactions. To improve their performances in solid state electrical devices, it is important to ameliorate charge transporting properties of the materials by imparting some degree of order in the bulk of the materials. Furthermore, this order would open the possibility of polarized emission useful for sensors and backlights for liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Developing liquid crystalline iridium(III) complexes is a promising approach to provide order in phosphorescent organic materials.\n\nThis proposal will develop new liquid crystalline iridium(III) complexes with improved emission quantum yield in condensed phase and highly polarized emission.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329199","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2013-10-04","fundEnd":"2015-10-03","dataset":"fp7"}
