{"id":"188111","title":"Multi-biofunctional implants for in-situ cartilage regeneration for traumatic and early osteoarthritic lesions","abstractText":"'MICartRegen is a multidisciplinary and highly innovative project aimed at designing and producing a novel multi-biofunctional, cell-free prototype orthopaedic implant able to induce, stimulate and sustain self-repair of injured cartilage tissue. This implant would be used to promote the in-situ regeneration of functional articular cartilage in lesions caused by trauma and early stage osteoarthritis. The proposed implant is novel, cell-free and differs in its mode of action from other devices on the market.\nIn brief, the implant will contain a) Bioactive molecules to recruit and retain 'repair cells' (mesenchymal stem cells) from the joint fluid or released by the orthopaedic surgeon by subchondral drilling; b) Bioactive factors to promote maturation of the recruited stem cells into cartilage cells  (chondrocytes) to produce the required extracellular  matrix components. The technologies used to fabricate the prototype implant are adaptable, therefore custom fabrication of sophisticated bioactive scaffolds for different biomaterials containing various  bioactive factors would be possible\n\nThe success of the project relies on the strong background in biomaterials science, largely in bio-functionalisation and genetic activation of materials, of the candidate, combined with complimentary skills and infrastructure of the host.\nMICartRegen will also give the candidate an opportunity to be trained in new methods on biological evolution of biomaterials, and transferable skills that will greatly boost her career. Furthermore, it will help her to become an independent and experienced researcher able to plan and manage her research, disseminate the results, up to industrial exploitation, through participation in courses and cooperation with experienced scientists.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"627480","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"no date","fundEnd":"no date","dataset":"fp7"}
