{"id":"98702","title":"Bio-engineered micro Encapsulation of Active agents Delivered to Shellfish","abstractText":"'The project aims to continue with some exciting work following up a development in delivering active agents to bivalve molluscs through micro-encapsulation. The early work showed that bacteria with a potential in vitro to break down some algal toxins could be effectively delivered to the gut of the bivalve. The size and nature of the micro-capsule (bead) was shown to be key. The SMEs and Other industry partners in the consortium have assempled a group of leading researchers in the field to develop this work , further, and to look into not only active detoxification but more effective depuration using pro-biotics. The group alsp plan to investigate the use of the &apos;beads&apos; as carriers of active agents to aid an immunostimulant response against attack by the Bonamia parasite on European (flat) Oysters.'","grantUrl":"http://www.projectbeads.eu/","grantId":"262649","fundValue":"1473879.4","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
