{"id":"107101","title":"Search for New Physics in Charm at LHCb","abstractText":"'The unique capabilities of the LHCb experiment at CERN will be used to collect enormous samples of charm meson multibody decays, and then study these decays for evidence of indirect CP-violation.  Any discovery would be highly suggestive of physics contributions from beyond the Standard Model.   The analysis methods proposed are novel and are largely independent of model-based assumptions about the resonance substructure of the charm decay, hence providing robustness to the results.  The proposal also features plans to improve the trigger system of LHCb to improve still further the performance in charm physics during future data taking'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329017","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
