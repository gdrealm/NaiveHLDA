{"id":"89562","title":"The  contribution of the  exosporium of Bacillus  anthracis  to survival","abstractText":"The  exosporium  is not unique to Bacillus anthracis and is present in all members of the B.cereus group and  some clostridia.   The  function  this  complex structure plays in the survival of these spores is as yet unknown. One possibility is that it  acts as a physical barrier  passively  reacting with biocides before they have the chance to reach essential molecules located within the spore core. We propose to  determine the contribution the exosporium makes to environmental survival and biocide resistance. In addition the exosporium contributes to intracellular survival by masking inflammatory signals located in the spore coat thus  preventing  the infected macrophage from mounting a pro-inflammatory immune response.   In addition  to playing a passive role in survival we recently reported the presence of biologically active enzymes such as alanine racemase within the exosporium which prevent germination under sub-optimal conditions encountered in soil and infection.  This  is an extremely novel  concept as  the spore has long been thought of as an inert particle whoï¿½s intrinsic  resistance to environmental  insult enables it to lie dormant until conditions are conducive to growth.   In addition to regulating germination  the exosporium  contains enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and an arginase which contribute to the intracellular survival of the organism by inhibiting the activity of antibacterial radicals.  By understanding the contribution the exosporium makes to intracellular survival  we  will be able to design therapeutics which enhance the ability of the macrophage to kill the organism.  This proposal represents the continuation of a program of research initiated by the applicant while working in the U.S.  Its funding  will  enable the researcher to establish  his own research effort in the UK by building on the earlier data and will continue the links forged with US colleagues  which to date has yielded five publications.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"201284","fundValue":"75000","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
