{"id":"105757","title":"Environmentally COherent measures and interventions to debottleneck HUBS of the multimodal network favoured by seamless flow of goods","abstractText":"'ECOHUBSprovides models and capabilities for cooperation and communication between green hubsï¿½ stakeholders, plus establishing value added services making co-modal networks attractive to use and, at the same time, contributors to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants.\nThe main outputs will be:\n1.Cooperative Model for Green Hubs enabling low-carbon, resource-efficient and secure transportation services\n2.Ecosystem for electronically connecting multimodal terminal network stakeholders and amplifying their joint capabilities when using the Cooperative Model. The result will be faster communications, shared resources and synchronised actions. An important focus will be integrating information obtained from on-going transport execution (visibility  of supply  chains) into planning processes (facilitated by hub operators) to ensure the best possible environmental and economic performance.\n3.Common Value Added Services to be combined with existing services, facilitating end-to-end co-modal, low-CO2 transport solutions that maximise utilisation of terminal and logistics resources. Common services will include: a. Intermodal terminal eco-efficiency calculator; b. Integrated competitive services for managing improvements in eco-efficiency; c. Measuring and Benchmarking System to provide the means of long term monitoring of greening activities and disseminating best practices at all supply chain levels and EU regions.\n4.Four ECOHUBSDemonstrators to be used across several representative operating scenarios characteristic of modern intermodal terminals.\nSpecial attention will be given to building improved understanding of prevailing complexities and business interests and ensuring long term sustainability of project outputs and market take-up based on an inclusive Stakeholder Engagement Strategy emphasizing European wide co-operation both to promote best practices and to support further development and implementation of international standards'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"314786","fundValue":"4119646","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
