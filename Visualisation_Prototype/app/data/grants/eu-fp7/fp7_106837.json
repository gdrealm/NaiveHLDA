{"id":"106837","title":"\"Innovative, environmentally friendly nanophosphor down converter materials for enhanced solar cell efficiency that will reduce energy production costs and increase cell lifetime.\"","abstractText":"'The NanoPhoSolar project aims to overcome the limitations relating to the efficiency and performance of a range of photovoltaic (PV) systems by developing a transparent NanoPhosphor down converting material capable of absorbing Ultra Violet (UV) and short wavelength visible light and re-emitting in the more useful longer wavelength visible spectrum(range 525-850nm).\n\nThis will enable the efficiency of Photovoltaic (PV) cells to be increased by an additional 10% for silicon PV and ?25.8% for Cigs or cadmium telluride PV and potentially increase system lifetime.\n\nBy doing this, the PV system created will offer greatly improved environmental performance due to capture of a larger proportion of the incident visible spectrum.\n\nThis will lead to significant economic and societal benefits to consumers and manufacturers.\n\nThe SME consortium target a total in-process coating technology market penetration of 5.5% when applied in the manufacturing process and 0.25% when as applied to existing installed PV systems within a 5 year period post project, achieving direct annual sales of over ï¿½66 million, ~470 new jobs and annual CO2 emissions savings of 154,697 tonnes per annum.\n\nThe project results are expected to benefit other SMEs in the PV and materials processing industry sectors.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"315677","fundValue":"2445264.27","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
