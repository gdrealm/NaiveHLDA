{"id":"104226","title":"THE VIA EGNATIA: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF A EUROPEAN CULTURAL ROUTE","abstractText":"'The aim of this Fellowship is to reconstruct for the first time the late medieval and early modern Via Egnatia, one of Europeï¿½s most important cultural routes. Originally constructed by the Romans, the Via Egnatia linked the Bosporus (and hence Asia) to the Adriatic Sea (and hence Italy and western Europe). The application of multidisciplinary research and cutting-edge technologies will focus on a historical period, which has never been studied systematically. The project aims to develop our knowledge of the key role the Via Egnatia played in drawing together communities, cultures and commodities at a time of political fragmentation and transition from the Byzantine to the Ottoman Empire as the dominant power in southeastern Europe. The project will identify changes in the course of the road by applying traditional and new methodologies. The Fellow, Dr Eurydice Georganteli, will combine her already high degree of knowledge of the archaeological and written evidence with high-tech methods of geographical and environmental science and digital mapping, developed concurrently at Harvard University and the University of Birmingham. The Fellow will benefit from the outstanding research resources in the fields of geography, history, and Byzantine and Ottoman studies at Harvard University. She will be profitably trained in GIS technologies and digital mapping by contributing to the Harvard Digital Atlas of Ancient and Medieval Civilizations. The training at Harvard should enable Dr Georganteli to become an established and well-recognized researcher in the EU. The project contributes to the European Research Area by developing a collaboration between a high-level US and a European university and by promoting links among the research communities in Albania, FY Republic of Macedonia, Greece and Turkey, the four countries which share the course of the Via Egnatia.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"302429","fundValue":"377209.1","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
