{"id":"103317","title":"The European External Action Service and its diplomats: socialisation in a multinational bureaucracy","abstractText":"'One of the principal objectives of the Lisbon Treaty was to increase the coherence of the EU�s external policies by establishing the European External Action Service (EEAS). This new �functionally autonomous body� is to bring together officials from the Council Secretariat General, the European Commission and the Foreign Ministries of the member states. Because of this particular organizational arrangement, the newly emerged EEAS provides a unique opportunity to study socialization and attitude formation in a multinational administration. It comprises of officials of different nationalities, experiences, coming from different institutional background, with varied nature of employment, for example: civilian and military; nationally delegated and those delegated by the EU institutions. The project will examine socialization processes in the EEAS and, by doing so, uncover the consequences of the establishment of the EEAS in terms of attitude formation, loyalties of the officials and the potential esprit de corps of the new institution. It will employ both qualitative and quantitative methods for obtaining evidence: semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300968","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
