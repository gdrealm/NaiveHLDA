{"id":"89671","title":"Co-operative Research on Environmental Problems in Europe","abstractText":"'Overall aim: The CR�PE project will empower and resource civil society organisations (CSOs) to participate in co-operative research on agri-environmental issues, as a means to achieve these subsidiary aims:  1. Capabilities:  To strengthen CSOs� capacity to participate in research, while engaging with diverse perspectives and expertise, thus facilitating co-operation between researchers and non-researchers.   2. Co-operative research methods: To design, implement, evaluate retrospectively and thus test the methods used for co-operative research in this project, as a basis to inform future efforts.   3. Agri-environmental issues:  To analyse diverse accounts of �the environment� in relation to agricultural methods, technologies, innovations and alternatives.   4. Priority-setting:  To relate research more closely to societal needs, as a means to inform policy debate and research priorities for Europe as a �Knowledge-Based Society�. 5. Solutions:  To suggest alternative solutions related to different understandings of societal problems, agri-environmental issues and sustainable development.   A CSO partner will lead the study of a specific topic, as follows:  WP1: Agrofuel production in Europe and the global South WP2: CSO participation in agbiotech issues  WP3: Water scarcity and its virtual export from Spain to the UK WP4: Local agri-food networks and their environmental effects  Other partners will lead studies of generic agri-environmental issues: WP5: CSOs� interventions into agri-environmental research  WP6: European Research Area (ERA): agri-environmental priorities  WP7: Innovation narratives in EU-funded research  WP8: Co-operative research processes in this project   A draft Executive Summary will be presented at an EU-level workshop.    The project website will be used for several purposes: participants� networking, dissemination of results, and public comment.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"217647","fundValue":"1020893.2","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
