{"id":"89975","title":"Creative writing as a tool in second language acquisition","abstractText":"'This programme will investigate the effectiveness of creative writing as a tool for SLA (second language acquisition) teaching in different cultures and linguistic contexts, using the test cultures of Tunisia and Poland. There are five objectives: to advance current knowledge of effective SLA teaching in different linguistic and cultural contexts; to improve SLA teaching at the Jagiellonian University and the Institut Supï¿½rieur des Sciences Humaines de Tunis (ISSHT), enabling curriculum reform in the ISSHT as Tunisia expands its SLA provision, and allowing for greater integration between linguistics and literature in SLA teaching; to raise awareness of creative writing teaching methodology at Strathclyde University; to build the base for future research in SLA by creating a corpus of comparable texts written by Polish learners, Tunisian learners and native speakers; to encourage future cooperation between the partner countries and universities.  The scheme involves visits by experts in SLA from the Jagiellonian and experts in teaching creative writing from Strathclyde to the ISSHT in order to transmit specific methods of creative writing teaching and to allow for cooperation between Tunisian and Polish linguists over standardised creative writing tasks which will be suitable for inclusion in an SLA corpus. The later stages of the scheme involve visits by SLA experts from the ISSHT in Tunis to the Jagiellonian and then to Strathclyde to analyse data and share findings respectively.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"230840","fundValue":"25200","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
