{"id":"97089","title":"Inequalities on Function Spaces and Properties of Integral Operators with Applications","abstractText":"'Our investigation is in the area of functional analysis and concerns boundedness and compactness properties of mappings between function spaces, estimates and asymptotic behaviour of characteristic numbers of integral operators and also embeddings between function spaces. The expected results may be useful for solutions of a number of actual problems in neighbouring mathematical areas such as the theory of differential and integral equations, interpolation theory, harmonic analysis, probability theory, etc.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252784","fundValue":"233089.6","fundStart":"2010-08-16","fundEnd":"2012-08-15","dataset":"fp7"}
