{"id":"89953","title":"Use of Foresight to Align Research with Longer Term Policy Needs in Europe","abstractText":"'The aim of this project is to pilot the use of foresight to align strategic and applied research with longer-term policy needs in Europe. It addresses a perceived gap in alignment under present arrangements and also argues that to develop, the European system needs a more content-oriented approach. It seeks to advance knowledge on: 1) Differences across policy domains in the European Research and Innovation Ecosystem (also further articulating this concept) in terms of the role and the integration of research agendas in long-term policies and vice-versa; and 2) Appropriate foresight designs needed to get engagement and secure follow-up across policy domains/areas. The project seeks to produce immediately useful results by selecting areas and participants with a view to stimulating action. Four areas with different sectoral characteristics will be selected with the advice of an independent panel to ensure that the pilot covers a range of circumstances. Success scenario workshops will be used to engage policymakers and those responsible for research. The methodology involves consideration of key drivers and wildcards to produce a vision of success, This is compared with the ability of the research and innovation ecosystem in the area to deliver and a roadmap for change is produced. A policy conference will be used to consider the outcomes and to disseminate the approach to other policy domains.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"225662","fundValue":"282532","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
