{"id":"105135","title":"Aerospace Multidisciplinarity Enabling DEsign Optimisation","abstractText":"'AMEDEO is a multi-disciplinary design optimisation (MDO) research training network designed to provide outstanding leadership career development for talented young researchers. Network training incorporates advanced multi-disciplinary optimisation, high fidelity simulation tools and techniques for resolving complex engineering design problems in the aerospace industry. It is complemented by a comprehensive package of generic skills training and career-enhancing secondments throughout the network. The secondments, training events and focused research projects combine to offer a unique platform upon which the researchers can build rewarding and high-impact careers. There is currently an acute skills shortage in MDO and this is exacerbated by the fact that MDO is not routinely taught in universities and no single organisation has the breadth of skills needed to develop the next generation of MDO specialists. The AMEDEO network focuses on the key research training challenges of providing the EU�s aerospace industry with a new generation of MDO researchers capable of providing the radical innovations needed to improve the energy efficiency and reduce emissions from aircraft, at reduced timescales and costs.\n\nThe importance and timeliness of training a new generation of researchers in MDO for the aerospace industry is clearly stated in the recent EU Flightpath 2050 document which describes its strategic importance to preserving Europe�s lead in an increasingly competitive international industry that makes an annual  EURO 220 billion contribution to the EU economy and provides 4.5 million jobs. Strong private sector involvement in the network, from both SMEs and global aerospace industry leaders, demonstrates the commitment of Europe's leading aerospace companies to the AMEDEO network and to its ability to form an excellent example of the type of enduring technological, scientific and industrial leadership cluster that has been called for in the Flightpath 2050 document.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"316394","fundValue":"3621872","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
