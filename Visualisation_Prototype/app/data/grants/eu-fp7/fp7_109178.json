{"id":"109178","title":"MAGnetic Innovation in Catalysis","abstractText":"'The aim of the MAGIC Innovative Doctoral Programme is to train the future generation of leading investigators of biological catalysis/enzymology with a view to developing new enabling technologies that can advance physical understanding of catalysis and mechanism. Recent research has shown that enzyme catalysts exploit the coupling of motions to the reaction coordinate and employ classical and quantum effects (e.g. tunneling) in their reaction cycles. Roles for quantum entanglement and spin chemistry are also suggested. Prompted by these discoveries, many groups are currently focusing their research on this field, and this offers great career opportunities. The aim is to understand the physical and chemical basis of enzyme catalysis and exploit this information in predictive design, thereby underpinning the exploitation of enzyme catalysts in industrial biotechnology, manufacture and diagnostics. This creates a need for outstanding young scientists to pursue collaborative research projects in which the mechanistic details of enzyme systems can be explored using new experimental capabilities to probe the contributions of motions across multiple spatial and temporal timescales and quantum chemical effects. The projects will be based upon innovative, versatile and unique experimental techniques. These are based on the physics of magnetic resonance derived from original concepts of the participating senior scientists. These new methods will transform current experimental capabilities and will be applied to a range of important biological catalysts to probe the mechanistic importance of coupled motions and quantum physico-chemical effects.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"606831","fundValue":"3523100.68","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
