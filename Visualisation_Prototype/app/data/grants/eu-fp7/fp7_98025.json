{"id":"98025","title":"Advanced Turbofan-Equipped Aircraft Noise Model","abstractText":"'The aim of this project is to adapt, improve validate and test a computer model for the simulation of aircraft noise. The project starts from a well-established basis of a multi-disciplinany computer model that includes flight mechanics, aerodynamics, gas turbine engine performance, numerical modelling, optimisation, aircraft operations, and aircraft noise. The latter discipline also includes wave propagation and diffusion. The goals are: 1.) To produce a state-of-the-art noise and emission software. 2.) To validate and test the software with agreed benchmark cases. 3.) To provide training on the software and on aircraft noise. 4.) To provide technical support beyond the duration of the project. The work programme includes the following main tasks: 1.) Review of requirements and systems compatibility. 2.) Software upgrades in a number of key areas of propulsion and airframe noise. 3.) Generation of databases (airplanes, turbofan engines and topographical information). 4.) Validation and Testing. 5.) Documentation, Training and Technical Support.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255750","fundValue":"329924.4","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
