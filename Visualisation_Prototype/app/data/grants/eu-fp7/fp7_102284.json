{"id":"102284","title":"The integration of intermediate pyrolysis and vapour gasification to create and effective and efficient biomass-to-energy system for combined heat and power","abstractText":"'The use of biomass, and waste, as a fuel for the production of energy in the form of electrical power and heat has in recent years come to be recognised as a key element in the move to sustainable forms of energy as part of the strategy to combat climate change. Throughout Europe, challenging targets for the provision of bioenergy and reduction in carbon emissions have been identified but progress towards those targets is extremely slow.\n\nThus, to enable a concerted, informed, and joint development this project brings together a leading European Bioenergy Research institute (EBRI) that has new key patents in the clean and efficient thermal treatment of biomass based on the Intermediate Pyrolysis process, with two European SME companies recognised for their respective technical and engineering expertise in the provision of thermal  treatment plant (WGD) and gasifier technology (WWAG) respectively.  A Demonstration installation has recently been approved for funding at EBRI which not only gives significant added value (ï¿½15M) in terms of the stand alone technology installations but, more importantly, provides a unique opportunity to integrate the pyrolysis and gasification processes to produce a cost efficient flexible,optimised, linear process for power and heat production from biomass and waste.\n\nThe aim of the programme is therefore, through a programme of laboratory and demonstration scale testing, to fully integrate the intermediate pyrolysis and gasification processes to form the PYROGAS concept for power and heat from biomass, and to demonstrate its successful operation on a range of feedstocks.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"286244","fundValue":"1082575","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
