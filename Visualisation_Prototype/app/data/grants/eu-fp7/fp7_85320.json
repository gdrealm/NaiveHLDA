{"id":"85320","title":"Supporting Highly Adaptive Network Enterprise Collaboration Through semantically enabled knowledge services","abstractText":"The next phase of enterprise interoperability is the sharing of knowledge within a Virtual Organisation (VO) to the mutual benefit of all VO partners. Such knowledge will be a driver for new enhanced collaborative enterprises, able to achieve the global visions of enterprise interoperability. The SYNERGY project envisages the delivery of Collaboration Knowledge services through trusted third parties offering web-based, pay on demand services, exploitable through interoperability service utilities (ISUs). The overall aim of SYNERGY is to enhance support of the networked enterprise in the successful, timely creation of, and participation in collaborative VOs by providing an infrastructure and services to discover, capture, deliver and apply knowledge relevant to collaboration creation and operation. Specifically SYNERGY aims to (a) provide semantic ontology-based modelling of knowledge structures on collaborative working; (b) develop the service-oriented self-adaptive SYNERGY holistic solution for knowledge-based collaboration services; and (c) facilitate the testing and evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of the SYNERGY solution in concrete case studies.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"216089","fundValue":"5191334","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
