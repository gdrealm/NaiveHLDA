{"id":"99821","title":"Crystallisation Systems Engineering �  Towards a next generation of intelligent crystallisation systems","abstractText":"'The project proposes the development of an intelligent crystallisation system by combining state-of-the-art process analytical technologies and novel model-based and statistical feedback control approaches, to provide a fully integrated and adaptive system for efficient engineering of particulate products. The developed adaptive and robust control approaches will be incorporated in a Crystallisation Process Informatics System, to provide an intelligent decision support system, which triggers the suitable control algorithm taking into account the effect of crystallisation on the downstream processing units and final product properties. In this way crystallisation becomes a key intelligent �process actuator� in the whole production system, that manipulates final properties of the solid product taking into account operational, regulatory and economic constraints of the entire process, opening the way towards novel product engineering approaches. The project will bring the implementation of a new generation of integrated, intensified and intelligent crystallisation systems with drastically improved flexibility, predictability, stability and controllability. The system will be used for detailed evaluation of the current paradigm shift from batch to continuous processes in the pharmaceutical industries. Besides providing a breakthrough in crystallisation science the results could revolutionise the methods in which crystallisation will be designed and controlled in the future, yielding to the development of the emerging research field of Pharmaceutical Systems Engineering, by providing a comprehensive framework for the development of novel integrated pharmaceutical production units and product engineering technologies, for sustainable pharmaceutical production, with the aim of reducing time-to-market and increasing product quality, therefore providing considerable increase in quality of life, for example, by making new products available more quickly and at lower cost.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"280106","fundValue":"1263702.27","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
