{"id":"97415","title":"Flexible Tooling for the manufacture of free-form architectural cladding and faï¿½ades","abstractText":"'The proposal focuses on development of a digitally controlled variable geometry tooling and implantation market for manufacture of 3D architectural panels in high performance composites for the construction industry. The main advantageous features of FlexiTool prototype are rapid, universal, sustainable and cost-effective with high reconfigurablity compared with present thermoforming using dedicated solid mould or fixed hard dies. It is the aim of FlexiTool to empower digitally flexible tooling technology with a clear focus on immediate industrial exploitation in construction and building, and to drive the development of reconfigurable tooling for the benefit of SME participants leading to new processes. There are no such product of mouldless thermoforming tooling available on globe market. FlexiTool will play a key role in realising the full potential of reconfigurable tooling by combining innovative multi-point forming technology with robotic control technology. The industrial and scientific breakthrough objectives of the project are: (1) Fundamental exploitation of FlexiTool machine using multi-point forming methodology for manufacturing curved cladding and facade composite panels. This will lead to realise rapid mouldless thermoforming of thermoplastic cladding and facade panels. (2) Solution of the key technological problems of FlexiTool machine. This will lead to develop FlexiTool manufacturing cell compositing multiple active actuators to replace the traditional fixed moulds. (3) Build of the integrated the integrated computer software interface and robotic control devices. This will lead to the digital optimisation of deformation and the automatic controlling of a FlexiTool machine. (4) Development, demonstration and implantation of FlexiTool manufacturing cell. This will lead to reduce tooling costs by 70%, cut set-up time by 60% and eliminate the need for tooling storage significantly and the quick tooling adaptation to architecture design or changes.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"261925","fundValue":"1498074.4","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
