{"id":"92681","title":"\"'Systems' study of cellular growth, shape and polarity\"","abstractText":"'A major challenge of modern biology is to elucidate how cellular structure and function result from the systemic action of the genome and proteome. In this proposal, we describe an integrated approach combining high-content and quantitative microscopy, systematic gene knockouts, and computational/theoretical methods to carry out the most detailed systemic study of three key aspects of cell physiology: growth, shape and polarity. We will use the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as experimental model organism. The haploid fission yeast with its relative genomic simplicity, genetic tractability, uniform size and shape, and well-characterized, conserved and simple growth and polarization machinery is ideal for this study. A better understanding of the systemic regulation of those processes is likely to contribute in the long run to the development of better strategies to fight cellular pathologies associated with many diseases, such as cancer.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"243283","fundValue":"1697400","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
