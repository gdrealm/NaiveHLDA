{"id":"192503","title":"Graphene Based Active Metamaterials","abstractText":"'This proposed Fellowship is aimed at developing active control of optical properties that may not be found in nature by synergising the �graphene metamaterials� technology invented at the applicant�s institute in Korea and the �novel design of metamaterials with unnatural properties� developed by the host university through knowledge sharing and technology transfer by the incoming top-class researcher, Dr. Teun-Teun Kim. The proposed hybrid metamaterial system features very thin, free-standing and flexible platform and is capable of full electrical control, which will not only control novel optical properties, but also overcome most of the limitations of current semiconductor-based metamaterials. This fellowship will produce significant technical, economic and social benefits, thus contributing to European excellence and competitiveness in both metamaterials and graphene technology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"626184","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2015-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
