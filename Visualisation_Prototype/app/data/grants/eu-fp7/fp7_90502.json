{"id":"90502","title":"Realising and Managing International Research Infrastructures","abstractText":"'This project builds on recent developments in the management of Research Infrastructures, specifically the publication of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) Roadmap and four European conferences which discussed how to develop regional, national and international policy in this area, particularly the legal, financial, operational and governance aspects of managing large and complex research infrastructures. The principal aims of this proposal are to train senior policy makers and scientific decision makers, particularly in New EU Member States and Associated States, in the practical governance and management requirements of pan-European and transnational Research Infrastructures; and to develop a policy framework directed at managing future large Research Infrastructures across national boundaries. Key deliverables of the project will be a symposium entitled �Realising and Managing International Research Infrastructures� which it is proposed to hold in three leading centres of European research � London/Oxfordshire, Grenoble and Hamburg. The project Coordinator will be Imperial College London, which will work closely with its partners, ESRF, ILL, Elettra, DESY and UKAEA-Culham ensuring that the outcomes have the authority and support of leading organisations in this field. Additionally, the symposium will result in a network of experts, delegates and other organisations active or interested in managing RIs. Discussions during the conferences, and afterwards through the network and published preliminary policy paper and Symposium Report, will identify the essential requirements for taking forward the ESFRI Roadmap. The resulting sharing of experience and knowledge will be an essential component of a European strategy for developing and safeguarding Europe�s high quality research community and will contribute to the effectiveness and impact of research across Europe.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"226446","fundValue":"523248","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
