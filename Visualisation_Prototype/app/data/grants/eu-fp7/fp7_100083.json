{"id":"100083","title":"\"Supporting decentralised management to improve health workforce performance in Ghana, Uganda and Tanzania\"","abstractText":"The proposal addresses the workforce deficit in sub-Saharan countries in Africa by improving the overall performance of the workforce.  Management strengthening activities will be tested to identify what improvements can be made within available resources in decentralised management structures.  The management strengthening activities will develop integrated approaches to improving workforce performance based on a situation analysis and monitor the impact on workforce performance and on unintended systems effects.  New knowledge will be developed on the effectiveness of an action-based approach to management strengthening and what strategies improve health workforce performance in different contexts.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"266334","fundValue":"3785700.6","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
