{"id":"86674","title":"COMPACT ULTRAFAST LASER SOURCES BASED ON NOVEL QUANTUM DOT STRUCTURES","abstractText":"FAST-DOT aims to implement a new range of ultrafast quantum-dot lasers for critical bio-medical applications. This project will develop portable, low-cost, reliable, highly efficient ultrashort pulse and ultra-broadband tuneable laser sources.  The key technical innovation ï¿½ quantum dots (QDs) - are based on novel semiconductor nanostructure clusters which demonstrate remarkable new photonic properties.  QD structures will afford major advances in ultrafast science and technology by exploiting the unique combination of QD properties (high optical quality, efficient light generation, ultrafast carrier dynamics and broadband gain bandwidth) at wavelength range which not easily accessible with current technologies. The FAST-DOT consortium brings together a unique and compelling group of world-leaders in the physics of QDs and QD photonic devices, system integrators and biophotonic. This research will realise a full understanding of the underlying ultrafast properties and physics of QD structures and exploit these effects in the construction of novel highly compact, reliable and environmentally-stable sources of ultra-short pulses. The new QD sources will be investigated and validated in a range of bio-photonic applications including OCT; Non-linear Microscopy; Nanosurgery and minimally invasive diagnostics. The availability of compact and inexpensive ultrashort pulse lasers will have widespread impact in uptake by making many applications more affordable and opening up new application areas. The project unites 18 complementary European research groups and companies with international reputations in the development of semiconductor materials and their use in efficient ultra-fast lasers, related applications and marketing. All of the groups have record of collaboration and a strong record in producing high quality results and joint publications. This programme will contribute to further extending Europe's world-leading position of in photonics and ultrafast technology.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"224338","fundValue":"13652372","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
