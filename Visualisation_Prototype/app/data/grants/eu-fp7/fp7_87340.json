{"id":"87340","title":"Integration of regulatory networks in Pseudomonas","abstractText":"'The competitiveness of Europe in the field of antibacterial discovery programs has been drastically compromised due to a serious drift of academic expertise on antibacterial discovery away from Europe�s to major USA Pharmaceutical companies where the multidisciplinary skills required for this work is available in single institutions. ERA is therefore at serious risk of becoming non-competitive with North America where there is critical mass and excellent training in this area. To regain the European leadership in this field there is an urge to generate a critical mass of scientific workforce with the required advanced multidisciplinary training.  The research project will use Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model bacterial human pathogen to investigate the integration of different key regulatory systems in the control of essential molecular mechanisms for virulence and survival during infection with a view to identify novel antibacterial targets within these regulatory networks. This type of project cannot be achieved with the expertise of a single institution but can be attained through establishment of this IEF fellowship for advance complementary multidisciplinary training where both the host institution and the visiting fellow will benefit from the exchange of expertise. This IEF project is highly complementary to the applicant�s existing research skills and her extensive knowledge on advanced technologies for the study of bacterial biofilms formation, protein interactions and microbial ecology will, in return, bring new expertise to the University of Nottingham. The topic has been freely chosen by the fellow in collaboration with the host institution with the aim to maximise his employability, competence diversification and life long learning as an independent researcher.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219200","fundValue":"182276.12","fundStart":"2008-05-12","fundEnd":"2011-09-11","dataset":"fp7"}
