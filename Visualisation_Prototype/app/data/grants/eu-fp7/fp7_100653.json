An entirely new Junior Research Fellowship scheme will be launched, aimed at early career researchers with 2-5 years of postdoctoral experience. These Fellowships will be associated with one of Durhamï¿½s eight interdisciplinary Research Institutes to provide a supportive and intellectually challenging research environment.  We will expand the existing successful Senior Fellowship programme at the Institute of Advanced Study to encompass Senior Fellowships at the other Institutes and introduce a new Senior Fellowship programme aimed at industrialists and policy-makers. All Fellows will retain an association with their Institute after the end of their Fellowship.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"267209","fundValue":"9912558","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
