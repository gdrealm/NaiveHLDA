{"id":"108365","title":"SPRITES Optimisation of Bio-inspired Gel Scaffolds for Hydrogen Production","abstractText":"'Results arising from the ERC Starting Investigator Grant, Introducing SPRITES (202706, Aug�08-Jul�12) reveal that encapsulating synthetic molecules based upon the hydrogenase enzyme in a bio-gel material cause dramatic changes in chemical behaviour as well as significant improvements in their stability when exposed to air. These systems therefore offer exciting prospects for use as a scaffold material for hydrogen production catalysts in fuel cell applications, addressing an urgent need in the next-generation energy production sector. In this proof of concept study we will perform technical testing and validation of a library of material formulations using SPRITES spectroscopy to determine the most technologically-promising material. The output will be threefold i) a gel material capable of hydrogen production ii) a library of bio-gel formulations for use as catalyst scaffolds iii) a SPRITES screening procedure for advanced materials.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"334949","fundValue":"162670.22","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
