{"id":"103335","title":"A Novel BIPV-PCM Heat and Power Cogeneration System for Buildings","abstractText":"'The project aims to develop a novel BIPV fa�ade module capable of achieving enhanced solar thermal/electrical efficiencies when utilizing micro-encapsulated PCM slurry. This type of module will be designed to provide for flow of properly selected micro-encapsulated PCM slurry, which transfers heat away from the rear of the PV modules, thus decreasing the temperature of the PV cells/modules and increasing their electrical efficiency. The energy carried by the slurry will be used to (1) aid ventilation of the building; (2) provide hot water for domestic use all year round, and for space heating when needed; and (3) be stored in a heat storage unit if there is surplus and fed back to the ventilation or/and heating system when solar radiation is insufficient or unavailable. Compared to conventional BIPV and BIPV/thermal systems, the proposed system could potentially achieve 20% (relative to BIPV/thermal) and 60% (relative to BIPV) higher solar energy conversion efficiency, thus enabling an increased per unit surface area energy production and reduced cost for energy supply. The proposed research will promote large-scale deployment of PV in urban environment, encourage enhanced use of BIPV fa�ade components by architects and builders, and help achieve improved overall energy performance of the buildings. The specific objectives of the project are: (1) designing a conceptual BIPV module and the associated heat and power cogeneration system using the PCM slurry; (2) developing a computer model to optimise the configuration of the BIPV/PCM system and predict its energy generating performance; (3) constructing and testing a prototype BIPV/PCM system and validating the computer model using the experiemntal data; and (4) carrying out economic, environmental and regional acceptance analyses.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"298093","fundValue":"278807.4","fundStart":"2012-12-07","fundEnd":"2014-12-06","dataset":"fp7"}
