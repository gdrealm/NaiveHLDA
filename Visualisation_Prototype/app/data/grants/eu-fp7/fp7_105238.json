{"id":"105238","title":"New Energy Material","abstractText":"'There are a range of emerging solar technologies which are pushing to achieve power conversion efficiencies of similar values to thin film solar cells, but with a materials base and manufacturability of a much lower cost. Within the ERC starting grant HYPER, we have developed a new solid-state absorber material and device structure, which represents a distinctly new emerging solar technology based on solution processed inorganic and organic semiconductors. This new material system has delivered power conversion efficiencies, as measured under simulated AM1.5 sun light at 100 mWcm2 irradiance, of over 10% which puts it at the very top of the emerging PV technologies. Beyond performance however, in order to �prove� commercial viability, long term stability needs to be demonstrated. Within this proof of concept project, long term stability will be externally verified, and a strong IP position and strategy will be developed through professional IP strategists.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"324614","fundValue":"160175.4","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
