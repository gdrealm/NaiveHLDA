{"id":"98229","title":"\"Events, Causality and Symmetry-the next-generation semantics\"","abstractText":"'Headed by Principal Investigator Glynn Winskel, the project ECSYM assembles a world-leading team of theoretical computer scientists and mathematicians. Their  goal: to build the next-generation semantics---a new mathematical  foundation with which to understand and analyze computation of the complexity we  begin to see today. The proposal arises in  answer  to the anomalies found in today's theories of computation and  to the commonality and  need  for shared  techniques  becoming apparent across a range of  seemingly disparate areas, through  security protocols, systems biology, model checking, computational games, types and proof.The evidence points to a new intensional semantics,  one in which the current distinctions between operational and denotational semantics disappear.  It leads to the project ECSYM (Events, Causality and SYMmetry). The project marries the vision of Scott and Strachey, who sought a comprehensive semantics of computation, with Petri's  analysis of computation, as emergent from  local causal structure between basic events.  A key insight is the increased expressivity a treatment of behavioural symmetry brings to causal models, to the types, processes, operations and applications they can  support.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"267916","fundValue":"2347998.8","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
