{"id":"102807","title":"Can altitudinal data predict latitudinal responses of plants to climate change?","abstractText":"'Rapid changes in climate are predicted to disrupt the conditions which determine the distribution of species, with the most dramatic effects predicted to occur at species range edges. At the population level, such changes induce range shifts, both at altitudinal and latitudinal level. With this study, we will try: i) to determine the capacity for population expansion in altitude and latitude as a consequence of climatic change, ii) to evaluate the likely range contraction at species lowermost/southernmost distribution limits due to changes in growth and reproduction, and iii) to analyse discrepancies and similarities between altitudinal and latitudinal range shifts.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300825","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
