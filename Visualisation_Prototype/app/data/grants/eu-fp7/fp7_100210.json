{"id":"100210","title":"RF-enhanced Microprocessing for Fine Chemicals Synthesis using Catalysts Supported on Magnetic Nanoparticles","abstractText":"'This proposal aims at further strengthening the current line of the applicantï¿½s research in the area of nontraditional energy sources and structured reactors. Novel and challenging reactor concepts and technologies are proposed for newly emerging liquid phase catalytic processes for, amongst others, fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals synthesis. Catalytic processes in the liquid phase are crucial in the manufacturing of fine and specialty chemicals. It is widely accepted that the activity of a solid catalyst suspended in a liquid phase can benefit greatly from the use of smaller catalyst particles to avoid mass-transfer limitations. However, the difficulties in recovering small particles from the reaction mixture severely circumvent their industrial applications. To overcome the above drawbacks, the separation of suspended magnetic catalyst bodies from the liquid system using an external magnetic field is proposed. Functionalized magnetic bimetallic nanoparticles are leading candidates for catalytic applications as a vector for magnetic guidance. Their appclication will provide reactors and processes for synthetic routes and high-value added products with optimal space-time yields, minimum waste production, minimum energy consumption, and minimum operating costs. Two novel reactor concepts are proposed in this ERC starting grant program with the aim to develop and demonstrate continuous flow reactors, viz. (1) the RF-heated reactor where catalytically active magnetic nanoparticles are hold in the reactor by an external magnetic field while being heated, and (2) the micro-flow through reactor for magnetic NP manipulation, where mixing in laminar flow is improved by quadrupolar actuation created by a quadrupolar micro magnet arrangement along the channel.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"279867","fundValue":"1242000","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
