{"id":"92671","title":"Membrane Enhanced Tide Synthesis - A New Paradigm Peptide / Oligonucleotide Synthesis Technology","abstractText":"'The MemTide Initial Training Network will create a new generation of synthesis technologies for peptide and oligonucleotide (�tide�) manufacture, with focus on the use of emerging membrane technology to effect critical separations. New nanofiltration membranes with improved chemical stability, and closely controlled molecular discrimination properties, will be developed. Novel synthesis strategies for tides, which utilise membranes for key separations will be created. MemTide will consider both step change improvements to solid phase tide synthesis, and the realisation of a completely new concept of tide synthesis based on solution phase synthesis coupled to membrane purification. The applications of these technologies will be through the industrial partners. The project is multidisciplinary, involving chemists, materials scientists and chemical engineers. The consortium is intersectorial, comprising 3 universities/research institutes, a technology SME, a fine chemicals company and a large pharmaceutical manufacturer, and will have a strong emphasis on knowledge creation, technology commercialisation, and entrepreneurship. The training programme involves Early Stage Researchers (ESR), at both university and industrial partners, each of whom will complete a PhD thesis through a combination of local and network wide research experience. Experienced Researchers (ER) will complete their training through development of entrepreneurship and project management skills. ESR and ER will complete complementary training through a series of Personal Skills Modules, and a course on Technology Commercialisation and Entrepreurship. MemTide seeks to contribute to improving the European knowledge supply chain through this industry-academia programme aimed at developing engineers and scientists who are academically excellent and achieve PhD degrees, but who thrive at the interface between fundamental research and industrial application.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"238291","fundValue":"2329000","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
