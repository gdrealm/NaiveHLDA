{"id":"89455","title":"Sustaining Technology Enhanced Learning Large-scale multidisciplinary Research","abstractText":"STELLAR represents the effort of the leading institutions and projects in European TEL to unify our diverse TEL community.  This Network of Excellence is motivated by the need for European research on Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) to build upon, synergize and extend the valuable work we have started by significantly building capacity in TEL research within Europe, which is required to allow the European Union to achieve its goals via the Bologna Agreement and the execution of the Lisbon Agenda. The European TEL agenda has been set for the last 4 years by the Kaleidoscope network ï¿½ with a huge strength in pedagogy and scientific excellence, and the Prolearn network with a complimentary strength in technical and professional excellence.  We see integrating this excellence and moving on to the higher strategic formation of policy based in leading research is the challenge for the next three. STELLAR will move beyond the earlier networks by setting a new and critical foresight agenda for TEL via an annually reviewed Grand Challenge programme.nThe Network will be executed via a series of integration instruments designed to increase the research capacity of European TEL at all levels. These instruments will act as the backbone of an interlocking set of 3 Grand Research Challenge actions, themed as Connecting People, Orchestration and Context. At the most general level the network will reach out to the wider stakeholder community via the organisation of strategic stakeholder communication vehicles whilst at the other end of the spectrum it will take its strategy and vision to an annual policy maker 'meeting of minds'.  The path between these two key instruments is designed to reach each key community and greatly increase its capacity to address the critical research issues at each level of capacity.  The themes of the Network's instruments will be set by our community as the 'Grand Challenge' for TEL.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"231913","fundValue":"6384179","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
