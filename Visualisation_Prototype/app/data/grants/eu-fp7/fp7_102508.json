{"id":"102508","title":"Self-aligned high-resolution organic ferroelectric transistor based complementary memory","abstractText":"'The Soft-COM project proposes to realize a self-aligned fabrication of non-volatile, reprogrammable organic complementary memory cell (CMC) compressing both p- and n- channel organic ferroelectric thin film transistor (FTFT).\n\nNon-volatile memory applications based on organic materials have recently been of great interest due to their potential integration into products ranging from low-cost identification tags to switching devices for active matrix display.  Among all demonstrated memory devices organic ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FTFT) has drawn great attention for its non-destructive read-out, non-volatile, and compatibility of integrating with other organic circuits etc. Although such device is very attractive for many merits but its real application is hindered by several problems, such as high fabrication cost, high power consumption occurs during the read operation when the channel of the transistor is in the on state.  Thus, a new design of organic FTFT based device that can be fabricated by low cost method with reasonably high resolution is highly desired. Herein, a complementary design of memory device fabricated with �all self-alignment process� and compatible organic complementary circuit will be demonstrated.  The complementary devices comprise both p- and n-channel organic FTFT to ensure a minimized current flow for reading. All components of the organic FTFT including transistor channels, both p- and n-type of semiconductors, and gate are patterned by all self-aligned process without mask alignment. Whole process, like device design, fabrication, and characterization, will be achieved in a feasible and credible way with in the knowledge and experiences that the candidate has obtained before and will acquire in the proposed project through the synergies offered by the experienced host institution.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"301028","fundValue":"278807.4","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
