{"id":"87617","title":"Partial Behaviour Modelling: A Foundation for Incremental and Iterative Model-Based Software Engineering","abstractText":"'Software systems are amenable to analysis through the construction of behaviour models. This corresponds to the traditional engineering approach to construction of complex systems. The advantage of using behaviour models to describe systems is that they are cheaper to develop than the actual system. Consequently, they can be analysed and mechanically checked for properties in order to detect design errors early in the development process and allow cheaper fixes. Although behaviour modelling and analysis has been shown to be successful in uncovering subtle requirements and design errors, adoption by practitioners has been slow. One of the reasons for this is that traditional approaches to behaviour models are required to be complete descriptions of the system behaviour up to some level of abstraction, i.e., the transition system is assumed to completely describe the system behaviour with respect to a fixed alphabet of actions. This completeness assumption is limiting in the context of software development process best practices which include iterative development, adoption of use-case and scenario-based techniques and viewpoint- or stakeholder-based analysis; practices which require modelling and analysis in the presence of partial information about system behaviour. This aim of this project is to shift the focus from traditional behaviour models to partial behaviour models ï¿½ operational descriptions that are capable of distinguishing known behaviour (both required and proscribed) from unknown behaviour that is yet to be elicited. Our overall aim is to develop the foundations, techniques and tools that will enable the automated construction of partial behaviour models from multiple sources of partial specifications, the provision of early feedback through automated partial behaviour model analysis, and the support incremental, iterative elaboration of behaviour models.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"204853","fundValue":"1366450","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
