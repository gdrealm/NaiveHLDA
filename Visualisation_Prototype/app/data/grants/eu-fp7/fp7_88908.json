{"id":"88908","title":"Demographic Change and Housing Wealth","abstractText":"'DEMHOW will investigate links between demographic change and housing wealth.  Whereas those who rent their homes may have no housing wealth at all, for many older Europeans - perhaps 75% of the  total -   housing is their single largest item of wealth  But, increasing numbers do not have children to whom their wealth might be bequeathed.  The potential of housing assets is that they  offer: older households  a way of  increasing their consumption; governments a way to respond to the pension crisis;and  financial institutions a way to increase business.  DEMHOW will investigate the ways in which, across member states, ageing populations and housing wealth are linked, how housing wealth has been used in the past and how attitudes to its use in old age are changing.  In addition, it will investigate developments in policy and in financial markets that may encourage its use as a form of pension, and assess the characteristics of housing assets as a form of pension.'","grantUrl":"http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/social-policy/chasm/projects/demhow.aspx","grantId":"216865","fundValue":"1647273","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
