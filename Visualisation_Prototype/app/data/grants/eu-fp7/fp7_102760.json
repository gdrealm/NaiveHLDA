{"id":"102760","title":"HANDHold - HANDHeld OLfactory Detector","abstractText":"'While the dog will remain a central part of the detection process at border crossing and airports, sensor technology and low power embedded system computing are improving to the extent that the time is right to develop substantially improved mobile detection devices that can complement the role played by dogs. Moreover, these detection devices can be networked together to provide enhanced detection facilities and also to facilitate easier management and field deployment of the platforms themselves.\n\nThe HANDHOLD consortium consists of nine partners who bring complementary expertise in all the fields needed to develop a mobile network of low power CBRNE sensor system. The consortium  includes the Irish Customs Authority and the consortium has an attached user group of representatives from law enforcement fromaoround Europe.\n\nThe consortium plans a 42 month project which will deliver a working prototype system in two phases, the initial version being completed 24 months into the project lifetime.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"284456","fundValue":"4580959.97","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
