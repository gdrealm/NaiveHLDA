{"id":"99472","title":"Natural History Museum Science Night","abstractText":"'NHM NIGHTS2 will deliver the mass participation of a diverse public audience in a unique event to meet many of the Natural History Museum�s most dynamic and engaging scientists from around the world in an unprecedented festival of scientists in central London. With a rich and vibrant community of research scientist and PhD students that are accomplished science communication practitioners the NHM is well position to breakdown existing public stereotypes of researchers, to drive home to the public the role and value of scientists and to inspire the next generation of young researchers.\n\n7,000 participants will visit the Natural History Museums in London and Tring to be greeted by over250 scientists delivering more than 57 different engaging activities and formats alongside professional educators in a fun and relaxed atmosphere. The impact of this event on the 7000 participants will be profound, perhaps life-changing for some, and at an approximate spend per head of �55 represents excellent value to foster a long term engagement with science.\n\nThe intense and wide reaching awareness campaign will ensure mass participation and broad awareness of the NHM NIGHTS2 project as well as the European Researcher Nights initiative across Europe. This campaign aims to reach a wider audience of over 25 million people giving excellent return of less than �0.01 spend per head.\n\nThe 250 scientists from NHM and Imperial College will promote the diversity (gender, ethnicity, age) of our researchers. As well as addressing science and research this event will be unique in celebrating EU research, international collaborations and the global nature of science as a human endeavour of immeasurable value to society.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"287455","fundValue":"150000.5","fundStart":"2011-04-20","fundEnd":"2011-11-19","dataset":"fp7"}
