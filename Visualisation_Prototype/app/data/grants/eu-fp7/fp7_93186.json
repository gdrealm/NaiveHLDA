{"id":"93186","title":"Motion in Random Media: Random Polymers","abstractText":"'Motion in random media and in particular the study of random polymer models constitutes a major research field on the interface of probability theory and mathematical physics. In this proposal we focus on the study of three major polymer models in random media: 1) Media with disorder on a defect line, 2) Directed polymers in media with bulk disorder and 3) Semidirected polymers in media with bulk disorder. Although, the study of such models has occupied the mathematical community for almost three decades, many fundamental question are still open. In this project we propose to settle some of these questions and create the framework that will lead to a unified theory of the above aspects of the field.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"246809","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
