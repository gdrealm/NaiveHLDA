{"id":"107258","title":"Metabolic engineering of triterpenoid pathways involved in plant defense in Arabidopsis and rice","abstractText":"'Plants produce a diversity array of natural products (otherwise known as secondary metabolites) that have important ecological functions (Dixon 2001; Field and Osbourn 2008). Triterpenes are one of the largest classes of plant-derived natural products.  These compounds protect plants against pests and diseases and are also important as drugs and anticancer agents (Papadopoulou et al 1999; Phillips et al 2006; Liby et al 2007). Arabidopsis and also cereals such as rice do not make protective triterpene glycosides (Hostettmann & Marston, 1995; Vincken et al 2007). These model species are therefore excellent experimental systems for proof-of-concept experiments involving metabolic engineering of triterpene pathways into heterologous species. The aim of this proposal is to engineer triterpene metabolic pathways into Arabidopsis and rice by genetic modification.  As part of this work I will develop methods for introducing multiple genes into plants using recombineering and synthetic biology approaches. At the end of this project we will have the necessary knowledge to devise strategies to introduce multiple genes into diverse plant species for control of plant pests and diseases based on synthesis of protective triterpenes.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"328529","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-03-04","fundEnd":"2015-03-03","dataset":"fp7"}
