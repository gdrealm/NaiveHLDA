{"id":"90967","title":"Historical Patterns of Development and Underdevelopment: Origins and Persistence of the Great Divergence","abstractText":"'Understanding the �great� and �little� divergences between Northwest Europe and the rest of Europe, and between Europe and the rest of the world, implies considerable challenges, both in terms of quantification and analysis. In terms of quantification, the major European challenges are to be found in the pre-1800 period, although much work remains to be done in quantifying post-1800 performance elsewhere. This proposed research project fits very tightly with the objectives of this call. We will be explicitly exploring the �relations between world regions and the factors shaping different development paths in a historical perspective� (Area 8.4.1). We will be explicitly focussing on the experiences of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and will be drawing not only upon European-based scholars but on a Latin American partner to this end (Activity 8.4). In terms of the specific topic addressed, �SSH-2007-4.1.2�, the proposal focuses explicitly on the way in which �development processes have and are being affected by relations between world regions and countries�, and on the links between uneven development and such relationships. The project will indeed look at whether and how uneven development is linked to such relations, both past and present; at �the extent to which historical relationships such as colonial and post-colonial relations affect today�s development paths�; at �the role of urbanisation�; and at �gender and development relations�, to which we will be devoting an entire work package.'","grantUrl":"http://hipod.cepr.org/","grantId":"225342","fundValue":"1695343","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
