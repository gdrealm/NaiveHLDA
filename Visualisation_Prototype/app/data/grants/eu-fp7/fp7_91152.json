{"id":"91152","title":"INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN SHORT AND LONG-DISTANCE TRANSPORT NETWORKS","abstractText":"'INTERCONNECT is concerned with the role of local and regional connections in the context of growing importance of interregional passenger journeys in the European Union. Poor interconnectivity among different transport networks and among different scales of modal networks might compromise the objectives of integration of the TEN-T network investments and policy measures.  The proposal addresses the potential for greater efficiency and reduced environmental impact of passenger transport by judicious encouragement of integration, co-operation and, where appropriate, competition in the provision of local connections, paying attention to land, air and maritime modes. Building on the attributes of a well-connected transport system identified in past research and policy documents, as well as on the review of available evidence on the extent and nature of problems affecting local connectivity for longer distance journeys, INTERCONNECT will develop an analytical approach to provide effective recommendations to national and European policy makers. The applicability of mechanisms for improving interconnectivity between the different network scales and between road, rail, maritime and air passenger modes of transport will be explored through a combination of literature reviews, interviews with key stakeholders and - above all - detailed investigation of selected case studies. The range and applicability of specified solutions, which will be tested in the project case studies, will take into account legal and institutional issues and will make use of policy measures like integrated pricing, and ticketing, improved links and interchanges, infrastructure pricing, strategic planning, information and marketing.  While promoting take-up of organisational, administrative and technical best practice and coordination among policy makers, INTERCONNECT will also make a contribution to the wider use of analytical tools that are appropriate to this field at both European and local level.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"233846","fundValue":"1947129","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
