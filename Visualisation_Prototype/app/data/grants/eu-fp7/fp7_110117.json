{"id":"110117","title":"Carbon Nanomaterials Assembly","abstractText":"'CANA explores new methods for the fabrication of complex carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene. The project emphasizes the importance of the hierarchical organization of materials over several lengthscale. To achieve this, CANA follows a methodical approach, that systematically optimizes mesoscale chemistry, nanoscale morphology, microscale porosity and macroscale assembly and packaging. For instance, we will pursue combined top-down microfabrication and bottom-up self-assembly, accompanied with surface modification through hydrothermal processing.\nWhile the properties of organized carbon nanomaterial assemblies can be tuned towards a wide variety of applications, this project specifically focusses electrodes for energy storage. This project is highly multi-disciplinary as it brings together expertise ranging from macro- and microscale manufacturing, to nanoscale material synthesis and mesoscale chemical surface modification and electrochemistry.\nThe funding provided through this CIG grant will mainly be invested in vital pieces of equipment to enable pursuing the above objectives, but also for travel in Europe and for setting up new research collaborations. As such, this project is crucial for the applicantï¿½s integration in his new research position. Beyond this initial project, the expertise and equipment acquired through this grant will be employed for the development of new water filtration techniques.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"618250","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
