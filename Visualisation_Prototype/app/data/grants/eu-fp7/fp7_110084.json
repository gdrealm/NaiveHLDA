{"id":"110084","title":"\"Tyre Recycling Pyrolysis for producing oil with less than 0.2% sulphur content, low cost \nsulphur impregnated carbon for reducing mercury air emissions, with simultaneous elemental\"","abstractText":"'SULFREE offers a complete, end-to-end process for ELT recycling, which breaks down tyres to valuable products\nthat can be reused by the EU tyre industry; instead of merely recycling them either as tyre crumb or as fuel (i.e.\ntyres are burned for power production). The recovery of oil and sulphur reduces the dependence on imported\nproducts and lessens the effect of price volatility on tyre production whereas the sulphur-impregnated\nactivated carbon (S-AC) will aid in reducing mercury emissions.\n\nThe project will (a) develop a novel, platform technology implementing a specially designed Fixed Bed Reactor\nfor the hydrodesulphurisation of the pyrolysis vapour (combined oil and gas fraction), resulting in a gas rich in\nhydrogen sulphide (H2S) and oil with sulphur content less than 0.2%, (b) develop a monoethanolamine (MEA)\nstripper to capture H2S from the gas and optimize the Claus Process for recovering the sulphur (c) optimize\nmicrowave pyrolysis technology for breaking down end of life tyres and (d) optimize the technology for\nactivating the solid carbon black. The gas and heat produced during the process will be used for the energy\nrequirements of the process and for activating the solid carbon black. The major novelty of the process is that\nthe fixed bed reactor, the MEA stripper and the Claus process will design and operate at a significantly smaller\nscale.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"605246","fundValue":"1658931.33","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
