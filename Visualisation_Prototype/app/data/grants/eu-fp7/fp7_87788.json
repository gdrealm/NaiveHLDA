{"id":"87788","title":"High Temperature Sensors","abstractText":"'High-temperature piezoelectric sensing technology is of major importance for the chemical and material processing, automotive, aerospace, and power generating industries. Aurivillius phase ceramics are of interest for these applications because of their high Curie points (Tc up to ~950C). Modified bismuth titanate compositions can be used for sensor applications up to 500C. If a higher operating temperature is required there are currently no suitable polycrystalline ceramics available. The objective of this project is to systematically investigate the effect of doping on the properties (ferroelectric, piezoelectric, dielectric, Curie point, electrical conductivity, thermal depoling and ageing) of candidate Aurivillius phase ceramics. Having identified promising optimised compositions, we will then determine a processing route using Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) to produce highly textured microstructures with enhanced piezoelectric coefficients.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"221413","fundValue":"178874.06","fundStart":"2008-10-09","fundEnd":"2010-10-08","dataset":"fp7"}
