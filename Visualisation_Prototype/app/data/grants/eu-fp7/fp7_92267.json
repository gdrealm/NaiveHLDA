{"id":"92267","title":"Variable Stars in Current and Future Large Scale Observing Surveys","abstractText":"'Observing and analysing changes in the brightness of stars is one of the oldest means of studying them, their populations and underlying laws of physics.  Variable stars give insight into stellar life and death and can act as rulers for determining distances in the Universe, allowing us to decipher spatial shapes of galaxies, including our own. \nIn this project I propose to study various aspects of variable stars with an emphasis on their detection and classification using data accessible from long-term surveys. Analysis of millions of stars may potentially yield discoveries of new exotic types of variable stars. Statistical studies of the vast samples of variable stars will be used in the preparation for the future space-based European mission called GAIA. Variability induced by gravitational lenses in our Galaxy will be examined as being of special interest. This has recently led to detection of extra-solar planets.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"234784","fundValue":"35000","fundStart":"2009-03-16","fundEnd":"2011-07-15","dataset":"fp7"}
