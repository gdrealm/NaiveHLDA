{"id":"91505","title":"Pan-European infrastructure for management of marine and ocean geological and geophysical data","abstractText":"The overall objective of the Geo-Seas project is to effect a major and significant improvement in the overview and access to marine geological and geophysical data and data-products from national geological surveys and research institutes in Europe by upgrading and interconnecting their present infrastructures.The Geo-Seas partnership has taken a strategic decision to adopt the SeaDataNet interoperability principles, architecture and components wherever possible. This approach allows the Geo-Seas upgrading to gain instant traction and momentum whilst avoiding wasteful duplicative effort. It is envisaged that the SeaDataNet infrastructure will provide a core platform that will be adaptively tuned in order to cater for the specific requirements of the geological and geophysical domains. A range of additional activities for developing and providing new products and services is also undertaken in order to fulfill the diverse needs of end-user communities.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"238952","fundValue":"6760422","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
