{"id":"104200","title":"Hybrid Nanophotonics for Enhanced Light Control","abstractText":"'Coupling of quantum emitters, and the exploitation of multi-photon quantum interference, is the next challenge for generation optical information technology and quantum computation. The aim of this proposal is to achieve long-range coupling of two or more quantum emitters, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of light transport, nano-optical emission control and resulting collective phenomena, such as super-radiance and lasing.\nA model system will be realised where the light originated from one quantum emitter is transported to the next one by a combination of photonic crystal waveguide and optical nano-antennas which together act as a bridge for light transport from the micrometer to nanometer scale.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"321952","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
