{"id":"101138","title":"High Performance Insulation based on Nanostructure encapsulation of air","abstractText":"'The concept of High Performance Insulation Based on Nanostructured Encapsulation of Air (HIPIN), described in this proposal, is to develop a sustainable and affordable technology to produce a nanostructured thermal insulating coating to improve thermal efficiency in new and retrofitting buildings. The insulating material will have enhanced performance compared with the state of the art products and will contribute to the protection of the environment through the reduction of greenhouse gases generated in heating and cooling the building.\n\nThe concept described in HIPIN develops technology which is affordable and easily applicable. Insulating properties will be achieved through a combination of a novel approach to fabrication of aerogels to address the current cost issue, combined with the addition of low emissivity, a critical feature in improving the performance of thin insulating layers. In addition to the insulating effect, other functionalities will be sought such as self-cleaning, sound insulation and fire retardant properties.\n\nThe innovative multi-functional material will be suitable for application in a liquid form on exterior of buildings at a reducing cost and time required for installation. This will be achieved by the development of novel technology for handling fragile additives within liquid systems.\n\nThe developed process will constitute a viable approach to produce a material which can be affordably manufactured on an industrial scale and significantly in advance of solutions currently available.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"260117","fundValue":"2865010.87","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
