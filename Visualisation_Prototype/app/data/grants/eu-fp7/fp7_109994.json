{"id":"109994","title":"To critically evaluate vegetable acceptability through individual and environmental characteristics across the lifespan in institutional food service","abstractText":"'Adequate vegetable consumption is fundamental to a healthy balanced diet, however, EU compliance with dietary guidelines is poor and further research is required to overcome consumption barriers. The aim of VeggiEAT is to develop an EU platform for predictive modelling of processed vegetable intake that takes into account individual characteristics (acceptability, intake level, age groups) as well as environmental cues (choice architecture and institutional setting). This aim will be achieved through the development of consumer-oriented products (sensory analysis); the development of recipes for use by food providers (restaurants, canteens, etc.); and the benchmarking of choice architecture facilitating the consumption of vegetables. Results will be gathered and modelled to provide strategic intelligence for decision-making (by Industry) and for policy purposes (by the EU); further, this translational research will be disseminated both at scientific and consumer levels. The application of these results will contribute to operational benefits for European vegetable manufacturers (growers, processors, retailers etc), while adding to the body of knowledge regarding consumer behaviour and preferences towards vegetables. The conceptual model will translate the latest academic research results into a greater understanding of factors determining vegetable consumption while informing a commercially viable vegetable product and therefore strengthen European competitiveness. This Industry-Academia-SME collaboration will invigorate the vegetable sector in Europe while addressing in a constructive way the EU objectives of healthier eating at population level.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612326","fundValue":"1627659.92","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
