{"id":"94184","title":"MAPPING THE JEWISH COMMUNITIES OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE","abstractText":"'The aim of the project is to assemble for the first time all the data on the presence of Jewish communities in the territories of the Byzantine empire (southern Balkans, Aegean islands, Anatolia), and to generate interactive maps on-line using GIS (Geographic Information Systems). The data in question come mainly from archaeological investigations and from inscriptions, and from a broad range of documentary and literary sources in Greek, Hebrew and other languages. Much of this data has never before been published or collected. All data will be associated with specific locations, mainly towns and specific locations within towns. The maps, as well as related tables, graphs etc., will be readily accessible to specialised scholars and to the general public. The data will also be made available in print form, including complete publication of newly-discovered evidence such as inscriptions. The project will make significant contributions both to Jewish history (where the Byzantine region has been largely overlooked) and to Byzantine history (where the study of minorities is a neglected area which is only now coming to be studied seriously). The innovative use of GIS is also intended as a pilot that will generate further applications of this important new technology to historical study and similar fields.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"249468","fundValue":"979414","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
