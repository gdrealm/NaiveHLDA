{"id":"102070","title":"\"The Autonomous Vehicle Emergency Recovery Tool (AVERT) provides a capability rapidly to deploy, extract and remove both blocking and suspect vehicles from vulnerable positions and confined spaces.\"","abstractText":"'In Europe, terrorism threatens horrific loss of life, extensive disruption to city transport and damage to commercial real estate. Vehicles provide an ideal delivery mechanism because they can be meticulously prepared well in advance of deployment and then brought in to the Area of Operations. Furthermore, a real and present danger comes from the threat of Chemical, Radiological, Biological and Nuclear (CRBN) contamination. Current methods of bomb disruption and neutralisation are hindered in the event that the device is shielded, blocked or for whatever reason cannot be accessed for examination.\n\nThe Autonomous Vehicle Emergency Recovery Tool (AVERT) shall provide a unique capability to Police and Armed Services to rapidly deploy, extract and remove both blocking and suspect vehicles from vulnerable positions such as enclosed infrastructure spaces, tunnels, low bridges as well as under-building and underground car parks. Vehicles can be removed from confined spaces with delicate handling, swiftly and in any direction to a safer disposal point to reduce or eliminate collateral damage to infrastructure and personnel. AVERT shall be commanded remotely and shall operate autonomously under its own power and sensor awareness, as a critical tool alongside existing technologies, thereby enhancing bomb disposal response speed and safety.'","grantUrl":"http://avertproject.eu/","grantId":"285092","fundValue":"3631190.98","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
