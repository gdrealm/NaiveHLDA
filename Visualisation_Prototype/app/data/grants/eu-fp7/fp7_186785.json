{"id":"186785","title":"Climate change and risk: Exploring the corporate construction of climate change as risk in different industry settings","abstractText":"'Climate change is one of the most pressing risks facing humanity. However, the way in which climate change is framed as a risk is also critical in shaping the forms of subsequent actions. The proposed Marie Curie Integration Grant (CIG) will enable the integration of Professor Nyberg in setting up a new research program in response to business engagement with climate change. The program's overall aim is to understand how businesses construct climate change as risks and the effect these constructions have on business and society. The succesful integration and research program will: a) develop a new risk based model in explaining corporate engagements with climate change, b) build research networks of academics and practitioners to enhance the research capacity of private and public organisations, and c) inform evidence based public policies for the U.K. and E.U.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"630923","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
