{"id":"103920","title":"Transitional Justice Mapping","abstractText":"'In 2009, under the auspices of the ERC, a four year programme of research was launched to look at the legal shaping of memry after two apposite conflicts, both of which were marked by mass atrocity.  One context (the Spanish Civil War) dates back to a 'pre transitional justice' moment.  The other (the Yugoslav conflicts of the 1990's as they effected Bosnia and Herzegovina - hereafter BiH) is largely understood to have been the laboratory of transitional justice.\n\nOne of the largest and most complex parts of our work in BiH, one that accounts for approximately 30% of our entire 4 year budget and constitutes our first interim milestone, involves a consummate mapping of �transitional justice� initiatives in BiH.  The study is longintudinal, includes a regional purview and aims to chart: i) Flows of funding, personnel and information resources; ii) Target audiences of TJ initiatives; iii) Methodologies involved in research, design and implementation of TJ initiatives; iv) Successes, failures and reduplication of TJ efforts.\n\nThis �map� already offers an unparalleled resource. However, to expand its utility, this CSA will use social network mapping analysis (through UCINet software) in order to subject the data to a variety of statistical and network-based forms of examination (centrality measures, subgroup identification, role analysis).  This will enable us to identify: i) funding gatekeepers and their target audiences/funding priorities; ii) those actors/institutions that are not easily recognised as �central� but act as integral nodes in the TJ network; iii) clusters of implementing agents and their relation to gatekeepers and significant nodes in the network; iv) the role of certain institutions in coordinating TJ initiatives.\n\nThe project team believe that the proposed collaboration with designated user-beneficiaries  will produce a new process and model for coordinating transitional justice initiatives, an output we have named the TJ Mapping Toolkit.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"297497","fundValue":"126358.69","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
