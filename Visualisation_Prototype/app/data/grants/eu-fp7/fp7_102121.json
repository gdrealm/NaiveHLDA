{"id":"102121","title":"Moses Open Source Evaluation and Support Co-ordination for OutReach and Exploitation","abstractText":"Machine translation (MT) has increasingly become an indispensable tool for coping with Europe's linguistic diversity. However machine translation systems are complex software applications requiring significant levels of cooperation and coordination to enable research to continue to flourish, and to improve the usage rate amongst commercial translators, and public bodies. This project will provide a variety of forums for users, developers andresearchers in machine translation to exchange ideas and experiences with the technology. These will consist of research meetings, machine translation marathons (where academic and commercial developers gather to implement open-source MT tools) and industrial outreach events aimed at sharing practical experience amongstMT users. We will also coordinate the development of shared open-source translation tools, and shared data sets as a means of lowering the barrier to entry into MT research, and enabling organisations of all sizes to deploy their own customised translation systems.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"288487","fundValue":"1250960","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
