{"id":"105843","title":"Gold(I)-catalyzed decarboxylation in direct decarboxylative C-H arylation","abstractText":"'In the present research project we propose the development of new and innovative methodologies for organic synthesis, namely biaryl synthesis, by the combination of different metal-promoted processes. More specifically, the project will be built up on the very efficient procedure for gold-promoted decarboxylation of aromatic carboxylic acids, recently developed by the host group, giving place easily to arylgold(I) species.\nAs we detail below, the transmetallation of these aryl units from gold to other metal (likely palladium) capable of performing an orthogonal transformation as C�H activation would allow the direct cross-coupling of (hetero)arenes (via C�H activation) and aromatic carboxylic acids (via C�CO2H activation, see Scheme 1) without any pre-functionalization.\nSuch a methodology will significantly improve the current methodologies for the synthesis of biaryl motifs (ubiquitous in natural products, pharmaceuticals and organic materials) offering a more direct, economic and significantly greener approach. Replacing the use of organometallic compounds (frequently expensive, not trivial to prepare and giving place to large amounts of metal salt residues) by carboxylic acids (common functional groups in organic compounds, giving place to only CO2 as side product) will make cross-coupling processes more applicable both at laboratory and industrial scales and will very importantly reduce �virtually eliminate� their environmental impact.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300763","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
