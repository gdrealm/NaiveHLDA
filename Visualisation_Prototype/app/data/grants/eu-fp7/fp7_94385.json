{"id":"94385","title":"Integrated Quantum Sensors","abstractText":"The central aim of iSense is to deliver breakthrough enabling technologies and knowledge to push long-anticipated sensor and quantum ICT applications using cold atoms to a broadly accessible and commercially exploitable level.nnTo achieve this goal, iSense is structured in two highly interlinked and temporally overlapping phases: In the phase 1 iSense will create a science and technology platform introducing novel integrated optics concepts for cold atom production and interrogation. Phase 2 will pursue the establishment of commercial cold atom devices for a wide variety of integrated quantum sensors as well as in information and communication technologies (ICT). Starting with the realization of an integrated high-precision gravity sensor and strong technology dissemination activities this phase will lay the foundations for applications-specific broadening and wide use of the technol-ogy platform beyond the extension of this project.nnThe long term vision is a modular, scalable and portable quantum technology family based on cold atoms, adaptable to a wide variety of applications in diverse working envi-ronments. Potential applications include fundamental physics tests, quantum ICT devices, satel-lite geodesy, oil / mineral prospecting and communication network timing.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"250072","fundValue":"3329055","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
