{"id":"107430","title":"AAV-mediated Gene Therapy for Haemophilia A","abstractText":"'Haemophilia is a group of hereditary genetic disorders that impair the body's ability to maintain normal blood coagulation. Haemophilia A (clotting factor VIII deficiency) is the most common form of the disorder, occurring in ~1 in 5,000 males in Europe. Although different gene transfer strategies for factor replacement have been evaluated, several properties make adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors the most promising. Most importantly, AAV directs long-term transgene expression from non-dividing cells in animal models after a single administration of vector. In addition, AAV has an excellent safety profile. Unlike other vectors of viral origin, AAV has never been associated with any human disease and is naturally replication deficient.\nThe overriding goal of the proposal is to improve the probability that AAV-mediated FVIII gene transfer can be used to successfully treat patients with haemophilia A. To achieve this goal, the Fellow will 1) establish a simple and efficient GMP compliant manufacturing platform for rAAV-HLP-codop-hFVIII pseudotyped with serotype 8 capsid2) assess the safety and efficacy of this AAV vector encoding a novel, potent FVIII-variant in mice.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"326635","fundValue":"173462.4","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
