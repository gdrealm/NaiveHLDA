{"id":"106711","title":"Decision-making within cells and differentiation entity therapies","abstractText":"'Our ITN has both scientific and therapeutic targets. Research in Work Package 1 (WP1) aims to advance understanding of normal blood cell development and why primitive cells fail to differentiate in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Research in WP2 will use the information gained from WP1 to develop ways of alleviating the differentiation block in AML and so deliver new agents for use in differentiation therapy. This type of therapy aims, using only mildly toxic treatments, to induce terminal maturation of leukaemia cells and accelerate their death. WP2 responds to the urgent need to devise milder treatments, especially for older and frailer AML patients. Participants have already identified a number of promising new therapeutic agents. Working across these two complementary areas will train our Early Stage Researchers (ESR) to understand the translation of new fundamental science into the development of new therapies. The ITN brings together scientists who have made important advances in the fields of haematopoiesis and differentiation therapy, so will provide an excellent scientific training in these areas. Secondments/visits by ESRs to participants who run centres of expertise in leading edge technologies will provide training in these; and the time spent with private sector participants, and the courses they provide, will ensure that ESRs acquire the transferable skills they will need if they are to work well in, and build bridges between, commercial and publicly funded research organisations. ESRs will also receive management training. This research and training, which will develop our ESRs as versatile scientists, will involve the combined efforts of prestigious research institutes and universities, Polandï¿½s leading governmental pharmaceutical R & D institute, two successful biopharmaceutical companies and a leading management consultancy.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"315902","fundValue":"3313022.02","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
