{"id":"106368","title":"Green Initiative for Future Optical Networks","abstractText":"'At present, there is a large demand for green optical networks, viz. backbone optical networks with an increased optical fibre capacity and transmission distance at low operating cost and reduced power consumption. This is dictated by growing applications of e-commerce, e-banking and e-business, broadcasting media and medical applications. GRIFFON addresses the disruptive change in  information and communication solutions towards  drastic energy saving (green) technologies in the context of fast development and delivery of new technology, as well as cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary staff training. GRIFFON offers increased communication capacity through coherent technique with advanced modulation formats and polarisation multiplexing of signals, increased distance  and reduced power consumption by applying an ultra-long  second cascade fibre Raman amplification with supressed polarisation impairments, viz. polarisation dependent gain (PDG) and polarisation mode dispersion (PMD). The project merges four complimentary fields of expertise brought by well-recognized participants: VPI � advanced modelling and design of fibre optic communications links; Aston � high-speed communication systems and Raman technologies; KTH � the development of high-speed transmitters, receivers and modulators for high-capacity fibre optic communications; and ACREO � digital signal processing techniques and algorithms for compensation of linear/nonlinear transmission impairments in coherent communication systems, to create synergy in development of innovative devices and products for new generation of optic fibre communication and secure communication systems. The proposed Academia-Industry Knowledge Transfer Programme will stimulate development of new photonic products, training the researchers through secondments, exchange of skills and recently emerged technologies and will assist to establish a long-term collaboration between the university groups and industry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"324391","fundValue":"1541532.47","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
