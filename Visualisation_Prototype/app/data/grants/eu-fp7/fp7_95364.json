{"id":"95364","title":"Optical Fiber-based Nanobiosensors for Early Prostate Cancer Diagnosis","abstractText":"'This project intends to construct novel nanosized optical fiber-based biosensors which could be applied to detect and monitor the existing telomerase in nucleus of single living cells without significantly altering and/or destructing single cellï¿½s intracellular architecture and physiological function. By studying the level of telomerase in single living cells, early-stage cancer could be detected and diagnosed. This project further aims to develop novel strategies for silver coating and biomolecules immobilisation on optical fiber-based nanoprobes.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254957","fundValue":"240289.6","fundStart":"2010-09-13","fundEnd":"2012-09-12","dataset":"fp7"}
