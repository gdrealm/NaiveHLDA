{"id":"101383","title":"Development of a Novel Treatment for Clostridium Difficile","abstractText":"'We wish to exploit the need for effective treatment for nosocomial diarrhoea especially that caused by Clostridium difficile\n\ndisease (CDD). Patients treated with broad spectrum antibiotics are at greatest risk of CDD diarrhoea and many of those\n\naffected are hospitalised elderly patients with serious underlying illnesses. Antibiotics can cause disruption of the normal\n\nintestinal flora, an important part of the immune system, leading to an overgrowth of CDD. Currently, some 2350 patients\n\nsuffering from chronic CDD in a number of countries have been treated by faecal bacteriotherapy (FB), using samples\n\ncollected from donors. Although this procedure is reported, in a number of small studies, to be around 90% effective, it is\n\nhazardous, in that infection from the donor could be transmitted to the patient and it involves delivery of faecal samples into\n\nthe duodenum via a nasal probe.\n\nWe propose to treat CDD using a modified FB to restore the patientï¿½s original intestinal flora (employing samples collected\n\nfrom the patients themselves prior to their treatment) We will produce novel enteric-coated capsules, containing processed\n\nfreeze dried colonic flora that can be swallowed by a patient to restore their intestinal flora and immunise them against\n\nfurther infection by CDD. RFID tags will be employed to associate capsules with the relevant patient and assist with sample\n\ninventory.\n\n3 SMEs in 3 EU states and 5 distinguished research providers along with 1 OTHER SME in the coordination role will collaborate to provide the necessary technology to the project. The coordinator has previously coordinated an EU proposal and acted as a participant in projects over several\n\nFrameworks. The outcome will be a non-antibiotic medicament to treat and prevent CDD The consortium plan to patent the\n\nIPR from the project, exploit and disseminate the technology worldwide and carry out animal and hospital clinical studies.\n\nThere are no gender issues related to the proposal but animal and human studies will require ethical approval.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"284550","fundValue":"734179","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
