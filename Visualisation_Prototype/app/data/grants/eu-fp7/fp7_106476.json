{"id":"106476","title":"Open Rotor Engines Advanced Technologies II","abstractText":"'A principal contributor to affordable and sustainable public air transportation will be the introduction of more fuel-efficient propulsion systems, one of which is the Open Rotor Engine concept.  Unlike turbofans, open rotors must vary blade pitch to accommodate power and aircraft speed range, so a key element to the viability of the concept is the actuation and control of the blade pitch via the Pitch Change Mechanism (PCM). GE Company Polska, Warsaw Institute of Aviation and GE Aviation Systems Ltd (trading as Dowty Propellers) propose to build on the background of JT1-CS-2009-1-SAGE-02-001 as support for the SAGE 2 engine PCM.  The work packages proposed via this application will focus on the design, manufacturing and testing of key components associated with the down selected PCM concepts from JT1-CS-2009-1-SAGE-02-001. The proposal contains detailed design, manufacturing and assembly of key components and test benches, design and procurement of required instrumentation, key components maturation test plans, description of the test support and test data post processing. The deliverables from the programme will be the definition of the selected key components with 3D models, complete definition of test benches, evaluation of vendors and suppliers. All activities will be summarized in comprehensive reports. The work packages will be closely aligned to the key technologies maturation plans, in preparation for the ground demonstration of the open rotor engine.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"296515","fundValue":"1964531.6","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
