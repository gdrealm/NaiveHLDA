{"id":"91891","title":"The Footprint Left by Aristotle and the Peripatos in the Papyri","abstractText":"'The proposal is aimed to detect and analyse the presence of Aristotle and the Peripatos in the papyri, covering both Greek papyri from Egypt and those from Herculaneum, and utilising the new finds from both the Oxyrhynchus and the Herculaneum collections, as well as the recent research of the Theophrastus project. For that reason, as integral part of this work, it is necessary to inspect the unpublished Oxyrynchus papyri in the Sackler collection in Oxford, provided by Dr. Dirk Obbink, where I recently edited a fragment containing some lines of the third book of Aristotle�s �Rhetoric�. An online database of the results will be built and linked in with the current online projects directed by Dr. Dirk Obbink (see http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235745","fundValue":"164269.69","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
