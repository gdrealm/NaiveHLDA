{"id":"186574","title":"\"Precisely Defined, Surface-Engineered Nanostructures via Crystallization-Driven Self-Assembly of Linear-Dendritic Block Copolymers\"","abstractText":"'Recent advances made in the field of crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) with a crystallisable core-forming block in selective solvents have opened up exciting opportunities in the creation of well-defined nanostructures such as monodisperse cylinders with precisely controlled length. Herein, we propose to study linear-dendritic BCPs and to obtain new, well-defined materials with the dimensional precision provided by CDSA and also higher orders of complexity arising from surface functionalization with dendrimers.\n\nThe overall objectives of this proposal are two-fold. First, to combine well-defined dendrons with crystallizable linear blocks such as metal-containing polyferrocenylsilane (PFS) and crystalline  biodegradable organic blocks such as polycaprolactone (PCL) and polylactide (PLA) to yield linear-dendritic BCPs to further advance fundamental knowledge by studying their self-assembly behavior. Second, by combining CDSA and dendrimer science we intend to take a significant step toward the creation of precisely surface-engineered materials for potential applications in nanomedicine.\nThe proposed research objectives will be accomplished by bringing a highly talented researcher, Dr. Nazemi, from Canada with his extensive experience in dendrimer synthesis and bionanomaterials to stay for 2 years in one of Europeï¿½s highest ranked research laboratories, that of Professor Ian Manners at Bristol. This group is recognised as being among the world leaders in the fields of metallopolymers, BCP self-assembly, and in particular the use of CDSA. At the end of the 2 year stay Dr. Nazemi wishes to return to Canada to take up an academic position at a research-intensive University.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"628405","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
