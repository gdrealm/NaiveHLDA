{"id":"102695","title":"developing hybrid organic-inorganic rotaxanes for quantum information processing","abstractText":"'The proposed project is based on recent results reported (Nature 2009, 458, 314; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2010, 132, 15435) by the Winpenny group where they showed that heterometallic rings could be grown around organic threads, producing a new form of rotaxanes with both inorganic and organic components. [3]rotaxanes could be made as prototypes for two qubit gates for quantum computers.\nQuantum computers will use quantum binary digits, or qubits (the quantum analogue of the classical bit). Their complexity will enable to perform calculations with speeds of millions of times faster than the average PC. A key question is how to link qubits to entangle spins without causing decoherence; The Winpenny group et al. showed that using organic and inorganic components at the molecular level, they could link two molecular nanomagnet prototype qubits into a structure where, depending on the link, they can either communicate or not (Nat. Nanotech. 2009, 4,173).  Here we suggest an innovative proposal to build two qubit rotaxanes that could become part of future devices.  [3]rotaxane provides the ideal framework for making a scalable two qubit gate, because we can develop the two components of the rotaxane separately and then combine in the final structure.  We use the thread to control the through space inter-ring interaction to study the control of coherence times and simultaneously, we will design a �communication strap� through performing chemistry on the rings. Substitution chemistry allows us to include within the rings and stoppers groups that can bind to other metal ions, or surfaces. Physical studies will be made with pulsed EPR spectroscopy both in ground and excited states to measure relaxation times, varying factors like solvent that can influence relaxation times. The advantages over other solid state systems:\nchemistry is cheap and reliable\nallows multiple chemical functions to be incorporated\nheterometallic rings can  involve multiple qubits'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300402","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
