{"id":"86786","title":"Rare Earth  Metal-Organic Frameworks and their Application in Crystal Engineering","abstractText":"'Rare earth complexes are involved in a new scientific approach in crystal engineering. The synthesis will include organic, inorganic, and materials chemistry techniques using lanthanide salts and organic linkers as building blocks for the formation of crystalline molecular 3D networks.  Green chemistry methods applying solvent-free solid-solid and solid-gas preparation techniques will be developed for a high-yield low energy production of new crystalline rare earth materials.  Analysis of the new compounds will not only be based on advanced X-ray structure determination using single-crystals and crystalline powders but also on microscopy, thermoanalytical, and spectroscopical analysis of the expected luminescent crystals.  Training and collaborations of the researcher in an industrial company and university working and learning new aspects in the field of polymorph screening will guarantee a deeper insight into the optical and solid-state properties of the produced solids as well as their formation of polymorphs. The combination of the analytical and scientific expertise between the University of Bristol and the collaborators create a unique environment for a new rare earth based research in the field of crystal engineering.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219977","fundValue":"128035.46","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
