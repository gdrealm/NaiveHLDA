{"id":"88259","title":"The Chernobyl Tissue Bank ï¿½ Coordinating International Research on Radiation Induced Thyroid Cancer","abstractText":"'This proposal is for continued support for a high quality tissue bank of clinically and pathologically annotated biological samples from patients who have developed thyroid tumours following exposure to radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear accident. It not only provides biological material to researchers world-wide but will collate research data from all projects using the resource in a web-accessible data warehouse, and provide a suite of bioinformatic tools for secondary datamining studies. Biological data will be linked to dosimetry data, as well as data on clinical presentation and outcome. It will provide a coordinated approach to specimens collected to agreed standard operating procedures and quality standards. The project will provide an unequalled resource for research on the health consequences of exposure of a population to radiation from a nuclear accident.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"211712","fundValue":"1751738.27","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
