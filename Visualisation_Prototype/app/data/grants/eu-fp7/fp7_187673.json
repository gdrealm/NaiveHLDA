{"id":"187673","title":"Novel materials for organic electronics","abstractText":"'A series of  new conjugated polymer materials and conjugated small molecules based on new isoindigo analogues core for high performance, air stable, ambipolar OTFTs and/or OPV will be developed. The main requirements of the materials are: (1) enough solubility for solution processability; (2) decreased LUMO level (increased electron affinity) and HOMO level (to achieve air stability) with a low band gap; (3) highly organized microstructure with favourable molecular orbitals packing along the larger and planar pi-system direction.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"622187","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2014-06-02","fundEnd":"2016-06-01","dataset":"fp7"}
