{"id":"99404","title":"Decoding User Experience Qualities with and through Technology over Time","abstractText":"'User Experience (UX) is a complex, but promising concept in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This Marie Curie project aims to identify the key �UXCodes�, in particular to decode the UX qualities for a better ICT-enabled life for older people, following a humanistic, dialogical approach. The key premise is that people act on the basis of social relationships, which influence the quality of an experience with a technology. Gained insights are translated into for practical guidance for designers and generalized by applying experience-centered theories and research methodologies. In addition, the pattern approach is applied as valuable way to preserve knowledge for practitioners in future projects, and optimising technological innovation and opportunity for older people to enrich their lived experience with and through technology.\n\nThe European Union also recognized the relevance of this topic by focusing research on �Quality of Experience (QoE)� within the FP7 ICT Work Programme 2009-10 and calls for research into �more natural, intuitive and easy-to-use interfaces and new ways to interact with technology, machines, devices and other artefacts.� The proposed research will underpin the essential priority of ICTs in supporting daily life in today's digital society.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"274012","fundValue":"200549.6","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
