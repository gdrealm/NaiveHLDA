{"id":"187019","title":"Future Perfect: Ernest Dichter and Consumer Society in Europe and North America","abstractText":"'The applicant, Prof Regina Lee Blaszczyk, is the Leadership Chair in the History of Business and Society in the School of History at the University of Leeds.  The aim of this CIG is to help Blaszczyk, who moved to Europe in Feb 2013, to integrate her specialized expertise in the cultural history of business into the University of Leeds, the UK, and the EU. The research is built around a historical study of advertising, marketing, and design practice from the 1930s to the 1990s, using the transatlantic career of Austrian �migr� Ernest Dichter, often called the �father of motivational research�, as a focal point. The research will explore connections between Europe and America starting in the Great Depression and focusing on the Cold War, providing a platform for re-examining transatlantic consumer culture. The research will seek to develop a better understanding of how American and European ideas and practices influenced business culture around the world. The knowledge and skills gained during the fellowship will help the applicant integrate into the European research community, while the publications and dissemination activities will have important implications for EU-level policy makers concerned with business competitiveness in the creative economy.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"631789","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
