{"id":"105499","title":"Extreme Events Variability over Europe","abstractText":"'This project aims at the investigation and analysis of causes for synoptic- to decadal scale variability in the occurrence of meteorological and climatological extreme events over the North-Atlantic/ European region. Focus of the study will thus be to increase the understanding of variability steering factors and to enable a deeper understanding of processes involved in modulating the frequency and intensity of extreme events on the time scales from days up to 30 years and beyond. This understanding should help to allow estimates of necessary adaptation strategies to anthropogenic climate change impacts and their timely planning and initialization. Focus will be laid on severe extra-tropical cyclones as the major meteorological hazard to Europe, as well as on hydro-meteorological combined risks like heat waves and droughts. For the time horizon beyond 2040, scenario based simulations will be investigated to deduce estimates on long-term developments. The project will additionally concentrate on the estimation of damage potentials for wind storm and heat waves on different time scales linking the underpinning science to end-user needs.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"322208","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
