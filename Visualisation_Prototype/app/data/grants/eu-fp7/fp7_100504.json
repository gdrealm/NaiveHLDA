{"id":"100504","title":"GREENHOUSE GAS RECOVERY FROM COAL MINES AND UNMINEABLE COALBEDS AND CONVERSION TO ENERGY","abstractText":"Coal mining and utilisation results in release of significant amounts methane and represent an important threat to the fight against climate change.  Coal Mine Methane drainage processes can be set up to recover methane from the emissions during coal production. Methane can also be extracted from virgin coal seams trough primary and enhanced coalbed methane recovery. The main objective of the proposed research project is to contribute to the global GHG emissions reduction objective by addressing the key challenges facing the industry and emerging economies which also are major coal mining counties worlwide.  This objective canbe expanded upon as follows:\n\n\n\n- to achieve significant improvements in methane drainage efficiency and purity in coal mines in the emerging economies of China and India, where methane drainage is employed with relatively low yields of gas and purity.\n\n\n\n- to develop a novel and effective gas drainage techniques for the ultra-thick seam and gassy mining operations in Europe\n\n\n\n- to investigate the benefits of implementing horizontal wells for coalbed methane (CBM) and coupling horizontal wells with the injection of CO2 and/or CO2 enriched flue gas to enhance methane recovery and CO2 storage\n\n\n\n- to disseminate the know-how developed across the coal sector internationally\n\n","grantUrl":"","grantId":"268194","fundValue":"2447811.2","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
