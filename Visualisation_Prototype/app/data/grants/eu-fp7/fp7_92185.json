{"id":"92185","title":"ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON ANDALUCIAN POTTERY (8TH-11TH CENTURIES)","abstractText":"'This project is intended to study pottery from the Early Medieval Vega of Granada (Spain, 8th to 11th centuries) with archaeometrical and cutting-edge approaches. The aspects researched on will be the changes in technology, distribution, use of resources and organization of pottery production. The techniques used for the study will include thin section petrography and chemical (NAA and SEM) analyses, reproduction of actual shaping techniques and comparisons with local clay samples, known collections of studied materials and ethnological examples. The results will be linked with the evolution of society and economy in the Early Medieval Vega of Granada, where great changes were taking place. These changes are related to the general process of decline of the Roman world in the Mediterranean and the emergence in the territories of Spain of an Islamic State that would be known as al-Andalus. It has been shown in an earlier work (PhD thesis defended by the applicant) that pottery production and distribution reflects these changes. The insights that this project can offer will allow a better understanding of this questions and the linking of the Andalusian pottery production and socio-economic evolution with those of the rest of the Islamic world.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"236314","fundValue":"172434.64","fundStart":"2010-09-13","fundEnd":"2012-09-12","dataset":"fp7"}
