{"id":"108657","title":"GREENECONET: A best practice platform to support the transition towards a green economy","abstractText":"'The unsustainable path of our current economic system in managing both natural and man-made resources demands a paradigm shift in our idea of economic development. We need to define an innovative, multidisciplinary and integrate approach to identify, develop and deploy technologies, tools and services promoting a transition to a low-carbon, sustainable, resilient and socially comprehensive economic development. This new economic paradigm has been called �the green economy�. The contribution of private enterprises and business communities toward the transition to a green economy has often been underestimated. Yet, Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) and corporate actors work as key players and they have the power to change the socio-economic and physical landscape. Many SMEs and corporate actors have introduced innovative solutions which have greatly contributed to our understanding of �green economy�, and have developed revolutionary organisational, behavioural and technological approaches to the problem of sustainability and human well-being. Despite these developments, a large part of the business communities lag behind the �best in class�. The aim of our project is to address two problems: 1) the disconnection between best in class / benchmark �green business� practices and the wider business communities 2) the disconnection between applied research institutions investigating models for a transition to a �green economy� and the business community. We will do so through the design, deployment and use of a suite of instruments and a series of activities, i.e. a �platform�, aimed at developing an exchange network of best practices involving the �best in class� private enterprises, the academic research institutions, business networks and the wider business community, with a special focus on SMEs. The GREENECONET platform aims at becoming the reference point of access for actors who desires to become involved in the �green economy�.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"603939","fundValue":"1144189.4","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
