{"id":"109341","title":"Randomised controlled trial to evaluate electronic Symptom Management using the Advanced Symptom Management System (ASyMS) Remote Technology for patients with cancers","abstractText":"'The eSMART programme of work will demonstrate the effects of a real-time, mobile phone based, remote patient monitoring intervention on key patient outcomes and delivery of care provided to people with cancer during and after chemotherapy. Utilising the remote patient monitoring system, the Advanced Symptom Management System (ASyMS), will reduce the symptom burden experienced by patients receiving chemotherapy, improve their quality of life (QoL) during acute treatment and survivorship, and result in changes in clinical practice and improved delivery of care for patients with cancer. eSMART involves 11 European and one American partner as well as cancer care clinicians from all partner countries. A two-group, multicentre, repeated-measures randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted across 16 sites in Europe, 1108 patients will be recruited. Adult (>18 years) patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal cancer or haematological cancers, commencing first-line chemotherapy and planned to receive at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy will be invited to participate. Work will take place in four consecutive phases. Members of the European Cancer Patient Coalition have an integral role as advisors at every stage of the programme to provide advice and feedback and ensure that work is conducted in line with patientsï¿½ perspectives and needs. eSMART will demonstrate how delivering patient focused, anticipatory care via technology can improve outcomes for people with cancer whilst simultaneously addressing the increasing demands on acute services across Europe by; enhancing  patient outcomes and quality-of-life improvement; promoting of advances in cancer care; reducing social and economic barriers in cancer care; accelerating interoperability and collaboration across Europe and enhancing the economic stimulation of the National Health markets.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"602289","fundValue":"7815033.74","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
