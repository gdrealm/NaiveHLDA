{"id":"188150","title":"Atlantic Late Bronze Age Interaction through Metal Hoards","abstractText":"'The aim of this project is to examine the nature and the degree of interaction between the Late Bronze Age communities of the European Atlantic fa�ade (c. 1300-850 BC) through the study of metal hoards. We propose to determine the similarities and differences expressed by the hoards in different spheres (economic, technological, ideological and religious) by undertaking an intensive and comparative study of the phenomenon in four selected geographical areas. To achieve this objective, priority will be given to obtaining data using a standardised methodology in areas located in different regions on the Atlantic fa�ade (Portugal, Spain, France and England). This is a crucial aspect as previous studies have often been based on partial information that is not very standardised and therefore difficult to analyse in an integrated manner.\nHoards constitute an excellent source of information for tracing technological and cultural similarities and differences over extensive geographical areas, given that they reflect deliberate acts of hiding, offering or depositing certain objects. While other facets of the archaeological record may be the result of chance or routine action, in the hoards there is an intentional and conscious dimension that is in keeping with specific, culturally important ideological schemes.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"628959","fundValue":"299558.4","fundStart":"2014-04-28","fundEnd":"2016-04-27","dataset":"fp7"}
