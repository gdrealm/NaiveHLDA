{"id":"98604","title":"New chemical tools for profiling protein lipidation in cancer","abstractText":"'This project aims to develop chemical probes and technologies that will enable for the first time high-throughput analysis and exploration of the complex biological networks involved in protein lipidation. These chemical tools will be applied to mapping the changes in lipidation that occur in the proliferation and survival of cancer cells, with the ultimate objective of identifying and validating cellular mechanisms that can be targeted for future chemotherapy. The proposed work is multidisciplinary, combining organic synthesis with proteomics and cell biology. As such it lies at the cutting edge of chemical biology, and will permit the applicant to gain skills and independence to found an independent group in chemical biology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"273868","fundValue":"209092.8","fundStart":"2011-07-17","fundEnd":"2013-07-16","dataset":"fp7"}
