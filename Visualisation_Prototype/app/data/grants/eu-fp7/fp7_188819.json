{"id":"188819","title":"\"Flare Chromospheres: Observations, Models and Archives\"","abstractText":"'We propose a focused space-based and ground-based multi-mode, multi-wavelength study of solar flares - the most intense energy release events in the solar system. We will center our attention on the flare chromosphere, from which most of the radiation originates. This work calls on space-based and ground-based observations, plus theoretical and modeling expertise. The project will have two major outcomes: advances in our understanding of the physics of energy dissipation and radiation in the flaring solar atmosphere, and a catalogue and archive facility for the solar physics community to access combined ground-based and space-based datasets for well-observed flare events, and flare atmospheric models to aid in data  interpretation. It will have scientific impacts for both solar and stellar flare communities. We plan a dissemination activity for public and scientific communities alike, including an effort to involve amateur astronomers in co-ordinated flare campaigns.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"606862","fundValue":"2811687.6","fundStart":"2013-09-24","fundEnd":"2017-01-01","dataset":"fp7"}
