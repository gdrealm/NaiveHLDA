{"id":"105346","title":"New Material Processing Technologies for Sustainable Future","abstractText":"'This Marie Curie IRSES project involves 4 European and 3 Chinese institutions with 70 researchers to participate in a comprehensive exchange programme in developing new and innovative material processing technologies for future generation of sustainable manufacturing. This is a vital area for continued success and competitiveness of EU economy and for the realisation of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth as a key objective of the Europe 2020 strategy. All partners within the consortium are fully committed to the project not just because they bring together a highly complementary knowledge base, a critical mass of researchers with expertise in a wide scope of material processing technologies and a pool of state-of-the-art facilities and infrastructure. More importantly they have a shared vision and aspiration for long- term research collaboration and technical innovation in developing new material processing technologies for a sustainable future.\nThe project sets out three ambitious goals for maximised technical innovation, knowledge transfer/creation and dissemination. These goals will be achieved by\n�\tcarrying out extensive collaborative research and joint activities  in the field of new material processing technologies for stimulated creativity and innovative solutions and identified areas of industrial applications;\n�\tfacilitating exchange of experienced staff and talented young researchers for transfer of knowledge and skills through various forms of activities including organisation of research seminars/workshops, summer schools and high profile conferences;\n�\tdisseminating high quality research and establishing long-term collaboration through joint research programmes and collaborative projects with a wider participation of research communities, SMEs and OEMs from different industrial sectors.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"318968","fundValue":"793800","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
