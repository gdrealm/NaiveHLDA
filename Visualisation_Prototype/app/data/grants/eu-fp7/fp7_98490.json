{"id":"98490","title":"Carbon Nanotubes Technologies in Pulsed Fibre Lasers  for Telecom and\nSensing Applications","abstractText":"Nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), quantum dots, nanowires, are prime candidates as building blocks in nanotechnology, because they assemble themselves and have a combination of unique electronic, optical, thermal and mechanical properties. The optical properties of nanomaterials mainly depend on their size and shapes and can be optimized in a very broad spectral range. Importantly, such materials can display the resonant optical nonlinearities useful for generation of ultrashort pulse lasers, pulse shaping applications and noise suppression.\n\nOur goal is to create an ambitious research exchange program, with a strong interdisciplinary nature, crossing materials engineering, physics, chemistry and soft matter sciences to achieve a major breakthrough in the understanding of the optical properties of nanomaterials. This knowledge will be useful for development of efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) devices, using novel speciality fibres and waveguides. The final target of the program is implementation of a NLO device in fibre lasers in order to achieve ultrashort pulse generation in the optical range important for telecommunication, environmental and biological sensing.\n\nThe exchange program will benefit from participation of leading experts in nanomaterials, optical spectroscopy, computation chemistry, fibre optics and lasers from both EU and Partner countries. Therefore it will be a very attractive and useful opportunity for training of early stage researchers.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269271","fundValue":"201400","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
