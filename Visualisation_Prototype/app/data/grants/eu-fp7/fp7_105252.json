{"id":"105252","title":"Beta cell preservation via antigen-specific immunotherapy in Type 1 Diabetes: Enhanced Epidermal Antigen Delivery Systems","abstractText":"'Current  approaches to improving glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes are centered on increasingly complex insulin delivery systems. However,  less  than 30% of patients can achieve target  levels of glucose control with this approach even  in a clinical trial setting  and many patients are either unable or unwilling to make  the personal commitment required. By contrast, preservation of even  small amounts of endogenous insulin production, has been shown  to improve glycaemic control, reduce hypoglycaemia, improve quality of life and reduce long-term complications. Importantly, glycemic control in the presence of endogenous beta  cell function is not demanding and hence would be effective across the full spectrum of individuals.  Antigen specific immunotherapy (ASI) is the preferred approach to beta  cell preservation since  this avoids  the risks of immunosuppression. Attempts  at ASI to date  although successful in preclinical models have  had limited efficacy in humans. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of novel approaches to deliver effective ASI.\nOur Enhanced Epidermal ï¿½ Antigen Specific Immunotherapy (EE-ASI) system represents an innovative  approach to ASI created by combining  technologies brought  by our academic and 2 SME partners. A beta  cell target  T cell epitope (proinsulin C19-A3) will be combined with the tolerogenic cytokine IL-10 and targeted to antigen presenting cells via gold nanoparticles and delivery into the very superficial  layers  of the skin using microneedles. Validation of manufacture, in vitro and in vivo preclinical efficacy will be demonstrated followed by a phase 1 clinical trial to confirm safety  in humans.\nWe anticipate that the EE-ASI system will be less  costly, more effective and more acceptable to patients in improving glycaemic control than exogenous insulin replacement. Intellectual  property,  regulatory and ethical issues will be carefully addressed in order to maximise exploitation  of this integrated system for the benefit of the SMEs.'","grantUrl":"http://www.ee-asi.eu","grantId":"305305","fundValue":"7809429.8","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
