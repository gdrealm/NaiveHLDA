{"id":"93443","title":"New metal catalised C�H bond activation strategies for chemical synthesis","abstractText":"'The capacity to selectively functionalise either small molecules or more complex structures represents a persistent and ever increasing challenge in chemical synthesis. Transition metal catalysed coupling reactions have offered a revolutionary solution to the problem of selective derivatisation that has transformed the way we do synthesis over the last 30 years. However, while these precise reactions almost always proceed as planned this is because you �pay up front� for selectivity by using pre-functionalised building blocks (which of course have to be synthesised selectively themselves). This problem has been partly overcome because of the vast number of small specifically functionalised building blocks that are now available from commercial sources. However, in more complex systems it is not always possible and indeed becomes increasingly more complicated to carry orthogonally reactive motifs through a synthesis in order to exploit further conventional coupling tactics at a later stage. Therefore, the development of new methods for the selective controllable functionalisation of small and/or complex molecules is still a pivotal aspect of modern chemical synthesis. One of the major research theme�s in our research group is a programme dedicated to the development of new reactivity concepts that enable the design of metal catalysed C�H bond functionalisation strategies. Of particular importance in our design blueprint for these new C�H bond functionalisation concepts is (i) controllable and flexible regioselectivity of the new reactions, (ii) mild and facile reaction conditions and (iii) substrate generality. In order to achieve this we try to develop new chemical reactivity principles as part of our catalytic strategies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"236136","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
