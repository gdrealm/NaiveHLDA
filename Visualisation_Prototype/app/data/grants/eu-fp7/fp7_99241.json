{"id":"99241","title":"Random fibre lasers for telecommunications and distributed sensing","abstractText":"'The proposed 4-year program of knowledge transfer and networking between 3 EU and 3 Russian partners with the world leading expertise targets an emerging area of ultra-long fibre lasers and random fibre lasers and their telecommunication and sensing applications. The goal of the proposed research is to establish an efficient and stable knowledge transfer mechanisms to improve project partners possibilities in designing, development and applications of new laser sources for advanced emerging applications in high-speed optical communication and distributed fibre-optic sensing. Training, knowledge transfer and exchange of skills in laser science, communications, sensing, laser systems and nonlinear science are important to provide EU teams with a cutting edge expertise that will allow project partners to ensure world leading positions. The proposed 33 consortium brings together world known groups with very complimentary expertise, techniques and skills directly relevant to the project goals. The objective of the proposed joint exchange programme is to establish long-term stable research cooperation between the partners with broad combined expertise and knowledge. The project objectives and challenges present a balanced mix between industrial application focused knowledge transfer and development and more far-looking studies for potentially ground-breaking applications of random fibre lasers for sensing and telecommunication applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269242","fundValue":"368600","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
