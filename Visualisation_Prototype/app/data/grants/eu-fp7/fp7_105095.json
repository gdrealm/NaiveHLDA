{"id":"105095","title":"SMA Cytec Multilayer Prepreg","abstractText":"'The use of advanced composite materials brings to the aircraft design the benefits coming from a reduction in part counts and a simplification in the inspection and maintenance procedures. Hail, bird impacts and runway debris represents a big threat for aircraft structures and their effects shall be taken into account in the design phase leading to a redundant design and reducing the advantages coming from the use of CFRP. This problem affects in particular the regional aircrafts with their reduced fuselage thickness. CFRPs reinforced with a structure capable to increase significantly the impact-resistance and the damage tolerance characteristics could solve most of the problems coming from the use of composite materials on sensible aircraft parts. In particular, the adoption of a metallic mesh embedded into a CFRP panel seems to be one of the most promising solutions to improve the overall performance; in particular, the SMA fibres offer the possibility to realise a high-performance composite allowing a significant increase of mechanical properties opening also the way to the multifunctionality of the future aircraft structures Cytec Engineered Materials (CEM), relying on the great experience acquired in decades of research, manufacturing and application of advanced epoxy systems to the aerospace market, can bring to this problem the know-how required to reach a smart and sustainable solution. CEM will select of the most suitable materials (carbon reinforcement, resin system and metallic mesh) and will identify a method for prepreg manufacturing. The activities will then be focused on manufacturing and characterization of coupons and small panels realised with the selected base constituents. Specific characterisation tests will be carried out to validate the results and the results will be summarized in a report including assessment and benefits.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252045","fundValue":"149700","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
