{"id":"99463","title":"Functional semiconductor nanowire probes","abstractText":"'Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is an established technique for the characterisation of materials and structures at the nanoscale and is increasingly bridging traditional disciplines including the biosciences. As such, it is of fundamental and practical interest across the sciences and industry. The geometry of the tip is the critical factor which determines the resolution of an SPM sensor. In an attempt to achieve ultra high spatial resolution, carbon nanotubes have been widely investigated and shown some promise. However, it is extremely difficult to control the properties of these tubes, especially the electrical behaviour and growth geometry. Equally, their manipulation is a daunting task. We propose to use III-V semiconductor nanowires as functioning sensors at the apex of scanning probes. These structures can be directly grown on the substrates or SPM cantilevers with controllable properties at the nanometre scale. Using these nanowires offers excellent new avenues for the integration of established semiconducting devices onto the tip of a scanning probe. This will improve the sensitivity and functionality of scanning probe methods. An example of potential applications for such a novel probe is the detection of virus based on their electrical response which can be coupled to that of nanowires under appropriate conditions. Within the framework of this project, we will combine the complementary expertise of various internationally leading institutions for the creation of integrated individual semiconductor nanowire SPM probes exhibiting enhanced functionalities.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269169","fundValue":"374300","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
