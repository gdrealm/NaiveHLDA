{"id":"101034","title":"A Novel and combined domestic grey water treatment and heat recovery system suitable for cost effective  installation in 90% of European households","abstractText":"'AquaConserver concept addresses the twin problems of energy and water conservation faced by all citizens of the EU27 and offer us, as Europe�s leading SME Plumber, equipment suppliers and consulting Associations, at this specific time, an opportunity to bring a new demand-led, offering to our customers, requiring high levels of expertise and training to install correctly and efficiently. Our concept involves the development of a low cost, retro-fittable to 90% of domestic dwellings, water recycling system that is capable of the re-use of showering and bathing water thereby saving up to 50% of personal washing water usage and >50% of the associated heating energy usage AND that is capable of re-using filtered grey water from bathing/showering for toilet flushing thereby saving up to 35% of overall household water usage�.  The key issue and barriers to large scale uptake of these systems is their high installed cost, decades pay-back periods and their ongoing maintenance issues and that they are so large and require internal locations or are fitted in outside pits that they are not suitable for most consumers houses/flats. We believe that we as the Associations that represent the majority of installers can develop a low cost, low maintenance AquaConserver grey water recycling and heat recovery system that can be affordably installed in 90% of all domestic households and therefore become the market leader.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"286900","fundValue":"1886001.2","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
