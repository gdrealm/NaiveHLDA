{"id":"99005","title":"RFID EXPERIENCE AND PRIVACY IN THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT. INDICATIONS FOR IN-STORE CONSUMER RESEARCH","abstractText":"'This two years research project adopts an interdisciplinary approach by merging social-psychology research with computer technologies developments in the built environment to reach three main goals: 1) understanding the impact of social-psychological factors on issues of �privacy concerns� for  ubiquitous technologies within the context of consumption; 2) exploring how the adoption of ubiquitous technologies (such as RFID-enabled services) affects consumers� perception of the in-store environment and influences consumer experience; 3) the test of  mobile devices for in-store consumer research. The first two research goals draw on emerging questions in the ICTs and consumer psychology literatures whereas with the third one indications for a business application of technology are sought.  The first research objective is pursued by means of two studies: 1) qualitative in-store interviews to verify consumers� needs for privacy in different behavioural contexts of RFID-enabled information services. Data will explain the relations between consumers� profiles, goal orientations, products, information provided by technology, and privacy needs. 2) an experimental study on the impact of perceived control/empowerment on privacy concerns and trust as dependent variables. The second research goal is pursued by examining consumers� narratives of their experience in the shopping context. Phenomenic Qualitative Interviews are conducted after consumers use of RFID-enabled services within the in-store space. A novel  approach to qualitative  interviewing for the study of experience is attempted by prompting consumers introspection and self-reports via mobile devices. Data analyses account for age differences in order to identify special key issues for the elderly segment and formulate possible guidelines. Finally, data from the above studies are merged with usability testing to develop a new device for in-store consumer research.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"273475","fundValue":"279680","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
