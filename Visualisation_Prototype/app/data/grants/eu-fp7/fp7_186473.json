{"id":"186473","title":"Graphene-Assembled Inorganic Hollow Fibre Membranes and Membrane Modules for Water Treatment","abstractText":"'Membrane-based filtration technologies nowadays are standard separation processes and widely used in water treatment. The performance of membranes is however limited by their thickness. This project combines the cutting-edge technologies of membrane fabrication and the science of graphene materials to realize high-performance graphene membranes for water treatment purposes. This project will develop graphene membranes supported by inorganic hollow fibre substrates. The thickness of the graphene membrane layer will be less than 5 nm and down to one C-atom layer, with a nominal pore size from 0.3 to 20 nm. The graphene hollow fibre membrane will be able to used in water treatment and overwhelm other membranes with the same pore size by at least fifty times higher permeation flux. Furthermore in this project we will assemble membrane modules of above graphene hollow fibre membranes and build a lab-scale demo plant to evaluate the applicability of the graphene membrane modules in real applications. By the research of this project, a set of methodologies and knowledge of preparing graphene hollow fiber membranes and membrane modules will be developed.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"627591","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
