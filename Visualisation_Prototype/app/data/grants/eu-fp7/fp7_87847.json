{"id":"87847","title":"AdS/CFT correspondence: extrapolation techniques and space-time geometry from gauge theories","abstractText":"'The main goal of this proposal is to study several aspects of a conjectured equivalence between certain string theories and gauge field theories, known as AdS/CFT correspondence. It is expected that the outcome of this proposal will broaden the current understanding of the AdS/CFT correspondence in various directions.  One of the specific objectives is to extend the use of integrability tools  to more general settings, for instance when D-branes and open strings are included. Integrability methods have played a central role in understanding the planar limit description of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Another goal is to develop and apply new techniques for interpolating between the weak and strong coupling descriptions in cases where integrability is not granted. Finally, these and other approaches will be  exploited to reconstruct geometrical information of the space-time background where the strings are propagating, by only analysing the dual gauge field theory point of view. In general, it is aimed to improve the understanding of how geometrical notions are encoded in the strong coupling regime of gauge theories.  The concretion of these objectives is expected to contribute to the development of the tools and notions that might be necessary for a future proof of the AdS/CFT correspondence.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"220702","fundValue":"174111.18","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
