{"id":"97918","title":"REDD Fast Logging Assessment & Monitoring Environment","abstractText":"'The REDD Fast Logging Assessment & Monitoring Environment (REDD-FLAME) project will design, prototype and demonstrate a system capable of monitoring tropical and sub-tropical forests using high-resolution radar (and optical) imagery acquired by Earth Observation satellites. By focussing on early detection of logging activities, the system will provide the means to quickly identify the first signs of deforestation and thus act as a tool to control resource use and sustainable development within these fragile and valuable environments. The system will form a high-resolution add-on for existing (semi-)operational low- to mid-resolution systems, providing hot-spot monitoring for areas at highest risk of deforestation. As such, it could be integrated into national or regional forest monitoring centres and provide inputs for large scale carbon emission assessments in the context of the UN-REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Programme.\n\nThe system will be developed in collaboration with investigators from developing countries on three continents in an effort to build lasting partnerships and transfer European expertise. Sites in Indonesia, Brazil and Mozambique have been chosen to represent a variety of forest types and deforestation issues, and thus to test the systemï¿½s versatility.\n\nThe REDD-FLAME project will bring benefits to a wide range of parties concerned with deforestation in tropical and sub-tropical environments and build capacity in the host countries for managing forest resources and carbon balances. By implementing a dedicated version of REDD-FLAME for each participating ICP country, results targeted at their specific monitoring requirements, based on the strategies and policies for deforestation in place, will be provided to give timely information on logging activities and deforestation.'","grantUrl":"http://redd-flame.info/","grantId":"263142","fundValue":"616106.8","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
