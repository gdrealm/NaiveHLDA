{"id":"101449","title":"High density energy storage materials","abstractText":"'There is an urgent need to develop high density energy storage materials for application in electric vehicles and power conditioning systems. These will enable us to extend the usage of renewable energies. None of the existing storage media completely meets the current requirements. In this project new capacitive storage materials will be designed and fabricated, composed of high permittivity ceramic powders with small amounts of polymers, with structure and properties integrated to ensure high energy density, plus with high power density and long lifetime. These features will lead to energy storage systems that are small size, light weight, cost effective and environmentally friendly. The proposed research may not only lead to the development of new storage materials for industrial applications but also an improved scientific understanding of high density energy storage.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"274123","fundValue":"280680","fundStart":"2011-11-28","fundEnd":"2013-11-27","dataset":"fp7"}
