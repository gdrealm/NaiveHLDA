{"id":"90464","title":"Optimal seismic rehabilitation of reinforced concrete buildings using FRP composites","abstractText":"'This study aims to develop an original practical optimisation technique for seismic rehabilitation of RC structures using FRP composites. The proposed method is capable of producing retrofit designs that minimize the total material cost of FRP by at least 20% while optimising the seismic performance of the structure. Based on the outcomes of this study, design guidelines for optimum seismic rehabilitation of reinforced concrete buildings using FRP composites will be provided. These design guidelines should prove useful for engineers involved with rehabilitation of building structures and will lead to both reliable and cost-effective designs. The guidelines will be prepared in consultation with Task Group 9.3 of the International Federation of Concrete (fib). The host institution has an excellent record in European grants and the host group plays a leading role in the field of FRP internationally. The researcher has an excellent academic track record in the field of Earthquake Engineering and Structural Optimisation Techniques and has received numerous awards for his excellence in research and knowledge transfer.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"236282","fundValue":"180216.74","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
