{"id":"94131","title":"\"Origins, proliferation and pathogenesis of L-form (cell wall deficient) bacteria\"","abstractText":"'Jeff Errington is a bacterial molecular cell biologist with nearly 30 years of research experience. He spent much of the first 15 years or so working on spore formation in B. subtilis as a simple model for development and differentiation. His lab developed a method with which to clone the complete set of sporulation genes and then contributed in a major way to working out how sporulation is controlled spatially and temporally. Work on the spatial control of gene expression and protein localization led him to pioneer some of the methods of digital imaging of bacteria on which the modern field of bacterial cell biology was founded. He has contributed in a major way to understanding the division machinery of bacterial cells and particularly how division is restricted to the correct mid cell position. Errington made the seminal discovery that bacteria have true homologues of actin (MreB proteins) and showed that MreB filaments govern cell shape by directly organising the cell wall synthetic machinery. Recent work has opened up the neglected field of L-form bacteria to molecular and cellular analysis by developing methods to study the L-form state in a controlled way in B. subtilis. Errington has promoted the commercialization of the basic science emerging from his lab through foundation of a spin-out company Prolysis Ltd, which has developed the first cell division inhibitors with proven efficacy. Errington has founded the new Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology in Newcastle, to promote the recovery of basic science on model bacterial cells and has recruited several world leading experts to the Centre. Over his career he has helped train nearly 50 graduate students and post-docs, many of whom have gone on to become independent group leaders. He is an elected Fellow of several internationally important Academies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"250363","fundValue":"2028888.6","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
