{"id":"107410","title":"RESIDENTIAL ANALYSIS - \nHOW DO LATENT ORDERS DETERMINE RESIDENTIAL DYNAMICS OF MINORITIES IN EAST-LONDON?","abstractText":"'Religious groups have become a salient factor of urban residential dynamics in Western society. The residential decisions of the sect's members follow, at least in part, the directives of the leaders, and the latter are interested in reinforcing their power through group segregation and social exclusion. What is the dynamic of residential competition between groups and a society of individuals? Can individualistic Western society withstand the pressure of a sect that decides to 'seize' a neighborhood? Will the city pattern turn into a network of voluntary ghettos within a retreating pluralistic society? The applicant intends to investigate these questions in east London, where minorities preserve tradition based on family ties in compact areas. This study will recognize latent orders that determine residential dynamics of minorities, spotlighting in high resolution the role of group versus individual residential behaviors and investigates its effect with regards to Private and Community housing, focusing on the Bangladeshi Muslim community.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"328820","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
