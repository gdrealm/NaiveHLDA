{"id":"187880","title":"Dimensional micro and nanometrology using areal topography data produced by 3D surface metrology instruments","abstractText":"'The project investigates the development of original methods and algorithms for the dimensional and geometric verification of products and/or surface features defined at micro and nanometric scales. The idea is to overcome the current limitations of SEM imaging (only qualitative information) and micro/nano CMMs (slow, difficult to use) through an unconventional use of measurement data produced by advanced 3D profilometers and microscopes, which are being currently adopted in surface metrology for areal surface texture assessment.\nThe ultimate goal is to produce a traceable, or at least reproducible measurement solution that can be used for quality inspection of micro/nano fabricated parts and devices, and/or for accurate measurement of defects and other singularities in precision engineering applications.  Such a solution would finally provide a reliable and quantitative feedback to those research and industrial applications concerned with precision engineering, and/or seeking to improve the design and manufacturing processes typically adopted at the micro and sub-micrometric scales.\nThrough the fellowship, the applicant will be able to join one of the most prolific and internationally renown research groups in surface metrology, and will be able to combine his previous experiences on algorithmic data processing for surface metrology with cutting-edge knowledge on the mode of operation and metrological performance of the most advanced surface metrology instruments currently available. Original solutions for dimensional micro and nanometrology will be devised by investigating a wide array of test cases of academic and industrial relevance pertaining MEMS, microfluidic devices, micro-textured surfaces and many other types of engineered high-precision surfaces.  In addition to providing measurement solutions of wide applicability, the fellowship will give the applicant an invaluable opportunity to progress towards maturity and full scientific independence.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"624770","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2015-02-09","fundEnd":"2017-02-08","dataset":"fp7"}
