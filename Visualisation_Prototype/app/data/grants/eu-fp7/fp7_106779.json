{"id":"106779","title":"Sustainable Synthesis of Metal-Organic Frameworks","abstractText":"'Research undertaken on ERC Advanced Grant 226593 (COORDSPACE) has delivered a new exciting range of the multi-functional materials known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These substances have ultra-high porosity and this makes them ideal for many high value applications including gas storage, carbon capture, gas and substrate separation, sensing, drug delivery, photo-optics, magnetic devices and catalysis. However, the major barrier to their commercialisation is their lack of availability in high scale via economically and environmentally viable production routes. Our research has established for the first time (patent application in progress) the use of high temperature water using flow technologies for the sustainable synthesis of porous MOF materials. This represents an important advance in the preparation of MOFs by removing the need for toxic and expensive organic solvents, and removing the need for purification and removal of organic solvents from the prepared materials. Furthermore, flow technologies offer exciting and potentially economic routes to scale-up of these materials for potential commercialisation and we estimate our process reduces the cost of MOF manufacture by at least a factor of five.  We believe that our process has great commercial potential and significance, and we now need to optimise routes against the many different market potentials.  The commercialisation of this research was not part of the original grant proposal and, therefore, we seek Proof of Concept funding to prepare a market ready package of information to be presented to venture capitalists or companies that might invest in this technology and take it through the early commercialisation phase.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"324588","fundValue":"155484","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
