{"id":"103459","title":"\"Integration of Analyses among fMRI, Biophysical Models and Genetic Data\"","abstractText":"'This project is interdisciplinary in character with three background topics. (1) Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which has become an important technique in the study of the cognitive functions of the brain. This topic also has important applications in the routine diagnosis and prognosis of thoracic surgery and mental diseases. (2) Bioinformatics, which has developed into a key approach in the life sciences, relating molecular data to a number of genetic diseases. (3) Biophysical mathematical models, such as the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron, the Hodgkin-Hulexy model, neural mass models and the neural field equation. These have been utilized to study neuronal activities and functions at the cell and tissue level for many years.\n\nThe project will combine the three background topics, and is aimed towards the integration of data and models. It will establish a framework composed of modelling, mathematical analysis and statistical inference. The ultimate aim is the integration of fMRI, biophysical models and genetic data.\n\nThis will involve modelling and mathematical analysis to understand the underlying mechanisms due to the intrinsic complexity and noise of biological systems. The specific problems we intend to solve are: (1) Integration of EEG-fMRI data and a neuronal network model; (2) Integration of fMRI and genetic data; (3) An fMRI data analysis, towards diagnosing mental disorders; (4) Modelling and mathematic analysis.\n\nThe main goal of the project is to gain new insights into some mental disorders and, on the way, develop mathematical models and theory that can explain the observed phenomena. The significance of our findings for social and economic impacts should be considerable since the project will address fundamental issues related to the daily life of human beings. It will take advantage of the quantity and quality of data that are now available and the power of modern computers and mathematical techniques.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"302421","fundValue":"278807.4","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
