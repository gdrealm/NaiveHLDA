{"id":"185563","title":"Surface-Based Molecular Imprinting for Glycoprotein Recognition","abstractText":"'There is now overwhelming evidence that glycosylation changes during the development and progression of various malignancies. Altered glycosylation has been implicated in cancer, immune deficiencies, neurodegenerative diseases, hereditary disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, antibodies are playing a central role in enabling the detection of glycoprotein biomarkers using a variety of immunodiagnostic tests. Nonetheless, antibodies do have their own set of drawbacks that limit the commercialization of antibody sensing technology. They suffer from poor stability, need special handling and require a complicated, costly production procedure. More importantly, they lack specificity because they bind only to a small site on the biomarker and are not able to discriminate, for instance, among different glycosylated proteins. The current antibody diagnostic technology has well recognized limitations regarding their accuracy and timeliness of diagnose of disease. This project will focus on research into the means of developing a generic, robust, reliable and cost-effective alternative to monoclonal antibody technology. The project aims to exploit concepts and tools from nanochemistry, supramolecular chemistry and molecular imprinting to provide highly innovative synthetic recognition platforms with high sensitivity and specificity for glycoproteins. Such novel type of platforms will make a profound and significant impact in the broad fields of biosensors and protein separation devices with applications in many areas such as biomedical diagnostics, pharmaceutical industry, defense and environmental monitoring. The proposed technology may open an untraveled path in the successful diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of therapeutic treatment for major diseases such as cancer, immune deficiencies, neurodegenerative diseases, hereditary disorders and cardiovascular diseases.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"614787","fundValue":"1894046","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2019-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
