{"id":"92767","title":"Climatic forcing and local controlling factors in the sedimentary evolution of high-latitude continental margins","abstractText":"'This project focuses on the application of the �source-to-sink� approach to the study of paleo-ice streams with the main objective of analysing and comparing the climatic forcing and its interaction with local factors in high-latitude continental margins (Southern and Northern hemispheres) during the last glacial cycle, from morphological and sedimentological studies. The �source-to-sink� approach is a novel concept that considers the continental margin as an entire system and allows the interpretation of sedimentary processes and controlling factors from the morphology and sedimentary record. The application of this approach to the study of high-latitude margins, through the identification of sedimentary systems, processes and controlling factors during the last glacial cycle, will give information on how global (climate) and local factors have interacted in the sedimentary evolution of these margins during the last glacial cycle. Thus, the proposed work will enable the comparison of a variety of systems in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, having a great potential to the interpretation of the climatic forcing in a world-scale and providing a basis for assessing the investigation on Climate Change, which is a topic of growing international importance because of its effects on the natural systems of the planet Earth. This project will be carried out employing different datasets that include swath bathymetries, seismic reflection profiles and sediment samples. New data will be obtained in a geophysical cruise off West Greenland, and a broad database available at the SPRI will be integrated in the study.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"236526","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
