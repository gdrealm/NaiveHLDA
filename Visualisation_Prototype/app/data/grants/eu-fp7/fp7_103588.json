{"id":"103588","title":"Needs and requirements for independent living for older people","abstractText":"'The NARILOP project will develop effective methodologies to elicit the needs and preferences of older adults for technologies to help them live independently. Currently methodologies developed for use with young people are used without regard to their appropriateness for older people and there is evidence that they are indeed not appropriate for use with this group. Developing new technologies for older people is vital, given the ageing of society in Europe and beyond.  This timely research will fill an important gap in both research and practice in how to best engage with older adults in the design of technologies that will help them in independent living. The fellow on the NARILOP project will review the literature from human-computer interaction and other related disciplines for elicitation methodologies that have the potential to be used with older adult users and propose appropriate adaptations to make them fit for purpose.  The project will then use five adapted methods to undertake requirements elicitation work on a range of technologies related to cooking, food shopping and nutrition, an important but underrepresented area of technology innovation for older people.  Each method will be applied with five different groups of users. The data recorded during these elicitation sessions will be analysed for the attributes that lead to the most effective and acceptable elicitation methods for older adult users and for user requirements for the design of new technologies in the nutrition area. The project will create a manual of research methods and procedures for working with older people in the area of new technologies as well as a corpus of information about their needs for technological support in the kitchen.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"303184","fundValue":"278807.4","fundStart":"2012-10-15","fundEnd":"2014-10-14","dataset":"fp7"}
