In this project, we proposed a novel kind of nanomaterials, organic/inorganic hybirds containing polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS). POSS-containing hybrid polymers with unique architectures will be prepared using advanced polymer synthesis protocols. These hybrid polymers could self-assemble into a rich variety of morphologies in domains with periodicities such as lamellae in bulk or micelle in solution. We will carry out primary test of the resulting POSS-containing nanomaterials for drug delivery applications and explore many other applications such as catalysis and nanoreactors, microelectronics, molecular template, etc.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252943","fundValue":"240289.6","fundStart":"2011-01-03","fundEnd":"2013-01-02","dataset":"fp7"}
