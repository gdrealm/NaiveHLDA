{"id":"94852","title":"Development of molecules for the stabilization of quadruplex DNA and regulation of oncogene expression: a potential route to novel anticancer drugs","abstractText":"'In this project we aim to develop a series of metal-containing molecules with the ability to interact with specific DNA sequences. More specifically, we will target what is called quadruplex DNA. It has been recently identified that there are approximately 350,000 sequences in the human genome that can potentially form quadruplex DNA structures. More interestingly, some of these regions have already been identified as potential targets for the development of cancer drugs. Therefore, we will aim to develop metal complexes that can selectively interact with these specific quadruplex DNA structures. The project will involve the design (aided by computational methods), development and characterisation of the new molecules. The DNA binding properties of these molecules will be evaluated using a range of techniques (e.g. FRET, FID, SPR and CD). This will allow us to identify lead molecules (those that interact more strongly and selectively with specific quadruplex DNA structures) so that their biological activity can be evaluated.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251761","fundValue":"172240.8","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
