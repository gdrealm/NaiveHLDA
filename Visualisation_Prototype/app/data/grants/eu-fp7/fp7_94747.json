{"id":"94747","title":"Ionospheric threats and suitable Countermeasures Applicable to satellite Radio systems Under next Solar maximum","abstractText":"'The fellow is Assistant Professor in Physics at the the Centre for Atmospheric Research, University of Nova Gorica, Slovenia. He specialises in physics of the upper ionised atmosphere, radio wave propagation and remote sensing of the atmosphere. The scientific training focuses on the study of the upper ionised atmosphere (ionosphere) and its effects on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS and the new European Galileo, during next solar maximum. This will also benefit the reliable operation of the European Space Situational Awareness service. The fellowship will provide specific training in Geodesy, GNSS techniques and services, not available in Slovenia but inherent to the expertise of the Institute of Engineering Surveying and Space Geodesy (IESSG) at the University of Nottingham. The candidate�s background is entirely disparate and complementary to the existing expertise at the IESSG, making this a truly interdisciplinary and collaborative venture. The fellowship will advance the scientific and academic career of the fellow once he is back at UNG, enhancing his ability to train future students and scientists in GNSS related sciences and ultimately his career prospects. He aims to establish an international centre of excellence in Slovenia. The training is by nature interdisciplinary and achieving its scientific goals will depend on a solid understanding of fields that are mastered either by the fellow or the host institution. Very importantly, the advancement of the candidate�s career will be also underpinned by additional training in areas such as management of large projects, interaction with high calibre scientists and with industry, and international cooperation, The fellowship will possibly lead to patents and technological solutions to make European systems and services more robust and efficient, bringing economic advantages for companies in Europe involved in the design and commercialisation/provision of related GNSS receivers/services.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254139","fundValue":"231927.2","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
