{"id":"91317","title":"Self-Learning Control System for Freeform Milling with High Energy Fluid Jets","abstractText":"'Innovative control philosophies that enhance the capabilities of niche processing methods are of critical importance for EU manufacturers of high value added products made of advanced engineered materials. High Energy Fluid Jets (HEFJet) processing is a niche technology with outstanding capabilities: cuts any material at negligible cutting forces; generates virtual zero heat; uses the abrasive jet plume as a �universal tool�. Nevertheless, freeform machining by High Energy Fluid Jets Milling (HEFJet_Mill) is still at infancy level. This is because no control solution for HEFJet_Mill exists.  ConforM-Jet will develop and demonstrate, for the fist time, a self-learning control system for HEFJet_Mill to generate freeform parts. This will be done by integrating models of HEFJet_Mill with patterns of multi-sensory signals to control the outcomes of jet plume � workpiece interaction, i.e. magnitude and shape of abraded footprint; these are key issues in controlling the generation of freeforms via HEFJet_Mill. This will be done via the following research steps: - Develop a novel integrative energy-based model of HEFJet_Mill. - Develop an innovative energy-based multi-sensing monitoring system for HEFJet_Mill. - Develop a radically new control system for HEFJet_Mill of freeforms that is equipped with novel abilities: Self-learning ability: Self-gauging of the energetic models of HEFJet_Mill vs. key energy-based sensory signals. Thus, whenever new working scenario occurs, updated models are employed by the model predictive controller. Self-adaptive ability: The energy-based sensory signals, trained with the data available in the process database, will be taught to respond to process variations by feeding back the correct combination of process parameters. - Demonstrate ConforM-Jet control strategy on multi-axis HEFJet_Mill systems to generate aerospace, medical, and optical freeform components made of difficult-to-cut materials (Ni/Ti alloys, optical glass).'","grantUrl":"http://www.conformjet.eu/","grantId":"229155","fundValue":"5097020.39","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
