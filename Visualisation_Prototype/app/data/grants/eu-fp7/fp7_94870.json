{"id":"94870","title":"Pronouns of Medieval Italian Dialects","abstractText":"'This project will examine the pronominal systems of Medieval Italian Dialects on the basis of a scrutiny of 13th and 14th centuries texts. It will represent a significant contribution both to the field of Italo-Romance linguistics and, more widely, to the general linguistics community, by adopting an interdisciplinary approach that interfaces traditional philological and dialectological studies with recent advances in morphological and syntactic theory. The data will be firstly sifted on the basis of rigorous philological criteria in order to exclude from the sample of texts those containing misleading phenomena due to the influence of other (prestigious) dialects or the intervention of later copyists. Then the data will be classified and stored into a relational database, which allows efficient and rapid comparison of morphological and syntactic variation. In particular, the project will exploit an innovative data management system based on an inventory of specific tags that capture unambiguously the grammatical properties of each sentence. This allows us to organize the data according to a set of linguistic features so as to maximise the possibilities of comparison and enhance the capacity to find meaningful correlations among morpho-syntactic phenomena. On the basis of these features, this system will indeed retrieve not only a specific phenomenon in different texts, but also its specific characteristics and the co-occurrence of distinct phenomena/properties. The database will finally provide an organized set of data that can be readily retrieved and compared in order to allow the extraction of material for articles, presentations, and a comprehensive grammar of MID personal pronouns to be prepared during the last phase of the research.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253332","fundValue":"173403.2","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
