{"id":"103777","title":"Novel gas diffusion layer for PEM fuel cells","abstractText":"The objective of this research proposal is to generate a novel gas diffusion layer (GDL) which will be a combination of existing carbon paper and cloth GDLs to ensure effective water management in PEM fuel cell. Water management is one of the technological challenges which needs to be addressed to commercialise PEM fuel cell technology and for hydrogen energy based future. Commercial paper and cloth GDLï¿½s are good at handling specific water profile as carbon paper can handle dry operating mode effectively and carbon cloth handles flooding effectively.  When fuel cells are deployed for automotive application they are subjected to wider operating condition depending on the load profile and hence there is a need to combine paper and cloth to obtain advantage of individual GDLs. The combined paper and cloth GDL will be achieved by two different means; first a bi-layer GDL will be developed by physically stacking paper and cloth GDL and compared with the performance of a conventional single paper or cloth GDL of equivalent thickness. Secondly hybrid paper-cloth GDL will be developed by directly coating slurry of chopped carbon fibers and resin on carbon cloth substrate followed by sintering. The properties of hybrid GDL will be determined as a function of coating thickness and hence the degree of hybridization will be optimized. The novel GDLs will be tested for their water management when subjected to European and Indian automotive driving cycles. The degree of hybridization between paper and cloth will be further refined for each of the driving cycles and knowledge obtained will be of greater interest for both European and the Indian community.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"303248","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"no date","fundEnd":"no date","dataset":"fp7"}
