{"id":"93413","title":"Surface Engineering for Antifouling - Coordinated Advanced Training","abstractText":"'The main research goal of SEACOAT is to improve understanding of biointerfacial processes involved in the colonisation of surfaces by marine fouling organisms. Our vision is that this enhanced understanding will inform the future development of new, environmentally-benign materials and coatings for the practical control of marine biofouling. Our principal objective is to discover which nano- and micro-scale physico-chemical properties of surfaces influence the adhesion of fouling organisms, through the use of surface engineering technologies to fabricate coatings that vary systematically in relevant surface properties, and length scales. We will use advanced surface analytical methods to characterise test surfaces for relevant physico-chemical surface properties and how these change after immersion. Parallel adhesion bioassays using a range of representative marine organisms will test intrinsic antifouling properties of surfaces. The network is an interdisciplinary cooperative of chemists, physicists and marine biologists. Intersectoral aspects unite basic and applied scientists working in universities, a large company and an SME. The projectï¿½s S&T objectives will be delivered through research in 4 main Work Packages: viz. WP1-Surface Engineering, WP2-Surface Analytics, WP3-Bioadhesion, WP4- Integration. Two additional Work Packages (WP5, WP6) will be concerned with the Dissemination of project results and the Management of the Network respectively. The aim of the Training Programme is to increase the knowledge base and experience of trainees in each of the Thematic Areas and to develop their transferable skills for future careers in industry or academia. Six training objectives will be delivered through a suite of 7 Core Skills Areas (Research Project, Advanced Training Courses, Project Conferences, International Winter Workshop, Career Development Plan, Generic Research Skills, Transferable Research Skills).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"237997","fundValue":"3281108.21","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
