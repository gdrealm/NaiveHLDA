{"id":"98022","title":"Smart Methodologies and multilevel/multiscale Analysis of composite stiffened panel for Structural Health monitoring","abstractText":"'The concept of sensorised structures for the purpose of damage detection and recording changes of strain fields is of growing interest to reduce the maintenance activities as well as to improve the aircraft safety. The general objective of this proposal is to develop effective computational tools for the development and manufacturing of aircraft stiffened composite sensorised composite structures for impact damage detection as outlined in CfP JTI-CS-2009-1-GRA-01-005. Different SHM methods for Piezoceramics and Fiber Optic sensors will be developed. In this proposal, we will develop: � smart computational methodologies to accurately simulate the sensing/actuating of a smart panel; � methods based on Lamb waves and Electormechnaicam Impedance; � optimum sensor layout methodology (i.e. number and location of sensors), using smart FE, test data and optimisation;. � a neural network using test results and smart FE; � generation of response functions and metalmodels using the neural network and smart FE; � a multilevel analysis of stiffened composite panel; � robust methodologies for multiscale modelling of woven composites and multiscale/multilevel environment for modelling material degradation and damage; � validation through test data. The above innovative developments will form validated methodologies of high relevance to the Aeronautical industry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255741","fundValue":"417130","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
