Rats and mice carry over 70 diseases that can be transmitted to humans, they also cause economic damage to crops, buildings and infrastructure that runs into billions of Euroï¿½s per year. The rat population of the world is expanding rapidly and our current control systems are just not effective. All of the current electro mechanical devices have a carbon footprint with daily visits to remove dead animals and rest / re bait them. The toxins (eg warfarin) also require frequent visits to check on consumption and to re-bait.There is therefore a global need for a reliable, effective, safe, robust, economic pest control device.\nThrough the integration of new technologies proposed in part by the 4 participating SME organisations and with outsourced research capacity of European leading RTD performers, The PIED PIPER project aims to develop a new generation pest control device that will overcome the limitation of existing approaches in an environmentally, cost effective manner.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"286852","fundValue":"1566311.8","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
