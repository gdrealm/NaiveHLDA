{"id":"102354","title":"Modular beads for regeneration of bio-cofactors in enzyme-catalysed synthesis","abstractText":"'There is increasing interest in exploiting enzymes to carry out steps in industrial catalysis. Biocatalysts permit reactions to be carried out under mild conditions and with the exquisite chiral and regio-selectivity demanded of pharmaceutical, food and fine chemical products. A growing number of enzymes are already utilised across these industries. However, the repertoire of enzymes available for industrial redox transformations is greatly limited by the requirement of many oxidoreductase enzymes for supply of the hydride-carrying nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) cofactors at stoichiometric levels. The high cost of these cofactors means that a regeneration system is essential. In this project, we develop towards commercial application, a convenient, cheap, modular regeneration system for the nicotinamide cofactors NAD/NADH and NADP/NADPH. Our innovation is likely to have broad applications in facilitating enzyme-catalysed steps in the preparation of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals, and to offer substantial advantages over currently available cofactor recycling systems. This project builds on ideas and early-stage results that have arisen rapidly out of an ERC Starting Grant-funded project. We now apply for funds to protect our Intellectual Property, explore the surrounding market and patent landscape, and develop our innovation into a robust demonstration.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"297503","fundValue":"163260.4","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
