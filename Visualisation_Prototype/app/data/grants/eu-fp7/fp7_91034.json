{"id":"91034","title":"Intuitive operation and pilot training when using marine azimuthing control devices","abstractText":"'The aim is to improve by policy and design, the safety and security of ships by taking into account the man-machine interface and the training of maritime pilots; specifically when operating ships equipped with azimuthing control devices. From the thrusters on smaller, but numerous, harbour support vessels through to the pod-drives on cruise ships and ocean going liners, azimuthing control has rapidly established itself in the maritime industry. But while the industry has risen to meet the demand, this rapid evolution has not allowed sufficient time for the propagation of knowledge throughout the different disciplines. Though the various sectors of the industry each have their own expertise, a lack of communication is both restricting progress and compromising safety and security; in addition, much work is being repeated unnecessarily. To address this problem, the project will provide a forum for technical review and cross-disciplinary discussion between the key industry sectors; specifically: - The specialist in HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING and testing, both theoretical and experimental, and expert in the understanding of azimuthing control and propulsion devices. - The designers and manufacturers of MARINE SIMULATION software, hardware and physical models that are used for the training of marine pilots. Including, the designers, human factors specialists and manufactures of automation and control systems, joystick systems and graphical user interfaces. -The MARITIME TRAINING facilities using both numerical and physical simulation tool and specialist in the theory and practice of human factors (physical and behavioural components) and specialist in the training of bridge-crews and pilots. - Practitioners in OPERATIONAL PRACTICE including maritime pilots, ship operators/managers, pilot association and end users. And including, Maritime Authorities and Regulators specifically interested in policy and regulation.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"217818","fundValue":"1335082.8","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
