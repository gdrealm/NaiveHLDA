{"id":"94788","title":"Quantum simulation of mesoscopic systems with highly excited atoms and ions","abstractText":"'The rapid development in cold atomic physics in conjunction with advances of optical technologies has paved the way to create artificial simulators mimicking complex quantum models. Remarkable experiments, e.g. superfluid-insulator transition of ground state atoms in optical lattices, have been achieved recently. This opens new research frontiers at which atomic physics and condensed matter physics merge and becomes worldwide activities which aim at turning quantum physics into useful technology. This project brings together a top-class, young, Chinese researcher from Germany, Weibin Li, and the dedicated, enthusiastic Scientist-in-Charge Dr Igor Lesanovsky at Nottingham University, UK. The project will work on quantum simulators based on dynamics of valence electrons of Rydberg atoms and ions. It provides additional freedom that particles can be controlled and manipulated individually by lasers. Such an approach has particular advantages over quantum simulators established by cold atoms. It allows to simulate chemical reactions in molecules and charge and energy transfer processes of spin models as well as access possibilities in quantum computation. This research will benefit the applicant by becoming an expert of atomic and condensed matter physics and raising the applicantï¿½s profile in an international level. The host institution will benefit from this project and Weibin Li&apos;s presence because complementary knowledge on highly excited atoms and ions will be brought here. The project will enrich research areas and international collaborations of the host. The ERA (European Research Area) will benefit because the proposal develop a new approach in the study of quantum simulation. The results will promote studies in practical quantum technology. All these will emphasize the leadership of European in this field and widen gaps of the studies relative to other competing regions (USA, Japan, Australia, etc).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255391","fundValue":"173403.2","fundStart":"2010-05-15","fundEnd":"2012-05-14","dataset":"fp7"}
