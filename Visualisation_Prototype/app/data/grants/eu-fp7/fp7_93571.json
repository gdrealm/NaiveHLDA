{"id":"93571","title":"\"Smart Resilience Technology, Systems and Tools\"","abstractText":"'The programme, involving leading European organisations, will develop innovative smart technology, systems and implementation tools. The project is set out into six main work packages: WP1 � Management: controlling the operation, scientific excellence and finance of the consortium. WP2 � FRe technology: developing innovative and smart technology and products, based on extending current products and introducing smart systems that rely less on manual intervention. The emphasis is on cost effective solutions. The WP will develop guidance and standards for FRe technology that could be adopted by standards organisations as harmonised standards. WP3 � FRe systems: developing the concept of flood resilient systems in the urban environment through the use of case studies in seven partner countries. FRe systems are the combination of FRe technology and the urban environment within which they sit. The FRe systems can range from individual building and infrastructure level to whole cities. WP4 � FRe implementation: considering how to implement FRe technology and systems in practice. It will consider appropriate tools and develop a decision support system. WP5 � Integration: bringing together the theory and practical research in WP2 � WP4, the intention is to demonstrate how FRe technology, systems and implementation can work in practice. The involvement of relevant stakeholders through national support groups will be essential. WP6 � Dissemination: a range of dissemination activities are planned within the project. A project web site will host an information platform. National and international conferences will disseminate the research results and create impact amongst stakeholders. A manual of FRe technology, systems and implementation tools will be produced. The project partners have already cooperated for more than three years in COST Action C22 � Urban Flood Management and are therefore well placed to successfully undertake this project.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"244102","fundValue":"4562218.94","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
