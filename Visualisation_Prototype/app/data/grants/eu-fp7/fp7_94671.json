{"id":"94671","title":"Integrated Quantum Optics with Waveguides","abstractText":"'The present proposal will fund an experimental project which aims to implement optical quantum information devices on a solid state substrate. Optical waveguides will be used for the fabrication of different circuits that will be designed for the generation of nonclassical light sources, and reconfigurable linear circuits. Lithium niobate and lithium tantalate will be used as substrates for the fabrication of the guiding structure since they provide high second-order nonlinearity and a transparency range that goes from infrared to blue light. The two crystals are also compatible with the reverse proton exchange technique that will be used for the fabrication of high quality optical waveguides. Nonclassical light sources will be realized by spontaneous parametric down conversion in periodically poled waveguides. Different sources, such as squeezed vacuum and photon pairs, will be produced with innovative optical guiding configurations that are extremely compact and stable. Reconfigurable linear circuits will be fabricated using variable beamsplitters that can be externally controlled via the electrooptic effect. This basic structure will be the building block of a reconfigurable circuit that will be able to perform deterministic unitary transformation and probabilistic nonlinear operations. The final step of the proposal is the implementation of a completely integrated quantum circuit, from source to gate, all on the same chip.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251722","fundValue":"173240.8","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
