{"id":"99558","title":"Enhancing Research Impact on Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change","abstractText":"'Global environmental issues such as climate change pose a major societal challenge. A lot of research is ongoing to provide knowledge for improving societyï¿½s response to climate change: assessing potential impacts, formulating options for mitigation and adaptation, dealing with uncertainties of model outputs. However, a major challenge remains to ensure that research has an impact, i.e. that research outcomes are actually used by society and translated into solutions. The interaction between science and society is not a simple matter of linear knowledge transfer from research to practice and recent research on science-society interfaces has identified various forms of knowledge transfer and exchange. The overall aim of the proposed research is to understand better how to enhance the societal impact of climate change governance research. Producing research impact requires expertise that is generally not incorporated in traditional disciplinary academic training and education. The intermediary aim is therefore to increase the expertise for producing research impact amongst climate change governance researchers. Knowledge about research impact is dispersed in several bodies of literature: political and policy science, public administration, business management and innovation studies, communication studies. Moreover, it generally fails to provide practical guidelines. To know what expertise researchers should acquire, new knowledge about the production of research impact therefore has to be generated. Action research within ongoing research projects is the preferred research strategy for this study. Through design and testing of  strategies for delivering impact it will be explored how different types of research, scholarship and engagement initiatives help to shape the decisions made by local and regional governments and private and civil society stakeholders.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"276934","fundValue":"32500","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
