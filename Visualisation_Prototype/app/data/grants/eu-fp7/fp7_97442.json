{"id":"97442","title":"Virtual Physiological Human: Sharing for Healthcare - A Research Environment","abstractText":"VPH-Share will develop the organisational fabric (the infostructure) and integrate the optimised services to (1) expose and share data and knowledge, (2) jointly develop multiscale models for the composition of new VPH workflows, (3) facilitate collaborations within the VPH community. Four flagship workflows (from @neurIST, euHeart, VPHOP, Virolab) provide existing data, tools and models, engage with the services developed by VPH-Share to drive the development of the infostructure, and pilot its applications. Data sources are usually clinical data from individual patients - medical images and/or biomedical signals - sometimes with population information. The operations range from secure access and storage through annotation, data inference and assimilation, to complex image processing and physics-based mathematical modelling, to data reduction and representation. The project focuses on a key bottleneck: the interface with the wealth of data from medical research infrastructures and from clinical processes. VPH-Share will provide the essential services, as well as the computational infrastructure, for the sharing of clinical and research data and tools, facilitating the construction and operation of new VPH workflows, and collaborations between the members of the VPH community. Evaluating the effectiveness and fitness-for-purpose of the infostructure and developing a thorough exploitation strategy are key activities, creating confidence in the communities. The consortium, through its optimal mix of medical, mathematical, engineering, software & hardware and industrial knowledge and expertise from the EU and internationally, will make this effort a success, delivering to European citizens clinically useful outcomes that will benefit society. The duration of the project is 4 years, its budget is � 14.3M, with an EC contribution of � 10.7M.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269978","fundValue":"14332963","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
