{"id":"93016","title":"Climate Change and BIRDs in the African SAVannah","abstractText":"'Climate change is arguably the greatest threat to biodiversity today. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie climate impacts is crucial if biodiversity goals are toe be met as the global climate changes. To date, climate impact research has focussed on northern areas, yet tropical ecosystems hold most biodiversity. For the first time, this project will have the overriding objective of identifying the mechanisms of climate impacts on biodiversity in the African savannah. This objective will be met through a highly innovative combination of modelling, monitoring and empirical work, to assess the impact of changing climates (particularly water availability) on Tanzanian bird species. Working as part of the University of British Colombia�s internationally recognised research group on savannah ecology before reintegration at the University of Aberdeen, the fellow will gain the experience and training required to facilitate his establishment at a European research organisation where he will be able to develop a research group focussing on tropical ecology and climate change. The combination of high quality science and training as part of a world class research group, plus the return period after gaining these new skills will ensure that the project meets the aim of the �People� work programme.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"237090","fundValue":"231461.78","fundStart":"2009-09-15","fundEnd":"2012-09-14","dataset":"fp7"}
