{"id":"100269","title":"Innovative inspection techniques for laser powder deposition quality control","abstractText":"'Laser Powder Deposition is a recently developed technology for manufacture of small intricate metal parts such as those\nused in aerospace and automobile engines. This technology has significant potential advantages over conventional\ncasting methods in that small parts with internal features can be built, enabling special processes and light structures to be\nconstructed.\nThe powder deposition process works by melting a layer of powder in a pattern determined by the path of a laser. The layers\nare either 500 ?m or 20-50 ?m thick depending on the process used.\nTo take full advantage of the intricacy of form enabled by these additive technology approaches in these applications\ncommensurate non-destructive inspection capability is needed which can support the cycle times needed in Rapid Agile\nmanufacture of high performance, high loading efficiency structures. This requires an inspection process capable of handling\nthe complex evolving forms, in cycle with a processing environment with a feature resolution on a scale relevant to the\ncomponent structural elements. This project aims to address this problem and provide non-destructive testing techniques with\nknown capabilities for the process.\nObjectives:\n� To provide inspection methods for the laser powder deposition process with known capability.\n� To manufacture a prototype laser powder deposition manufacturing system with known inspection capabilities and to\ndemonstrate these capabilities.\nCandidate inspection technologies have been identified that have potential to provide the inspection capability. Note that\nthese will probably need to be robotically deployed and remotely operated within the laser cell between the deposition of each\nlayer.\nEddy current, ultrasound signals generated by lasers, thermal patterns and optical methods for surface distortion\nmeasurement technologies will be evaluated, developed and the performance established for the range of defects and sizes\nrequired.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"283833","fundValue":"1442306.4","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
