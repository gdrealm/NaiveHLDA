{"id":"92265","title":"Enhanced Durability Resurfacing Endoprosthesis","abstractText":"'Each year in Europe there are:- � 800000 hip operations costing approximately �1,942 per/implant, worth over �1.5 billion � Hip implant operations are rising by approximately 15%. � Currently 10% of all the prosthesis implanted are in patients under 55 years of age of which 33% of these will fail within 16 years with a further 20% of implant fitted to over 55�s failing with in 20 years requiring revisional surgery costing �2.3 billion per annum. Treatment of younger patients with severe hip disease using a conventional THR presents a challenge with the rate of success being very low, (most failing within 16 years). To over come this Finsbury help develop the MoM BHR resurfacing hip with a survival rate of 93% over a conventional THR. However, studies have reported high concentrations of Co &amp; Cr in the serum and/or urine of patients with MoM resurfacing implants. Studies have shown that increased levels of Co &amp; Cr cause caners such as leukaemia and are linked with myocardiopathy. During the course of this project we intend to overcome these problems by developing a ceramic one ceramic or ceramic on polymer resurfacing hip. Like that of the MOM prosthesis will only cover the femoral head thus retaining all of the desirable properties associated with retaining an intact femur.'","grantUrl":"http://www.endure-fp7.com","grantId":"232151","fundValue":"1483378.73","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
