{"id":"107371","title":"Methodologically Accurate Modelling of BOne: new experimental methods for the validation of cortical bone tissue computer models","abstractText":"'Multiscale modelling of the human body is becoming an essential approach in large part of biomedical engineering research, as well as in the development of technologies for clinical applications, such as the Virtual Physiological Human. Bone is a hierarchical material and plays a fundamental role in the framework of the musculoskeletal system. In the last years the bone models at the tissue level (10-10000 microns) have been considered the weakest link in the multiscale modelling chain due the complexities of defining reliable experiments to validate them (i.e. to verify their accuracy in predicting the reality). The goal of the proposed study is to generate a set of accurate experiments for the validation of numerical models for cortical bone by using state of the art experimental techniques (micro-CT, nano-indentation), image processing (Digital Image Correlation) and engineering numerical methods (Finite Element (FE) models). To do so, a custom made jig will be designed to be able to perform stepwise loading on cortical bone samples inside a micro-CT. The sample�s mechanical properties and the strain field will be computed between each loading level and compared to the outputs of the FE models generated from the acquired 3D images. The output of this project would be relevant for a variety of clinical and basic research applications: osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, regenerative skeletal medicine, fractures associate to bone tumours, better understanding of association between form and function in the skeleton, etc. Moreover, the bone research community would benefit from the sharing in Public Domain of reliable experimental results that could be used by other researchers as a benchmark for their modelling methods. The expertise of the researcher (Enrico Dall�Ara), the scientist in charge (Marco Viceconti) and the host organization (University of Sheffield) will provide the perfect environment to accomplish the goals of the project in the planned 24 months.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327357","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
