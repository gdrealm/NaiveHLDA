{"id":"97003","title":"Word Wide NMR","abstractText":"and institutions specialised in all aspects of NMR spectroscopy in Europe with newly developed laboratories in five other countries. It builds on EU-funded infrastructures and will enable the creation of strategic and sustainable links with nine Partners from countries outside Europe. In return Third Country Partners will gain access to highly sophisticated NMR equipment. NMR spectroscopy is a broadly applicable technology relevant to all aspects of Life Science research, with major influence and impact on the biomedical industries. The specific objectives will be reached through mutually beneficial collaborations: SO1: Increasing awareness of the potential of NMR spectroscopy in essentially all areas of Life Sciences. Mutual advancement of the research portfolio of the Partners involved through global networking, training in advanced technologies and meetings to present cutting edge research projects. SO2: Building joint collaborative projects for liquid-state and solid-state NMR investigations by providing access to NMR instrumentation, focussed on investigations of drug targets such as kinases, phosphatases, metalloproteinases, bromo domains, membrane proteins and their complexes with agonists and antagonists. SO3: Learning and participating in training and application in the field of metabolomics research. Building a world-wide agenda for the role of metabolomics in diagnosis, predictive and individualised medicine supporting human health programmes and in fundamental research in the context of a mechanistic systems biology view to cellular function. This project will support and reinforce the collaborative interactions amongst the participants and help to establish long-term research co-operation. Most importantly, WW-NMR will enable Europe to lead the agenda for future NMR activities on an international platform.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247546","fundValue":"439200","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
