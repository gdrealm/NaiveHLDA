{"id":"109681","title":"Cell Metabolomics on A Chip By Integrated High-Resolution NMR Spectroscopy","abstractText":"'uF-NMR aims at the development of microfluidic devices that allow the culture and manipulation of populations of live cells while characterising their metabolome in situ through NMR spectroscopy. The basic paradigm is the direct interrogation of sample volumes on the chip. This is achieved through integrating micro-fabricated radio frequency resonators into the microfluidic device. Rather than extracting aliquots for analysis, the entire chip is inserted into a specially designed NMR probe for the measurement. This work will combine the power of emerging microfluidic lab-on-a-chip techniques with the specificity, versatility, and resolution of NMR spectroscopy.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"618368","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
