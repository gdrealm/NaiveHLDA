{"id":"96824","title":"Training Research and Applications Network to Support the Mitigation of Ionospheric Threats","abstractText":"'TRANSMIT will provide a coordinated programme of academic and industrial training in an area of immediate interest to the European society. It focuses on atmospheric phenomena that can significantly impair a wide range of systems and applications that are at the core of several activities embedded in our daily life. TRANSMIT deals with the harmful effects of the ionosphere on these systems, which will become increasingly significant as we approach the next solar maximum, predicted for 2013. It will gather major European stakeholders in a large multi-site ITN to develop real time integrated state of the art tools to mitigate ionospheric threats to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and several related applications, such as civil aviation, marine navigation and land transportation. TRANSMIT will expand the European knowledge base and ensure its sustainability by preparing young researchers in a multidisciplinary, intersectorial, industry-led training programme. Its driving forces are the EC prediction of an annual global market for GNSS of �300bn by 2020 and the fact that Europe�s own GNSS, Galileo, will be fully operational by 2013, just when the impact of the ionosphere will be greatest. GNSS satellite signals and any others operating below 10 GHz, including communications (satellite and HF), remote sensing and Earth observation systems, are extremely vulnerable to ionospheric phenomena. This formidable fast growing community lacks robust counter-measures to deal with these threats. Advancement in this area has been limited by:\n� A shortage of human resources in relevant Engineering disciplines;\n� The lack of a multidisciplinary framework where the various specialist research groups can devise solutions of practical value to end users.\nTRANSMIT will overcome this by providing a concerted training programme including taught courses, research projects and secondments that will arm the researchers of tomorrow with the necessary skills and knowledge.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"264476","fundValue":"3922842.4","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
