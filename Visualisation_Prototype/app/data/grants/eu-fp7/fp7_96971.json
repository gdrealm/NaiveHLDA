{"id":"96971","title":"Tracking Early Development: From Basic Science to Applications","abstractText":"'We propose  a structured PhD training programme that will prepare Early Stage Researchers for a career in public or private sector research in early developmental cognitive neurosciences. A unique feature of the project is the extensive participation of private sector partners from the technology, manufacturing and services industry in an emerging discipline that does not yet normally interact with the private sector. The last 15 years has seen important strides made in our understanding of the relation between early brain and behavioural development. The time in now ripe to exploit these developments in the from of applications of significant societal and commercial relevance.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"264301","fundValue":"1915975","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
