{"id":"107448","title":"�Till Death Us Do Part�: The Comparative History of Domestic Homicide in Early Modern Europe","abstractText":"'This project offers new complex analysis of the history of private violence within the context of public violence decline. It studies domestic homicide as a legal, cultural, and historical phenomenon to bring new understanding of origins and attitudes to domestic violence in Modern European society. The project builds on comparative data from main European regions including Eastern and Southern Europe introducing new documents and focusing on such questions as whether decline in public violence by the end of the 18th century can be explained by the domestication of homicide; if and how killing family members facilitated a safer public environment; whether the nature of private violence changed over time and whether private violence is intrinsic to modern society. It is a new and pioneering study looking at early modern European society, using domestic homicide as a filter to identify the level of violence based on the comparison between major European regions. The project systematises previous research, links different disciplines and introduces new empirical data using unconventional geographic understanding of Europe that should push the scholarship to explore EU heritage on the grounds of equal value systems, erasing the heavy built Cold war borderline between the West and the East. The project will result in a monograph, two articles in peer-reviewed journals, and four conference presentations. In addition it will provide connections to and impact on the wider community through networking and Marie Curie Ambassador�s functions to raise awareness about high levels of domestic violence and usage of violence in modern society.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"330674","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
