{"id":"109242","title":"Regulation of Pathogenic CD4 T Cell Responses in Inflammatory Bowel Disease","abstractText":"'Immune response in the intestine are tightly regulated to ensure host protective immunity in the absence of immune pathology. A permanent disturbance of this delicate balance can lead to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprising Crohnï¿½s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The aetiology of IBD is unknown, but it is thought to involve a complex interplay among genetic, environmental, microbial and immune factors. Dysregulated effector CD4 T cell responses can be causative in IBD irrespective of the initiating events that promote them. There is compelling evidence that pathogenic CD4 T cells accumulate in the inflamed intestine and contribute to the chronicity of disease. Additionally at the onset of IBD, mucosal effector CD4 T cells acquire a pathogenic polyfunctional Th17/Th1 phenotype. However the signals and molecular events that induce and regulate the pathogenic switch in human T cells, remain unknown. Whether this phenotype can be modified in favour of a homeostatic Type 17 or regulatory T cell response also remains to be determined. Revealing the signals and mechanisms by which the differentiation programs of pathogenic CD4 T cells are induced, maintained and modulated, might open new avenues by which pathogenic and chronic CD4 T cell responses can be specifically targeted in IBD.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"330621","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
