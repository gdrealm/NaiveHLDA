{"id":"88532","title":"\"Studying Developmental, Neural, Cognitive and Affective Aspects of the Self in Humans\"","abstractText":"'This project will investigate the cognitive, affective, neural and developmental basis of the Human self. In particular it will investigate reflexive, unconscious aspects of the self, and how these impact upon Human cognition. The proposal seeks to employ cognitive neuroscience methods (EEG and fMRI) as well as other physiological markers (Galvanic Skin Response ï¿½ GSR) together with studies on neuropsychological patients who have specific disorders of conscious processing of the world (visual neglect, prosopagnosia and split-brain patients) to explore the neural and cognitive basis of incidental, unconscious self-processing of the world. In addition to this we also seek to explore the development of incidental self-association in early childhood and the change from this form of processing to more meta-cognitive processes which link self to the environment. The results of these experiments will shed light on current cognitive and functional accounts of what has been called a uniquely Human construct. Our data may not only increase understanding in this area, but may also speak against such a view. We hope that the findings from this project may help to further understand the numerous disorders of self as a result of trauma or organic disorders.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"202893","fundValue":"791549","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
