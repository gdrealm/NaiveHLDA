{"id":"95343","title":"Photoinduced Chemistry: Development and Application of Computational Methods for New Understanding","abstractText":"'The interaction of light and matter gives rise to a multitude of important and fascinating phenomena.\nComputational studies of excited states are vital to further our basic understanding of these processes, and\ndesign and optimise new processes for particular applications. However, the computational chemistry of\nexcited states gives rise to many challenging features, including differential static and dynamic correlation\neffects, which can often be difficult to separate. Furthermore, regions of non-adiabatic coupling between\nvarious potential energy surfaces are ubiquitous in photochemistry. Such regions where the Born-\nOppenheimer approximation breaks down are among the most difficult to treat.\nThe computational chemist must use a wide variety of methods to study photochemistry. However,\none important �tool� in the computational arsenal is currently missing for general photochemical problems:\nnamely the ability to undertake systematically converging computations over all of the relevant regions of\nthe various (multi-state) potential energy surfaces. The Monte-Carlo Configuration Interaction (MC-CI)\nmethod is ideal for this purpose, and has many desirable features, including automatic inclusion of strong\nstatic correlation effects, and a balanced treatment of all states. Development of MC-CI methods, including\ngradients and non-adiabatic couplings is proposed. This will give rise to the unprecedented ability to\nbenchmark a large variety of photochemical problems, across the entire potential energy surfaces, with\nsystematic accuracy. The method will be further extended by coupling within molecular mechanics in a\nquantum mechanics / molecular mechanics (QM/MM) framework to study general excited state / open-shell\nproblems in complex environments.\nThe work will lead onto the applications research which spans the length scales of chemistry from\nsmall molecules to large supramolecular systems. The above MC-CI method and other state-of-the-art\ntechniques will be applied to photochemical problems of enormous scientific interest. These include high\naccuracy studies of inorganic photochemistry where the computational demands can be greatest, but also\nwhere high-level electronic structure and dynamics simulation offers exceptional possibility to understand\ncomplex molecular photochemistry. A practical area of photochemical research with a huge potential is\nphotodynamic therapy. Here light is used to destroy cancer tissue via the creation of the highly reactive\nsinglet molecular oxygen species. A deeper understanding of the many processes involved in this is required.\nThese include, single- vs multi-photon absorption, sensitizer internal conversion and intersystem crossing,\nenergy transfer processes with molecular oxygen, solvent effects, and aggregation effects. Detailed and\nsystematic studies of these fundamental aspects are proposed. The final applied area of study follows\nnaturally from this and is the supramolecular photochemistry of host-guest molecular sensors. Here advances\nare required to allow a detailed understanding. These include the use of molecular dynamics simulation in\nconjunction with QM/MM and statistical sampling.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"258990","fundValue":"1319728","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
