{"id":"95569","title":"Microsphere Based Cellular Manipulation ï¿½ From Protein Delivery to Intracellular Palladium Catalysis","abstractText":"'The broad aims of this research project are the application, exploitation and development of a generic microsphere cellular delivery system that will allow the delivery of a broad range of cargos into cells. This microspehere based technology will enable the efficient deliver of benign, large nano-small micron-sized particles and their associated cargos into cells. Controlled release from these carriers of their associated cargos, into mammalian cells will allows a variety of cellular processes to be modulated and followed in real time, while providing a means of tagging and tracking cells in an in vivo environment. These microspheres have, quite remarkably, been demonstrated to allow the delivery of specific chemical reagents into cells. I will exploit the delivery of palladium based catalysts into cells to carryout a range of quite unique cell based transformations!'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254238","fundValue":"181103.2","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
