{"id":"95405","title":"The Commercialisation of Transglutaminase","abstractText":"'The TRANSCOM project is designed to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and technology between 3 leading European research teams and 4 SMEs each with an interest in the protein crosslinking enzymes Transglutaminases. Transglutaminases are a widely distributed group of enzymes that catalyse the post-translational modification of proteins by the formation of isopeptide bonds or by deamidation of proteins. The deregulation of enzyme activity generally associated with major disruptions in cellular/tissue homeostasis can result in a number of human diseases TRANSCOM will be involved in the invention, development and production of diagnostic kits and treatments for health problems related to the activity of transglutaminases. The project will establish the molecular nature of the role of transglutaminases in the pathogenesis of diseases such as coeliac disease, neurodegeneration and intravenous catheter infections which are known to involve their cross-linking activity. The proposed work programme will develop new knowledge to address gaps in our understanding of this field and transfer existing knowledge and skills between sectors. It will build and broaden the capability of the partners with the objective of accelerating the development of new strategies that can be used in diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease, neurodegeneration and in the prevention of infections like MRSA associated with intravenous catheters.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251506","fundValue":"1680248","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
