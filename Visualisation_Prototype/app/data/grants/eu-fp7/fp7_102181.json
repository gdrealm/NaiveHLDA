{"id":"102181","title":"Attosecond Science by Transmission and Emission of X-rays","abstractText":"'This is a programme of advanced research with potential for high scientific impact and applications to areas of great strategic importance such as renewable energy and biomolecular technology. The aim is to develop and apply a combination of cutting-edge tools to observe and understand dynamics in molecules and condensed phase matter with attosecond temporal and nanometre spatial resolutions. The programme, will exploit two new types of measurements that my group have already begun to develop: high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy and attosecond absorption pump-probe spectroscopy, and will apply them to the measurement of attosecond electron dynamics in large molecules and the condensed phase. These methods rely upon the emission and transmission of soft X-ray attosecond fields that make accessible measurement not only of larger molecules in the gas phase but also thin (micron to nanometre) samples in the condensed phase. This is a research project that will open new frontiers both experimentally and theoretically. The challenge of this research is high and will be met by a concerted programme that is well matched to my teams experimental and theoretical expertise in attosecond physics, ultrafast intense-field science, soft X-ray techniques and advanced techniques for creating gaseous and condensed phase samples.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"290467","fundValue":"2344390","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
