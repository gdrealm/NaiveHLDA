{"id":"92706","title":"Hybrid organic-inorganic nanostructures for photonics and optoelectronics","abstractText":"'The proposed ITN will support close collaboration between 8 highly experienced and complementary European teams, who in all cases are working at the forefront of semiconductor science, photonics and materials technology. The real value that is offered by our collaboration will be realized by the generation of new, genuinely disruptive hybrid-semiconductor optoelectronic technologies. It will also train the next generation of scientists at the highest level, producing a skilled cadre of researchers who will contribute the Europeï¿½s competitiveness in emerging optoelectronic technologies. Our network has world-leading experience in the field of structure fabrication and material synthesis (both organic and inorganic), together with a strong focus in ultra-fast spectroscopy, nano-optics, photonics, non-linear optics and device engineering. We also have a significant experience in high-level theoretical analysis of the optical properties of organic and inorganic semiconductors, as well as experience in industrial research. The establishment of ICARUS will thus realize the creation of new hybrid systems, their characterization and their implementation in photonic and optoelectronic devices.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"237900","fundValue":"2803715.13","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
