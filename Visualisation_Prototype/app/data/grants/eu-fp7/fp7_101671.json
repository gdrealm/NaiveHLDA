{"id":"101671","title":"Satiety Innovation","abstractText":"'The SATIN project has been devised to develop food products produced by novel food processing that control satiety through modification of food structure. To achieve this the SATIN project will:\n1. Integrate advanced technologies to screen novel food structures through in vitro models to\nisolate and refine products according to their satiating potential.\n2. Develop novel food processing technologies that combine active ingredients and change food\nstructure to produce a range of novel satiety enhancing ingredients.\n3. Produce finished foods products that pass through safety analysis, early sensory evaluation\nand consumer testing.\n4. Demonstrate the effects of prototype products on biomarkers of satiety and on nutrient\nbioavailability using in vivo studies and validating new in vivo approaches.\n5. Demonstrate the effects of final foods products on within-meal satiation, post-meal satiety and /\nor reduced appetite and biomarkers of satiety.\n6. Demonstrate the enduring effects of individual food products on satiety and their potential to\ninduce weight loss.\n7. Demonstrate the long-term consumer and health benefits of adhering to a diet containing\nsatiety enhancing products.\n8. Validate health claim endpoints and commercialise technologies and products.\nThe SATIN consortium consists of 7 SMEs and 4 commercial partners ensuring that advanced technologies developed to process and screen novel food products are applied to the food industry and improve European economic competitiveness. The safety and efficacy of products developed will be rigorously examined by 7 leading international academic research teams ensuring consumers will have new high quality processed foods to help them achieve a balanced diet.'","grantUrl":"http://www.satin-satiety.eu/","grantId":"289800","fundValue":"8032374.2","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
