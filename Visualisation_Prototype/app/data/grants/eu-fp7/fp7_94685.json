{"id":"94685","title":"Semiconductor lasers for generation of non-diffracting (Bessel) beams","abstractText":"'Propagation of non-diffracting light beams, called Bessel beams, which are capable of retaining their intensity during propagation are particularly important in respect of a number of biophotonics applications such as optical trapping and tweezing, Doppler velocity measurement and manipulation of micro-particles and micro-fabrication. The main goal of this project is to develop compact, low-cost, reliable and highly-efficient all semiconductor based sources of non-diffracting light beams which has to become an alternative to the conventionally used solid-state lasers, which are more expensive, cumbersome and inefficient. Based on our recent results, it is planned to develop non-diffracting light beams from various semiconductor laser sources such as vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers, edge-emitting laser diodes and optically and electrically pumped semiconductor disk lasers with output powers ranging from a few milliwatts to a few Watts and central-lobe diameters of about few micrometers with propagation lengths from a few to tens of millimeters. This will then enable us to propose and implement new concepts and design strategies for reliable low-cost optical tweezers and manipulators suitable for broad use in biomedical laboratories. Our plan is to apply new concepts to the generation of Bessel beams in applications where the quality-to-cost ratio, efficiency and size are especially relevant such as lab-on-a-chip, micro-manipulation and micro-machines applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255646","fundValue":"238289.6","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
