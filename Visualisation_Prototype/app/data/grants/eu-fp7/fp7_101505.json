{"id":"101505","title":"Composites under Fatigue: Temperature and Humidity Related Environmental Ageing Damage","abstractText":"This projects aims at substantially improving the understanding of the role played by environmental factors on the long term hydric fatigue endurance of fibre reinforced composites. This will be achieved by an extensive experimental campaign and the development of physically robust finite element based modelling techniques. The will allow predicting the onset of fatigue induced damage in laminates subjected to arbitrary temperature and humidity cycles. Such a modelling capability is the key for establishing equivalence factors between the actual conditions in which composite structural elements are required to operate and the characterization environment employed in the laboratory.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"278156","fundValue":"299665.2","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
