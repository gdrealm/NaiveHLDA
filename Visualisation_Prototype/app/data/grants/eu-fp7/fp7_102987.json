The volume of information on hazard characterisation of ENM is increasing fast. In parallel with the scientific development, regulation orientated initiatives are also taking place to identify needs.\n\nThe ITS-NANO concept is 1: Gather targeted all scientific evidence, by literature search and communication with leading scientists. 2: Develop an initial assessment (document) of the available knowledge and the gaps, focussed on identifying knowledge level as how to develop an intelligent approach to grouping ENMs based their properties and their subsequent biological impacts in order to intelligently design next-generation nanosafety evaluation and risk assessment strategies. 3: Assemble stakeholders for presenting the initial assessment, having a dialog on how this relates to their aims/needs and how to make a consent driven strategy forward that ensures communication. 4: Revise the initial assessment document with the input from the stakeholder sent around for commenting, presenting the next draft for a smaller group for final commenting. 5: Publish it.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"290589","fundValue":"907898.4","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
