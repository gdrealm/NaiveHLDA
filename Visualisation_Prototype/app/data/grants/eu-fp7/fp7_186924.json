{"id":"186924","title":"Novel dynamic self-assembling system: from hierarchical and biomimetic morphogenesis to functional materials","abstractText":"'There is great need for radically new paradigms that significantly push forward the complexity, multiscale control, and functionality of novel materials. Molecular self-assembling strategies are continuously being explored for developing ever more precise and organized materials. The development of adaptive materials that can be morphed into complex shapes of hierarchical structure through bottom-up mechanisms that mimic those found in tissue development is a fascinating possibility. This proposal (BIOMORPH) aims to develop a novel dynamic self-assembling material fabrication platform that combines the benefits of molecular self-assembly, bioengineering, nanotechnology, and tissue engineering. The system integrates simple peptide and protein building-blocks with multiple cells types to create complex hierarchical, biomimetic, hybrid structures that exhibit remarkable properties such as self-healing and the capacity to undergo morphogenesis. The work would represent a major step-change by developing a dynamic strategy based on emerging physico-chemical mechanisms that generate and dissipate stresses, and maintain a controlled non-equilibrium state that together is reminiscent of elements found in tissue morphogenesis. The work is divided in four work packages that expand from building block design and synthesis to biomechanical and in vitro assessment of the generated materials. The proposed fabrication platform may find applications in a variety of tissue engineering applications. However, as a first stage, the work proposes to grow tubes and tubular networks that recreate vascular tissue.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"631783","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
