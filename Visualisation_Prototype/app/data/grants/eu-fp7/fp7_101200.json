{"id":"101200","title":"Universal Failsafe IGBT Package for robust power transmission","abstractText":"'Through a mixture of applied research and development, the Uni-Pack project will deliver technologies to reduce the manufacturing costs and improve the performance of plastic packaged IGBT (Insulated gate bipolar transistor) modules, in particular those for use in Voltage Source Converters (VSC) for High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) power transmission. VSC technology enables efficient access to renewable energy sources and economic connection to the electric utilities grid. Trade studies have identified target IGBT module performance parameters for the HVDC market sector and the need to address the influence of gate drive strategies on converter cell/ module performance. Tailoring of IGBT structures for on-state/ switching loss trade-off across each market sector will be demonstrated and applied to develop 4.5KV enhanced DMOS and /or trench IGBT die exhibiting optimum performance for HVDC transmission.\nApplied research into a high thermal performance low profile package, designed for low inductance and having fully bonded interconnects will deliver step improvements in performance / reliability and reduced manufacturing cost. An important characteristic of the package will be its capability to fail to short circuit, a feature which is highly beneficial in reducing the system costs.\nA VSC system is currently in the design stage using standard IGBT modules and this will be used as a benchmark to demonstrate and quantify the degree of success.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"283857","fundValue":"1499786.6","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
