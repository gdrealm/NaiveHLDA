{"id":"90639","title":"LEARNING AND LIVING SUSTAINABLY: Building Interdisciplinary Research Capacity and Expertise in Social and Professional Responses to Sustainability at the University of Gloucestershire","abstractText":"'Sustainability, and engagement with it, has become one of the biggest challenges we face in the 21st Century. Unsustainable practices are increasing the impact of environmental degradation, extending inequalities in our society and across the globe as well as limiting quality of life. The University of Gloucestershire has an institutional commitment to Sustainable Development. The University has modelled sustainability in its operational, administration and management structures. The University is now seeking to invest in and support staff so that existing research strengths explore a common platform in the area of people learning and engagement for sustainability. It also recognizes the importance of embedding sustainability into the curriculum and the lack of pedagogical and research capacity in this area. The purpose of this proposal is to bring external expertise necessary to develop research capacity in social and professional action for sustainability. The programme seeks to: (i) embed sustainability as a cross-cutting research strand at the University of Gloucestershire through training and networking opportunities in interdisciplinary social science research; (ii) conduct flagship research in a crucial multifaceted area which can inform sustainable living; (iii) conduct pedagogical research which can assist in embedding sustainability into the learning experiences of students at the University of Gloucestershire.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235766","fundValue":"239952.41","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
