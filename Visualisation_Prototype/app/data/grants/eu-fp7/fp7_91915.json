{"id":"91915","title":"The development of a novel rare-earth magnet based wave power conversion system - Snapper","abstractText":"'Our concept is a step change in enabling cost effective marine energy renewable capture. It is the development a novel low cost, high efficiency linear generator for marine wave energy extraction, (Snapper). Initially embedded within �Point Absorbers� and then transferable to other marine energy type capture devices, both wave and tidal, with energy efficiency of the generator of between 75%-80%. The primary advantage of the Snapper technology extending it beyond the state of the art is its ability to act as a magnetic gearing system. This leads to a significant reduction of the mass of the materials needed within the electrical generator, especially rare earth magnets. This will result in a cost saving, based on the raw materials from over �40k to under �7k for a 175KW electrical machine. This will enable a step change in the economic potential for the conversion of wave energy into electricity. To achieve this our technological objectives are: 1) To provide a low friction interface; a coefficient of friction (of not greater than 0.2?) between the translator and the stator with a design lifetime of 20 years operation, 2) To achieve a robustness of design according to six sigma criteria, 3) To achieve environmental protection of the development against marine environments; up to a depth of 60m (6 BAR), wave loading (25 year storm event),salinity (3.5%), anticorrosion (5 year) and biofouling (5 year); and, 4) ensuring that the development is intrinsically environmentally benign. We will also ensure that the system is grid compatible i.e.can be connected to an electrical distribution grid.'","grantUrl":"http://www.snapperfp7.eu","grantId":"232099","fundValue":"1391919.2","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
