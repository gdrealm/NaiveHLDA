{"id":"95658","title":"\"Gender inequalities in the home: Social structures, identities, and the division of family labor\"","abstractText":"'The proposed study draws on Identity Theory (Stryker, 1980, 2008) to explore gender inequalities in the division of household labor. To overcome existing disciplinary divides, it provides a conceptual and empirical formulation of identities as a route through which the sociological and psychological traditions can be connected. Shifting the focus from the surface level of belief-systems to the deeper meanings individuals apply to the self in a social role, this research advances the claim that identities are shaped, in part, by one�s location in the social structure, and that these identities have consequences for the division of family labor. Although the influence of social structures on identities is a basic premise of identity theory, there is no empirical evidence bearing on this assumption to date. Furthermore, in line with the identity-behavior link delineated by the theory, the salience of spouses� role-identities should account for their behavioral choices regarding the allocation of responsibilities and time investment in work and family labor. Identities are therefore hypothesized to play a mediating role in the relationships between sociodemographic backgrounds and the division of labor. These hypotheses will be examined in a parallel mixed-methods design. A sample of 150 couples (n = 300) will complete extensive questionnaires. Novel instruments will be developed to address deficiencies in previous measurement of identities. Complementary in-depth interviews will be conducted with 20 of the couples (n = 40). The findings from the quantitative and qualitative data sets will be integrated to provide a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the division of family labor. By overcoming disciplinary and methodological divides, this research constitutes an important step forward and will have significant implications for the development of effective interventions to promote change towards greater equality in families.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253022","fundValue":"241289.6","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
