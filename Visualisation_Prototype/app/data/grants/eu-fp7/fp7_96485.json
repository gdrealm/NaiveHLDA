{"id":"96485","title":"Computational Intelligence in Lifestyle Management Infrastructure","abstractText":"'Influenced by the developments in information and communication technologies and pressured by the dramatic changes in demographics in our societies, health care is and must be transforming to remain viable and of high quality. An important element in such changing health care is the emergence of personal health systems. Based on smart home environments and wearable, implantable, portable systems, citizens are empowered to manage their own health status. It enhances the opportunities for independent living of an ageing population, for instance by providing technology-driven support to Alzheimerï¿½s patients in every-day tasks. It also provides personalized support for lifestyle management, including preventative opportunities. Such systems require data capturing and runtime data analysis technologies to be integrated, and must deal with fears, distrust and potential privacy infringements for its users (patients and citizens). In this proposal, we bring together these three elements: (i) data capturing software infrastructures for lifestyle management as being pursued by U. Trento, Italy (UniTn), (ii) data analysis as being researched in various contexts at the Catholic University of Rio Grande del Sul, Brazil (PUCRS) and (iii) research in trust and privacy as pursued in the context of health, inclusion and other application areas at Newcastle University, UK (UNEW). Leveraging the ongoing collaboration with health professionals and research institutes in health and ageing, we ground our technology-driven work in real-life. We propose an exchange program that includes both research and teaching elements. In so doing, the proposed exchange program creates unique transfer of knowledge between the partners, beneficial for each individual partner, shifting and synergising the focus of the three concerned research groups, and with an exciting potential for follow-up and parallel projects in this important area.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247620","fundValue":"205200","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
