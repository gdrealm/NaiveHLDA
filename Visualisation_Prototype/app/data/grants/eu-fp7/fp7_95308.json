{"id":"95308","title":"Socio-Economic Impact Assessment for Research Projects","abstractText":"SEQUOIA will perform an assessment of the socio-economic impact of research projects in the area of Software as a Service and Internet of Services. At the same time, it will capture and document this process in order to develop a self-assessment methodology that on-going and future research projects will be able to adopt and apply on their own after the end of this support action. Finally. SEQUOIA will also develop recommendations for how self-monitoring mechanisms can be built into the FP7 project  instruments in order to facilitate the self-assessment process and enable the impact of SaaS/IoS to be optimised in future FP7 calls and in FP8.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"258346","fundValue":"590710","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
