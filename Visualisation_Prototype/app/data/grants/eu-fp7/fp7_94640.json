{"id":"94640","title":"The Renaissance Project: Towards a strategic orientation and associated toolkit to support global UCD that is appropriate and accountable to local culture","abstractText":"'Companies strive to develop products en masse for a global market. The challenge for companies is to maintain product quality, consistency and profitability, whilst ensuring that products meet and respect local and cultural norms. When technology design contravenes expectation, a product will fail, which can be disastrous not only for a company�s profits but dangerous in safety critical situations, and a potential source of structural instability in complexly interconnected sensitive industries such as finance. The Renaissance Project Project will establish the first steps towards a strategic orientation and associated toolkit to support global UCD that is appropriate and accountable to local culture. There are three main research objectives: i) to capture information related to knowledge management strategies for UCD; ii) to establish a toolkit to support appropriate design in disparate cultures; iii) to disseminate this knowledge within industry and academia. This research directly builds on the researcher�s prior Marie Curie ToK research, during which a design framework and evaluation tool was developed at Philips Research in Eindhoven to support socially intelligent design of products. By exploring new and pertinent research findings, capitalizing on existing international industry and academic partners (whilst simultaneously seeking to extend this network of interest), and addressing social need to ensure design fits culture, The Renaissance Project research findings promise to lead to new understanding and support for technology design and innovation.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"256599","fundValue":"45000","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
