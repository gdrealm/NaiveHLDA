{"id":"97337","title":"Joint Action for Multimodal Embodied Social Systems","abstractText":"The JAMES project ('Joint Action for Multimodal Embodied Social Systems') aims to develop a socially intelligent humanoid robot combining efficient task-based behaviour with the ability to understand and respond in a socially appropriate manner to a wide range of multimodal communicative signals in the context of realistic, open-ended, multi-party interactions.nnTo direct our research in JAMES, we will focus on five core objectives: (1) analysing natural human communicative signals, (2) building a model of social interaction, (3) extending the model to manage learning and uncertainty, (4) implementing the model on a physical robot platform, and (5) evaluating the implemented system.nnThe work in JAMES will build on state-of-the-art results and techniques in seven areas: social robotics, social signal processing, machine learning, multimodal data collection, planning and reasoning, visual processing, and natural language interaction.nnJAMES will combine the analysis of human social communicative behaviour, the development and integration of state-of-the-art technical components, and the evaluation of integrated systems. Work on these threads will be interleaved: the results of the human data analysis will be used in the development of the technical components, while the robot will be used for further data collection and evaluation studies.nnJAMES will extend the state-of-the-art in social robotics by moving beyond one-on-one, long-term relationships to deal with more open-ended, multi-party, short-term situations. The research in JAMES will also increase our understanding of how humans use multimodal social cues to communicate and coordinate their interactions in task-driven, joint-action contexts. The individual technical contributions to the system components will also providenstate-of-the-art results in their respective research areas.","grantUrl":"http://james-project.eu","grantId":"270435","fundValue":"3747367","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
