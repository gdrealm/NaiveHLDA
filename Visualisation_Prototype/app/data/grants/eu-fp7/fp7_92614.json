{"id":"92614","title":"Pan-European training in computational cosmology: modelling cosmic structures","abstractText":"'European scientists lead the world in the modelling of the formation of cosmic structures using computer simulations. The objective of the CosmoComp proposal is to reinforce Europe&apos;s world standing in this field by training the next generation of computational cosmologists. CosmoComp builds on and extends existing research collaborations between major European centres, and has a global element with links to Latin America and the Far East. New training capacity will be developed through the network activities, which will benefit early stage researchers from across Europe, beyond the network members. We propose a series of ground breaking ``grand-challenge&apos;&apos; simulations which use the state of the art numerical techniques in the subject on some of the largest supercomputers available in Europe. Sun Microsystems and Microsoft will actively participate in our training programme, ensuring that CosmoComp will prepare young people for a research career in academia or industry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"238356","fundValue":"4646615.49","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
