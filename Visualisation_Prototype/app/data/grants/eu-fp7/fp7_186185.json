{"id":"186185","title":"Asymmetric reactions of nitrile compounds: an approach to the synthesis of bioactive molecules","abstractText":"'This proposal, written jointly by Prof Iain Coldham (Sheffield, UK) and Dr Arghya Sadhukhan (Bhavnagar, India) details research in synthetic chemistry. The research will advance knowledge in the formation of single mirror image compounds based on a very recent discovery in the Coldham group on the stability of metallated nitrile compounds. Dr Sadhukhan has relevant experience in handling nitriles during his PhD studies and is extremely well placed to join this project. He will conduct research in synthetic chemistry to advance knowledge and understanding of the preparation of nitrile compounds with high selectivities. This is a very important area for synthetic chemistry, of relevance to the preparation of bioactive drug molecules. It is timely, as we have just published preliminary results in a high impact journal for chemistry communications (Angewandte Chemie). The University of Sheffield is well placed to advance this area, building on the experience of Prof Coldham. In addition, the Fellow Dr Sadhukhan will bring knowledge and skills of particular relevance that will enhance the standing of the European Research Area (ERA).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"625471","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
