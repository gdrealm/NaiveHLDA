{"id":"99451","title":"\"Reading Humanity: Language, Text and Power\"","abstractText":"'Reading�s Researchers� Night (RN) is inspired by the European-wide discussion in the media of the role and value of the arts and humanities in society. By showcasing the research theme in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities (FAH): �Language, Text and Power (LTP)�, Reading�s RN will make available to the wider public the importance and relevance of the arts and the humanities, showing them how this is used for �reading humanity�. The event will be hosted by FAH, which is well placed to take on the challenge posed by the debate by its unique combination of traditional academic and practical subjects, combined with a large number of museums and collections. Reading�s RN has as its objectives to raise public awareness and understanding of the arts and humanities; their profile within the local and national community; to open up new avenues of public engagement and income; and to showcase Reading as a European centre of excellence. Reading�s Museums and Special Collections play a central role in this. The RN will be aimed in the first place at the local community (young children, teenagers and prospective students and minorities). It will produce a series of interactive education packages for schools, community centres and local museums, which can be used alongside and after the RN, ensuring a continued engagement with the wider public. The RN will take place in 4 prominent locations in the city of Reading and on the University�s Campus. It will begin in the afternoon to enable children to take part. Throughout, there will be a strong presence of researchers from the Faculty, highlighting their research and the people and their personal interests. The evening will culminate in a reception including musical performances, entertainment and refreshments by researchers from FAH, demonstrating the many creative and varied talents of researchers outside their research expertise. Engaging with Europe and promoting European mobility is also an important aspect of the event.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"287465","fundValue":"100884.01","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
