{"id":"95355","title":"Multifunctional MEdical DIagnostic LASEr System","abstractText":"'MEDI-LASE proposes to perform a joint research programme capitalising on the knowledge and expertise of the partners through exchanges of researchers and transfers of knowledge between research centres at the University of Dundee, Laser Physics and the Institute of Medical Science and Technology and two SME companies with expertise in different aspects of photonics based diagnosis, a manufacturer and developer of state-of-the-art medical diagnostics equipment ASKION GMbH and a Russian developer of integrated diagnostic laser systems LAZMA. The aims are to overcome scientific and technical challenges to the realisation and adoption of a unique multifunctional non-invasive laser diagnostic system. Specifically, new and novel laser sources will be developed and validation of the spectroscopy and complex algorithms required to provide relevant and reliable diagnosis of specific biological conditions. The work will comprise experimental research in the optical analysis of blood and tissue to direct the exploitation of the developed system. The project will draw on technology and expertise from all three partners while training 4 early stage researchers and providing career development opportunities for 4 recruited experienced researchers. Many opportunities for further research collaborations exist between the partners and it is anticipated that MEDI-LASE will facilitate the development of relations to catalyse ongoing long-term collaborations.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251531","fundValue":"1630569","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
