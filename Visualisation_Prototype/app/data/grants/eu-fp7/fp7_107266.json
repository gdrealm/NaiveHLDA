{"id":"107266","title":"Methodology for and Synthesis of Highly Congested Molecules","abstractText":"The development of new methodologies which allow for the direct synthesis of highly complex molecular entities bearing vicinal all carbon quaternary stereocentres remains a most important goal for modern synthetic chemists.\nThe aim of this proposal is to develop cutting-edge methodology for congested molecule synthesis and apply it to the total synthesis of the core of a highly complex natural product.\nPhase 1 of the project will involve the development of three related methodologies which will allow for the efficient synthesis of a wide range of highly complex tricyclic molecules bearing multiple stereocentres including vicinal all carbon quaternary stereocentres from simple achiral starting materials.\nIn Phase 2 of the project the developed methodologies will be used to synthesise the complex tetracyclic core of a highly complex biologically active terpenoid natural product.  The tetracyclic core will be further functionalised using state-of-the-art synthetic transformations.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329876","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
