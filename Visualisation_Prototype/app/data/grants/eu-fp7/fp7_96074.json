{"id":"96074","title":"Tephra constraints on rapid climatic events","abstractText":"'Little has challenged our understanding of climate change more so than the abruptness with which large-scale shifts in\ntemperature\noccurred during the last glacial period. Atmospheric temperature jumps of 8-16�C, occurring within decades over Greenland,\nwere closely\nmatched by rapid changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. Though these climatic instabilities are\nwell-documented in various\nproxy records, the causal mechanisms of such short-lived oscillations remain poorly understood. Two hypotheses have been\nproposed:\none relating to the behaviour of the ocean circulation and the other to the dynamics of the atmosphere. Testing these\nhypotheses,\nhowever, is severely hampered by dating uncertainties that prevent the integration of proxy records on common timescales.\nAs a result\nunravelling the lead/lag responses (hence cause and effect) between the Earth�s climate components is currently beyond our\nreach.\nTRACE will exploit a powerful new approach whereby microscopic traces of volcanic events are employed to precisely\ncorrelate proxy\nrecords from the North Atlantic region to assess the phasing relationships between the atmosphere and the ocean during\nthese rapid\nclimatic events. Volcanic layers have the unique advantage of representing fixed time-lines between different proxy records.\nThis\ncorrelation tool has experienced a considerable step-change in recent years, with invisible layers of volcanic ash traced over\nmuch wider\ngeographical regions than previously thought. What is more, recent work has identified new, previously unknown eruptions -\nseveral of\nwhich coincide with the rapid climatic jumps imprinted in the proxy records. Thus tephra isochrones represent (perhaps the\nonly)\nindependent constraints for resolving past events on decadal timescales.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"259253","fundValue":"1471116.8","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
