{"id":"88285","title":"Creative Design for Innovation in Science and Technology","abstractText":"Today�s economic environment is characterised by a high level of competitiveness emphasised by globalisation which enables access to low cost skills and services. Competing in a global economy and facing the challenges of tomorrow requires a movement towards innovation that recognises the key importance of creativity and design.  The proposed project aims to establish an interdisciplinary network of researchers investigating creative design in various applied domains including interaction design, industrial design and arts design. The goal is to create an internationally recognised programme of research that will expand the current state-of-the-art in creative design. This research proposal aims to strengthen the dialogue among the different disciplines contributing to creative design and to provide a basis for interdisciplinary investigation of technological creativity and innovation.  This network seeks to provide new researchers with knowledge and skills needed to investigate and support creative design, as well as apply it in practice in technological fields such as human�computer interaction and ubiquitous computing.  The research programme will focus on the following topics: Creative problem solving in design; Studying creative design process; Supporting creativity;  Modelling creativity; and Innovation in teaching/learning design.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"215446","fundValue":"3243287.69","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
