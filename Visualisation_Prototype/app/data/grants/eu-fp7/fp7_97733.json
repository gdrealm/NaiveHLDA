{"id":"97733","title":"Low-x Gluon Distribution from the  Discretised BFKL  Equation","abstractText":"'The BFKL equation in perturbative QCD, with certain well-defined additional assumptions about the non-perturbative (infrared) contributions to the QCD pomeron, will be used to extract a realistic gluon distribution at low-x. This will be exploited to make predictions for jet cross-sections at the LHC. The second part of the project involves the extension of the BFKL equation to non-forward pomerons. These will be used to extract generalized gluon distributions which will, in turn, be used to make predictions about diffractive events at LHC.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"246924","fundValue":"16200","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
