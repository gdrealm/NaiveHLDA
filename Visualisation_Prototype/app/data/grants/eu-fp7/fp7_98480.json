{"id":"98480","title":"VASCULAR BONE","abstractText":"'Abstract\nThe European population is ageing, forecasting a growing demand of health care solutions. The demand for biomaterials, either for orthopaedics, dental or maxilla-facial applications, will follow this trend. According to Biomet report, it is estimated that in Europe, 180,000 man and 610,000 women will suffer from hip fracture due to osteoporosis. These numbers will grow until 2050. Bearing in mind European population ageing as well as the status of social and financial indicators, it is urgent to develop more successful bone substitutes. A large number of bone substitutes made of calcium phosphate-based materials are commercially available. Despite the progresses that have been made with regard to their biocompatibility, one research area is being serious neglected: the study of the capability of acquiring blood vessels (angiogenic capability). The presence of blood vessels is the first critical step of bone regeneration and affects the implant success rate. The present proposal aims to tackle this problem through the development of a bone substitute with angiogenic potential, the VASCULAR BONE.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"275005","fundValue":"209592.8","fundStart":"2012-02-13","fundEnd":"2014-02-12","dataset":"fp7"}
