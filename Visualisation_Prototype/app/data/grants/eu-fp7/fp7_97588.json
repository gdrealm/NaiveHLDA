{"id":"97588","title":"The search for the nature of dark energy and its equation of state","abstractText":"'Understanding of the nature of dark energy is currently one of the most important and topical problems in cosmology. This project aims to study the problem of dark energy. It aims to investigate how matter inhomogeneities that are present in the Universe affect the results of cosmological observations and if they can account for dark energy. There have been already a number of findings which show that one can fit cosmological observations (supernova, CMB, H(z)) without the need for dark energy. Instead of invoking dark energy, these inhomogeneous models assume existence of Gpc-scale inhomogeneities. This is a very tempting and elegant explanation since it requires neither exotic forms of energy nor new laws of physics. However, these types of models require further tests against available observations and this project aims to do that. Also it focuses on problems of evolving dark energy models and the possibility of distinguishing observationally between models of constant dark energy (cosmological constant) and evolving dark energy.\nTherefore, the results of this project will contribute to improvement of our understanding of the Universe.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252950","fundValue":"166040.8","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
