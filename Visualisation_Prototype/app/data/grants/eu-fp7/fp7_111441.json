{"id":"111441","title":"Durham International Fellowships for Research and Enterprise","abstractText":"'The Durham International Fellowships for Research and Enterprise (DIFeREns2) will greatly expand and enhance a successful COFUNDed fellowship scheme at Durham University.  DIFeREns2 will provide fellowships across all areas of the natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities for both early-career and established researchers seeking to address challenging problems in the 10 interdisciplinary Research Institutes and more than 50 Research Centres within the University. The Colleges of Durham University will accommodate the Senior Fellows and enrol the Junior Fellows into their welcoming intellectual community.\n\nThe renowned Institute of Advanced Study (IAS), situated within the World Heritage Site around Durham Cathedral, will administer the Fellowship Scheme and act as a focus for cohort-building activities and a locus for Fellows to meet and interact.  The IAS hosts the Universityï¿½s signature IAS Fellowship Scheme, which brings together 20 Fellows each year from across all academic disciplines and the creative arts to work together on an annual theme.\n\nThe Junior Research Fellowship scheme aims to attract early-career researchers of the highest calibre from around the world, who wish to undertake a substantial research project for a period of 1-3 years. JRFs are full employees of Durham University. DIFeREns2 will enhance our existing JRF scheme by including an outgoing phase for up to 25% of the Fellowship to stimulate network building and trans-national mobility, as well as generous research expenses and new personal development opportunities in the Colleges.\n\nThere will be two types of Senior Fellowships: Senior Research Fellowships for leading international researchers, and Policy and Enterprise Fellowships for practitioners in industry, government, NGOs or cultural organisations, who will engage with the application of research in Durham.  Intersectoral mobility is a central theme of both the Policy and Enterprise Fellowships and the IAS Fellowships.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"609412","fundValue":"19214382","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2019-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
