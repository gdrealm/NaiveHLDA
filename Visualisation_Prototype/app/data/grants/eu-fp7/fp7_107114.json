{"id":"107114","title":"Multifunctional theranostic nanoparticles using pH-responsive DNA-nanoparticle conjugate for effective cancer therapy","abstractText":"'Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 7.6 million deaths in 2008. Although conventional cancer chemotherapy can provide profound benefits, seriously adverse side-effects still cannot be avoided, due to lack of specific targeting nature of current treatments. Nanomedicine can reduce such side-effects by exploiting characteristic properties of tumors for targeted delivery and therapy. Despite extensive research, most nanomedicines developed so far have relied on passive targeting using a single therapeutic modality, which are inefficient for treatment of challenging conditions such as multi-drug resistance.\n\nRecently we developed a pH-responsive-DNA-GNP conjugate based nanocarrier that numerous features required for an ideal drug nanocarrier, e.g. uniform small nanoscale size, resisting non-specific adsorption, non-toxic, biocompatible, water-soluble, stable, and having high drug loading and controlled release capacities. It can offer efficient and pH-triggered drug release suitable for effective cancer chemotherapy at the cellular level using doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapy drug.\n\nHerein we will extend it into a more effective, multifunctional nanomedicine that can offer simultaneous biomodal chemotherapies with hyperthermia and MRI imaging capacities. First, we will prepare, characterize, and evaluate their drug loading & release profiles in buffer; then we will study and quantify their cell- & cell-specific- uptake and drug delivery efficiency, and then evaluate their toxicity, cytotoxicity & cell-specific cytotoxicity with cancer cells (incoming phase), and finally evaluate their synergistic therapeutic efficacy at cellular and preclinical level (re-integration phase). This project will greatly benefit both the fundamental research in nanomedicine and the healthcare/pharmaceutical indurstries in Europe.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"331281","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
