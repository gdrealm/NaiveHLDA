{"id":"185533","title":"Four World Nodes for Brain Networks of Attention and Awareness","abstractText":"'A Group of cognitive neuroscience institutes join forces to enhance scientific advances on cognition through a series of collaborative actions centred on knowledge and information sharing and transfer through sustained cooperation. The project aims at realizing a high-level researchersï¿½ exchange and networking activities in cognitive neuroscience in health and disease. The research group has four Nodes: Cambridge (UK), Dublin (Ireland), Brisbane (Australia) and Melbourne (Australia). The topic to jointly investigate is the exploration of the mechanisms of human attention in healthy people and in those with disorders or brain injury. Attention is crucial in coordinating cognitive functions, and its relationship with consciousness and awareness, scarcely studied, will benefit of combined efforts from the Nodes looking at the manner this function of the brain works in normal participants and patients with brain disorders. The staff exchange will provide a very efficient opportunity to promote joint publications and to exploit the complementary expertise. The participants in the Network will exchange knowledge and get trained by using Workshops (to evaluate progress of the Network and set up new research lines), Seminars (training on specific topics), Visits (to exchange concrete methods and analysis techniques) and Experiments (research trips for collaborative experiments that would integrate expertise of several Nodes) as common coins for the integration of different areas of expertise in one common shared network.  The project is embedded in and linked with several international research projects and coordinated by scientists that have been collaborating intermittently for 20 years. We plan dissemination events with policy makers both in Europe and Australia which will provide the respective communities with essential material for informed decisions on disorders of attention such as ADHD, Alzheimer, traumatic brain injury, and hypoxic/anoxic brain injury.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612681","fundValue":"285600","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
