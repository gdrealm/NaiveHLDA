{"id":"107019","title":"Tailored Quantum Structures","abstractText":"Self-assembled semiconductor quantum structures are the subject of world-wide interest because of their potential use in quantum information technologies and nanoscale optoelectronics. This project will advance this field by obtaining nanoscale movies of III-V quantum structure formation. This will be achieved by establishing a ï¿½ 1 million Low Energy Electron Microscope (LEEM) which is the only instrument in the world capable of obtaining nanoscale movies of compound semiconductor growth under arsenic flux. The understanding gained from this work will facilitate a new level of control over specific quantum features for device applications.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327229","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
