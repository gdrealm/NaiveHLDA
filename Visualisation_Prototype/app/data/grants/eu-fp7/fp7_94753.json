{"id":"94753","title":"Europe's Asian Centuries: Trading Eurasia 1600-1830","abstractText":"The project brings global perspectives and interdisciplinary methods to bear on histories of industrialization, consumer and material culture. It investigates the key connector that transformed the early modern world: the long-distance trade between Asia and Europe in material goods and culture. That trade stimulated Europe s consumer and industrial revolutions, re-orientating the Asian trading world to European priorities. The twenty-first century sees a new Asian ascendancy: Europe has lost those manufacturing catalysts of textiles, ceramics and metal goods back to Asia. This project seeks to understand Europe s new challenge of Asia by charting the history of that first global shift between the pre-modern and modern worlds. Europe s pursuit of quality goods in the 17th and 18th Centuries turned a pre-modern encounter with precious and exotic ornaments into a modern globally-organized trade in Asian export ware. But ironically the result was Europe s industrialization and China s and India s displacement as the world s manufacturer. The project compares Europe s trade with India in high quality textiles with its trade with China in porcelain using the records of Europe s East India companies and major museum collections of export-ware objects. The PI will research the English East India Company together with a PhD student, and lead three postdoctoral fellows in comparative case studies on other European companies, especially the Dutch, the French and Scandinavian companies. The research is groundbreaking in bringing the study of traded products, material cultures and consumption into economic and global history, and in making economic history relevant to wider cultural history. It has the vision of a history over a long time period and wide European and Asian comparisons and connections.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"249362","fundValue":"1544667","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
