{"id":"192382","title":"Twists & more: the complex shape of light","abstractText":"'My scientific career to date has centered around the phase and intensity shaping of light beams, specifically for the pioneering studies of Orbital angular momentum.\n\nI wish to build upon this foundation applying twisted and shaped light to sensing and imaging in both the classical and quantum domains.\n\nI will use orbital angular momentum as a new imaging modality and as the basis as a remote sensor of rotational motion.  I will used randomly shaped light beam as a new approach to 3D vision.  I will use the quantum correlations of orbital angular momentum and other spatial states to explore new demonstrations of quantum behaviour and deliver imaging performance beyond the classical limit.\n\nTo realize this project, funding is sought for 2 FTE postdoctoral research assistants for 5 years and 3 PhD students who will work in close conjunction with myself.  I will devote myself to this project, both technically in the laboratory and in promoting the results of the program to international scientific, industrial and political peers.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"340507","fundValue":"1734570","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2019-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
