{"id":"192281","title":"A fully automatic method and apparatus for economical and long-lasting patching of potholes","abstractText":"'Pothole repair in road networks is one of the most commonly performed operation for most road maintenance teams, especially in areas where cold winters and wet springs contribute to accelerated road surface breakup ever year. The poor condition and lack of maintenance of European roads contribute to at least one third of all accidents each year, and accounting to 52.7% of fatalities in 2011. Potholes also hold the distinction of being the most aggravating road distress to the traveling public in general.\n\nPothole repair generally accounts for a significant portion of transportation departments� operating budget, with more than �1,2 billion being directly attributed to fill nearly 20 million potholes in Europe during 2011, but only half of Europe's potholes were treated. This can be attributed to the high initial costs associated with maintenance activities, the historically poor performance of patching which often necessitates additional maintenance work, and the exorbitant safety and legal costs associated with the need for traffic control of these activities. As such, any improvements or advancements in this area could result in substantial cost savings.\n\nAs a response to this need, a potholer repair method that will significantly reduce the direct costs (cost of repair) and indirect costs (cost of user compensation, traffic disrupts, etc.) associated with road maintenance activities is required. Specifically, increased effectiveness and better productivity during pothole repair and enhanced longevity of potholes use are required.\n\nThe proposed solution is to develop a fully automatic, via robotic vision and computer-control, and adaptive, via an expert system, pothole repair system with integrated quality assurance mechanisms, as well as a new, robust patch material blend - an emulsified asphalt emulsion - that lend itself to the automatic process and demonstrates excellent performance.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"601426","fundValue":"1424617.2","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
