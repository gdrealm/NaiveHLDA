{"id":"103491","title":"Novel Nano-Stabilisation for Green Bioplastic Nanocomposites","abstractText":"'The primary focus of NANOSTAB-GB (Novel NanoStabilisation for Green Biopolymer-Nanocomposites) is on developing innovative technology for enhancing processability, performance and durability of sustainable green biopolymer-based nanocomposite materials.  The underpinning science is a novel chemical process for the immobilisation of protective agents onto natural nanoscopic-size reinforcing fillers embedded in biodegradable and compostable polymers. The novel chemistry developed here will be technologically relevant and industrially viable for production of durable structured biodegradable nanocomposites with direct involvement (in project and training) of leading European producer. One challenging demand in materials research today is that of the development of advanced materials based on sustainable resources as alternatives to fossil fuel-based materials. Current biopolymer-clay-based nanocomposites have the potential to meeting this demand competitively but only when new technological breakthroughs emerge to overcome major short- and long- term performance problems of stability during high temperature manufacture and in-sevice. The scientific goal of NANOSTAB-GB is to bring about step-change development in a technology platform which is readily scalable by implementing �smart� stabilisation approaches for modifying nanoparticles and building biopolymer-nanoparticle reinforcing networks structured around naturally-occurring, bio- or synthetically- based antioxidants. Results generated will be disseminated globally; the outcome of NANOSTAB-GB addresses directly the EU vision of �Knowledge Based Bio Economy�. IP generated will help maintain EU lead on �green� materials and to meeting CO2 emission targets. Above all, it will provide an inspirational training opportunity for a talented fellow with assured successful outcome benefitting both fellow and EU with the emergence of a multi-skilled leader in biomass-based materials research with sustainability at its core.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300302","fundValue":"232339.5","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
