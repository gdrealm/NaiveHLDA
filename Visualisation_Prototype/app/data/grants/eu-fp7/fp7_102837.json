{"id":"102837","title":"Functional analysis of osmo-sensitive signalling processes regulating the metabolic response to environmental stress","abstractText":"'Plants use light energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce monosaccharides - the building blocks of the polysaccharides forming plant cell walls. Plant cell walls represent the first line of defence against environmental stress while representing the bulk of the biomass used for bioenergy production. Their composition and structure influences both efficiency of bioenergy production and resistance of food crops to biotic / abiotic stress. The plant cell wall integrity maintenance mechanism monitors the functional integrity of the wall and initiates changes in cell wall structure / composition and metabolic changes in response to cell wall damage (CWD) to maintain functional integrity of the cell wall. The aim of the proposed research is to dissect the mode of action of the mechanism coordinating cell wall integrity maintenance with primary metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. Previous work in the host lab has implicated sugar-based signalling and turgor-sensitive processes in the response to CWD. The host lab has developed FRET-based nanosensors targeted to different cellular compartments for in vivo soluble sugar detection. These sensors will enable determination of the effects of CWD and turgor manipulation on intracellular soluble sugar distribution with subcellular resolution. In addition, a phospho-proteomics approach will be employed to identify and functionally characterise novel proteins required for mediating the response to CWD and turgor induced metabolic changes. Candidate proteins identified in the screen will be validated by biochemical assays and phenotypic characterisation of candidate gene knockouts. The results of this project will provide novel insights into the cell wall integrity maintenance mechanism that could lead to improved food crop performance and facilitated bioenergy production.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"301307","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
