{"id":"94417","title":"All Condition Operations and Innovative Cockpit Infrastructure","abstractText":"'ALICIA addresses the ACARE objective of increasing time efficiency within the future air transport system. The aim will be to develop a new and scalable cockpit application which can extend operations of aircraft in degraded conditions � �All Conditions Operations�. A key objective will be to deliver an extensible application that can be applied to many aircraft types.  This will necessarily entail a new cockpit infrastructure capable of delivering enhanced situation awareness to the crew whilst simultaneously reducing crew workload and improving overall aircraft safety.   All Conditions Operations, other challenging applications and the desire for reduced crew will mean that the crew station interface will be challenged beyond the reach of the current state-of-the-art. Accordingly, a radical rethink is required to manage the escalating complexity whilst simultaneously enhancing safety and controlling through life cost.  Thus, the next significant step in cockpit design will require a holistic integration of technologies allowing the crew to process and act on information concurrently and intuitively, using an optimum combination of their visual, tactile and audio senses.  In the concept envisaged, use will be made of precision navigation, synthetic vision, high integrity data bases, sensor and sensor data and image fusion, obstacle warning systems, taxi autopilots, touch screens, large area displays, voice/audio and multimodal input/output devices to deliver an All Conditions Operations application integrated within an enhanced crew interface. A major objective will be to deliver a common, and open standard interface which can manage existing core applications across all aircraft types whilst simultaneously supporting the needs of challenging new applications.  The ALICIA project is uniquely placed to deliver the capability necessary to facilitate the next big step in crew station design.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"233682","fundValue":"47233679.66","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
