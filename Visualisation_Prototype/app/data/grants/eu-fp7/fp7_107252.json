{"id":"107252","title":"Ruthenium Based Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitor�s","abstractText":"'In this research, the fellow (Jayapal Reddy Mallareddy) will synthesize novel cell permeable fluorescent ruthenium complexes and demonstrate their utility for perturbing biological processes. This fellowship will build on the fellows expertise in synthetic chemistry (particularly peptide synthesis) applied at the biological interface, together with Leeds� expertise in the design and synthesis of cell permeable inhibitors of protein-protein interactions. The project will ultimately furnish cell permeable fluorescent small molecules designed to act as inhibitors of key protein-protein interactions involved in disease development and progression. Such inhibitors can be used as tool molecules to understand biological processes, as sensors for malfunctioning proteins and as the starting point for development of new molecular therapeutics thus impacting the competitiveness of the EU, and the quality of life of its citizens, by facilitating new strategies for diagnosing and treating disease.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"326744","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
