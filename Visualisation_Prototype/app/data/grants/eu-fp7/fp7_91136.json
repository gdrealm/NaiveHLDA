{"id":"91136","title":"Managing Global Human Resources in UK Multi National Corporations","abstractText":"'Internationalisation of firms has been a key issue in international business research for several decades. Much attention has been given to the process; market entry modes; organisational structures in the multinational firm; and the impact of culture on firmsï¿½ internationalisation. The process is often placed within the broader context of globalisation in general. Whether it is internationalisation or globalisation being examined, these two processes have fundamentally affected the study of disciplines, notably economics and management. Partly due to the relatively closed political and economic systems that existed until the late 1980s in Central Europe (CE) and Russia, these regions have been under-researched in the areas of internationalisation, globalisation, and HRM. Three CE countries have received the most significant foreign direct investment: Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. The proposed study draws upon the disciplines of economics and management theory to examine how UK-owned companies have made the decision to invest in these three countries. The study will examine the enabling factors that help contribute to successful subsidiary investments, with a particular focus on the management of HR between the subsidiary and UK Head-Quarters. The study will focus solely on UK-owned firms with brown and greenfield subsidiaries. It will examine the importance and constantly evolving role of global HR managers/directors. It will explore the well researched link between business strategy, the use of HRM practices and performance in the subsidiary. The research will identify characteristics of successful FDI in the region and policy recommendations will be made based on these findings.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"230969","fundValue":"75000","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
