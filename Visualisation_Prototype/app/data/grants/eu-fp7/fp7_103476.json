{"id":"103476","title":"Europe-China High Value Engineering Network (EC-HVEN): Shaping Sustainable Engineering Sectors in Europe and China","abstractText":"'Europe-China High Value Engineering Network (EC-HVEN) is an exchange project aiming to establish a framework for global network collaborations in high value engineering, manufacturing and innovation. This project builds on leading expertise in Europe and China along the whole engineering value chain from research, design, development and production, to delivery, service, support, recycling and disposal. Seven partners are involved from two EU Member States and China. These partners bring into this project complementary expertise along the full spectrum of the engineering value chain. The main objectives of this project include:\n� Increasing awareness of the importance and potential value of engineering and networking within the community of high value engineering research.\n� Providing a supportive environment for building collaborative research projects focusing on high value engineering technologies and novel concepts of operations.\n� Establishing a framework for global network collaborations in high value engineering areas.\n\nThe above strategic objectives will be achieved through exchange visits, workshops, and collaborative research projects organised into eight work packages. Main output will include a systematic view of high value engineering in Europe and China, an established community of researchers and practitioners for HVEN research, as well as practical guidance and enabling technologies for effective value creation based on HVEN.\n\nIt is expected that this project will provide direct benefits to the European institutions involved, the wider academic and industrial communities, and to the European Research Area as a whole. This project will also enhance research partnerships amongst the participants and help establish a long-term and lasting research co-operation. Furthermore, EC-HVEN targets at a frontier research area of increasing importance worldwide. This project will help Europe to lead the agenda for future HVEN research on an international platform.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"295130","fundValue":"837900","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
