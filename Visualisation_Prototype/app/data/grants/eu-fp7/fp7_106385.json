{"id":"106385","title":"Injectable Medical Ceramics for Bone Repair and Augmentation","abstractText":"'The repair and regeneration of bone tissue remains a significant clinical challenge in many clinical fields including orthopaedics, dentistry, and maxillofacial surgery.  The problem is increasing in the face of complicating factors such as the ageing population.  The aim of this project is to undertake a basic scientific study of new nanostructured biomaterials that will underpin the development of new nanostructured, injectable bone graft substitutes.  This scientific and technological research will be integrated with the development of a dedicated advanced delivery system that will provide the surgeon with a high degree of control during clinical use.  The basic scientific research will be directed at understanding structure-property relationships related to nanoparticle size and morphology, composition, and functional behaviour including rheology, biocompatibility, and bone tissue regeneration. While the project is ambitious, the likelihood of success is greatly increased by the formation of a consortium that includes different elements of the supply chain in combination with the scientific competencies necessary to execute the work programme.  The scientific and technological aspects of the project will be further enhanced by the participation of a clinical panel composed of surgeons from the two RTD partner organisations.  This combination of business, scientific and clinical expertise will together facilitate the translation of basic science through applied research and on to development of a new medical device.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"315679","fundValue":"2142500","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
