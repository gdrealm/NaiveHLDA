{"id":"95075","title":"The academic voice in quality and internationalisation of Czech and British higher education","abstractText":"'The proposed research concerns the issue of internationalisation in higher education and its relation to higher education quality. Quality in higher education has gained attention particularly over the last two decades (Westerheijden et al, 1994). Internationalisation in higher education is a phenomenon which has also recently become a widespread and strategically significant topic in higher education (Van der Wende and Westerheijden, 2001), and has developed in parallel with quality in higher education. In particular, the research proposes to investigate internationalisation and its relation to higher education quality through the academic voice in the Czech and British higher education systems. These issues are currently high on the agenda of many European higher education systems, including the Czech and British systems. The research study will utilise a �critical event� narrative inquiry method, which is a novel qualitative method ideally suited to investigate complex issues, such as internationalisation and quality in higher education. The essence of the �critical event� narrative inquiry method is in the identification of �critical events� in professional practice of individuals, in the case of this proposed research it will be the British and Czech academics and higher education leaders. To the researcher�s knowledge, higher education quality and internationalisation have not yet been investigated utilising such a method, nor have they both been previously investigated from an academic perspective. Thus, it is proposed that such research would be of great value to European higher education and potentially to other higher education systems worldwide, particularly in terms of further policy development.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"256366","fundValue":"75000","fundStart":"2010-05-10","fundEnd":"2013-05-09","dataset":"fp7"}
