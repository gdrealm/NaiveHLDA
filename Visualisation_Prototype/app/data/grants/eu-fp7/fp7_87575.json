{"id":"87575","title":"Plasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics with diamond-based quantum systems","abstractText":"'This proposal aims to realize physical systems for the realization of plasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics using optically active diamond-based quantum systems such as atomic impurities. Color centers in diamond provide a suitable test bed for applications of quantum information processing, as well as selected spin-spin interactions. While there are hundreds of known color centers in diamond, but only one (Nitrogen vacancy) is studied extensively. We will study optical properties and identify energy levels of alternative color centers both naturally occurring and artificially implanted, potential candidates being Ni, Si, or Fe impurities. We will in parallel study solid-state-based cavity QED with light confinement at sub-wavelength scale. Using metal nanostructures and plasmons, we aim at achieving individual or ensemble strongly coupled emitter-cavity systems. Further, we will study how sub-wavelength structures of a medium alter the material-based properties, so the optical fields can experience exotic media with negative refractive indices.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"209636","fundValue":"1712342","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
