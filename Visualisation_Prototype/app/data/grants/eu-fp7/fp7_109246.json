{"id":"109246","title":"Coatings for Composite Aero-engine structures","abstractText":"'The COMPOCOAT project will develop a new surface protection system for the development of composite aero-engine aerofoil structures with metallic leading edge. The surface protection system will be based on TWI�s CompoSurfTM family of coating technologies and provide erosion protection for the metallic leading edge and thermal protection for the composite body. In addition to the surface protection system, the Comeld� joining process will be utilised for achieving high strength bonding in the metal-composite interface. The leading edge itself will comprise of two fishbone shaped parts that will facilitate further strength to the bond. The two parts will be welded together by laser, ensuring aerodynamic surface at the edge tip.\nThe operating temperature for the new aerofoil structure will be in excess of 360�C. Out-of-Autoclave (OoA) processing will enable the rate manufacture of the demonstration parts, thus improving the cost effectiveness of the production.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"338290","fundValue":"710075","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
