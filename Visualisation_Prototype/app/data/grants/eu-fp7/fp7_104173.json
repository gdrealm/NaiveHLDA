{"id":"104173","title":"Development of a handheld antimalarial drug resistance diagnostic device using nanowire technology","abstractText":"'Malaria is a global health priority that has been targeted for elimination in recent years. Attaining the goals that define elimination of malaria in different countries depends critically on provision of effective antimalarials and further that these antimalarials are used appropriately in individual patients. Drug resistance is a major threat to malaria control and has important global public health implications. Over the past decades the genetic bases for resistance to most of the antimalarial classes currently in use has become defined. For some drugs and combinations, these mutations are the most important predictors of treatment failure. This proposal will innovate new technologies to confirm malaria diagnosis and detect drug resistance in malaria parasites by analysis of mutations in nucleic acids, using nanowire technology, and will result in the development of a simple, rapid and affordable point-of-care handheld diagnostic device. The device will be useful at many levels in malarial control by:\n\n1. Optimising individual treatments for patients\n2. Assessing the epidemiology of drug resistance in malaria endemic areas\n3. Assessing population impacts of antimalarial interventions\n\nThe development programme capitalises on highly original and proprietary advances made by QuantuMDx in the field of point-of-care diagnostics. This is complemented by academic expertise that has made major contributions to the understanding of antimalarial drug resistance mechanisms in laboratory models, as well as parasites obtained directly from patients. The impact of this proposal can be extended rapidly to other established and emerging infectious diseases.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"304948","fundValue":"5236310.8","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
