{"id":"92970","title":"\"Nanoelectronics: Concepts, Theory and Modelling\"","abstractText":"'The NanoCTM network will tackle major challenges in the theory of nanoelectronics. Ten internationally-leading European theory-of-condensed-matter groups from nine different countries [including one of Europeï¿½s leading industrial electronics-research groups (QinetiQ)] have joined forces as full participants, combining theoretical expertise in nanowires, quantum dots, carbon-based electronics, and spintronics, along with interaction and proximity effects in small dimensions. Our highly-integrated approach to nanoscale transport will represent a major step towards the realisation of future scalable nanotechnologies and processes. In the longer term, the insights gained will contribute to the fabrication of novel functional nanoscale architectures and their integration into a higher hierarchical level. System parameters such as electric field, light, temperature or chemical reactivity are envisaged as possible drivers of future nanoelectronic devices.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"234970","fundValue":"2466208.21","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
