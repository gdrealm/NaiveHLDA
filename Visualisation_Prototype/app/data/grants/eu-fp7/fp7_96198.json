{"id":"96198","title":"Evidence-based risk management in global software development projects","abstractText":"'This proposal is to enable Professor June Verner, who is recognised as a leading researcher in project failure, global software engineering and project management, to work with the leading internationally recognized research group in evidence-based software engineering at Keele University. The project will produce a set of guidelines to assist project managers in the identification of risks relating to global software development (GSD) and to recommend ways in which the risks can be addressed, minimised or mitigated within different project contexts, based upon high quality empirical evidence. The project will also deliver a software tool for use by GSD project managers. The project will therefore reduce the high failure rate of GSD projects. Essential to the success of the project is the training of both the research fellow and the project team at the host institution. The project will facilitate the transfer of invaluable knowledge relating to GSD and its associated risks to Europe and form the basis of a long-term collaboration between the researchers. In addition, the research fellow will receive training in evidence-based software engineering techniques, including systematic literature reviews, which can be used within teaching and research, and also benefit software practice in Australia.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253754","fundValue":"234089.6","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
