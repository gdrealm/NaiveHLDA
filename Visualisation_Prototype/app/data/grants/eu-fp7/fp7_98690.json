{"id":"98690","title":"End-to-end Virtual Resource Management across Heterogeneous Networks and Services","abstractText":"'The objective of the EVANS project is to increase researchers� mobility between EU countries and China to obtain better understanding of network virtualisation for future Internet infrastructure. In particular, the knowledge transfer, as a result of researcher�s mobility, will focus on the management aspects of the virtualised network resources rather than the virtualisation techniques themselves. As far as the types of network platforms are concerned, there are not only optical networks and IP networks for the core networks that constitute the Internet backbone but also various broadband wireless network technologies for mobile access. In order to provide an end-to-end service solution to end users, wireless mobile access network technologies have to be considered as an increasing number of users use mobile devices to get access to the Internet. The EVANS project aims to investigation into the creation of a network virtualisation environment over a fully heterogeneous network infrastructure and to provide an integrated network management system across different types of network platforms. The project will investigate into two complementary aspects of such an integrated network resource management system: (1) vertical management of virtualised resource for service heterogeneity, which is performed by infrastructure providers, and (2) horizontal management of virtualised resource for network heterogeneity, which is for the interest of service providers.\nThis staff exchange programme will also help develop new research links and deepen and strengthen the current research links amongst the partners and help build up long-term, world-class research in future Internet technology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269323","fundValue":"306600","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
