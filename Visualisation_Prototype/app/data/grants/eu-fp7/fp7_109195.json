{"id":"109195","title":"\"Wind Tunnel Model Design with Active Flow Control, for Low Speed Test\"","abstractText":"'The original requirement covered by this DEAFCON proposal was for the detailed design of two low speed half models, with a fully pressure plotted low sweep and high sweep wing respectively\n\nRemovable and variable Leading Edge, Trailing Edge and Wing Tip devices were to be included, and the main element of innovation and learning for ARA would have been the integration of some form of Active Flow Control technology, which had not yet been defined\nDEAFCON\nAlso included would be relevant design changes to an unknown, but existing, half fuselage FALCON model to enable appropriate integration of either wing configurations together with their relevant AFC actuators ( recognising that these fuselage design modifications would need to be considered fully reversible )\n\nHowever, prior to commencement of this programme, the scope and work content was changed quite considerably by the Topic Leader to comply with their final Specification document DGT-132940 Iss C Oct 2013\nThis document presented the specification of the design of a single large scale half-model for testing in a pressurized low speed wind tunnel.  Integration of any Active Flow technology was thus dropped at this stage, and the parts to design within DEAFCON became therefore:-\n\n�\tA left-hand side modular wing with high aspect-ratio and low sweep\n�\tA set of Body fairings to fit with the fuselage\n�\tA left hand side cross-shaped HTP and its movable attachment fitting compatible with the former Vertical Tail\n�\tA simplified main landing gear and its cavity'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"271784","fundValue":"219000","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
