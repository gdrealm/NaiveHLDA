{"id":"91926","title":"\"Metallopolymers with Metal-Metal Bonds: The Synthesis, Characterization and Applications of Novel Molecular Wires\"","abstractText":"'In this project the synthesis of metal-metal bonded oligomeric or polymeric linear metal chain complexes from metal-metal bonded dimetallic units by various methods is proposed. Nanoscience applications of the newly synthesized materials, e.g. as molecular wires, will be investigated. The proposed research on Metallopolymers with Metal-Metal Bonds: The Synthesis, Characterization and Applications of Novel Molecular Wires is at the cutting edge of the advanced functional polymer field and is both highly interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary. The project involves synthetic inorganic and coordination chemistry, synthetic polymer chemistry and polymer materials science and nanoscience. The project described herein would thus have a substantial multidisciplinary impact that reaches beyond purely the chemical sciences into materials science and physics.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"237365","fundValue":"181350.76","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
