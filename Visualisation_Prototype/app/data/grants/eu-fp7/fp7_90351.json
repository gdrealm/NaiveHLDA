{"id":"90351","title":"Northern Seas Wind Index Database","abstractText":"NORSEWInD is a programme designed to provide a wind resource map covering the Baltic, Irish and North Sea areas.  The project will acquire highly accurate, cost effective, physical data using a combination of traditional Meteorological masts, ground based remote sensing instruments (LiDAR & SoDAR) and Satellite acquired SAR winds.The vertical resolution of the ground based instruments will be used to calibrate the Satellite data to provide hub height, real world data.  The resultant wind map will be the first stop for all potential developers in the regions being examined, and as such represents an important step forward in quantifying the quality of the wind resource available offshore. The techniques employed are fully transferrable, meaning that they can be repeated in any offshore environment. This will be showcased in the NORSEWInD validation task.  Remote sensing has a hugely important role to play within the wind industry, and their use within the NORSEWInD programme to reduce the cost and increase the accuracy of offsore wind measurements will increase acceptance and showcase the ability and power of the techniques.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219048","fundValue":"7612090.2","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
