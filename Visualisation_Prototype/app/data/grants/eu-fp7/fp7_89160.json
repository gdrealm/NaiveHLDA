{"id":"89160","title":"\"Modelling, Optimization and Control of Biomedical Systems\"","abstractText":"'The main aim of the proposed project is to develop models and model based control and optimization methods and tools  for drug delivery systems, which would ensure: (i) Reliable and fast calculation of the optimal drug dosage without the need for an on-line computer while taking into account the specifics and constraints of the patient model (personalised health care) (ii) Flexibility to adapt to changing patient characteristics, (iii) Incorporation of the physician s performance criteria (iv) Safety of the patients (v) Reduced size effects by optimising the drug infusion rates The overall control and optimisation approach will rely on the novel multi-parametric model-based control technology developed by the PI over the past 15 years, which will be further extended and implemented in the context of the following biomedical systems (a) insulin delivery (b) control of anaesthesia and hemodynamic variables, (c) optimal chemotherapy design for anti-cancer (d) optimal control of the chemotherapy for HIV.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"226462","fundValue":"1782925","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
