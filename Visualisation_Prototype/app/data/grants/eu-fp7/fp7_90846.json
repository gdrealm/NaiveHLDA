{"id":"90846","title":"LINKING RINGS INTO COMPLEX STRUCTURES","abstractText":"'The project is to link chemically controlled nanoobjects into new types of material. Specifically, a class of molecular magnet called 'antiferromagnetic rings' can be functionalised such that through chemistry we can produce arrays of such rings. Initially we will target dimeric structures, where two such rings will be linked through a switchable group. Such structures have been proposed as possible two-Qubit quantum gates for quantum information processing. In the latter part of the project we will extend this work to produce larger supramolecular assemblies, using antiferromagnetic rings as building blocks. The materials, once made, will be studied using a range of physical techniques, including magnetic susceptiblity measurements, EPR spectroscopy and photophysical studies in Manchester, and more complex magnetic characterisation with European collaborators.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219588","fundValue":"178874.06","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
