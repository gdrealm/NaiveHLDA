{"id":"98475","title":"Core-shell catalysts for Direct Alcohol Fuel Cells (DAFCs): Study of the structure and stability under electrochemical conditions by X-ray structural techniques","abstractText":"'The development of low-cost materials is a determining step for the final introduction of low temperature fuel cells in the market. These systems, especially direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs), are the most important and promising alternative energy systems. However, their commercialisation for demanding applications, in particular for the transport sector, requires an increase of the metal efficiency and the reduction of the platinum content in electrodes in order to reduce the fuel cell cost.\n\nIn this context, the use of core-shell catalysts seems to be the most feasible solution for reducing the platinum content and, therefore, the fuel cell cost. This nanostructure involves the replacement of the core of the nanoparticles with less expensive metals. Furthermore, using this nanostructure, the utilization efficiency (surface-to-volume ratio) is increased, and an enhancement of the platinum activity is achieved due to an electronic, structural or morphological effect that depends on the metal used as core.\n\nIn this project, we will explore further enhancements of the alcohol (methanol and ethanol) oxidation activity of core@shell materials for the alcohol oxidation reaction (AOR) by preparing Pd-core, Pt-Ru or Pt@Ru shell catalysts. Subsequently, the studies will be extended to other core metals and ternary (bimetallic shell and/or core) systems. The overall aim will be to provide advance understanding of the structure/property relationships, by using in situ X-ray structural techniques, which determine alcohol oxidation activity as well as identifying the degradation mechanisms that limit the stability of the materials under electrochemical conditions.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"272632","fundValue":"200549.6","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
