{"id":"88348","title":"Absolute dating of the variations of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and correlation of events since the Eemian in north-east Germany","abstractText":"'Research into the extent and chronology of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet (SIS) has been conducted for > 150 years, yet the general pattern and timing of SIS advances is only understood in a few areas that are spaced apart by several 100s of kilometres. Thus, a realistic and full understanding of ice sheet dynamics and its response to, and interactions with, palaeo-climatic conditions during the last glacial cycle (c. 110-11.5 ka) is still very incomplete. This is largely due to a pronounced lack of chronology in several parts of the Northern European Plain (NEP) around the Baltic Sea Coast, in turn the result of the absence of suitable material for most dating methods. We here propose to use a combined approach of detailed sedimentological laboratory and field investigations and OSL-dating at selected key sites in North-East Germany, a much under-researched area compared to other areas on the NEP. This will enable a tight chronology for the emplacement of various glaciofluvial, glaciolacustrine and glaciomarine sediments that are found on this part of the NEP to be established. The study areas were chosen because existing numerical dates are absent or, where they exist, provide contradictory evidence. Likewise, existing numerical dates from the surrounding areas on the NEP require similarly detailed dates in order to allow correlations to be made and also to fill gaps in our knowledge. The data resulting from the proposed project would ultimately allow numerical modellers to tune their models according to the field evidence. Only if such models are well-constrained by palaeo-evidence can they be expected to reliably predict future climate change. Thus, the proposed project is of immediate societal interest.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"224739","fundValue":"37500","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
