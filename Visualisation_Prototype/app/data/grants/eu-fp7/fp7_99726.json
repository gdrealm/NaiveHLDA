{"id":"99726","title":"Building a Visual Brain for Fast Human Machine Interaction","abstractText":"'Effective computer vision is a major research challenge. Vision plays a critical role in the interaction of most animal species with a dynamic world, and even relatively low order animals have remarkable visual processing capabilities. However, much research in neural vision has been based upon general computing systems, whereas the powerful parallel computing capacity of visual neural systems can only be fully demonstrated and utilized when realized in Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) chips.\n\nFocusing on modelling biological visual neural systems and realizing them in chips for human-machine interaction, the research staff exchange programme will bring opportunities for the four partners to work together and complement each othersï¿½ research strengths via research staff secondments, training seminars, joint workshops and jointly organised conferences, to explore the multidisciplinary research area and to build strong connections between the European institutions and partner institutions in a fast growing economy. Five work packages (WPs) are designed to achieve the objectives of the project:\n\nWP1: biological plausible visual neural system modelling,\nWP2: multiple visual neural systems integration,\nWP3: VLSI neural vision chip design,\nWP4: biologically plausible vision systems for human-machine interaction, and\nWP5: management, networking and dissemination.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269118","fundValue":"798000","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
