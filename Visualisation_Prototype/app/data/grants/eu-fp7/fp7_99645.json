{"id":"99645","title":"\"Memory, Youth, Political Legacy And Civic Engagement\"","abstractText":"'MYPLACE explores how young people?s social participation is shaped by the\nshadows (past, present and future) of totalitarianism and populism in Europe.\nConceptually, it goes beyond the comparison of discrete national �political cultures?\nor reified classifications of political heritage (�postcommunist?/?liberal democratic?);\nit is premised rather on the pan-European nature of a range of radical and populist\npolitical and philosophical traditions and the cyclical rather than novel nature of the\npopularity they currently enjoy. Empirically, MYPLACE employs a combination of\nsurvey, interview and ethnographic research instruments to provide new, pan-\nEuropean data that not only measure levels of participation but capture the meanings\nyoung people attach to it. Analytically, through its specific focus on �youth? and the\nhistorical and cultural contextualization of young people?s social participation,\nMYPLACE replaces the routine, and often abstract, iteration of the reasons for young\npeople?s �disengagement? from politics with an empirically rich mapping of young\npeople?s understandings of the civic and political space that they inhabit. In policy\nterms, MYPLACE identifies the obstacles to, and facilitators of, young people?s\nreclamation of the European political arena as a place for them.'","grantUrl":"http://www.fp7-myplace.eu/","grantId":"266831","fundValue":"9968172.4","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
