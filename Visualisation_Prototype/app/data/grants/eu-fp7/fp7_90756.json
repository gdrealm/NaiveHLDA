{"id":"90756","title":"Opto-electronic properties of graphene and other carbon nanostructures","abstractText":"'Project covers theortical/computational studies of optoelectronic properties of graphene and other carbon-based nanostructures, aimed at both fundamental effects and application in future graphene nanotechnology. Major goals are: (i) learning new, powerful methods of electronic-structure calculations (quantum Monte Carlo and density functional theory) and their application for graphene nanostructures; (ii) learning methods of field theory and combining them with extensive present expertise for the studies of many-body effects in electronic and optical response, with expected application in novel nanodevices; (iii) learning complementary skills for establishment of home interdisciplinary research group focused on nanoscience/nanotechnology of new structures/materials and integrated with big EU research programmes (leadership skills, acquiring funds, project management, work in collaboration); (iv) acquintance with (and import of) teaching methods/practices (excellence in this academic skill being crucial for Applicant�s promotion to a full professor upon return).  Project�s success relies on Applicant�s present potential/experience (mostly in fundamental research, but also in teaching and leadership) and on superb quality of the host (Cambridge in general, Cavendish Laboratory in particular) in all essential aspects (research, participation in European science, and teaching). The main results will be: (i) multi-aspectual individual education of the Applicant (at a rate possible only due to continuous interaction with Europe�s best specialists and exposure to unparalleled academic environment) as well as (ii) enhancement of attractiveness and potential of European science by means of transfer of knowledge and research/academic habits from the leading European university to a major but still rapidly developing research/academic institution in Poland and (iii) efficient incorporation of the latter in priority EU research programmes.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"221701","fundValue":"234536.33","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
