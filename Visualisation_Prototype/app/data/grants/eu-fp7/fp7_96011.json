{"id":"96011","title":"Next-Generation Broadband Optical Access Networks","abstractText":"'For the next-generation broadband optical access networks, some new technologies have been proposed, including wavelength division multiplexing- passive optical networks (WDM-PON), optical code division multiplexing-PON (OCDM-PON), and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-PON (OFDM-PON). In a WDM-PON, each user is assigned a dedicated wavelength and can enjoy the full bandwidth provided through the wavelength. WDM-PON can provide much higher bandwidth, but would also require tunable or dedicated hardware for each user, which significantly increases the system cost. OCDM-PON assigns different users with orthogonal codes. OCDM-PON provides some unique features, such as asynchronous communications and a certain level of network security. However, the optical components required by OCDM-PON are still very expensive. Recently, OFDM-PON was shown to be advantageous for future broadband optical access networks. In an OFDM system, a large number of closely-spaced orthogonal subcarriers are used to carry data signals. The orthogonal nature of the subcarriers makes OFDM highly efficient in spectral utilization. Despite the attractive progress made in proving the principle and showing the basic OFDM-based network architectures, significant research efforts and breakthroughs are required for the future practical implementation of OFDM-based optical communications. In our proposal, we will focus on investigating innovative technologies, which are targeted at breaking the current technology limit and building next-generation OFDM-based broadband optical access networks. Our research will focus on (1) the investigation of all-optical signal processing for the next-generation OFDM-based broadband optical access networks (2) virtualization in broadband optical access networks to support various kinds of native services and (3) improvement of the network energy efficiency and hardware lifetime through programmable dynamic resource allocation and system upgrade.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253421","fundValue":"90551.6","fundStart":"2011-07-05","fundEnd":"2012-07-04","dataset":"fp7"}
