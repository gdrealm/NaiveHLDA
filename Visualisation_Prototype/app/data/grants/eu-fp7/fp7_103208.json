{"id":"103208","title":"Philosophy for the People? Antonio Brucioli as Translator of Aristotle in Sixteenth- Century Italy","abstractText":"'My project on Antonio Brucioli (c. 1498-1566) aims to offer the first monograph on his activity as a philosopher and vernacular translator of philosophical texts. A native Florentine, Brucioli was forced to leave his hometown for political reasons and spent the better part of his life in Venice where he devoted his activity to the promotion of the vernacular as a literary language, not only with his famous and controversial version of the Bible, but also with a dozen Aristotelian treatises, until now completely neglected. My monograph will explain the motivations behind this project, Brucioli�s own philosophical ideas, and the intellectual and editorial contexts in which his work unfolded. Combining printed sources with unpublished manuscripts, my book will not be simply a contribution to Brucioli�s biography, but in general to scholarship on the history of ideas in the sixteenth century.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"298098","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
