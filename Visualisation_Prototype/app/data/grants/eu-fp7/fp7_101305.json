{"id":"101305","title":"Non-Classical Main Group Chemistry; Supramolecular Chemistry and Catalysis","abstractText":"'The classical view of the periodic table suggests, in particular, that there are distinct boundaries between the chemistries of s-block, p-block and d-block elements stemming from the availability and type of valence orbitals present and fundamental properties such as electronegativity. Yet this long-excepted, text-book view can provide a barrier to progress in a number of key chemical areas because it prevents us thinking about the true picture, that there is more commonly a continuum of structural and reactivity properties which overlap large segments of the periodic table. This proposal seeks to move through these barriers by establishing fundamental and practical applications of p-block element chemistry in supramolecular chemistry (the classical domain of carbon chemistry) and catalysis (the classical domain of transition metals).The broad theme of the proposed project is to study non-classical aspects of main group chemistry. This takes the form of two major components which span the non-metallic and metallic areas of the p-block, (i) the development of systematic approaches for the building of macromolecular inorganic systems and their application in host-guest, gas storage and separation, and (ii) the applications of p-block metals in a broad spectrum of stoichiometric and catalytic bond-forming reactions.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"291280","fundValue":"1485429","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
