{"id":"89373","title":"\"Detection Technologies, Terrorism, Ethics and Human Rights\"","abstractText":"'DETECTER  aims at increasing the compliance of counter-terrorism with human rights and ethical standards in the rapidly changing field of detection technologies. The project addresses the increasingly international character of counter-terrorism, the increasing use of informal mechanisms for altering law-enforcement practice to meet the threat of terrorism, and the great variety of detection technologies and their uses. The partners agree on the need for human rights standards to be informed by dialogue with both manufacturers of detection technology and law-enforcement officials directly involved with counter-terrorism who use this technology and influence the development of products. The project combines applied ethical and legal research with this dialogue in order to affect the design and use of products, to make ethical and legal research better informed, and to innovate conceptually in a field that is developing with great speed.'","grantUrl":"http://www.detecter.bham.ac.uk/index.shtml","grantId":"217862","fundValue":"2424419.13","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
