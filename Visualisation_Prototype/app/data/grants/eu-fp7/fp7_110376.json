{"id":"110376","title":"BRIDGING THE GAP FOR ENHANCED BROADCAST","abstractText":"BRIDGET will open new dimensions for multimedia content creation and consumption by enhancing broadcast programmes with bridgets: links from the programme you are watching to external interactive media elements such as web pages, images, audio clips, different types of video (2D, multi-view, with depth information, free viewpoint) and synthetic 3D models.<br/>Bridgets can be:� created automatically or manually by broadcasters, either from their own content (e.g., archives, Internet and other services) or from wider Internet sources;� created by end users, either from their local archives or from Internet content;� transmitted in the broadcast stream or independently;� filtered by a recommendation engine based on user profile, relevance, quality, etc.;� enjoyed on the common main screen or a private second screen, in a user-centric and immersive manner, e.g., within 3D models allowing users to place themselves inside an Augmented Reality (AR) scene at the exact location from which the linked content was captured.<br/>To deliver the above, BRIDGET will develop:� a hybrid broadcast/Internet architecture;� a professional Authoring Tool (AT) to generate bridgets and dynamic AR scenes with spatialised audio;� an easy-to-use AT for end users;� a player to select bridgets, and consume and navigate the resulting dynamic AR scenes.<br/>The AT and player will use a range of sophisticated and innovative technologies extending state-of-the-art media analysis and visual search, and 3D scene reconstruction, which will enable customised and context-adapted hybrid broadcast/Internet services offering enhanced interactive, multi-screen, social and immersive content for new forms of AR experiences. BRIDGET tools will be based on and contribute to international standards, thus ensuring the creation of a true horizontal market and ecosystem for connected TV and contributed media applications.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"610691","fundValue":"5286751","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
