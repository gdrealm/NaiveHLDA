{"id":"100877","title":"\"Sample power electronic module construction for testing, characterisation and manufacturability assessment\"","abstractText":"'Power Module Reliability (PEMREL) addresses the clean sky�s call �Sample PEM (Power Electronic Module) construction for testing, characterisation and manufacturability assessment. This proposal aims to compliment other research into the development of an all SiC 10kW inverter, implemented in a double-side cooled, non-hermetic sandwich packaging technology (no bondwires), able to withstand a nominal ambient temperature range of -60�C to 200�C.\nKey developments will include FMMEA, and the development of physics-of-failure reliability models for both type 1 & 2 modules. These modules will be tested for electrical and thermal chracterisation. Power and passive cycling of the modules will be undertaken to generate reliability data for validating the developed reliability models.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"271788","fundValue":"499571","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
