{"id":"100160","title":"Optimising Passenger Transport Information to Materialize Insights for Sustainable Mobility","abstractText":"'OPTIMISM's main outcomes is the creation and development  of different sets of strategies and methodologies for optimising passenger transport systems based on co-modality ICT solutions. OPTIMISM also takes into  consideration the passenger needs and the carbon-neutral objective. The main scope is to provide a scientifically documented insight of the transport system and peopleï¿½s travel choices via the study of social behaviour, mobility patterns and business models.This will also allow to define  future changes in the passenger's travel system that would lead to  more sustainable  method/mode(s) of travelling.\n\nOPTIMISM will base its operating principles in three main blocks of activities: 1. Identifying the gaps and harmonisation of data in travel behaviour.  This will lead to a unified set of data that will serve as reference material for future exploitation of existing studies and baseline information (or data) 2. Definition of  the demand and supply factors  that shape the transportation system and mobility patterns. This will aim to give an outlook on future development(s) by modelling and scenario simulation and 3. Defining the potential decarbonisation of the passenger transport system and ensuring the sustainability of the system. The decarbonisation potential and co-benefits of best practice(s)/solutions will be based upon an analysis of ICT and co-modality options  with an impact assessment of the research results\n\nThe OPTIMISM partners will combine and utilise multidisciplinary skills, expertise, and on-going work in the fields of climate friendly transport, foresight, modelling, socio-economics, mobility behaviour, ITS and transport policy development. A  network with  Pan-European  and beyond coverage, has  been appointed to lead the dissemination relevant tasks in order to ensure the widespread dissemination of results but also to allow  access to various information sources relating to national surveys.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"284892","fundValue":"1528958.6","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
