He will work with Dr. Cong Cao, the scientist in charge who has recognized skills in macro-level innovation policy analysis and synthesis, to chart China�s innovation trajectory. The combination of the expertise will enable a first-class project that will enhance Nottingham�s research capacity in the study of China�s S&T enterprise and innovation policy, which in turn will help to advance Europe�s understanding of the rise of China as a technological power.\nThe project will be of considerate interest to academics, policy-makers, and the business community in Europe. It will produce academic papers on globalization, innovation, and China�s national capability; position and role of China in the global innovation network; and China�s innovation trajectory for publication in leading international journals, which also will lead to a book. It will generate policy papers and briefs to be circulated in the European scholarly and policy communities. It also will provide recommendations to the Commission on EU�s future S&T cooperation with China, as such activities have been on the rise, and advise the EU�China Business Summit on the innovation-related issues that seem to be taking up an increasingly significant position.\nWhile at Nottingham, Dr. Sun will be exposed to advanced research in social science and management science so as to help advance his career in China upon finishing the fellowship. Collaboration between the two scholars and their institutions also will enter a new stage.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"302303","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"2012-10-10","fundEnd":"2014-10-09","dataset":"fp7"}
