{"id":"96018","title":"Identification of new causative genes for congenital hypothyroidism","abstractText":"'Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common neonatal metabolic disorder and, if untreated, results in severe neuro-developmental impairment and infertility. CH is genetically heterogeneous and causative genes identified so far account only for a minority of cases. Therefore many genes causing CH still remain unknown. This project aims to identify new causative genes for CH by combining autozygosity mapping and positional-candidate gene cloning strategies. For this purpose we have already assembled a large cohort of consanguineous families with CH and to achieve the goals of this project we plan to execute the following studies on the samples collected: i) the exclusion of known causative-loci by linkage analysis; ii) genome-wide linkage scan and autozygosity mapping studies for the determination of novel loci in families not linked to any known-locus; iii) direct sequencing and mutation analysis of novel candidate genes in newly mapped regions. State-of-the-art laboratory technologies such as high resolution SNP arrays and high-throughput sequencing will be exploited for the execution of tasks. Our initial results indicated that our cohort includes several families suitable for mapping novel loci and genes for CH. Identification of new CH genes through this study would enhance the diagnosis and classification of the disease and may provide novel insights into thyroid physiology as well as into molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. This in turn might lead to the development of new diagnostic and management strategies for hypothyroidism. This project meets a relatively new EU aim and focus to increase understanding of rare disease conditions with a potential of leading to new preventive approaches for these diseases. If supported, this fellowship will be a major milestone for the fellowï¿½s transition from clinics to research as well as for establishing himself in an emerging field.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253737","fundValue":"241289.6","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
