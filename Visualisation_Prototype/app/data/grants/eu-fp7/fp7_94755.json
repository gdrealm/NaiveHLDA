{"id":"94755","title":"Probing electrically charged Higgs bosons at the CERN's Large Hadron Collider: a collaboration between theory and experiment","abstractText":"'This collaborative project is in the area of high-energy particle physics phenomenology with the focus on electrically charged Higgs bosons. The proposal is a research programme where the applicant's expertise on various aspects of charged Higgs boson phenomenology in hadronic collisions is well-matched with that available at the host institution. The NExT institute has several leading world experts on the phenomenology of the Standard Model (SM) at present and future high-energy colliders both at the theoretical and experimental level (with groups working on the CMS and ATLAS collaborations at the CERN's LHC facility, where the aforementioned studies will take place). Moreover, NExT's mission is to promote fundamental research where theorists and experimentalists work together in the process of New Physics discovery, and the applicant is the ideal catalyst for this since his theoretical work has influenced experimental collaborations in the past. Hence this project will produce forefront research, mutually advantageous to both parties, based on a new raw model of a researcher with interdisciplinary skills. We are especially interested in the search for electrically charged Higgs bosons. Such particles are a necessity in numerous extensions of the SM which address its empirical and theoretical shortcomings. It is widely believed by contemporary particle physicists that the elusive Higgs bosons (both electrically neutral and charged) are potentially the key to answer the fundamental question of why elementary particles have mass. Their search is therefore the primary goal of the LHC. Overall, our aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the world of particle physics by performing, developing, and optimising both Monte Carlo and real data analyses to confirm or constrain such particles experimentally. This application is ideally timed, as the data-taking phase of the experiments at the LHC is due to start in 2010.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252263","fundValue":"240289.6","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
