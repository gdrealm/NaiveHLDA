{"id":"90592","title":"\"Coordination, rationalisation and integration of antimalarial drug discovery initiatives\"","abstractText":"'Antimalarial drug discovery and development initiatives globally are fragmented and uncoordinated.  We have brought together key organisations including MMV, WHO and AntiMal, an EU-funded FP6 Integrated Project represented by its coordinating institution and a number of academic malaria researchers, to resolve this problem through a logical series of meetings, conferences, workshops and dissemination strategies. The Gates Foundation will be involved as an invited participant.  The action will co-ordinate leading European malaria research initiatives in antimalarial drug discovery and development, co-ordinate the European effort with international initiatives, engage industry and provide guidance on standardisation of core requirements of regulatory drug development.  This will contribute towards generating global priorities and prepare the European antimalarial research agenda for the next decade.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"222948","fundValue":"560747.69","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
