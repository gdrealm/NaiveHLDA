{"id":"103904","title":"New bio-inspired processes and products from renewable feedstocks","abstractText":"'Within the FP7 PEOPLE project (Blue4Glue), Fraunhofer Institute (IFAM) and Procter and\nGamble discovered a (PPO based) enzymatic process used by marine-organisms, which\n�produce� polymers in a much simpler way (less process steps) than industry does in classical\nchemistry. BIO-MIMETIC aims to transfer this new scientific knowledge into a blueprint for a\nnovel (pre-)industrial enzymatic-based bio-polymerization process. It involves research partners\n(IFAM and UNITOV) with experience in enzymatic transformation and bio-based synthetic\npolymers, as well as expert SMEs such as Dyadic (enzymes), CIMV (biomass transformation\ninto bio-chemistry) and CULGI (computational modeling of bio-chemical processes) to develop\nthe process that firstly transforms biomass (lignin) into new bio-based polymers (pseudo\npeptides). These will used to create respectively: 1) Bioconjugated copolymers, that will be\ntested in detergents (by P&G) 2) Bio-cross-linked adhesive gels, to be experimented in antiageing\ncosmetics and in bio-textiles preparation (by an SME cosmetic producer MAVI).\nPotential environmental benefits are over 124 kton/yr less toxic solvents to produce chemicals,\nover 1 Billion kWh of energy savings (room temperature process) and a drastically reduced CO2\nfootprint i.e. replace 8000 Mtons of petrochemical based deposition aides and in the future\nsubstitute a large amount of phenol and phenolic derivatives, which are used to produce chemical\nintermediates for a myriad of applications. BIO-MIMETIC will carry out LCA and LCC (cost)\nassessments over the value chain as input to business plan and will use a new SME LCA tool\n(cCALC) to develop an LCA showcase, which will come available for SMEs. The cCALC tool\nand showcase will be freely downloadable as part of the exploitation plan targeted at the market\nuptake of project results in the emerging European market of bio-based products, projected to\ngrow towards 250 billion Euro by 2020.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"282945","fundValue":"4765037.57","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
