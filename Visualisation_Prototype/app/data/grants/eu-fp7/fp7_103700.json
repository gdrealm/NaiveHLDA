{"id":"103700","title":"Movement and Migration in Irish Prehistory","abstractText":"'The aim of this project is to achieve a better understanding of human population movements and migrations during the Mesolithic and early Neolithic periods in the Atlantic regions of northwest Europe. The investigation will especially focus on the role of such movements in bringing about social, cultural and economic changes in Ireland and Britain, including the arrival and spread of agriculture. This will be achieved through conducting original isotope analysis of human and animal remains from the region and integrating the results of this work with genetic and traditional archaeological evidence for population movements in early prehistory. As a vital part of the project the fellow will develop research excellence in all aspects of isotope analysis and additional competencies that will allow him to lead a research team engaged in a wider programme on population movement and migration in early prehistory. This will give the fellow the opportunity to build on his extensive knowledge of human movement and mobility in early prehistory and to develop expertise in a state-of-the art field of research, i.e. archaeological isotope analysis, which presently cannot be acquired in his home country.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"301460","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
