{"id":"92186","title":"Development of methods for genome-wide association studies","abstractText":"'Genome-wide association studies have been very successful - and yet much of the genetic contribution to complex diseases remains unexplained. In-depth mining of GWA data sets may provide evidence of further novel variants: this could be through looking at epistasis, gene-environment interaction, disease sub-phenotypes, rare variants. These analyses can be applied to a range of data sets available to us including type 2 diabetes, Crohn&apos;s disease and anthropological traits including BMI, height and adiposity.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"237423","fundValue":"181350.76","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
