{"id":"188085","title":"Binary Evolution and Low-Level Accretion","abstractText":"'Although X-ray binaries constitute to the brightest X-ray point sources in our Galaxy, a peculiar subgroup is orders of magnitude fainter in the X-rays than the general population. These sub-luminous X-ray binaries\nmay harbor unusual donors, tracing rare binary evolution paths, and represent a relatively poor explored regime of accretion. This proposal aims at elucidating the nature of this tantalizing population of X-ray binaries to advance our understanding of binary evolution and accretion flows occurring at low rates.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"627148","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
