{"id":"186673","title":"3D Hydrogel Microwell Arrays to Control Cardiac Differentiation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in a High Throughput Manner","abstractText":"'The research objective of the project is to develop synthetic materials to control the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) (which comprise human embryonic stem cells and induced human pluripotent stem cells) suitable for clinical use using a combination of synthetic polymer chemistry, hPSC culture and high throughput materials characterization.\n\nThis project brings together a talented researcher with experience in polymer chemistry and surface chemical analysis and a multidisciplinary research and industrial partnership in internationally leading materials discovery and cell culture technologies. The resulting training program will deliver high quality career development in the area of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering and materials science with wide applicability within the EU and internationally.\n\nThis project will aim to improve �start of the art� technologies by offering an innovative array of materials that not only present a range of moduli but also a diverse range of chemistry. This will enable the identification of instructive hydrogels by controlling a range of physiochemical parameters that has not been previously explored simultaneously.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"629320","fundValue":"282109.2","fundStart":"2014-05-12","fundEnd":"2017-05-11","dataset":"fp7"}
