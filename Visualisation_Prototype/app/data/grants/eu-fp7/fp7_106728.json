{"id":"106728","title":"Policy RECommendations for Open Access to Research Data in Europe","abstractText":"'The RECODE project will leverage existing networks, communities and projects to address challenges within the open access and data dissemination and preservation sector.\n\nThe sector includes several different networks, initiatives, projects and communities that are fragmented by discipline, geography, stakeholder category (publishers, academics, repositories, etc.) as well as other boundaries. Many of these organisations are addressing the barriers to open access to research data, such as stakeholder fragmentation, technical and infrastructural issues, ethical and legal issues, and state and institutional policy fragmentation. However, these organizations are often working in isolation or with limited contact with one another. RECODE will provide a space for European stakeholders in the open access and data dissemination and preservation sector to work together to provide common solutions for these issues. It will provide over-arching recommendations for a policy framework to support open access to European research data.\n\nThe RECODE partners will identify and connect with relevant stakeholders, building upon and strengthening existing stakeholder engagement mechanisms at the European and international levels. It will conduct studies of good practice and exchange good practice principles with relevant stakeholders and institutions during networking activities.\n\nThe RECODE project will formulate recommendations for open access to research data targeted at different stakeholders and policy-makers in support of the Commissionï¿½s policies. It will take account of the disciplinary and international differences in open access stakeholder ecosystems and stakeholder, institutional, funding body and governmental value chains.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"321463","fundValue":"1156736","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
