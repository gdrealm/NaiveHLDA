{"id":"103882","title":"\"Migration and Temporary Agency Work in the EU welfare, tourist and agricultural sectors\"","abstractText":"'Migrants constitute the most significant pool of workers at the disposal of the EU member states that wish to expand flexible forms of labour in order to meet the demands of their increasingly ageing and diverse population. They usually fit best the profile of the poor and vulnerable segments of society that would readily take the low status, low pay jobs, yet their freedom of movement towards (and within) the EU labour markets is restricted by inflexible migration policy regimes leaving the space open to a wide array of social networks to construct pathways of entry.\n\nInterdisciplinary research touching on the issue of the migrants� integration in host societies has indicated so far that the ways migrants enter the host country are somehow related with the work opportunities and conditions they experience. This project aims to systematically investigate the factors determining the forms of temporary agency work in specific economic sectors.\n\nThe key contribution of the proposed study from a conceptual perspective is that it tackles issues having to do with the socioeconomic context of work and its organisation as well as questions related to the socio-political framing of the (migrant) worker�s mobility. From an empirical and policy-related perspective, the significance of this research project consists in addressing the question of temporary agency work in a comparative setting across labour markets with different settings of work and across two EU countries experiencing different and managing differently migration flows.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"301731","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
