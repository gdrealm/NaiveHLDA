{"id":"108360","title":"Social Anchoring in Superdiverse Transnational Social Spaces","abstractText":"'The project studies in an innovative, interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological way the problem of identity, integration and adaptation to transnational spaces. It aims to examine the role of identity for immigrant adaptation and integration and ways in which individuals, especially  migrants, establish footholds in their life spaces. The goal of the proposal is the development of a theoretical and methodological framework that enables identification of the source(s) of socio-psychological stability of individuals, particularly in a context of societal integration. The researched problem will be analysed using the concept of social anchoring proposed by the author, which will be developed through research with Polish immigrants in the UK and Ukrainian immigrants in Poland.\n\nThe research approach will be based on grounded theory. The project will include alternate stages of field research and theory building. The methods used in the project will include: desk research and analysis of secondary data, field research among Polish and Ukrainian immigrants in the UK and Poland and the analysis of �unguided� materials (i.e. forum discussions, web blogs and diaries), which will be analysed using narrative, biographical,  textual and visual approaches as well as the analysis of observation material.\n\nThe originality of the project lies in the idea of using the metaphor of anchor to develop the conceptual framework of anchoring enabling limitations of subjectively defined identity to be overcome whilst including the objective aspects of resources. The intensive inclusion of participants� perspective and the employment of a reflective approach also add to the originally of the project.\n\nThe theory of social anchoring will bring an entirely new approach to migration studies and provide an opportunity to link integration and identity problems and as well as relate individuals to a contemporary superdiverse and mobile society.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"331421","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2013-09-02","fundEnd":"2015-09-01","dataset":"fp7"}
