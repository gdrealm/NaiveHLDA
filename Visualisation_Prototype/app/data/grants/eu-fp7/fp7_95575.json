{"id":"95575","title":"Ivestigating the ability of embryonic stem cell derivatives to improve renal function in a murine model of kidney disease","abstractText":"'The number of people world-wide with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing every year. Current treatment options consist of dialysis and transplantation, both of which have significant side effects in terms of quality and quantity of life. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop alternative therapies. My recent work has shown that if mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) are directed to differentiate to mesodermal cells, they show high potential for integrating into developing nephrons in a mouse kidney rudiment ex vivo. Moreover, the ability of mESC ï¿½derived mesoderm to generate renal cell types was highly comparable to that of metanephric mesenchyme (MM), which are the cells that give rise to the nephron in the developing kidney. Although these results are encouraging, a key test will be to investigate if the mESC-derived mesoderm cells can generate nephric cell types in a rodent model of kidney disease and if these cells are able to improve renal function. Therefore the aim of this project is to explore the potential for renal replacement therapy from exploitation of the unique properties of mESC. This will be tested by injecting the stem cells into the tail vein of mice with induced kidney injury, following which, the ability of the cells to generate renal cell types and improve renal function will be analysed. The propensity of the stem cells to generate inappropriate cell types or tumours in the animal model will also be tested. A further objective will be to develop an MRI-based tracking system so that the stem cells can be monitored non-invasively following transplantation. The project will form the basis of a long term collaboration between the applicant and the host group at the University of Liverpool.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"256453","fundValue":"30000","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
