{"id":"107505","title":"Medical Diagnostics based on Exhaled-air Analysis with Laser Absorption Spectroscopy","abstractText":"'The objective of this project is to develop a sensor based on laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) for the medical diagnosis of one or more human diseases by measuring biomarkers in breath. Biomarkers are volatile compounds present in trace amounts in the exhaled air whose concentrations correlate with the presence or absence of a disease or metabolic condition. A well-known example is acetone in the breath of diabetes patients.\nThe project will be carried out at the University of Oxford in the group of Dr. Grant Ritchie. The disease(s) will be selected in the first phase of the project taking into consideration the relevance of a non-invasive alternative diagnosis, the requirements in terms of sensitivity and selectivity of the LAS sensor, and the biomarkers that would have to be measured. Subsequently, a sensitive LAS experiment aimed at detecting the selected biomarkers will be designed and implemented. Techniques to preconcentrate the targeted biomarkers and to filter out compounds interfering with the measurements will be investigated and implemented. To test and benchmark the sensor, 'artificial' breath with realistic concentrations of biomarkers will be produced and measured. Tests on real breath samples will be carried out if the sensor shows successful performance with the artificial samples.\nThe project is significant in view of its potential applications in the field of fast and non-invasive medical diagnostics.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327441","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
