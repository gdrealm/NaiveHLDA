{"id":"110341","title":"\"Low cost, super efficient and jet fire resistant cryogenic thermal insulation half shell structures using geopolymer technology for LNG pipeline applications\"","abstractText":"'Natural gas may be liquefied at -160oC thereby reducing its volume and providing an economic means for its transportation. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) enables gas markets to be connected with more distant export sources thereby improving market competitiveness and stability. Effective thermal insulation is critical to energy management throughout the LNG value chain, impacting on competitiveness and profitability. Furthermore, durability and fire protection are important to ensuring safety and protection of capital infrastructure.\n\nExisting insulation systems are based on cellular foam or powder insulation structures, pipe-in-pipe vacuum insulated structures, or hybrid systems combining foam / powder and vacuum. Whilst cellular and powder materials are low cost, they are time consuming to install, rapidly degrade under cryogenic temperatures and are fixed in place preventing routine inspection. Whilst offering high performance, vacuum systems are expensive, complex to install and rapidly lose their vacuum with time. None of the existing systems offer adequate fire protection. The CryoWrap project will develop a highly innovative LNG insulation system incorporating emerging geopolymer & aeroclay material science & novel production processes, achieving:\n\n� Enhanced insulation performance and service lifetime (improved energy & maintenance cost efficiency)\n\n� High jet fire resistance performance for protection of infrastructure assets (Prioritising safety and added value)\n\n� Energy efficient production of standardised and unique insulation half shell shapes (reduced environmental impact & cost competitiveness)\n\n� Rapid on-site installation (greater flexibility and reduced installation costs)\n\n� Efficient removal & re-installation (enabling routine inspection & ease of maintenance)\n\nThe global LNG insulation market is worth >�1 billion. The CryoWrap consortium target �35 million business\ngrowth within a 3 year period with the creation of 72 jobs.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"605277","fundValue":"1469297.2","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
