{"id":"108391","title":"New Dearomatization Methods for Chemical Synthesis and Synthetic Biology","abstractText":"'The hypothesis behind our synthesis blueprint involves the development of new dearomatization process that comprises phenol oxidative dearomatization and organocatalytic desymmetrization, generating highly functionalized, non-racemic architectures. A key aspect of this process is the formation of quaternary centres embedded within a complex structural framework containing valuable orthogonal functionality. With this in mind, we have identified classes of molecules that could be accessed through exploitation and developments of this methodology. The natural product targets encompass structures of alkaloids such as morphine, as well as complex non-natural frameworks that may have interesting properties as the basis for novel small-molecule libraries. Also we have identified that dearomatization could be a useful tool in synthetic biology wherein tyrosine residues are targets for selective oxidation and conjugated with a suitable reagent of function. This will lead to an exciting new tool for chemical biology. The overall proposal is split into three objective research plans comprising (i) the development of CED methodology (ii) the synthesis of morphine, and (iii) the development of deraromatization methods for synthetic biology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329596","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
