{"id":"95420","title":"Metal-containing hybrid materials for water remediation from trace heavy metals","abstractText":"Innovative approaches based on alloying of metals to remove mercury from drinking water will be developed. Gold and silver nanoparticles immobilized on the surface of silsesqioxane-hydride films deposited on silica-gel surfaces will be used as a novel adsorbent for trace mercury removal. Use of silsesquioxane-hydride as an additive for producing cryogels allows for creation of novel clean up devices for trace mercury removal from various environmental media. Incorporation of iron oxide nanoparticles in pores of silica-gel increase the specificity of the sorbent to arsenic removal.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255635","fundValue":"171240.8","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
