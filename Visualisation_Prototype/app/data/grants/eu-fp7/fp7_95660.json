{"id":"95660","title":"a Study of the Epigenetic Alterations that Result in Cardiac Hypertrophy","abstractText":"'Heart failure is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and often the consequence of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Upon entering hypertrophy, cells undergo a vast transcriptional remodelling, with thousands of genes being either up- or down-regulated. In the last years it became evident that epigenetic modifications are an important determinant of transcriptional changes, and several lines of evidence demonstrate that epigenome modulating enzymes are implicated in cardiac hypertrophy. In the present project we propose to study transcriptional repression by DNA and histone methylation. We will map these modifications and use this map to identify and study the methyl transferases, transcription factors and pathways that underlie these modifications using a systems-biology approach. The insight that is to be anticipated from this study will not only enhance our understanding of transcription regulation in hypertrophy, it can also provide a novel entry point for strategies to treat this disorder.'","grantUrl":"http://www.ub.edu/searchproject/","grantId":"253644","fundValue":"171740.8","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
