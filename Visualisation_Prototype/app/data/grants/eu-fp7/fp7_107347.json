{"id":"107347","title":"Spectroscopy Combined with Optical Polarization for Endoscopy","abstractText":"'Multispectral imaging system is proposed to fit in a rigid endoscope for aiding reflectance spectroscopy and observing auto fluorescence This will allow simultaneous recording of stereoscopic and spectral images with the aim to develop a near real time, three dimensional 3D imaging tool, which can detect spatial distribution of various molecules and the evaluation of the properties of tissue chromophores such as Oxy and Deoxy Haemoglobin.  Contrast enhancing   methods are proposed to aid diagnosis.  Further development of this instrumentation could be used for intraoperative imaging, for screening   precancerous dysplasia, for detecting and mapping suspicious sites in the peritoneum, the liver and kidney, for  visualizing of the bile duct and  observing the oxygenation status of organs  and   evaluating transplant organ viability.\n\nEpithelia dysplasia is an early form of precancerous lesions with high probability of transition to high grade dysplasia (carcinoma in situ)  and invasive cancer. Early diagnosis of dysplasia may allow faster interventions and improve the outcome for the patients.  Traditionally dysplasia is regognisable by pathologist with biopsy. During this procedures a tiny fraction of the affected tissue is selected for pathological examination, and has a low probability of detection because dysplasia is highly focal and visually indistinguishable.\nThere is a high clinical demand for developing non invasive methods for large area tissue surveillance and discriminating healthy from diseased tissues with particular interest for cancer screening.\nIn response to this a Multispectral  Imaging system is proposed to fit in  a rigid endoscope and provide high field of view imaging with spectroscopic analysis. Reflectance spectroscopy and autofluorescence will allow simultaneous  characterisation of tissue morphology and haemodynamic measurements.\nContrast enhancing methods based on polarization and   laser speckle pattern analysis   are proposed  to in'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"332226","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
