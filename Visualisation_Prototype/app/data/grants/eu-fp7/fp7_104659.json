{"id":"104659","title":"Frontiers in Quantum Technology","abstractText":"'Mission Statement: To deliver an internationally competitive student cohort who will be equipped to be the research and industry leaders of the future through interdisciplinary training at the frontiers of Quantum Technology. The ability to engineer materials at the atomic level has led to the enormously active field of nanotechnology: the analysis, design and fabrication of devices that operate at the leading-edge of optical and electronic technology. This technology has inevitably revealed the true quantum nature of the microscopic world, where particles and waves co-exist and interact in novel exciting ways. The study of quantum information and quantum technology has now been around for some time, and this is the ideal opportunity for the fundamental science to work with industrial researchers to make advancements which the market wants, rather than those which serve only the scientists� curiosities. Along this line, we have identified two strands of research themes, namely, the generation of extreme light sources and the study of light-matter interactions, with a view to the development of quantum technology. Imperial College has a large team of researchers (17 members of academic staff and 50 postdoctoral fellows: research grants over �30m) working at the leading edge of quantum sciences encompassing surface plasmonics, cold atoms, attosecond lasers and quantum theory. Coupled with newly refurbished postgraduate lecture facilities, a brand new state-of-the-art workshop, and new offices for the quantum theory group this makes Imperial ideal for student training. The associated partners include top academic institutes, government labs and private companies which will be actively involved in student recruitment, research and training. Imperial has been known for attracting world�s best students and with the current IDP we will be able to train those students to become leading scientists with the creative ideas to answer the beneficiaries� needs.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"317232","fundValue":"3816691.12","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
