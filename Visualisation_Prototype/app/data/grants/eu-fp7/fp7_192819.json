{"id":"192819","title":"Durham University Researchers' Night 2009","abstractText":"'The participants in this proposal are Durham University (UDUR) and Naked Science Ltd. (TNS). UDUR is a world-class university that is committed to the communication of knowledge and learning, encouraging and supporting engagement in dissemination of knowledge to a broader community. TNS currently produce a weekly science radio programme that is broadcast in the East of England, and made available as a podcast through their website (www.thenakedscientists.com). Our primary aim is to provide an opportunity for people to find out more about researchers within a European context through live discussions (at a public event and through radio phone-ins). In England, listening to the radio is an important part of everyday life with an average listener hearing over 20 hours of radio a week. There are a diverse range of stations, both local and national, which together cater for almost every taste in music, news and entertainment. There are 38 local BBC radio stations which together with the national stations, account for over half of all radio listening in the UK. A total of 7.4 million people (18.3% of the 15 population) listen to BBC local radio each week. In the North of England these figures range from 15.9% to 34.1% of the 15 population. Our vision for Researchers� Night 2009 is to broadcast a Researchers� Night programme on local radio, including a live link to a public event in the North East region of England. The programme will be hosted by TNS and the public event will be hosted by UDUR, with researchers from UDUR who are involved in European research projects providing major contributions to both. Our two primary objectives are to run a public event including a main arena, an exhibition area and an international cafe, targeting those who already have a personal or professional interest in European researchers, and to use local radio as a medium to engage with an audience who would not normally attend events about researchers.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"244913","fundValue":"66866","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
