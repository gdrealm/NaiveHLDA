{"id":"88794","title":"How well can humans perform: Testing human cue integration across multiple systems","abstractText":"'Humans and all other animals are constantly engaged in making decisions based on partial, uncertain, noisy, and in some cases, expensive, cues. A central paradox in the study of decision making is the divergence between our extraordinary facility at perceptually-posed decisions and our very ordinary incompetence at cognitively posed ones. We plan to study the continuum between these ends of a spectrum, along with other, critical, characteristics for decision-making such as the effects of correlations between the cues. Our investigation will be based on, and contribute to, a range of quantitative models based on different computational and informational trade-offs.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"231115","fundValue":"75000","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
