{"id":"104738","title":"Supersymmetry Breaking in String Theory","abstractText":"'This project will study supersymmetry breaking directly within string theory. Most studies of supersymmetry breaking, in both phenomenology and cosmology, are performed using the crutch of four dimensional field theory. This project will raise the state of the art and remove this restriction.\n\nI will develop tools to study supersymmetry breaking directly on the worldsheet and aim to do this for both phenomenological models of low-energy supersymmetry breaking and also for cosmological supersymmetry breaking, applicable  during the inflationary epoch in the early universe.\n\nOnce these tools are developed they will be applied to search for novel effects of string theory in the early universe and also to calculate the phenomenology of string models of low energy supersymmetry breaking.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"307605","fundValue":"1027855","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
