{"id":"99857","title":"Strongly Coupled Systems","abstractText":"'Strongly coupled systems comprise some of the most difficult and important problems in physics, from high temperature superconductivity, to quantum chromodynamics, to gravity at the Planck scale. Understanding even the most basic questions about these systems --- such as the phase structure or the relevant degrees of freedom --- remains a challenge. It is necessary to introduce new, imaginative techniques to tackle these problems.\n\nIn the past decade, several new ideas have emerged from research in string theory. While string theory is often paraded as a �theory of everything�, a less trumpeted facet is the way in which is gives new perspectives to study more down to earth systems, in particular the strongly coupled phases of quantum field theories.\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop these techniques to extract information about strongly coupled quantum field theories, both relativistic and non-relativistic, including theories at conformal points and those with a mass gap. The focus is on the application of gauge/gravity duality to new arenas. However, we will also explore the constraints imposed by supersymmetry on non-relativistic systems.  These results will be important for communities interested in quantum field theory, string theory, and condensed matter physics.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"279943","fundValue":"1271623","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
