{"id":"107428","title":"Multiphosphorescent emitters based on Tris-Heteroleptic Iridium Complexes","abstractText":"'The aim of the proposal is to develop a new family of phosphorescent iridium(III) complexes as dual phosphorescent emitters. The goal is to obtain a complex with a first phosphorescent band below 500 nm and a second around 600 nm in order to have white emission.\nThe strategy revolves around a tris-heteroleptic cyclometalated iridium complex with two different main C^N ligands and one ancillary ligand. The tris-heteroleptic nature of the complex leads to two possible triplet emitting states, T1a and T1b, due to the excited state possibly localized on one or the other C^N ligand.\nIn addition of providing novel insights and tools for understanding and controlling the properties of phosphorescent organometallic materials, the long term goal is to achieve white emission from a single emitting center for electroluminescence applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"326107","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
