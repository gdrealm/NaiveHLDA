{"id":"103287","title":"Self Reporting Asymmetric Nucleophilic Catalysis","abstractText":"'The energy efficient synthesis of complex molecules from readily accessible starting materials remains a key challenge of the natural sciences, catalysis can address this important challenge. This project draws together the disparate disciplines of catalysis and sensing to deliver new understanding and new functionality towards the synthesis of the next generation of molecules for health. By exploiting the best technology in the sensing arena in combination with synthetic expertise will offer a new paradigm in the approach to tackling synthetic challenges that the team draw together here is ideally equipped to tackle and deliver significant scientific and societal benefits.\nNew catalysts which can sense their own efficacy will be at the heart of the proposed research. Through rapid screening facilitated by the unique sensing regime translated from chemical sensors into catalysis will permit new and exciting synthesis be realised. As such drug molecules that were previously inaccessible for commercial exploitation due to efficiency and selectivity concerns will be realised.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"298424","fundValue":"278807.4","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
