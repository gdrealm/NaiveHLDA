{"id":"90200","title":"Biocompatability of carbon nanoparticles with tissues of the neuromuscular system","abstractText":"'The partners wish to build a long-term European, industry-academia consortium, to work on the problem of repairing tissue damage in the neuromuscular system (NS). We initially seek to determine the biocompatibility of carbon nanoparticles with tissues of the NS as an essential prelude to our medium to long-term goal of developing marketable novel carbon nanotube-based implants for tissue repair of the NS. Presently, there is no satisfactory method for repairing extensive damage of the different tissues of the NS namely, nerves, muscles, ligaments and tendons. In the case of nerve lesions, the major problem associated with most of the recently developed implants is their limited capacity for organising regenerating axons appropriately for functional tissue re-innervation. We believe that CNTs due to their unique combination of physico-chemical properties could play a major role in overcoming these problems and therefore enhance tissue integration and nerve repair. In the case of damaged skeletal muscles and tendons, we envisage that CNTs could play a key role in strengthening and repair of these types of NS tissues.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"230766","fundValue":"633648","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
