{"id":"97303","title":"ARCOMEM: ARchive COmmunities MEMoriesnnFrom Collect-All Archives to Community Memories �   nLeveraging the Wisdom of the Crowds for Intelligent Preservation","abstractText":"ARCOMEM is about memory institutions like archives, museums, and libraries in the age of thenSocial Web. Memory institutions are more important now than ever: as we face greaterneconomic and environmental challenges we need our understanding of the past to help usnnavigate to a sustainable future. This is a core function of democracies, but this function facesnstiff new challenges in face of the Social Web, and of the radical changes in informationncreation, communication and citizen involvement that currently characterise our informationnsociety (e.g., there are now more social network hits than Google searches). Social media arenbecoming more and more pervasive in all areas of life. In the UK, for example, it is now notnunknown for a government minister to answer a parliamentary question using Twitter, and thisnmaterial is both ephemeral and highly contextualised, making it increasingly difficult for anpolitical archivist to decide what to preserve.nThis new world challenges the relevance and power of our memory institutions. To answer thesenchallenges, ARCOMEM's aim is to:n� help transform archives into collective memories that are more tightly integrated withntheir community of usersn� exploit Social Web and the wisdom of crowds to make Web archiving a more selectivenand meaning-based processnTo do this we will provide innovative tools for archivists to help exploit the new media andnmake our organisational memories richer and more relevant. We will do this in three ways:n� first we will show how social media can help archivists select material for inclusion,nproviding content appraisal via the social webn� second we will show how social media mining can enrich archives, moving towardsnstructured preservation around semantic categoriesn� third we will look at social, community and user-based archive creation methodsnAs results of this activity the outcomes of the ARCOMEM project will include:n� innovative models and tools for Social Web driven content appraisal and selection, andnintelligent content acquisitionn� novel methods for Social Web analysis, Web crawling and mining, event and topicndetection and consolidation, and multimedia content miningn� reusable components for archive enrichment and contextualizationn� two complementary example applications, the first for media-related Web archives andnthe second for political archivesn� a standards-oriented ARCOMEM demonstration systemnThe impact of these outcomes will be to a) reduce the risk of losing irreplaceable ephemeral webninformation, b) facilitate cost-efficient and effective archive creation, and c) support the creationnof more valuable archives. In this way we hope to strengthen our democracies' understanding ofnthe past, in order to better direct our present towards viable and sustainable modes of living, andnthus to make a contribution to the future of Europe and beyond.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"270239","fundValue":"8009198","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
