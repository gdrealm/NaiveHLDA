{"id":"102776","title":"FLUORESCENT ROTORS FOR IMAGING VISCOSITY IN CELLS","abstractText":"'This project proposes to design and synthesise a series of novel fluorescent molecular rotors able to measure microviscosity of cellular domains based on the fluorescence lifetime. The fluorescence detection is an efficient and direct way to localise the molecules within cells whereas the measurement of the fluorescence lifetime provides a number of additional assets since the fluorescence decay is typically sensitive to the environment of the fluorophore. In molecular rotors the lifetime can be correlated with viscosity of their immediate environment. Besides, fluorescence lifetime is concentration independent and allows to account for the aggregation phenomenon, and other detrimental quenching processes, the data which is unavailable from the simple intensity measurements. As such, lifetime based detection of molecular rotor fluorescence will provide a quick and accurate measure of the microviscosity in individual cell domains, unavailable from other methods.\nThe new molecular rotors, with incorporated substituents to achieve extensive electronic conjugation, will have advantageous spectroscopic properties, such as high two-photon absorption cross sections and red-shifted absorption and emission wavelengths in the tissue therapeutic window, important both for diagnostic and therapy. These new superior dyes will be used for viscosity imaging in cells, with the emphasis on measuring the viscosity of hydrophobic membranes and on the monitoring of the viscosity changes during Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), a light activated cancer treatment of clinical importance.\nThis project has the ideal overlap of experience and expertise between the applicant and the host group. The results will be both of fundamental importance and practical significance, e.g. for the development of future imaging strategies in biological research. This fellowship will enable the applicant to learn new biology-related skills and as such will prove instrumental for her future academic career.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"302441","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-09-03","fundEnd":"2014-09-02","dataset":"fp7"}
