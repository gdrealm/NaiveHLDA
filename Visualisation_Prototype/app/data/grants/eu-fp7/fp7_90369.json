{"id":"90369","title":"Systematic analysis of factors controlling meiotic recombination in higher plants","abstractText":"'Meiotic recombination has underpinned plant breeding for the generation of new traits of agronomic, environmental and economic importance, although we still have little understanding of the controlling mechanisms involved in this process. We will combine approaches in genomics and systems biology to obtain a detailed understanding of the factors that control recombination and will provide a basis for the development of strategies to modify recombination in a variety of crop species.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"222883","fundValue":"6223215.8","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
