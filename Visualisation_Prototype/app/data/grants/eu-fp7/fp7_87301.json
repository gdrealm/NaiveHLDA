{"id":"87301","title":"Resolving the molecular mechanisms responsible for the localization of mRNA through active transport","abstractText":"'I intend to further characterize the molecular mechanisms responsible for the localization of mRNA (RNA) through active transport by motors on microtubule tracks. My specific aims are:   1) Elucidating the dynamics of active RNA transport. I will investigate how unique RNAs arrive at discrete cellular destinations using the same molecular motor and the hypothesis that RNAs travel on distinct populations of microtubules. To study bicoid and gurken RNA transport particles I will use OMX for very rapid and highly sensitive image acquisition in three dimensions of several channels simultaneously.  2) Distinguishing the mechanisms of RNA maintenance and anchoring. I will test the hypothesis that the ultrastructure and composition of RNA transport and anchoring complexes changes through the course of development using cryo-immuo EM. I will compare the transport particles of different RNAs (i.e. bicoid, gurken, nanos) and co-visualize these with key transacting factors such as Stuafen, Exuperentia and Squid.  3) Determining the mechanism of multiple localization events for a single RNA. I will address the hypothesis that the confirmation and composition of transport and anchoring complexes stage at different steps and times during development. Using live cell imaging of photoactivatable components, I will characterize changes in residency time of RNAs and their transacting factors within transport and anchoring structures'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"220668","fundValue":"169957.94","fundStart":"2008-06-09","fundEnd":"2010-06-08","dataset":"fp7"}
