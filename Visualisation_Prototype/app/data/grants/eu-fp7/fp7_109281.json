The design and implementation of the smart grid will be very complex, involving a large number of systems, layers and relationships. In order to make the infrastructure of smart grid systems work effectively, engineers need to be trained to have a detailed understanding of both power engineering and communications issues. Many related research projects to date involve either mainly power engineers or mainly communications/signal processing researchers, limiting the interaction and knowledge exchange between these two communities. However, smart grid engineers should be able to appreciate the power network that the smart grid is designed for and how to communicate and process data concerning the power grid, so that it can be controlled effectively. This ITN project is a major interdisciplinary project between both power and communications engineers to train the next generation of engineers and scientists that will lead the development of this technology both within Europe and Internationally.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"607774","fundValue":"3596493.78","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
