{"id":"88488","title":"\"Systems biology of phagosome formation and maturation, modulation by intracellular pathogens\"","abstractText":"'To address the question of how intracellular pathogens modulate phagosome trafficking in the host cell we propose to use a systems biology approach, using an iterative cycle of experimental data, model, new experimental data, improved model. The ultimate aim of our project is to develop a mathematical model of mycobacteria and Salmonella infection of macrophages that can be applied to find new interventions that promote clearance of intracellular bacteria by phagocytic cells, and so boost innate immunity. To answer this question we have assembled a consortium of European experts able to tackle complementary aspects of this problem. By bringing together these laboratories to focus on a common goal we will be able to lever their expertise far beyond the state of the art.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"223451","fundValue":"3941752","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
