{"id":"104932","title":"Integrated hydrogen power packs for portable and other autonomous applications","abstractText":"'The proposed HYPER System is a scaleable and flexible portable power platform technology representing significant advances in terms of fuel cell development, hydrogen storage and associated supply. R&D will generate both new scientific knowledge and new technologies for exploitation. Specifically the project will:\n� Focus on developing a system based on application specific operational and performance targets, informed by early and ongoing end user intelligence;\n� Embed cost improvement and design for manufacture within the development pathway to optimise material and assembly costs and meet key cost targets;\n� Demonstrate complete application specific prototypes in the field with end users;\n� Deliver a market ready system that is flexible in design, and cost effective, for rapid roll out across multiple applications.\nThe HYPER System can be readily customised to meet a range of application specific requirements including: power output, energy (or runtime), fuelling options, and cost (capex and opex). The system is based on a modular LT PEM fuel cell system with a common interface to use with alternative hydrogen supply modules. Two generic types of (interchangeable) hydrogen storage module will be developed: a bespoke gaseous hydrogen storage module; and a solid-state hydrogen storage module based on nanostructured hydrogen storage materials.\nTwo proof of concept HYPER Systems will be developed and demonstrated; 100 We portable power pack/field battery charger, and a 500 We (continuous) range extender for a UAV. This will validate the scalability and robustness of the system whilst addressing early market opportunities that are aligned with the direct commercial interests of the Consortium Partners.\nThe Consortium will provide a European supply chain, and early routes to market, for the subsequent commercial exploitation of the HYPER System.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"303447","fundValue":"3923909.8","fundStart":"2012-09-03","fundEnd":"2015-09-02","dataset":"fp7"}
