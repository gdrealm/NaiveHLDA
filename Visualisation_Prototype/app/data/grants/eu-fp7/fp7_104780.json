In particular, the project aims at fulfilling the specific targeted outcome f): Integration of the FEV in the cooperative transport infrastructure. It proposes will develop an integrated IT platform that enables the connection and information exchanges between multiple infrastructure systems that are relevant to the FEV such as road IT infrastructure, EV backend infrastructure and EV charging infrastructure. Over this platform, multiple advanced electric mobility services are able to be provided to FEV users to improve the energy management efficiency and usability of the FEV.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"314411","fundValue":"4265317","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
