{"id":"186524","title":"Novel Flexible Sheet Forming for High Value Manufacturing","abstractText":"'Developing environmental friendly & sustainable manufacturing technologies has become a driving force to maximise resource efficiency, to reduce energy consumption & environmental pollution. In addition, with ever increasing global competition, it is crucially important for European manufacturers & SMEs to develop core competence of future advanced manufacturing technologies.\n\nThis IIF project proposes the development of a new flexible sheet forming process to support sustainable technologies of rapid manufacturing high value-added, small batch & customised sheet metal parts, with reduced costs & lead time. The project will support an experienced researcher, Dr Bin Lu, of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) China to visit the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Sheffield (USFD) UK for 24 months. Bringing his unique knowledge & expertise in the flexible sheet metal forming technologies and skills in numerical modelling & optimisation techniques, Dr Lu will be focusing on the development of a new concept of Laser Assisted Double Side Incremental Forming using WaterJet (DSIF-LWJ), design of a bespoke prototype machine & manufacture of  three sheet metal parts for industrial demonstration. The project will benefit from transfer of knowledge to the host USFD in fundamental research of combined effects of laser & waterjet on material plastic deformation as well as advanced flexible sheet forming, hybrid process control & system integration technologies.\n\nBy demonstrating scientific advances & economic potentials of the flexible sheet forming of DSIF-LWJ, the project will not only enable the share of the candidate�s knowledge & expertise, develop long-term collaborations, but also make a contribution to help European manufacturers & SMEs enhance their technical capabilities & overall competitiveness in high value added & user driven production therefore strengthen the EU�s competitive position to meet future challenges of sustainable manufacturing.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"628055","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
