{"id":"98037","title":"Ceramic Optical Temperature Sensor for Turbine Engine Measurements","abstractText":"'COTSTEM will develop an optical sensor system for measurement of total temperature in gas turbines at temperatures up to 1700C. The main deliverable from the project will be a prototype sensor system integrated into a test engine. The completed system will provide significant benefits for engine design and operation leading to reduced weight and lower specific fuel consumption. The sensor will be based on well established optical principles using novel materials to survive the harsh environment. The project builds on Oxsensis existing expertise in harsh environment optical sensors established through the development of an existing pressure sensor for use in gas turbine combustion monitoring and control. COTSTEM is a single partner project with the majority of the work to be carried out in-house by Oxsensis. Oxsensis will apply existing project management practices which have been successfully used on similarly sized completed projects in the aerospace, power generation and automotive sectors.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255848","fundValue":"761299","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
