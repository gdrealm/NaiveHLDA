{"id":"108184","title":"The 1429 Catalan Translation of Giovanni Boccaccio�s �Decameron:� Tracing the Making of a European Classic","abstractText":"'Composed in the wake of the Black Death (1348), the Decameron is a foundational text in the construction of European cultural identity. It profoundly influenced the form and content of narrative fiction in diverse western European traditions, in a process in which translation played a major part. This proposal seeks to analyse the 1429 Catalan translation of Boccaccio�s Decameron through a set of interrelated studies, including a partial digital edition. The Catalan text will be considered both in its own right and in its relations with readings and rewritings of the Decameron across different countries (France and Italy) and social milieus (the courtly nobility and rising urban bourgeoisie).\nThe Catalan Decameron poses distinctive problems to scholars, since it is the result of a dynamic, and particularly complex, process of textual and linguistic sedimentation. To do justice to this process, DecameronTranslated draws on a multidisciplinary approach that brings codicology, palaeography and textual criticism together with digital resource development, and that is informed by key insights from reception theory and translation studies. Study of the complete Catalan text, its process of composition and its relationship with the Italian and French tradition of the Decameron, will generate a digital edition of Day 10 and a short monograph on the complete work.\nBy building on my existing competencies, and by giving me high-level skills in applying digital tools to studying and editing pre-modern texts, the DecameronTranslated project would enable me to deliver expertise that is increasingly in demand throughout Europe, including in my home institution. This will equip me to take on research leadership roles, and to have an impact on scholarship across an unusually wide range of medieval romance literary studies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"328345","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
