{"id":"108452","title":"ATLAS Higgs to taus","abstractText":"'In July 2012 the discovery was announced of a new boson\nobserved at the Large Hadron Collider. The proponents of this project are uniquely placed, by their previous research, to measure key aspects of this new particle's couplings to other particles through a suite of measurements. This will be achieved by leading searches for the Higgs boson decaying to tau leptons, produced in several production mechanisms all of which feature particles produced in association with the Higgs boson (Vector Boson Fusion, association with W/Z or ttbar.This necessitates the proponents of ths proposal to work together to develop new strategies to record these events and to understand the connected theoretical issues. Further, I will develop a new career direction by joining Warwick and playing an important and timely role in the design of a new component of the ATLAS trigger system: L1Track which is currently in an R&D phase.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"331883","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
