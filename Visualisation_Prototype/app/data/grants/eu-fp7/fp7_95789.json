{"id":"95789","title":"Crystal Engineering of Self-Assembled Diblock Copolymers with a Crystalline Core-Forming Block","abstractText":"'A series of complex, hierarchical micelle architectures such as block co-micelles have recently been prepared from crystalline-b-amorphous diblock copolymers using living, crystallization-driven polymerizations in solution. In this proposal the fundamental issues behind this novel process will be investigated. We propose to perform and interpret detailed experiments designed to allow us to understand the issues arising from the formation and behaviour of micelle architectures such as cylinders formed by diblock copolymers with a crystalline, core-forming polyferrocenylsilane block. The proposed studies of cylindrical micelles with a crystalline metallopolymer core will allow us to accumulate new fundamental knowledge in the field of polymer crystallization that can be used for predicting the behaviour of other crystalline blocks. For example, we will explore the extension to polylactide block copolymer materials. A variety of future applications in polymer and materials science and nanoscience are anticipated. This interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research proposal requires a wide range of skills and combines the expertise of the applicant (polymer crystallization and morphology) with that of the host laboratory (polymer chemistry, materials chemistry, and nanoscience). The proposed research will bring a promising young researcher to the UK for 2 years before his return to Taiwan.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254810","fundValue":"240289.6","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
