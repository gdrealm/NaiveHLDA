{"id":"95101","title":"Coordination Action for Self-Awareness nin Autonomic Systems","abstractText":"The main aim of the AWARE Coordination Action is to provide a focal point for the wide range of research domains potentially addressed by the FET Proactive Initiative in AWARENESS. Self-awareness in autonomic systems can include ideas and concepts from artificial intelligence, network performance, distributed systems, machine learning, and artificial consciousness. This CA seeks to provide a common forum for cross-disciplinary interactions, by facilitating the exchange of ideas and personnel, by coordinating the development of the research projects and programme, and timely dissemination of research within the community and to a broader scientific and technological audience. The long-term purpose of these activities is to build a new, self-sustaining scientific community and the project will engage in a number of specific initiatives to bring this about. These will include workshops, summer schools, researcher placements, a periodical newsletter, a magazine, book, a video documentary, research consultations and other road-mapping, agenda-setting activities. A successful outcome of the project will include cross-fertilisation between different research domains, a gathering of scientists with a common purpose and training for an active group of well-informed, well-connected young researchers.   The resulting generation of new knowledge and opportunities will reinforce Europe&apos;s position at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field of research.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"257154","fundValue":"809070","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
