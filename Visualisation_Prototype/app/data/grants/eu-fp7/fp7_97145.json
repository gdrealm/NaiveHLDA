{"id":"97145","title":"MANUFACTURING AND APPLICATIONS OF NANOSTRUCTURED MATERIALS","abstractText":"'Nanotechnologies and nanostructured materials is expected to be the most promising area of technological development and among the most likely to deliver substantial economic and societal benefits to the EU in the 21st century. It is a time of rapid advance in the development of these technologies, which can organize materials at the nanoscale and tailor their properties. This offers exciting possibilities in virtually all sectors of EU activity and could create entirely new industries. However, the exploitation of nanomaterials by European industry has been disappointing and one of the critical reasons for this is a general shortage of scientists/engineers with the knowledge to undertake relevant research and transfer the research findings into industrial production. The aim of the proposal is to encourage the very best researchers to get jobs in EU industry, where they can create these breakthrough opportunities. This will be achieved by giving them intellectually stimulating and industrially relevant research projects that will be undertaken in collaboration with universities and industry, and include industrial secondments together with comprehensive technical and complementary skills training. A network of 5 universities and research institutes, and 10 companies from 8 EU countries will be set up to carry out the integrated research and training programme. The research will include new nanomaterials for organic electronics, lithium ion batteries, solar cells on roof tiles and on flexible polymers, ultra-light aerogels for transportation and an innovative technique for 3D characterization at the nanoscale.  The network will train a new generation of ESRs in the disciplines needed to understand nanotechnology and the complementary skills to enhance their career progression. All recruits employed in the programme will be ESRs and the partners will provide experienced researchers from their own staff without charge to the European Commission'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"264710","fundValue":"2313945.8","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
