{"id":"98886","title":"Molecular and cellular heterogeneity of tumour stem cells in human glioblastoma","abstractText":"'Despite the emergence of new targeted therapies, there is still no curative treatment for many human cancers. Through the need for the best combination and solution, a new theory has suggested that cancer is as a stem cell-driven disease and a growing body of evidence has supported this hypothesis.\nIn this context, the applicant proposes to investigate the biological function and complexity of the so called 'tumour stem cells' in the most devastating human brain cancer, i.e. glioblastoma. Cells isolated from different areas of the same tumour will be characterised at genotypic and phenotypic level. This study will increase our knowledge about brain tumour biology and will shed new lights on the function of tumour stem cells in human glioblastoma.\nThe project will be carried out at the Department of Clinical Neurosciences of the University of Cambridge in an international and stimulating institute that is ranked first of all the UKï¿½s top medical schools in both teaching and research and is one of the top Universities in the world. The applicant has a strong background in gene therapy, neural stem cell and brain tumours and will receive scientific and non-scientific training ranging from acquisition of novel scientific methodology for the development of the project to new skills for career development and will be encouraged to establish local and international collaborations. Complimentary activities will be provided by the University staff, the Human Resource Division and the Career Service.\nConsidering past achievements and potential of the applicant, it is reasonable to envisage a successful post-doc career at the University of Cambridge. In this view, the Marie Curie Intra-European fellowship will substantially foster the applicant to emerge in the international community of scientists working on cancer and in the future to apply as junior group leader in the country of origin.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"273381","fundValue":"200549.6","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
