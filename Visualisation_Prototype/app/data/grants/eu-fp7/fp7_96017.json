{"id":"96017","title":"Matrix Models Recursions in Topological Strings and Beyond","abstractText":"'Recently it has appeared that recursions relations formulated in the context of matrix models can be applied to solve a wide array of problems ranging from topological string theory to algebraic geometry to statistical physics. It has also been shown that matrix models recursions are sometimes equivalent to other known recursions developed to solve several algebro--geometric problems. Matching recursions belonging to different areas has very deep conceptual implications pointing to the existence of some hidden universal property of solvable problems which would explain the broad applicability of matrix model technologies. In this research project several problems will be addressed with these new tools, from mostly mathematical to more physical ones. On the more formal side matrix models technologies will be employed in topological strings and algebraic geometry, fields where the profitability of these methods is by now well established. On the physics side more explorative researches will be carried out mostly in the context of the AdS/CFT duality and in the computation of gluon scattering amplitudes. This interdisciplinary project is expected to be a means for knowledge transfer between the mathematics and string theory communities. The training proposed in this project aims at enhancing all aspects of the applicant&apos;s capability to perform leading independent research.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253716","fundValue":"165040.8","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
