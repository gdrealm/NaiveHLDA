{"id":"108650","title":"Teaching Enquiry with Mysteries Incorporated","abstractText":"'The aim of this teacher training project is to help transform science and mathematics teaching practice across Europe by giving teachers new skills to engage with their students, exciting new resources and the extended support needed to effectively introduce enquiry based learning into their classrooms. We will do this by working with teacher training institutions and teacher networks across Europe where we will implement innovative training programmes called �enquiry labs�. These will be based around the core scientific concepts and emotionally engaging activity of solving mysteries, i.e. exploring the unknown.  The enquiry labs will use scientists and communication professionals (e.g. actors, communication experts, etc.) to mentor teachers through the transition to use enquiry to teach science. A spoke and hub model for coordination and delivery allows the project to both respond to local country needs while maintaining an overall EU wide sharing of best practices and reporting.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"321403","fundValue":"3558127.6","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
