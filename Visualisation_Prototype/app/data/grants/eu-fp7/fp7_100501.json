{"id":"100501","title":"South-East European TSO Challenges","abstractText":"The proposed project addresses the needs of South-East European TSOs in their effort towards harmonization and integration of the region with the rest of the European power network. Diagnostics, modeling and monitoring generate huge amounts of data that create the need for efficient storage and analysis of the collected information for better decision making and execution; under this respect the use of a common computational platform is highly recommendable and will be a focus of the proposed project. The project objectives are: � Assist in harmonizing regulatory and commercial frameworks in South East Europe to facilitate cross-border trading of both power and grid services, ensuring that they will accommodate a wide range of operating situations; � Development of systems and tools that will enable TSOs and other players in the energy field to utilize innovative service arrangements to improve their efficiency and enhance their services to customers; � Develop and implement methods and techniques for capacity calculation and allocation. � Establish corrective procedures to ensure security of power transmission and grid connections. � Ensuring the successful interfacing of new and old methods and tools for the representation and modeling of power networks. The consortium has a strong representation (50%) of TSOs that take part from the initial to the final stages of the project to ensure appropriate input of information, proper use of methods and techniques and practicality of outcomes. Academic institutions with expertise and research in the field are heavily involved through their electrical engineering departments. Furthermore international cooperation is ensured with the participation of two TSOs and two academic institutions from EU neighboring countries. The results/products of the project that are in electronic form (software, data) will be publicly available (open source) to researchers and businesses for further development and implementation.\n","grantUrl":"","grantId":"239453","fundValue":"3452800","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
