{"id":"108369","title":"Advanced Bladder cancer LAser Diagnostics and thErapy","abstractText":"'This project aims develop an integrated laser diagnostic and therapeutic technique for the use in detecting and treating bladder cancer.  The aim will be to transfer knowledge and expertise between the University of Dundee Medical School and the Photonics and Nanoscience Group and two industrial partners who have specific expertise in laser based medical diagnostics and system development to share in the research project.  Key aims include the generation of in-vitro and in-vivo validation data for a newly discovered laser absorption, in response to cancerous cells, peak in the infra-red region . Uncovering the mechanism behind this strong biomarker and implementing the knowledge to develop a new diagnostic tool focussed on bladder cancer will also have long-term collaboration potential for early diagnosis of other types of cancer.  ABLADE will aim is demonstrate the efficiacy of a novel photo-therapy based on the stimulation of triplet oxygen at a cellular level which can initiate cell apotosis specifically in tumour cells.  The project high levels of transfer of knowledge and expertise, including access to leading research factilites, through a series of secondments of ESRs and ERs, complemented by the recruitment of ERs to provide further inter-disciplinarly expertise and resource while benefitting from the strong industrial and academic links initiated through the project.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"324370","fundValue":"2365400","fundStart":"2013-04-10","fundEnd":"2017-04-09","dataset":"fp7"}
