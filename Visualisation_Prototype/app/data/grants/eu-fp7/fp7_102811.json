{"id":"102811","title":"Oxidative Fluorination with [18F]Fluoride - New Radiochemistry for PET Imaging","abstractText":"'The objective of this proposal is to provide a solution to a well-recognised problem in 18F-radiochemistry: the direct fluorination of electron rich aromatics with a nucleophilic source of 18F-Fluoride. The value of this new radiochemistry will be challenged with the synthesis of 6-[18F]Fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ([18F]FDOPA) and 6-[18F]Fluoro-L-meta-tyrosine ([18F]FMT), two high value tracers to image the presynaptic sites of the dopaminergic system; yet these two radiotracers are notoriously difficult to produce using currently available radiochemistry. Conceptually, we advance that the nucleophilic fluorination of electron rich aromatics with fluoride may be possible using a so-called �substrate umpolung� approach. Under oxidative condition, we will revert the reactivity profile of the substrate from a nucleophilic to an electrophilic entity (umpolung), thereby allowing for nucleophilic 18F-labelling. This approach, which will rely heavily on microfluidic technology, has never been exploited for 18F-radiolabelling.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"301342","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
