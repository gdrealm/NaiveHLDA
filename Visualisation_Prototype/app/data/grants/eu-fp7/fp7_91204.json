{"id":"91204","title":"Culture and Human Rights in Colombia: Negotiating Indigenous Law","abstractText":"'The research proposed over 24 months seeks to extend the �culture and rights� debate in Social Anthropology through an ethnographic examination of how indigenous identity and self-image in Colombia is becoming politicised. The candidate intends to use the Fellowship significantly to advance her career by moving to a leading independent position in the field of socio-legal studies. The candidate�s foremost training activity under a dual mentorship comprises a programme of training-through-research on a personalized socio-legal project on Colombia. Through six months of ethnographic fieldwork at an indigenous law school, this research project reframes concepts of culture and rights by investigating indigenous leaders� projection of indigenous culture as a basis for legal entitlements, the project�s suggestion is that in practice the terms �culture� and �rights� need not be inevitably opposed. The fellowship would provide the applicant with the opportunity to manage and implement an innovative interdisciplinary research project, developing skills and competencies through the facilities offered by the Department and the University of Cambridge.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"237549","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
