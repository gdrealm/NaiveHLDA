{"id":"110056","title":"GRaphene Enhancement of the Photocatalytic Activity of Semiconductors","abstractText":"'Graphene has emerged as one of the most exciting materials in recent years. This interest has now spread to the field of photocatalysis, with the intention of utilizing graphene as a two-dimensional photocatalyst material, and with the potential to harness grapheneï¿½s redox properties for opening up new opportunities in next generation photocatalyst systems. The proposed project is aimed at developing new robust-light hybrid materials based on semiconductor nanoparticles-graphene, targeting the improvement of their photocatalytic activity in different supports. This project opens a new opportunity to solve a wide number of environmentally problems as wastewater and air pollutants treatments, or sustainable solar fuel as the photocatalytic splitting of water to obtain hydrogen.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329945","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
