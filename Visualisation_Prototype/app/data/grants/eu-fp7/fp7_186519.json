{"id":"186519","title":"Emotional Welfare: From Brotherly Love to Fraternity","abstractText":"'The experienced researcher, Dr. David Lederer, seeks secondment to the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for the History of the Emotions (outgoing host) for one year. There he will join the Centre at the University of Adelaide, collaborating with the other four hubs in Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth.  His research on emotional welfare examines sixteenth-century utopian social reform based on brotherly love; its practical implementation by humane/lifesaving societies according to the enlightened doctrine of sympathy; institutionalization by modern nation states as the principle of fraternit� (French Revolution); and effects of global transmission by missionaries (case study Australia).  Emphasis is on historical development of public health and safety policies and mental health care. He then returns to Queen Mary's University, London (return host) for one year to affect knowledge transfer at the Wellcome Trust Centre of Excellence for the History of the Emotions under Prof. Colin Jones (scientist in charge), with collaborations in Germany and Holland.  This transfer includes the experienced researcher�s knowledge of the Australian model for large-scale interdisciplinary project funding in the humanities with multifaceted attention to public impact (public history, museum exhibition and the performing arts).  Upon completion, the experienced researcher will have organized one international conference, presenting at others, prepared two articles and co-edited a special issue for publication in peer-reviewed journals, drafted one synthetic monograph, designed a new undergraduate syllabus and a master class, and organized a touring public exhibition.  Thereafter, the experienced research will organize an Irish research cluster as PI and prepare a major funding proposal for international collaboration. As career progression, these achievements represent significant milestones toward a posting as full professor at a European research institution.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"628012","fundValue":"280965.4","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
