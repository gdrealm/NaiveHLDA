{"id":"192567","title":"Social cognition in gaze-based interaction","abstractText":"'Social cognition studies have, paradoxically, largely ignored social interaction, because of a prevailing cognitivist tradition that assumes we can learn about the minds in �isolation�, and because of methodological difficulties in operationalising real-life interaction in a controlled experimental setup. This proposal aims to study the dynamic properties of social interaction via gaze by means of a dual interactive eye-tracking paradigm in which each person�s gaze, recorded via eye-tracking, is presented to the other by means of a virtual agent.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"631224","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2015-05-18","fundEnd":"2019-05-17","dataset":"fp7"}
