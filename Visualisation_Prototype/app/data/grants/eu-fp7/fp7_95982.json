{"id":"95982","title":"Temporal regulation of starch degradation in CAM plants","abstractText":"'Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a photosynthetic adaptation to arid environments where water-use efficiency and biomass productivity is optimized by taking up CO2 at night when evapo-transpiration rates are low. These desirable traits hinge on effective temporal coordination of the metabolic processes that determine the supply and demand for carbon over the day/night cycle. Data from the host lab has indicated that; a) starch availability is a key determinant of the amount of CO2 taken up at night by CAM species and b) the internal circadian clock may play a key role in apportioning carbohydrates reserves for growth during the day whilst retaining sufficient starch for sustaining CO2 uptake at night. Recent in-depth sequencing of the transcriptome of Kalanchoï¿½ fedtschenkoi, a CAM species amenable to genetic manipulation, provides a timely and novel opportunity to test the functional significance of enzymes implicated in starch degradation and their regulation via the clock for optimizing the photosynthetic performance and growth of CAM plants. The MC candidate will use existing clock transformants of K. fedtschenkoi and will also genetically modify the expression of certain genes that have been implicated in starch degradation in CAM plants. The aims of the project are; 1) to determine if the unique nocturnal demands for carbohydrate in CAM are accomplished by using a different pathway for starch degradation compared to that found in C3 plants and 2) to establish the role of the clock in maintaining carbon balance in CAM in terms of the metering of starch reserves between growth and as substrates for nocturnal CO2 uptake under varying environmental conditions. This multidisciplinary program addresses several priorities within FP7 pertaining to abiotic stress tolerance in plants and is of high importance for contributing knowledge to assist in developing more drought resistant crops and for informing the potential use of CAM species as feedstocks for bioenergy'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252491","fundValue":"180103.2","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
