{"id":"96588","title":"Solar cells at the nanoscale: imaging active photoelectrodes in the transmission electron microscope","abstractText":"'The exploitation of renewable sources of energy is one of the biggest challenges of our time, with wide ranging implications in both Science and Society. The new generation of dye-sensitized solar cells and hybrid polymer-inorganic solar cells represents one of the most exciting developments in this field. These promising devices based on photoactive nanomaterials can be produced at low cost, but they have an overall power conversion efficiency of 10-12%, attributed to short charge carrier recombination times and diffusion lengths. If we hope to improve this performance we must learn how the solar cells behave at the nanoscale, under realistic working conditions.\nTo achieve this I propose to study photovoltaic materials in the transmission electron microscope, under photon irradiation. The three main areas to pursue are: a) In situ illumination technique development, b) Study of physical properties of solar cells, c) Theoretical interpretation of the spectroscopy results. The work plan of this ERC project will follow different strands in parallel, so that we can explore this novel field more efficiently.\nOur in situ illumination technique will be exported to a new monochromated and aberration corrected transmission electron microscope with very high spatial and energy resolution. The ultimate challenge is to provide maps of the electronic properties and photovoltaic behaviour of a solar cell, in particular to evaluate ï¿½on the atomic level- the effect of grain boundaries and surfaces on the performance of the device.\nWe will study both dye-sensitized and bulk heterojunction solar cells, starting from the individual nanostructured components, with the aim of producing working cross-section devices to be mounted and operated inside the electron microscope. Efficient data processing and theoretical interpretation of the microscopy results will be essential to the success of this process, so we will build capabilities in these areas to support and guide the experimental work.\nThe team I want to lead in this scientific mission is ideally composed of a postdoctoral research assistant and two PhD students. The postdoc will take care of technique development and theoretical aspects, while the students will concentrate on the study of materials and devices.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"259619","fundValue":"1381541","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
