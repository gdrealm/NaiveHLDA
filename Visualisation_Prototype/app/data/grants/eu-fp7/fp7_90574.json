{"id":"90574","title":"Self assembly of active colloids","abstractText":"'I plan to explore, by means of different molecular and mesoscale computer simulation techniques, the possibility of using active colloids as building blocks for self-assembled material. Active colloids are a novel class of soft matter maintained out of equilibrium, even in steady state, by internal energy sources. Examples are colloids producing small molecules at their surface (&quot;chuckers&quot;) that move due to an osmotic pressure imbalance caused by e. g. non-equilibrium density fluctuations of the small molecules, or colloids that self-propel in the surrounding medium. I will first study the physics of non-equilibrium chuckers, which has received little attention in the literature so far. In order to do that, I will consider a suspension of active and passive colloids to probe whether they phase separate or self-assemble into complex aggregates. I will then study the physics of motile colloids, focusing on Janus particles (synthetic colloids with different chemical properties at different locations), and I will make them motile to both direct and speed-up their self-assembly. At a later stage I will also simulate a suspension of these motile particles and non-adsorbing polymers to study the way self-assembly happens in an active colloids-polymers mixture. My project will have implications both in fundamental physics, shedding light onto non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and in technology, allowing the design of new materials.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"237454","fundValue":"172434.64","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
