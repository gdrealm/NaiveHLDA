{"id":"107688","title":"Children�s personal epistemologies: capitalizing children and families knowledge in schools towards effective learning and teaching (ChiPE)","abstractText":"'The conceptions of knowledge and knowing that students hold have increasingly become a focus of interest for educational researchers in the last decades. Research on personal epistemology has highlighted the educational relevance of students� beliefs about knowledge and knowing  and its important role in students� academic motivation, cognition, and performance. Relevant theoretical frameworks have advanced the knowledge on epistemological beliefs, despite those frameworks have been grounded in research conducted with adults such as university students, and with adolescents. Less research has been found that clarifies the relationship between learning contexts and types of instruction and children�s personal epistemologies, in order to foster effective teaching and learning in more inclusive classrooms, and ultimately increase educational success.  This research proposal aims to contributing to fill such gap by examining the personal epistemology of elementary school children, teachers and families participating in dialogic-based classrooms. This approach often contributes to enhance classroom�s �epistemic climate� composed of learners� and teachers� personal epistemologies and epistemic knowledge, but at the same time brings closer knowledge from children�s out-of-school experience to classroom knowledge. This research project will explore children and families� epistemological beliefs in the school context to capitalise on their funds of knowledge and promote effective learning. In the framework of the EU Strategy 2020, it is crucial to make available for more schools and communities those actions that help citizens succeed educationally, and then gain access to the labour market and full participation in society.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"332200","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
