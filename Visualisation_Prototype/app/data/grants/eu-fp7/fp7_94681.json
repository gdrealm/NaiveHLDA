{"id":"94681","title":"New Methodology for the Synthesis of Bioactive Pyrrolidines and Pyrrolidinones","abstractText":"'The development of new and efficient methodology for the synthesis of privileged structures of biological importance is an ever important goal for organic chemists. Natural products continue to provide a source of such important chemical entities for the treatment of human diseases. In particular the pyrrolidine and pyrrolidinone motif are biologically privileged structures which are present in over 9000 natural products, many of which possess important biological activity. The aim of this proposal is to develop a range of new transition metal mediated and transition metal catalysed synthetic methodologies for the efficient synthesis of pyrrolidines and pyrrolidinones which will be applied to the total synthesis of a biologically important natural product which contains a lactone-pyrrolidinone as its core heterocyclic motif. The developed synthetic methodology will also be applicable to the synthesis of a wide range of biologically active natural product targets.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254038","fundValue":"130430.6","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
