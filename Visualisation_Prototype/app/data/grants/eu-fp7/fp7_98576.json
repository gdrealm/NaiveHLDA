{"id":"98576","title":"On/Off-Switchable Smart Nanobioreactors","abstractText":"'Nanobioreactor, a fascinating technology, is a latest combination of nanobiotechnology with advanced functional materials, are becoming promising tools for sensitive and selective novel biosensors. The aim of this research is to develop, synthesize and apply a new generation of stimuli-responsive switch-like nanobioreactors which own the self-switching textural ability to allow the specific recognition of target bioanalytes. The implementation of the project could generate important contributions to the development of stimuli-responsive advanced nano-materials for the various applications, such biocatalysts and nanobiosensors. To achieve the goals, a fundamental route to development of stimuli-responsive advanced materials is showed below: first, cationic polystyrene (PS) particles formed via emulsifier-free polymerization will be used as templates to prepare core-shell hybrid PS/SiO2 via the ammonia-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation of (3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane, Tetraethylorthosilicate and methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane. In the second step, cationic PS templates will be removed in toluene solution to form hollow silica particles. Subsequently, Au3 will be assembled into inner pore of hollow silica through Au-S interaction and then reduced into nanoclusters by sodium borohydride. Finally, N-isopropylacylamide and 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid will be alternately grafted onto the surface of hollow silica particles, in the presence of N,Nï¿½-methylenebisacrylamide, to form an interpenetrating polymer network. The resulting nanoreactors would be expected to demonstrate on/off switchable behavior upon the contact with external stimuli such as temperature.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"275336","fundValue":"210092.8","fundStart":"2011-10-16","fundEnd":"2013-10-15","dataset":"fp7"}
