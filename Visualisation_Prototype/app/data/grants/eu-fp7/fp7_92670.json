{"id":"92670","title":"Advanced Technologies for Water Resource Management","abstractText":"'Technology gaps exist within the EU that prohibit compliance with the Water Framework Directive in providing an integrated water resource management strategy that will secure both water quality and quantity. The fundamental objective of the ATWARM ITN is to enhance the career prospects of 16 young researchers by providing them with greatly enhanced multidisciplinary skills and business aptitudes that will enable them to address these technology gaps. The two scientific objectives of the ATWARM proposal are: (i) To develop advanced technologies for enhancing the performance and/or sustainability of water and wastewater treatment plants, and (ii) To develop advanced technologies for enhancing water quality, including advanced technologies for analysis and monitoring. 14 ESR and 2 ER will participate in an integrated research programme. Each will be located within specific host organisations and will be seconded to other sites to improve their multidisciplinary skills and their knowledge of ATWARM as a whole. They will receive specific in-lab training plus general S&amp;T training at 3 Summer Schools and other relevant training events. Complementary training (involving external participants) structured to accommodate the personal career needs of each Fellow will also be provided. The ATWARM network will involve seven host organisations located in UK, Ireland and Germany. These organisations (four academic, one research and two industrial partners) have distinct but complementary research foci and, due to their involvement in an existing network, are already collaborating effectively. Participation in ATWARM will foster relationships between the partners and ensure the long term sustainability of the network. ATWARM will be coordinated by Queenï¿½s University Belfast (which is experienced in the management and administration of large FP research projects) and will be managed by a Supervisory Board to ensure that all Fellows receive the same high standard of training.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"238273","fundValue":"3497503.74","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
