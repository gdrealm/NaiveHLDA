{"id":"105907","title":"Tolerance in Contemporary Muslim Practice: Political Theory Beyond the West","abstractText":"'Academic research has consistently studied conflict but there is very little engagement with actually existing tolerance mechanisms of tolerance and this project breaks new ground in studying tolerance by explicitly engaging with both empirical detail and theoretical constructions in the predominantly Muslim context of Pakistan. The project comprises of two strands of enquiry that come together to suggest a new way of approaching political theory from non-western contexts. By investigating the political thought of two key religious public intellectuals on the issue of tolerance at the same time as collecting oral histories and ethnographic interviews from population groups that live in extremely precarious contexts, such as recent refugees from Pakistan's tribal areas into three large cities, the project aims to help build a new field of study within European academia: comparative political theory.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"313652","fundValue":"378116","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
