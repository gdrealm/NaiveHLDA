{"id":"92028","title":"A EUROPEAN BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAINING NETWORK FOR THE SUPPORT OF CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING","abstractText":"'The objective of BIOTRAINS is to deliver a trans-European network of industrially oriented white biotechnologists fully trained in the application of biocatalysis to sustainable chemical manufacturing. Their skills will be developed through a joint research programme at leading national CoEï¿½s (Centre of Excellence) with research projects identified by internationally leading Principal Investigators in this field. There is an urgent need for these scientists to support the KBBE (Knowledge Based BioEconomy) identified by the SUSCHEM (The European Technology Platform for Sustainable Chemistry) technology platform and they will provide the key to the European future that has defined the work programme for FP7 in this field. We present a doctoral training program where the scientific research is integrated with industrial training, supervised by key academic and industrial scientists from all the disciplines needed to deliver industrial relevant science. The UK Centre of Excellence in Biocatalysis (CoEBio3) will manage the project to ensure that the collaboration is integrated seamlessly across both academic and industrial centres, and across geographical boundaries. Most importantly, CoEBio3 will manage efficient technology transfer between the academic scientists and industry. This will ensure a state-of-the-art programme meeting current industry needs in both people and technology. A structured exchange programme with both industrial placements and CoE exchanges will ensure that national leading-edge skills together with specialist equipment training are transferred across Europe, and will define best practice for both academia and industry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"238531","fundValue":"4369872","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
