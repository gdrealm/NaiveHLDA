{"id":"89930","title":"Risk-Based Expert System for Through�Life Ship Structural Inspection and Maintenance and New-Build Ship Structural Design","abstractText":"'The primary objective of the RISPECT project is to use ship structural inspection results (coating condition, corrosion, cracks and deformation) along with the calculated expected results to guide future inspections required to achieve a minimum structural reliability.\n\nThis �probabilistic inspection planning� is not new but this project takes the method a stage further to use data from large numbers of ships in a �central statistical database� to contribute to the decision making process for any one ship. This has the effect of combining the traditional Classification Society broad view with the usual probabilistic method that is based on data from one ship only.\n\nSecondary objectives of the project are to:\n1)\timprove communications between ship owners, managers, inspectors and class,\n2)\tuse the results as input to new design.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"218499","fundValue":"4328826.96","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
