{"id":"93523","title":"Collaborative research on flood resilience in urban areas","abstractText":"'Collaborative research on flood resilience in urban areas (CORFU) is an interdisciplinary international project that will look at advanced and novel strategies and provide adequate measures for improved flood management in cities. The differences in urban flooding problems in Asia and in Europe range from levels of economic development, infrastructure age, social systems and decision making processes, to prevailing drainage methods, seasonality of rainfall patterns and climate change trends. Our vision is that this project will use these differences to create synergies that will bring new quality to flood management strategies globally. Through a 4-year collaborative research programme, the latest technological advances will be cross-fertilised with traditional and emerging approaches to living with floods. The overall aim of CORFU is to enable European and Asian institutions to learn from each other through joint investigation, development, implementation and dissemination of strategies that will enable more scientifically sound management of the consequences of urban flooding in the future. Flood impacts in urban areas � potential deaths, damage to infrastructure and health problems and consequent effects on individuals and on communities � and possible responses will be assessed by envisaging different scenarios of relevant drivers: urban development, socio-economic trends and climate changes. The cost-effectiveness of resilience measures and integrative and adaptable flood management plans for these scenarios will be quantified. CORFU is structured in six Work Packages. WP1 will look at drivers that impact on urban flooding. WP2 will enhance methodologies and tools for flood hazard assessment based on urban flood modelling. WP3 will improve, extend and integrate modern methods for flood impact assessment. WP4 will aim to assess and enhance existing flood risk management strategies. WP5 will disseminate the outputs. WP6 will co-ordinate the project.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"244047","fundValue":"5144169.67","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
