{"id":"106587","title":"Sustainable Silks Programme","abstractText":"'Silks are fully sustainable, non-perishable and climate-smart agricultural products.  They are uniquely suited for areas of low-wage/high-unemployment and fragile ecosystems sensitive about water and soil.  At the same time, silks and silk-derived materials are used for simple as well as highly sophisticated applications and products with low to high potential for adding value with rather moderate investment.\nThe Oxford Silk Group�s research on the ERC funded �Silk as Biomimetic Ideals for Polymers� led to a number of novel and important insights that combine proprietary know-how with patented concepts.  A key invention allows a wide range of novel silks to be accessed - thus freeing the global industry from the heavy reliance on mulberry silks and adding novel wild silks to the market.  This, together with other original insights and innovations, and combined with Silk �Life Cycle Analysis� allows now the planning and execution of novel silk projects in an economically robust as well as environmentally sustainable way.\nOur unique selling points are: (1) our Oxford research group is one of very few market leaders globally in the field of R&D on silks and has (2) unique insights in wild silk IP, in addition to (3) a pipeline of novel, sustainable silk products combined with (4) proprietary LCA models developed from silk farms around the world and derived from a rapidly developing and extensive network of collaborators.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"324607","fundValue":"126768","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
