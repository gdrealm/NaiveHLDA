{"id":"186014","title":"DNA origami templates for nanocrystalline diamond nanostructures","abstractText":"'The superlative properties of diamond make it a choice material for making nanoscale devices over a broad range of applications. Diamond devices are conventionally made using 'top-down' processing following the seeding and growth of nanocrystalline diamond thin films, however, due to the great resilience of diamond, fabricating nanoscale devices is technologically demanding and nanoscale patterning requires expensive and lengthy processing such as electron beam lithography (EBL).\n\nHerein, the applicant presents a proposal to develop a novel, inexpensive, rapid and scalable methodology to fabricate nanoscale devices using 'bottom-up' processing with a feature resolution that will surpass current state-of-the-art processing techniques such as EBL. To achieve this goal, the technique of DNA Nanotechnology will be used to create self-assembled 2D DNA patterns of any desired shape, which will subsequently be electrostatically and covalently coated with nanodiamond and diamondoid particles. Following diamond seeding on DNA templates, the applicant proposes to grow nanocrystalline diamond thin film devices with nanoscale features. Given the diameter of DNA is ca. 2 nm, structures with nearly 2 nm feature resolution should be achievable, especially when seeding the structures with molecular diamondoid particles. Following development of said technique, nanoscale diamond devices (specifically nanophotonic structures, transistors and biosensors) will be fabricated that promise unprecedented performance.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"624164","fundValue":"196456.2","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
