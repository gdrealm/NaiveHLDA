{"id":"87292","title":"Fuel Cell Membranes Based on Functional Fluoropolymers","abstractText":"'Several research groups are focusing their efforts on the replacement of the most widely used perfluorinated Nafionï¿½ as Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). The objective of this proposal is to prepare new fluoropolymers for fuel cell membranes.  The physico-chemical and electrochemical properties of these new polymers will be rigorously assessed.  The methodology relies on the use of novel fluorinated monomers [such as ?-fluoromethylstyrene] and their radical copolymerisation with various alkenes [chlorotrifluoroethylene, para-(2,2-dimethylisocyanate)styrene or vinylene carbonate].   This proposal builds on an existing collaboration between Gouverneur and Ameduri who have expertise on synthetic fluorine chemistry and polymer chemistry, respectively.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"220323","fundValue":"169957.94","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
