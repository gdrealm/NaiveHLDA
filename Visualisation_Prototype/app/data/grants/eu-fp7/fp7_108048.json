{"id":"108048","title":"Identification and Characterisation of the Sex Locus in the Dioecious Moss\nCeratodon purpureus","abstractText":"In genetically controlled sexual systems, gender is determined by defined chromosomal regions or by complete sex chromosomes. Both types have emerged independently and repeatedly during evolution. The structure, function and evolution of a number of sex determining regions (SDRs) have been studied in diploid organisms, but little is known about sex determination in haploid systems.  The dioecious bryophyte Ceratodon purpureus presents an interesting subject for the study of evolution of sex not only because it is haploid but also because of its phylogenetic position as a basal plant.   Deep transcriptomic analysis using next-generation sequencing will be performed in order to identify sex specific regions of the genome.  Sex-related genes will be identified by deep transcriptomic sequencing of a segregating population.  Genes controlling sex-determination should be localised within non-recombining regions of the sex chromosomes. X- and Y-linked genes identified as candidate sex-determining loci will be functionally tested using the high-frequency gene targeting technology possible in both C. purpureus and its hermaphrodite relative Physcomitrella patens. Because deep transcriptome analysis generates gene sequences on a genome-wide scale, it will be possible to compare rates of evolution between X- and Y-linked genes, and between autosomally located genes.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329416","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
