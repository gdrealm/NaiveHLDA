{"id":"111560","title":"Exploring the potential for photocatalytic air purification","abstractText":"'At the heart of this proposal is the discovery of a novel compound, based on nanostructured titanium dioxide, which exhibits excellent catalytical properties upon illumination with UV or visible light. The catalyst causes oxidative reactions that can degrade organic contaminants and other pollutants. A patent has been filed to protect the IPR of this invention, but the route to market requires rigorous testing and strong experimental evidence in support of the the most innovative applications.\n\nThis PoC project will explore the potential of this novel photocatalyst for air purification applications, and will aim at quantifying the properties of the photocatalyst for a broad range of conditions, generating the know-how necessary to enter the pre-commercialization phase.\n\nThe project will specifically target the air purification market, which is a high value market in Europe and industrialized counties, and is expected to grow in the near future due to increasing awareness and regulations about air quality both outdoors and indoors.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"620298","fundValue":"123096","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
