{"id":"92401","title":"ERA-AGE Extension","abstractText":"'The main aim of this proposal is to enable the continuation of the highly successful ERA-AGE ERA-NET in order to secure, for the long term, the European Research Area in the ageing field. The existing consortium has not only met but also exceeded all of its goals and is now committed to the joint funding of Europeï¿½s first research programme on ageing. This application is intended to deliver the joint programme (a parallel ERA-NET Plus proposal concerns its joint funding) together with a second round of the pioneering FLARE (Future Leaders of Ageing Research in Europe) post-doctoral programme and the light touch infrastructure necessary to ensure that European potential in this critical field is realised. The partnership will also be extended to include three new members. This proposal has the enthusiastic support of all ERA-AGE partners.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235356","fundValue":"1906760.4","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
