{"id":"94762","title":"Paramagnetic Metal Complex Transistors","abstractText":"'Electronic materials composed of small electroactive molecules are making a growing impact in commercial and academic work on devices such as transistors, light-emitting displays and solar cells. Almost all research attention however is based on diamagnetic, closed-shell molecules typified by examples such as pentacene, fullerenes and perylene derivatives. The use of paramagnetic molecules in such applications offers unique additional possibilities, for example abrupt on-off switching in field-effect transistors due to melting of magnetic order induced by the applied gate potential giving an avalanche of charge carriers. We will prepare and study paramagnetic, electronically-delocalised transition metal complexes of planar geometry. We will characterise fully their molecular properties through electrochemical, spectroscopic, spectroelectrochemical, EPR, magnetic, structural and computational methods. The complexes will then be used to fabricate thin-films for field-effect transistors and we will study the role of the unpaired electrons in the behaviour of those devices. This has the potential to open up new paradigms in small molecule research for electronic materials and devices.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252273","fundValue":"173240.8","fundStart":"2010-06-14","fundEnd":"2012-06-13","dataset":"fp7"}
