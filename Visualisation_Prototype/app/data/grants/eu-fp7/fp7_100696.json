{"id":"100696","title":"Transglutaminase in disease: a novel therapeutic target?","abstractText":"'TRANSPATH is a multisectorial Network designed to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and technology between 7 leading European research teams and 3 SME partners and 2 associate SME Partners involved in basic and applied research into transglutaminase (TG) related human diseases.  Its ambitions are to accelerate the development of new strategies for the treatment and diagnosis of human diseases related to transglutaminases, including metastatic cancer, neurodegeneration and celiac disease.  The subject is highly relevant as deregulation of tissue transglutaminase activity is observed in a number of human diseases while the exact mechanisms are still largely unknown.  The project targets this unmet clinical need.  The main objectives are :1) to establish the molecular nature of the role of transglutaminases in the pathogenesis of diseases which are known to involve these multifunctional enzymes with a view to developing novel specific inhibitors and new therapeutic approaches which will have a major impact on their treatment ;2) provide an extensive cross sectorial scientific and supporting training network that will increase the capabilities of highly skilled researchers for the European biotechnology industry and academia.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"289964","fundValue":"3740034.01","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
