{"id":"110670","title":"High quality curved aerospace composites using pultrusion manufacturing","abstractText":"'The main goal of PUL-AERO is the development of a material state based controlled pultrusion process for the manufacturing of curved and partially cured stringers that comply with the stringent specifications of the aerospace industry and offer significant savings in production costs.\nPUL-AERO will design and build a pultrusion line for the production of linear and curved composite stringers for the aerospace industry.\nThe main disadvantages of the pultrusion process is the difficulty in producing curved parts and the difficulty in handling aerospace grade epoxy resins, mainly due to the relevant stringent requirements regarding exposure to elevated temperatures and their slow cure (which results in slow pultrusion line speed)..\nPUL-AERO aims to resolve the technical problems of pultrusion when it comes to production of curved aerospace composites parts and take advantage of the benefits of the process. The main benefits of the pultrusion process are the possibility for continuous production, the repeatability of the process and the low production costs (calculated as cost per meter of composite produced).\nPUL-AERO will create production processes and technologies with a focus on improved cost efficiency while taking into account the environmental related aspects. The pultrusion line will be split in two stages, adding flexibility to the manufacturing of stringers with different curvatures and improving the cost effectiveness of the production. The whole process will be driven and monitored by a process monitoring and QA system that will provide real time information and control of the line.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"605613","fundValue":"1769420","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
