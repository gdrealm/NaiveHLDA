{"id":"94520","title":"ISO Shipping Container Tracking and Monitoring System","abstractText":"'90% of all cargo moves in containers and approximately 250 million are shipped annually. There were 1138035 SMEs in EU 25 as of 2003 in the transport and communications industry. The SME segment of the road transport industry in EU 25 employs 3.2 Million people, whilst 107200 personnel are employed in the SME maritime transport industry. Our member transport operators face theft of goods, illegal immigration, transport of dangerous goods and drug and contraband smuggling. In addition to these crimes, authorities must be vigilant to possible terrorist use or targeting of transport vehicles and infrastructure. Among these multiple threats, the misuse of the ISO maritime shipping container transport system is the most important one requiring a co-ordinated pan European response. The ubiquity of containers is the system�s principal strength; however there is little or no control over possible mis-use of the system by terrorists because less than 2% of containers are X-rayed or checked at ports. Current tracking devices require external antennas and are prone to damage or vandalism. Our concept is to replace the container door with a composite one which is transparent to RF. Tracking and sensing electronics to detect door opening, chemical explosives, radioactive devices and stowaways would be encapsulated in the door, thus greatly improving security and reducing losses. Target price of the system is � 740. We have estimated that over a ten year period insurance savings alone would amount to approximately � 38 billion across Europe.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"218414","fundValue":"2720232.4","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
