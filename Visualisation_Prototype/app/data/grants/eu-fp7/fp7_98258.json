{"id":"98258","title":"ULTRALONG FIBRE LASERS","abstractText":"'The project aims to develop a new research concept of ultra-long fibre lasers. The novelty of the concept is in the ground-breaking idea to use laser in the communication applications as a transmission medium rather than as a source of radiation.  Ultra-long Raman fibre lasers (first demonstrated in 2005 by the Aston Photonics Research Group led by the applicant) present an area of interdisciplinary research at the interface of high-speed communications, laser physics, optical signal processing, nonlinear science, and mathematical theories of wave turbulence and disordered systems. The project will explore a broad range of research directions emerging from our original proposal of using ultra-long Raman fibre laser technique for quasi-lossless optical transmission with a focus on the four major  areas: (i) communications - the development of advanced cross-domain (both in space and frequency) flat-gain, zero power excursion transmission schemes; development of long reach non-repeatered fibre transmission links based on  the concept of quasi-lossless fibre spans; (ii) secure communications   fundamentally new non-quantum approaches to key distributions using ultra-long laser; (iii) laser science   up-scaling of pulse energy to record levels in mode-locked lasers by substantial increase of fibre laser cavity; new types of lasers, including ultra-long random lasers and �modeless� ultra-long lasers; (iv) underlying physics and applications of ultra-long fibre laser   optical wave turbulence in fibre lasers; new distributed sensing techniques using ultra-long Raman fibre laser. The proposed program will be unique internationally and will combine the symbiotic development of new scientific ideas and techniques based on the concept of ultra-long fibre laser with the practical engineering design considerations of immediate and future technology applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"267763","fundValue":"1659771","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
