{"id":"90870","title":"Constitutional Law in the Age of Circulation of Factors of Production","abstractText":"'The aim of the research proposal �Constitutional Law in the Age of Circulation of Factors of Production� (CONCIRCLAW) is to test how and to what extent EU law of free movement a) is transforming some of the key concepts of member states� constitutionalism such as citizenship, equality, political participation and judicial review of legislation b) is developing a form of constitutional law at supranational level which, both substantively and procedurally, maintains important elements of divergence from the states� traditional template. By this research, it is expected to contribute to the ongoing debate on European integration and constitutionalism by bridging the gap existing in the constitutional scholarship on the relationships between comparative constitutionalism and the law of free movement. The training profile of the research is oriented at strengthening the skills of the applicant in both the fields of comparative constitutional and free movement law. To this purpose. a programme of training through research is devised according to an empirical approach based on selected case-studies in which the intersections between the two disciplinary fields at issue become evident.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219872","fundValue":"161225.98","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
