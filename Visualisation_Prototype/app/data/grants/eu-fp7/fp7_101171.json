{"id":"101171","title":"Enhanced Research Activities in Stratigraphy","abstractText":"'Robust stratigraphic correlations are essential in deciphering Earth History, yet there are crucial gaps and limitations in the current status of Cenozoic planktonic foraminiferal biochronology. Previous records are hampered by low resolution analysis, incomplete cores and/or lack of magnetostratigraphic age control. As such there is a critical need for high resolution biochronology to improve the accuracy of existing age calibrations. The applicant is in an ideal position to address these issues and contribute substantially to the development of the Cenozoic integrated time scale. Though �Enhanced Research Activities in Stratigraphy (ERAS)� I propose to significantly advance Cenozoic biochronology by producing detailed calibrations of planktonic foraminiferal bioevents. The proposed project is original and innovative, with finer scale stratigraphic analysis than any previous research in this field. The investigation utilizes new deep sea cores in the Pacific Ocean with expanded and complete sedimentary successions and well defined magneto- and cyclo-stratigraphies, which allow direct and accurate calibration of planktonic foraminiferal bioevents to the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale and Astronomical Time Scale. The proposed research is the cutting edge in Cenozoic biochronology and will set new standards by pushing forward the temporal resolution of biostratigraphic studies. The expected results will contribute to EU excellence by significantly advancing the understanding of the chronology of biotic evolution during the Cenozoic and will actively contribute to the EARTHTIME-EU Research Network Programme. It is envisaged that the Marie Curie Career Integration Grant will facilitate the reintegration of the researcher into the European research area by enabling interdisciplinary collaborations between the applicant and renowned researchers in other EU Member States.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"293741","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
