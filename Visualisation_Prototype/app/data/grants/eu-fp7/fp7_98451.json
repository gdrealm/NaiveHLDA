{"id":"98451","title":"Health Monitoring of Offshore Wind Farms","abstractText":"'Offshore wind farm health monitoring and maintenance are major challenges for renewable energy generation due to large scale, high cost and extreme environments. The development of faults in the tower or blades can cause serious secondary damage to the whole wind turbine system if prompt repair action is not taken and can lead to catastrophic failure. Although numerous techniques are being developed worldwide to monitor changes in specific parts of structure, the wide variety of materials and techniques involved means that skills and expertise are disparate and disconnected. For this new interdisciplinary area, this project will bring well recognised scientific institutions and researchers with complementary research experience and skills together, in the context of a collaborative scheme of research exchanges and networking. The proposed project is endorsed by 5 institutions, 2 EU partners and research groups in China and India, agreeing for a common exchange program built around the work packages to develop methods, models, systems and ICT tools for health monitoring and maintenance of offshore wind turbines. The members of the project consortium will provide complementary knowledge and strengths, as they have all carried out leading research in the area of non-destructive evaluation, structural health monitoring, communications and networks, information management, etc. The complementary capabilities have been drawn out in accordance with a joint research vision, commonly shared by the partners at the moment of writing the proposal. The project will consist of targeted research project undertaken by key individual researchers, supplemented and supported by PhD students, researchers and professors. The exchanges will enable the reciprocal transfer of knowledge between the members of the consortium and will be deployed by a set of various activities (visits, training in laboratories, lectures, workshops, seminars) open also to external stakeholders.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269202","fundValue":"241500","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
