{"id":"95198","title":"High performance and ultralight carbon nanotube wires for power transmission","abstractText":"'Due to their unique molecular structure carbon nanotubes can offer high electrical conductivity and superior current density. Both of these properties are sought after, especially for overhead power transmission lines where the extremely high axial strength of nanotubes would also be a bonus. In this research proposal single wall carbon nanotubes (nanometer size tubes made of rolled up graphene sheets) with desirable dimensions and controlled way of the graphene sheet rolled up into a tube (referred to as chirality), will be synthesized and spun into fibres using two unique methods, which were developed in Cambridge. These high performance carbon nanotube fibres will be explored as flexible, lightweight, highly efficient materials for use as wires for a variety of power transmission applications.\nThe project will focus on achieving precise chirality control of carbon nanotubes through crystallographic manipulation of the catalyst particles using a recently-discovered in-house method. Tuning the molecular structure of individual nanotubes will achieve maximum uniformity and desired level of electrical conductivity. Next, carbon nanotube fibres will be spun using a unique process currently available only in Cambridge. The quality of fibres will be assessed, after which the fibres will be assembled into strands and cables. In the final stage, different polymeric coatings will be investigated as insulation for the wires and diverse geometries explored. There will be several fundamental benefits from the outcome of this research proposal. Demonstration of the chirality control of nanotubes, which is the �holy grail� in the field, would be important in itself, while application of the material as useful wires and cables will make it much more immediately useful'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"259061","fundValue":"1470114","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
