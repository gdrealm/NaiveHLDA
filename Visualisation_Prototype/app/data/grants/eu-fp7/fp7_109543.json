{"id":"109543","title":"Numerical characterization and simulation of the complex physics underpinning the Safe handling of Liquefied Natural Gas","abstractText":"'The international commitment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases has led to a dramatic increase in the use of natural gas (NG). This trend is expected to continue since NG is considered as a vital ally in the search for a sustainable energy future. As Europe is deficient in natural gas resource, the demands need to be met by growing import in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The capacity of LNG to yield large volume of gas (a ration of 600:1 at standard temperature and pressure) has made it an extremely important component of the NG industry but also necessitates high safety standards in its handling. This has led to renewed interest in LNG safety from the energy security and reliability standpoint.\nThe proposed IDP will focus on the numerical characterization and simulation of the complex physics underpinning the safe handling of LNG. The specific objectives of the research include:\n� To characterize different LNG release scenarios and develop robust source term models;\n� To gain insight of the complex physics in LNG/fuel cascades and flammable cloud formation, and develop robust predictive tools;\n� To develop a robust model for accurate prediction of rollover.\n� To develop modelling strategies for assessing the environmental impact of large LNG spill by coupling micro scale dispersion models with mesoscale atmospheric models; and\n� To develop and validate LES based predictive tools for large LNG pool fires.\nThe predictive tools to be developed will be validated using published data as well as proprietary data from the private sector Associated Partners, and used to conduct parametric studies as well as safety case studies based on realistic LNG terminal layout.\nSix ESRs will be trained through the collective effort of well established academic staff (including some world leading professors) across 4 departments at the host in association with 6 Associated Partners including 4 from the private sector.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"606754","fundValue":"1761549.24","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
