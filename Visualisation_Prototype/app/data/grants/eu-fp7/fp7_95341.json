{"id":"95341","title":"Modulating interhemispheric interaction in physiology and disease","abstractText":"'Homotopic areas of primary motor cortices of both hemispheres are tightly interconnected and show both inhibitory and excitatory interactions, which are delicately balanced in healthy subjects. In disease this balance can be lost or impaired. Accordingly, some movement disorders occur lateralised. In early Parkinsonï¿½s Disease (PD) symptoms begin unilaterally, although unilateral changes on the cortical level are lacking. In focal task-induced hand dystonia (FHD) symptoms solely occur on one side and only spread in a minority of patients also to the other side. However, the pathophysiological role of interhemispheric interaction between both primary motor cortices in PD and FHD and its influence on cerebro-muscular coupling and cerebral oscillatory networks subserving motor activity is not finally understood yet. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) allows to modulate human brain activity. Using this feature it becomes possible to explore the characteristics of physiological and pathological cerebral networks and to modify these temporarily. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) enables us to characterise oscillatory synchronisation in the human brain. Moreover, MEG offers the possibility to scrutinise cerebro-muscular and cerebro-cerebral couplings. This allows to describe broad cerebral oscillatory networks including interhemispheric coupling. Combining rTMS and MEG the proposed project aims to reveal, how rTMS acts on the interhemispheric interaction in patients suffering from both PD and FHD and healthy subjects. Moreover, changes of oscillatory synchronisation induced by rTMS, i.e. resting state brain activity, cerebral oscillatory networks and cerebro-muscular coupling, will be characterised. Hence, results have the potential to enhance our understanding of the role of interhemispheric interaction in physiology and disease and to characterise the impact of disturbance of this interaction in PD and FHD.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253965","fundValue":"180103.2","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
