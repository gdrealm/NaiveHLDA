{"id":"98803","title":"\"Electrical Tail Drive - Modelling, Simulation and Rig Prototype Development\"","abstractText":"'The research programme will capitalise on the most recent advances in electrical machine technologies, thermal modelling, design optimisation and manufacturing processes to realise and evaluate a full-scale helicopter electric tail rotor (ETR) motor that is engineered for flight-critical operation and is representative of an aircraft installation.  A direct drive ETR solution will be optimised against the objectives of a peak output power of 3kW per kg of installed active mass making it weight-competitive with current mechanical technology, and will be a fault-tolerant design specified to an integrity target of 10 to the -9 failures per flight hour, whilst offering demonstrable performance and whole-life cost benefits.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"267322","fundValue":"2478434.4","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
