{"id":"91234","title":"\"Health system stewardship and regulation in Vietnam, India and China\"","abstractText":"'The proposed project aims to investigate stewardship and regulation as it relates to governance of health systems in policy and practice. It aims to do so by developing an integrated approach to improved stewardship and regulation in health services in Vietnam, India and China, in order to support policy decisions in the application and extension of principles of accessibility, affordability, equity and quality coverage of health care in the three countries.  The health systems of Vietnam, India and China include a mix of types of health care providers including public and private sectors.  The private sector has grown rapidly in recent years with implications for equity and access.  Previous research in the three countries suggests that the stewardship and regulation capacity of the three governments is pivotal in improving policies regarding accessibility, affordability and quality coverage of health services. The project will use maternal health as a case study of stewardship and regulation of health care services. Maternal health is one of the key areas for policy and health care delivery in low and middle-income countries and is included in the Millennium Development Goals. The choice of Vietnam, India (one state) and China (one province) as study sites has been based on their high rates of overall maternal ill-health, and the spectrum of contextual issues that determine the need for adequate stewardship and regulation. The project will evaluate stewardship and regulation within and across the study countries, will identify gaps and will suggest ways of improving stewardship and regulation. The outputs will include policy guides for national and international health policy makers and recommendations for national standards of stewardship and regulation. The project will contribute to improved health policy decisions related to the provision and financing of equitable maternal health services within Vietnam, India, China and wider.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"222970","fundValue":"3727436.8","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
