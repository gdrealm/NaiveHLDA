{"id":"90420","title":"Evolutionary explanations for cooperation: microbes to humans","abstractText":"'Cooperation poses a problem to evolutionary theory because it can be exploited by selfish individuals. Evolutionary biologists have developed a detailed theoretical overview of possible solutions to the problem of cooperation. In contrast to our theoretical understanding of potential solutions, however,, we have been relatively unsuccessful at applying theory to understand observations of cooperative behaviour nature. We present a novel and interdisciplinary programme of research to address this problem by empirically testing assumptions and predictions of several leading explanations for cooperation. We will develop theory to make explicit testable predictions for specific systems. We will exploit the advantage offered by different study systems: experiments with bacteria, comparative studies on cooperative breeding vertebrates, and experiments on humans. In addition to addressing specific hypotheses, we will show how evolutionary theory links and differentiates explanations for cooperation across various taxa and levels of biological organization.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"233204","fundValue":"1200000","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
