{"id":"85532","title":"Interactive Realtime Multimedia Applications on Service Oriented Infrastructures","abstractText":"IRMOS will design, develop, integrate and validate a Service Oriented Infrastructure that enables a broad range of interactive real-time applications.  It will support the development and deployment of real time applications in a distributed, managed, secure and cost effective way.  The infrastructure will be demonstrated in sectors with major economic and social importance by focusing on film production, virtual and augmented reality, and interactive collaborative learning.  The infrastructure will be accompanied by specification languages, toolkits and standards compliant interfaces to ensure the widest possible take-up in applications involving complex value chains and real time needs, for example in security, safety and emergency response scenarios.<br/>Today's Service Oriented Infrastructures (consisting of networks, computer systems, applications and their combination) there is no provision for Quality of Service assurances and so they are insufficient for the rapid construction and provision of many interactive real-time applications, they also lack dependability and resilience.  This prevents business at all levels, especially SMEs, from capitilising on the business models and services that have so much potential to emerge in this area. Whilst European business and individuals are becoming increasingly agile, today's Service Oriented Infrastructures are simply failing to keep pace.<br/>The IRMOS vision is motivated by combining the benefits of SOAs with the ability to support real-time applications with stringent performance, reliability and temporal constraints. We will allow real time applications to be exploited far more effectively and with dramatically lower costs.  Instead of costly investment in dedicated infrastructure, it will be possible for European businesses to make full use of commodity resources by using a flexible service oriented approach that achieves guaranteed Quality of Service.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"214777","fundValue":"12759911","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
