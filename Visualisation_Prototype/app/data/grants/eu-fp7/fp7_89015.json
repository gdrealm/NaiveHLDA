{"id":"89015","title":"Multifunctional DNA light-switches: sensors and devices","abstractText":"'Photoactive mono- and oligonuclear transition metal complexes containing DNA intercalative ligands will be synthesized. In the latter case, both homo- and heterometallic complexes will be synthesized. The photophysical properties of the complexes will be exploited to produce a number of outcomes: prototypical sensors for DNA sequences and/or structures that will produce a luminescent output on DNA binding, tools for investigating DNA/substrate binding events and the photophysical/electronic properties of DNA. The synthesis of multi-functional probes will also be investigated; e.g. DNA light-switches that also cleave DNA (directly OR through singlet oxygen sensitizing) and/or display cytotoxicity. To fully understand the properties of the new systems and their interaction with DNA studies will encompass a wide spectrum of techniques from time resolved optical spectroscopy, to calorimetry and in cellulo studies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219291","fundValue":"169957.94","fundStart":"2009-04-20","fundEnd":"2011-04-19","dataset":"fp7"}
