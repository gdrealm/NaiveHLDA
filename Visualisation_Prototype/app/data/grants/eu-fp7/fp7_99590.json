{"id":"99590","title":"Landscape and Identities: the case of the English Landscape 1500 BC- Ad1086","abstractText":"'The five-year EngLaId project will look at the long-term history of the English landscape from 1500 BC to AD 1086, combining evidence on landscape features, such as track-ways,fields and settlements, with the distribution of metalwork. The project aims to understand how people built relations with each other and broader cosmological forces from the start of the settled landscape to the early Medieval world. The project will combine a mass of digital data on landscapes and artefacts to uncover both continuity and change over 2500 years throwing a new light on the nature of pre-modern communities, contributing method and theory which can have model value in other areas of Europe.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269797","fundValue":"2059935","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
