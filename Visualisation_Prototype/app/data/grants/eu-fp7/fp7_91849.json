{"id":"91849","title":"Genomes and Evolution: Systematic Comparative Analysis of Homeobox Genes and their Non-coding Regulators","abstractText":"'The evolution of animal morphology is related to the evolution of the genome. In recent years, much research has focused on homeobox genes: a large and diverse group of genes, most of which encode transcription factors utilized in many aspects of embryonic development of animals. Their expression is controlled by non-coding regulators, DNA sequences that affect expression at the transcriptional (e.g. cis-regulators) or post-transcriptional (e.g. microRNA) level. Comparative genome analysis has showed that many (but not all) homeobox genes are widely conserved between evolutionarily divergent animal groups, while some non-coding regulators are also conserved but often over shorter time periods. Complicating these comparisons are many gene duplication events, gene losses, and varying rates of sequence change. Rarely has there been a systematic comparison allowing these data to be related to animal evolution. I have recently constructed a web-based platform �HomeoDB� that presents a robust evolutionary classification of animal homeobox genes facilitating comparison of those genes between animals. In its first release, HomeoDB includes all homeobox genes from human, amphioxus and fruitfly: over 500 genes in total. In recent years there has been a great expansion in genome sequence data, and many more animal species are having genomes sequenced. This gives a timely and unique opportunity to expand HomeoDB with data from additional species, additional elements, and additional functionality. In this project, I will carry out a systematic analysis of homeobox genes and their non-coding regulators, throughout the major branches of animal evolution. This will involve both lab-based experiments and bioinformatic analysis, coupled with expansion of the data depository and comprehensive functionality of HomeoDB. The outcome will be new insights into the relation between genome evolution and animal diversity, plus a resource of wider benefit to the scientific community.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"234861","fundValue":"181350.76","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
