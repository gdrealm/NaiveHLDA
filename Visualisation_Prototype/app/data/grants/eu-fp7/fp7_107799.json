{"id":"107799","title":"The Development of a Single-Screw Extrusion Process for Production of Low Density Biodegradable PLA Foam for Thermoformed Food Packaging Applications","abstractText":"'450 k t p.a. of foamed polymer packaging (mainly expanded polystyrene, EPS) is consumed in the EU with 34% (150 k t p.a.) used for food packaging. Foam packaging is an essential part of the food processing and transport process to prevent damage and spoilage. However, they are made from synthetic polymers and have low density (50 kg/m3) which makes them difficult to recycle economically. Thus, the vast majority of foams are landfilled at the end-of-life where they take-up a large volume and resist degradation. In addition, foamed polymers constitute a very high level of litter which is persistent in the environment and is the main source of marine debris. As a result of these factors, food retailers are looking to develop foamed packing solutions based on biodegradable polymers from natural sources. Only Poly lactic acid (PLA) is produced in sufficient tonnages as a natural alternative. However, due to its� chemical structure, PLA thermally degrades during processing which prevent the production of low density unmodified PLA foams using traditional extrusion technologies. Only modified PLAs have been successfully foamed to low densities. However these modified PLAs rely on technologies only available from the USA and the modification process affects the final properties and biodegradation behaviour. The proposed �PLA-Foam� project will develop a supercritical CO2 assisted foam extrusion process and thermoforming method that will produce unmodified PLA foam products with greatly reduced thermal degradation. This will enable the consortium to produce low density foams using unmodified PLAs whose performance and biodegradation behaviour will exceed current alternative. This will allow our consortium to develop world-leading PLA foam technologies that are not dependent on US technologies, giving us global market leadership and leading to sales in excess of 100 million Euros 5 years after the project ends and increase profits across the consortium by 9 million Euros.'","grantUrl":"http://pla-foam.uk-matri.org","grantId":"232145","fundValue":"1393953.58","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
