{"id":"99203","title":"Assessment of the hazard and opportunities of using carbon nanotubes as a new nanocarrier for drug delivery in neural tissue","abstractText":"'While neurodegenerative disorders and brain cancers increase in the population, current therapies have shown their limits. But thanks to recent advancements in nanosciences and nanotechnologies, new therapeutic opportunities are offered based on the development of nanoscale drug delivery systems. Among those, carbon nanotubes (CNT) have shown promising applications for therapy of a broad range of diseases because of their highly tunable abilities to transport different molecules and to penetrate cells. In this multidisciplinary project, we propose to use chemically functionalised CNT (f-CNT) as drug delivery systems for brain disease. However, since the knowledge concerning the interaction of CNT and the brain parenchyma is poor, the main goals of the project will be to define: (i) the potential hazard of using f-CNT in the brain and (ii) the pharmaceutical opportunities that these nanocarrier systems could offer. Our overall objective will be to identify critical parameters for the design/engineering of safe and effective carbon nanotubes based drug nanovectors for brain disease, with a special focus on the CNT surface functionalization. We will use both in vitro and in vivo studies to adresses these different questions.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"276051","fundValue":"199549.6","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
