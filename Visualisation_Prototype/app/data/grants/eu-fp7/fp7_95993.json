{"id":"95993","title":"Histone arginine methylation and citrullination in stem cell maintenance and specification","abstractText":"'Transcription in any given cell type is regulated at the level of chromatin, the complex where all nuclear DNA is packaged together with histones. Post-translational modifications at arginine and lysine residues of histones are key regulators of transcription. Furthermore, histone arginine methylation and citrullination appear to be important in the transcriptional control of several developmental processes. In this project, I intend to investigate the role of histone arginine methylation and citrullination in: (1) the maintenance of the pluri/multipotency status of mouse embryonic stem cells and neural stem cells; (2) the specification of neural stem cells, namely into the oligodendrocyte lineage. Increased understanding of the epigenetic regulation of stem cell fate and oligodendrocyte development is of uttermost importance for the development of cell therapies, in particular for demyelinating diseases. This interdisciplinary project will take advantage of my previously acquired expertise in stem cell biology and neural development, and of the host laboratory�s expertise in epigenetics, chromatin and transcription. I will be using leading-edge techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) � sequencing and Stable Isotope Labelling by Aminoacids in Cell culture (SILAC) technology, among others. Thus, this project will allow me to get research training in state-of-the-art techniques in the epigenetics field, which will be essential for my plans to become a principal investigator in the area of epigenetic regulation of neural development, with a focus on oligodendrogenesis.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252915","fundValue":"240289.6","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
