{"id":"100421","title":"DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADVANCED MEDIUM RANGE ULTRASONIC TECHNIQUE FOR MOORING CHAINS INSPECTION IN WATER","abstractText":"'The Moorinspect project will bring a step change to the current in-water moor chain inspection systems through the development and introduction of new method for detection of fatigue cracks in the large chain links used in Deepwater offshore facilities.\n\nMoorinspect main objective would be to develop a medium range ultrasonic in-water testing technology using Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGW) method to identify cracks and fatigues in closed circular/elliptical chains. Due to the propagation capability of the tool, it would also be possible to test link-cross sections in chain links for potential of detection of cracks in usually inaccessible locations, specific objectives would be to provide Interpretation of Signal readings for under surface crack and fatigues in chain links through development of UGW transducers ring, calibration techniques. The Moorinspect main technology objective would be to bring the novel approach to Non Destructive Testing (NDT) moor chain scanning though investigating several types of transducers for MRUT methods including (Electro-Magnetic Acoustic Transducer) EMAT approach to deployment, and hence through Development of Mechanised Deployment Vehicle to inspect those chains, leading to the capacity to conduct periodical inspection to detect progressive defects and fatigues based on historical data gathered from perpetual testing.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"286976","fundValue":"1420596.6","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
