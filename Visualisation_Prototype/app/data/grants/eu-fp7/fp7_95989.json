{"id":"95989","title":"Investigation of low-energy electron collisions with molecules in cluster and surface environments","abstractText":"'In the past decade, it has become increasingly apparent that low-energy electrons (LEE) play a critical role in a large number of fundamental and applied fields. Electrons with energies in the range 0-10 eV can induce specific chemical reactions which are relevant to nanolithography, dielectric aging, radiation waste management, radiation processing, astrochemistry, planetary and atmospheric chemistry, surface photochemistry, radiobiology, and radiotherapy. In the last decade researchers in the European Union have been at the forefront of such research and, through a number of EU supported networking activities (co-ordinated by the host), have led the international research community in the development of experimental studies of LEE interactions with molecules in the gaseous phase and at the surface of molecular and biomolecular solids pioneering a new field of �electron induced chemistry�. However, a comprehensive theory capable of predicting the dissociation dynamics of such electron molecule interactions - the precursor to the subsequent electron driven chemistry � has remained elusive. The applicant, Professor Ilya Fabrikant, has been at the forefront of such theoretical studies for more than 30 years. The purpose of the proposed IIF is to allow Professor Fabrikant to transfer his expertise to the emerging younger theoretical research community within the European Union. Based at the host institution, chosen because of its unique combination of experiment and theoretical research and recognised leadership in the field of electron induced chemistry, Professor Fabrikant will pursue a novel research program investigating electron attachment, and particularly dissociative electron attachment (DEA) with polyatomic molecules across a range of media including gaseous, clusters, surface and bulk matter, exploring how this basic chemical precursor process is influenced by such different environments.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252714","fundValue":"233089.6","fundStart":"2010-06-16","fundEnd":"2012-06-15","dataset":"fp7"}
