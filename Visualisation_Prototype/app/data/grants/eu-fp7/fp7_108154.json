{"id":"108154","title":"Global Americanisation of Rulemaking?","abstractText":"'Emerging but extensive literature remarks the interdependence of governments also in administrative law. Transparency, openness, accountability, and the use of scientific evidence are values now common in rulemaking of many countries. Although theoretical and empirical efforts to frame and evidence the Americanisation of administrative law and regulatory governance, a metrical measure for assessing the extent of convergence is still lacking. This research project fills this gap, by assessing the extent of converge among OECD and EU member states. An index of similarity over four decades is derived from an original data set on administrative requirements. This index allows to measure the extent of similarity across four decades and test alternative convergence explanations, by relying on different methods.\nThis research aims to assess the explanatory power of the underlying causes of Americanisation against the emergence of a European Administrative space via harmonisation, the transnational communication facilitated by the OECD, as well as globalising economic and political structures. The proposed research attempts to make the following three contributions to the literature of political science and comparative administrative law. The first contribution concerns the concept formation of administrative rulemaking. The emergence and the evolution of regulatory governance is taken into account, in order to trace the sequence and the cross-national pattern of regulatory oversight adoption. The second contribution refers to the literature of �global administrative law�, by assessing and estimating the extent of rulemaking process convergence. The final contribution is to the methodological literature on policy convergence.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"334008","fundValue":"75000","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
