{"id":"103471","title":"Evolution of longevity and senescence in long-lived Asian elephants and humans","abstractText":"'Ageing is a central concept in biology and has implications for humanities, social sciences and public health. A few mammals with extreme\nlongevity, including human women, represent a striking exception to general pattern, ceasing reproduction at age 50 and having a long\npost-reproductive lifespan, thus posing the question of whether and why long post-reproductive lifespan in such species has been under\nnatural selection. I am applying to establish a new innovative project to investigate the evolution of extreme longevity in mammals, by\ncombining my previous extensive expertise on longevity and senescence in humans with data on an another long-lived mammal with\nsimilar life-history, the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Asian elephants have long lifespan (maximum of 80 years), live in social groups\ncontaining many generations and thus would make a fascinating comparison to humans and the patterns of longevity evolution in animals\nin general. My proposed approach is novel, the dataset used unique, and the results are likely to be highly interesting both across different\ndisciplines of science as well as to the public. I am applying to conduct this study at the top-biological science Dept. in UK (as ranked in\nnational survey 2009 based on the quality of research), Animal and Plant Sciences (APS) of the University of Sheffield. Working in\nSheffield would allow me: to test my previous findings on humans with new avenues on elephants thus widening my personal research\nspectrum; continue working on topics and systems that attract lots of media interest in the positive sense; enable further international\nfunding opportunities from inter-disciplinary sources; likely lead to high-impact publications; highly interest students both at the\nundergraduate and postgraduate level. I believe that my career would greatly benefit from gaining an opportunity to work with top\ninternational researchers in my field in Sheffield.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"301996","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"no date","fundEnd":"no date","dataset":"fp7"}
