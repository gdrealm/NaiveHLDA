{"id":"107383","title":"Trifluoromethylation under Photoredox Catalysis","abstractText":"'Fluorine chemistry is critically important to advance a range of fields inclusive of medicinal chemistry, agrochemical chemistry as well as material science. In this context, there is a demand for new methods for the late stage selective trifluoromethylation of substrates that are not activated by the prototypical carbonyl group functionality. Such substrates require new catalytic manifolds to enhance reactivity and allow control over selectivity (regioselectivity, diastereoselectivity, chirality transfer, enantioselectivity). We propose to apply the concept of photoredox catalysis (visible light activation of transition metal complexes) for the trifluoromethylation of organosilanes and feedstock olefins.This study will include in depth understanding of  reaction mechanisms (this will feature cyclic voltammetric measurements and electrochemistry) and will generate a library of compounds, the properties of which  will be examined  for potential application in drug discovery (GSK). The project will be carried out by an applicant who has expertise in fluorine chemistry and who is proficient in mechanistic studies. The host will bring complementary knowledge in fluorine chemistry, catalysis and photoredox catalysis. An ongoing external  collaboration will add expertise in electrochemistry (Lyon). Upon completion, this project will contribute to  advance catalysis in Europe and beyond and will allow the implementation of long lasting  collaboration  between Oxford and the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry in China.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"331090","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2013-09-27","fundEnd":"2015-09-26","dataset":"fp7"}
