{"id":"90345","title":"Semiconductor Spintronics: Spin Polarisation and Nanodevices","abstractText":"'The proposed research programme addresses important issues in the field of ferromagnetic semiconductor spintronics which are of fundamental and potential technological importance. At the core of the project are the objectives of measuring the carrier spin polarisation in ferromagnetic semiconductors (a key quantity for spintronics) and of producing nanoscale ferromagnetic semiconductor single electron transistors which promise new spintronic functionalities. The applicant and the host Semiconductor Spintronics Group are uniquely matched to make this timely and important project possible. The applicant is an expert in the field of superconductivity and its interplay with magnetism who has extensive experience of focused ion beam nano-patterning and Point Contact Andreev Reflection spectroscopy, which makes possible the measurement of spin polarisation. The host Semiconductor Spintronics Group are internationally-leading in the field of ferromagnetic semiconductor materials and device development. This research project is very complementary to, but clearly differentiated from, existing research projects at Nottingham. In essence the intention is for the applicant to apply her particular expertise and techniques to materials fabricated at Nottingham for the realisation of important advances in semiconductor spintronics, thus greatly benefiting applicant and host institution.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"237375","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
