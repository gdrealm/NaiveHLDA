{"id":"110823","title":"\"Up-Scaled Production of Graphene Reinforced Thermosetting Polymers for Composite, Coating and Adhesive Applications\"","abstractText":"'The concept of PolyGraph is to develop new production techniques which will deliver industrial-scale quantities of graphene-reinforced thermosetting polymers, suitable for use in a number of key applications where improvements are needed in the strength, stiffness, toughness, electrical conductivity and thermal properties; such as fibre-reinforced composite resins, coatings and adhesives.\n\nThe ultimate aim of PolyGraph is to develop a process in which graphene can be produced and dispersed �in-situ� within thermosetting polymer resins, using relatively inexpensive expanded graphite as a starting material.\nWe propose a staged approach to reach this ambitious goal, starting with production of graphene via new chemical and mechano-chemical methods and its subsequent dispersion in thermosetting resins. We will then further develop and modify existing mixing and dispersion equipment to enable the exfoliation of expanded graphite to be carried out directly in thermosetting resins. A further aim is to optimise techniques for the production of fibre-reinforced composites, adhesives and coatings, to ensure that the graphene remains well distributed in the final part.\n\nAs a result, we will significantly lower the overall cost of these materials and make them viable for use in the composites, coatings and adhesives industries.'","grantUrl":"http://www.polygraphproject.eu/home","grantId":"604143","fundValue":"7200308.4","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
