{"id":"186850","title":"Use of EGF-R antagonists for the treatment of chronic infections and tumor growth","abstractText":"'FoxP3 expressing regulatory T-cells play an important role in the induction of peripheral tolerance and the prevention of auto-immune responses. How the functionality of regulatory T-cells is regulated at the site of inflammation remains poorly understood. We just recently discovered that the functionality of regulatory T-cells is regulated via the EGF-R that is expressed by activated regulatory T-cells. In in vitro suppression assays the presence of the EGF-like growth factor Amphiregulin significantly enhanced the suppressive capacity of regulatory T-cells and, in vivo, Amphiregulin-induced signals enabled regulatory T-cells to induce tolerance against innocuous antigens. This effect was blocked upon application of EGF-R antagonists (Zaiss et al. 2013).\nBased on these findings, the objectives of this proposal are:\n1.a)\tTo determine the role of regulatory T-cells during tumor therapy; in specific during induced lymphopenia in the context of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) based tumor therapy.\n1.b)\tTo determine whether EGF-R inhibitors can suppress regulatory T-cell function such that they enhance the efficacy of ACT based tumor therapy?\n2)\tTo determine whether smallpox viruses use their virus-encoded EGF-like growth factors to enhance regulatory T-cell function, and thus as an immune escape mechanism? This will answer the question whether interference with regulatory T-cell function explains for the immune-stimulatory effect of EGF-R inhibitor treatment, during vaccinia virus infections.\n3)\tTo determine whether we can develop an EGF-R inhibitor that selectively targets regulatory T-cells, and thus keeps all other functions of the EGF-R, for example in tissue homeostasis, intact?\n\nTaken together, this proposed project tests a novel therapeutic approach by which we expect to have hit a so far unrecognized, therapeutic �Achilles� heel� of Tregs, i.e. via the regulation of Treg functionality by EGF-R ligands.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"631413","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
