{"id":"87986","title":"\"Predicting and managing weld induced distortion in thin-walled, steel structures\"","abstractText":"'Experimental measurements and the finite element method will be used to study the relationship between the distortion of thin welded ferritic steel plates used in shipbuilding, the welding parameters and the design of the weldment. By modelling the distortion process using material, design and welding parameters, the parameters can be optimised (for example, by modifying the structural design or the welding process) in order to minimise the resulting distortion. Pre-existing stresses will be measured using neutron diffraction techniques. A novel finite element (FE) model-which includes a description of the austenite to ferrite and bainite phase transformations will be developed, allowing realistic predictions of the residual stresses and distortions to be made. The FE model will disseminated as paradigm into relevant academic and industry communities for routine use.  The fellowship will significantly contribute towards the career development of the researcher by providing the opportunities to acquire new skills, thus increasing his competency level in research and diversifying his abilities, and overall increasing  professional maturity (as per the FP7 �People� Work Programme objectives). This will be done through: (i) Scientific training-through-research project under supervision and active contribution in the scientific management of the research project, (ii) Active contribution to conferences, (iii) Capacity to build collaborations in academia and corporate sector, (iv) Hands-on training activities for developing scientific and complementary skills, and (v) Acquiring of additional organisational and interpersonal skills.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219820","fundValue":"169390.93","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
