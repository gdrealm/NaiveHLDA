{"id":"95406","title":"Computational Intelligence Platform for Evolving and Robust Predictive Systems","abstractText":"'The proposed research programme will focus on pervasively adaptive software systems for the development of an open modular computational INtelligence software platform For Evolving and Robust predictive systems (INFER) applicable in various commercial settings and industries. The main innovation of the project is a novel type of environment in which the �fittest� predictive model for whatever purpose will emerge � either autonomously or by user high-level goal-related assistance and feedback. The application of the INFER platform as smart adaptive soft sensors will contribute to increasing the operational excellence of the European process industry represented by a large international company, Evonik Degussa GmbH from Germany, focusing on specialty chemistry. The jointly developed software platform will translate the latest academic research results achieved with help of the academic partner, Bournemouth University from UK, into a commercial software product through involvement of highly skilled and innovative SME software company, Research &amp; Engineering Centre from Poland. In facilitating a continuous exchange of expertise, firstly by including new and innovative ideas in actual industry products and services and secondly by providing constant feedback in terms of practical applicability of the new approaches and future needs and requirements, a long-term research collaboration and mechanisms for commercial exploitation of research results will be established. The partners believe that engineering of more robust, context aware and easy-to-use ICT systems, which improve, adapt and maintain themselves within their respective environments and constraints, will play a crucial role in removing various technological roadblocks and reinforcing Europe�s industrial and commercial strengths.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251617","fundValue":"1555380","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
