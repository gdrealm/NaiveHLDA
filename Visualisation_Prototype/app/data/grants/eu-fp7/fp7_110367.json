The project comprises five work packages (WP). WP1 will, coordinate the delivery of project outputs, ensure achievement of anticipated outcomes, and develop and manage project infrastructure. WP2 will produce national (Afghanistan, Bangladesh,Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and regional (Southern Asia) position papers providing a consensus on the key societal challenges in the region linked to Horizon2020. These papers will be used as the basis for WP3: the identification and mapping of key national and regional stakeholders that can influence and address these societal challenges. WP4 will engage these key stakeholders, raise awareness of the potential for EU-Southern Asia cooperation, and stimulate their participation in Horizon 2020. WP5 will use the position papers from WP2 and stakeholder maps from WP3 to compile a policy brief with recommendations to the European Commission on how to promote bi-lateral cooperation with Southern Asia with a view to tackling key societal challenges of mutual interest. WP5 will also promote Southern Asian contacts among major European stakeholders.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"609562","fundValue":"335550.3","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
