{"id":"108053","title":"Abscisic acid and the mechanisms that regulate hydrotropism","abstractText":"Despite ABA being the most important phytohormone in the response of plants to drought stress little is known about how water\ndeficits are perceived by plants. Although ABA has been traditionally described as a growth inhibitor, different reports\nhave shown a role for ABA promoting growth. Under water stress ABA inhibits shoot growth and maintains root growth in\norder to guarantee water uptake. In fact, roots grow towards zones with higher water contents and this response is called\nhydrotropism. This project is focused on the study of the mechanisms that link the perception of water deficits in the soil with\nthe adaptive responses caused by ABA that are directed to ensure plant survival. The identification of the mechanism by\nwhich an environmental signal causes a modification of root growth will be investigated. The discovery of\nthe elements responsible for transmitting the water deficit signal and the proteins involved in this signaling pathway\nwill compose the first part of the project. Next, the creation of multiscale models capturing the response integrating dynamic\nchanges in ABA response, biomechanics and root growth in response to hydrotropic stimuli as well as the use of non invasive\nmicro CT imaging of root systems will help to understand how plants respond to osmotic gradients in soil. The study of the\nmechanisms that regulate root growth and bending will help create useful tools directed to reduce crop losses\ncaused by this stress. The experience of the researcher in the field of ABA will help to create an integrative point of view of\nthe role of this hormone in the context of growth regulation. The availability of modeling, genetic and imaging techniques as\nwell as the long experience of Prof. Malcolm Bennett in the study of gravitropism and auxin regulated plant\ngrowth makes The Center for Plant Integrative Biology an excellent setting to investigate this biological process.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"332016","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
