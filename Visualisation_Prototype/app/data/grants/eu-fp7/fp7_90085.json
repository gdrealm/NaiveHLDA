{"id":"90085","title":"MEDiterranean studies of Cardiovascular disease and Hyperglycaemia: Analytical Modelling of Population Socio-economic transitions","abstractText":"'Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes are increasing dramatically in low and middle income countries. The main reasons for this are an increase in major risk factors, particularly increasing obesity [as a consequence of changes in nutrition and decreases in physical activity], and increasing tobacco use. Globalisation, urbanisation and an ageing population are contributing to this trend. A common misperception is that NCDs are diseases of affluence, but in fact they are common amongst poorer sectors of populations, and age-specific disease rates can be higher in developing countries than in industrialised settings. Health services in these countries, developed to tackle acute infectious diseases, are often not ideally organised to promote effective care and prevention for NCDs.   This project will develop a CVD and diabetes model (IMPACT) for use in this region. After appropriate testing and validation, we will enter data from each of the four Mediterranean study countries (Palestine, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey) into the model, and validate results against current disease levels and trends. We will use a combination of situation analysis, policy and document review, and qualitative techniques to elicit the current state of NCD policy development in the study countries, and stakeholdersï¿½ perceptions of potentially effective interventions. We will then use the country validated models to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of selected future policies. Finally, we will develop implementation and evaluation plans for these policies in each study country. The goal of this project is to reduce the NCD burden of CVD and diabetes. The overall objective is to be able to make recommendations about the policy initiatives, both within and outside the health sector, likely to be the most effective and cost-effective in reducing the burden of CVD and diabetes mortality and morbidity in each country.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"223075","fundValue":"3475608.2","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
