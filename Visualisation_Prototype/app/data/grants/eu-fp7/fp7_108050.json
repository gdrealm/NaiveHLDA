{"id":"108050","title":"Catalysis driven Manufacture and patterning of Graphene at the nanoscale using probe technologies","abstractText":"Graphene is now a leader among new super-materials poised to transform the electronics and nanotechnology landscape. Specifically, graphene nanoribbons are purported to enable a host of applications such as superfast electronics. However, problems associated with large scale growth and patterning of graphene akin to silicon components constitute one of the main obstacles to using this material in device applications. I address this challenge by proposing a disruptive and novel method to produce graphene nanoribbons directly on arbitrary substrates via a unique probe-based nanomanufacturing approach that combines nanoscale catalysis and nanomechanical exfoliation for a scalable, manufacturable process. This would be a very significant enabler for large scale manufacturing of high performance graphene devices, as this would allow us not only to make standard graphene devices, but also allow one to rework or repair existing chips, create wearable electronics and pattern on arbitrary substrates such as plastics. This work will be carried out in a high-impact group with unique yet complementary expertise.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329988","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
