{"id":"90847","title":"Cage Complexes With Phosphonates","abstractText":"The proposal is to learn to use polymetallic cage complexes as building blocks for larger zero-dimensional nano-objects. The approach to be adopted will be to use phosphonate and related ligands to link these cages via a carboxylate displacement reaction that has been developed in Manchester. Once made these compounds will be studied by X-ray crystallography and their magnetic properties examined using a variety of techniques.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"220035","fundValue":"169957.94","fundStart":"2008-09-26","fundEnd":"2010-09-25","dataset":"fp7"}
