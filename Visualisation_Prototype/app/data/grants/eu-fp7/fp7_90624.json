{"id":"90624","title":"An innovative system to impose altered features on a defined chromosome region and investigate its movement by fluorescence microscopy in the nucleus of a cell","abstractText":"'Our objective is to provide world-class research and training in the field of Life Sciences. Our innovative project applies interdisciplinary methods to identify new paradigms therefore contributing to the knowledge-based economy and society. Scientifically, the project involves cutting-edge microscopy in fission yeast to characterize the relationship between different chromatin features and their position in the nucleus. We will integrate distinct scientific approaches to obtain breakthroughs in the field. All research activities are in compliance with fundamental ethical principles. Further the project will be carried out in a laboratory where gender equality is encouraged, currently there are ten women in a group of fifteen. With respect to the training: we provide a comprehensive experimental work-plan which is designed to enhance the researchers career development and the diversification of his abilities at an advanced level. This is achieved by sharing reagents and expertise in collaborative exchanges as well as in meetings and workshops. We also present a timetable of the anticipated progress with milestones, promoting proactive project management. The diversity of valuable skills acquired will certainly benefit the researcher and support professional maturity in attaining an independent position. The candidate is a motivated and enthusiastic experienced researcher with an excellent academic and research track record. He developed his skills and scientific training on an international basis, convinced that mobility is central to the open-minded requirement of fundamental discoveries. He will join the well-known laboratory of Professor Robin Allshire in Edinburgh, who is recognized as world-leader in the field of chromosomal biology. Overall the project is a collaborative effort set in the leading research University in Scotland with state-of-the-art infrastructures and facilities, contributing to Europeï¿½s excellence and attractiveness.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235892","fundValue":"171300.62","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
