{"id":"99371","title":"Rapid and Reliable Detection of Foodborne Pathogens by Employing Multiplexing Biosensor Technology","abstractText":"'Pathfinder is an important research project focused on development of innovative means of detecting important pathogenic organisms  associated with food poisoning. This will be achieved using biosensor technology capable of detecting many different pathogens simultaneously. To achieve the main goal the Marie Curie Fellow, Dr. Nitsara Karoonuthaisiri from Thailand will bring her skills in microarrays and pathogen detection and lead a team of scientists at the Host Institute at Queenï¿½s University Belfast. The Fellow will work closely with the Institute Director, Professor Chris Elliott, an eminent European researcher in the field of advanced diagnostics on this two year project at the host institution followed by one year return phase. The outcomes of this research will be extremely important to Europe as food poisoning affects many millions of citizens each year and improved diagnostics has been identified as one of the key topics requiring more research activity. Dr. Karoonuthaisiri has been motivated to apply for this prestigious Fellowship to work in a European centre of excellence to enable transfer of her skills & knowledge to an EU research team.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"273608","fundValue":"271636.8","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
