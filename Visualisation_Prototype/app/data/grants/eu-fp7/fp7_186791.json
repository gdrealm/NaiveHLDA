{"id":"186791","title":"Studying the physics of exceptional points using metamaterials","abstractText":"'Metamaterials is a new class of materials constructed from artificial atoms with their optical properties often come from the underlying structures instead of the composing materials. They can therefore be flexibly designed to achieve particular optical functions. As a result, extreme functions like invisibility cloaking and subwavelength imaging become possible. Because of this extreme flexibility, metamaterials can also be used as a platform to study the physics of waves in general and this is the main theme of this proposal. In particular, we are interested to use metamaterials to study the physics of exceptional points, which is tightly linked to various extraordinary wave phenomena including unidirectional reflection, phase transition, anti-lasing and non-reciprocal propagation. Moreover, exceptional points can also give us high sensitivity, which can be important for future applications of metamaterials in order to give reconfigurable or tunable metamaterials.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"630979","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
