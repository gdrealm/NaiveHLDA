{"id":"105822","title":"Improved Water efficiency through ICT technologies for integrated supply-Demand side manaGEmenT","abstractText":"The aim of iWIDGET is to advance knowledge and understanding about smart metering technologies in order to develop novel, robust, practical and cost-effective methodologies and tools to manage urban water demand in households across Europe, by reducing wastage, improving utility understanding of end-user demand and reducing customer water and energy costs.nThe main scientific challenges for iWIDGET are the management and extraction of useful information from vast amounts of high-resolution consumption data, the development of customised intervention and awareness campaigns to influence behavioural change, and the integration of iWIDGET concepts into a set of decision-support tools for water utilities and consumers, applicable in differing local conditions.nIn order to meet these aims and challenges, iWIDGET will investigate: (i) how best to provide the dynamic accurate measurement and data transfer of useful information about end-user water consumption, (ii) how best to use consumption data to improve the operation of utilities and influence end-users to modify their behaviour, (iii) how to arrive at the best business model to convert a promising technology into a useful and cost-effective product, and (iv) how to demonstrate and validate the new methodologies on two case studies in the North and South of Europe.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"318272","fundValue":"5032000","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
