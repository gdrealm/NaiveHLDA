{"id":"105502","title":"\"Scandium-based multifunctional nitrides for optoelectronic, polaritonic and ferro/magnetoelectric devices\"","abstractText":"'Device performance is ultimately limited by material properties. To break existing performance limits, I plan to develop a new multifunctional Sc-based nitride materials platform in which tuneable semiconducting, ferroelectric and magnetic functionalities may be achieved for the first time. I can then address three major challenges: (1) solving a 20-year-old problem in solid-state-lighting using highly efficient green light-emitters, (2) creating the first electrically pumped full-spectrum polaritonic lasers, and (3) developing an optimised artificial synapse for adaptive computing (plus similar related non-volatile memory devices). Combined, such advances could lead towards the �spintronics dream� of devices with integrated optoelectronic, photonic and magnetic functionality. Importantly, the mature growth and device processing technologies in place for conventional nitride semiconductors will allow rapid exploitation of this versatile new group of materials.\n\nA theme is planned for each objective. At Stage 1 (months 1 � 30), I plan to grow and characterise crystalline thin films of the Sc-based nitrides relevant to each theme, aiming to control the structure and properties of the individual layers and simple heterostructures from which devices will be constructed. Themes 1 and 2 will use specific Sc/III-nitride alloys created by molecular beam epitaxy, a flexible industry-proven growth technique. Theme 3 will explore and use a broad range of transition-metal/ScGaN alloys created by electron-beam epitaxy, a relatively low-cost technique optimised for transition metals. Full experimental data on layer properties will be input into models, which will be used to design full device structures. Optimised device designs will be chosen at Month 30. At Stage 2 (months 31 � 60), test structures will be created, processed and characterised, mostly using techniques already established for III-nitride semiconductor devices, leading to working prototype devices for each theme.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"307636","fundValue":"1486341.8","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
