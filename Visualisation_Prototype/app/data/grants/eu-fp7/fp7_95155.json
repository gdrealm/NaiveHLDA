{"id":"95155","title":"Development of new flow chemistry methodology: Application into total synthesis of spirangien natural products and analogues thereof","abstractText":"'This is a proposal on Organic Chemistry. One of the most relevant problems in modern synthetic chemistry is the development of new technologies directed towards overcoming many of the bottlenecks associated with conventional organic synthesis. Also more use of automation is needed to facilitate scale-up and to improve the current synthesis standards. One of the most exciting and potentially significant developments is the incorporation of flow chemistry into lab based synthesis platforms. Moreover, an additional benefit to this mode of chemistry is that it allows for the linking of individual reactions into multi-step sequences, allowing for one reaction to flow seamlessly into another, creating a rapid route to the desired more complex product in gram-scale. Although this field of research is still in its infancy, the endless applications of such methodology mandate extensive research on the subject. Natural products bearing a spiroketal or bis-oxazole core structure are well-precedented biologically interesting compounds. Application of innovative flow approach to such modular total synthesis would be useful as biological probes for drug discovery programs. As a proof of the concept hennoxazoles and spirangiens have been targeted for design of novel flow approach. This will naturally lead to development of new flow chemical methodology. Particularly challenging organometallic Carbon-Carbon and Carbon-Oxygen coupling reactions are to be developed. The successful application of this proposal may allow the applicant conduct postdoctoral studies at one of the most prestigious European research centre (Professor Ley�s Group at the University of Cambridge, U.K.), therefore expediting fellow�s career development.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251834","fundValue":"172740.8","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
