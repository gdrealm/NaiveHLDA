{"id":"91986","title":"Hyaluronan-based injectable material for tissue engineering (HYANJI SCAFFOLD)","abstractText":"'This is an exchange-based programme to enable developing new tissue engineering scaffolds based. It aims at technology transfer of advanced methods from for the biosynthesis of polyalkaonates and for targeted drug delivery. The exchange programme comprises 2 EU partners (Keele and Pisa) and 2 Chinese partners (Tsinghua and Sichuan) who are centres of excellence. The exchange comprises 208 person-months over 4 years to achieve scientific and strategic development of foundation for long-lasting scientific collaboration between EU and China. Scientific novelty lies in the use of biosyntehsised  multifunctional nano-process matrices. They will be cultured under dynamic conditions in bioreactor with online monitoring of O2, CO2, and pH. Building these regeneration constructs needs the combination of expertise which is by no means available on one ingle centre. The work is organised into definite but complimentary 4 work-packages (WPs) that are executed by the combined effort of the 4 partners. Each WP has 52 person months. After this project, each partner will have adapted new knowledge, skills and expertise resulting in new innovations in treatment of bone and cartilage defects to transfer to industry for and strengthened EU-Chinese collaboration to catch with existing gap with US and Japan.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"230791","fundValue":"374400","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
