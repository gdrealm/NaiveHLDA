{"id":"111295","title":"The coordination of national research activities of Member States and Associated States in the field of Ocean Energy (ERA-NET)","abstractText":"'Europeï¿½s vast coast line harbours a huge potential resource of ocean energy to be exploited as a renewable electricity source contributing towards the 2020 targets and beyond. The ocean is a complex working environment, relatively little is known about it and it is widely used by others, such as fishing, shipping and recreation. However, the prize for introducing ocean energy generation is high, estimated by DG MARE, at 380GW.\nCurrently, several member states and regions are funding ocean energy research, demonstration, technology and innovation (RTDI). There is a shared goal to generate knowledge about the marine environment and to speed the development of this emerging sector. However these research efforts are not coordinated. This is why the member states are proposing the Ocean Energy ERA-NET as outlined in this paper. The ERA-NET will provide a framework for transnational joint activities and will cooperate with the EERA Ocean Energy Joint Programme; other relevant European projects and industry stakeholders.\nThis wide reaching ERA-NET brings together 16 partners from nine member states intent on gaining the benefits of coordinated research funding. Member States have different levels of engagement in the ocean energy sector, and it is important that the ERA-NET actions reflect this. The objective is to improve the quality, scope and fragmentation of research through better networks, addressing common barriers and improving coordination. The proposal sets out the execution of the project from networking and information sharing to the launch of, at least one, transnational joint call. In doing so the partners will develop a shared vision for the sector, an action plan for delivery and a toolkit for call administration. The result will be reduced fragmentation in research funding, development and wider uptake of good practice and support for the commercialisation of the ocean energy sector.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"618099","fundValue":"2673801.96","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
