{"id":"104613","title":"Durable Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Tri-generation System for Low Carbon Buildings","abstractText":"'The project (TriSOFC) aims to develop and evaluate the performance of the first-of-its-kind LT-SOFC tri-generation system for low carbon buildings. The system is based on the integration of LT-SOFC stack and a novel liquid desiccant unit.\n\nA 1.5kW low-cost durable LT-SOFC tri-generation prototype system will be designed optimised, constructed and tested. The tri-generation system incorporates additional components including a fuel processor, to generate reformate gas if natural-gas used as fuel, and equipment for the electrical, mechanical and control balance of plant (BoP). With high efficiency, low-cost and longï¿½term duration in mind, all these components will be first tested in the laboratory for further optimisation and miniaturisation. The performance of the tri-generation system will be tested using the Creative Energy Homes (low/zero carbon homes) at the University of Nottingham, UK.\n\nThe tri-generation system will be used primarily in the low carbon homes/buildings. The system will be tested using natural-gas but it could be modified for use with other clean/renewable energy fuels (e.g. alcohol, biomass liquid fuel and biodiesel).\n\nThe system has the potential to reduce CO2 emission by 70% compared to a traditional energy production system comprising of separate condensate power plant, boiler and compressor-driven cooling units. The successful development of the proposed project will promote LT-SOFC applications for provision of power, heat and cooling. The commercialisation of the system will bring economic and environmental benefits to the EU.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"303454","fundValue":"2727219.06","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
