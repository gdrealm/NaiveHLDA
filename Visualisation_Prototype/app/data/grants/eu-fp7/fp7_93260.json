{"id":"93260","title":"DIstribution Of Multi-view Entertainment using content aware DElivery Systems","abstractText":"The delivery of 3D immersive entertainment to the home remains a highly challenging problem due to the large amount of data involved. As the number of 3D views provided to users increases, current video delivery systems (e.g. terrestrial broadcast) will struggle to meet the demanding requirements for many 2D/3D displays/TVs at homes. DIOMEDES will focus on new methods for the compression and delivery of multi-view video and multi-channel audio to users. The DIOMEDES approach is to develop a 3D Peer-to-Peer (P2P) distribution system, which will be designed jointly with novel video compression techniques. The DIOMEDES system will have the following features:n�t3D Quality of Experience (QoE) and 3D audio-visual attention modelling � to ensure that human perception of 3D multimedia is considered during the optimization of 3D media delivery services.  This work includes optimized adaptation to network congestion and for displays/TVs with different capabilities;n�tJoint compression and distribution strategy � the designed P2P 3D media distribution system coupled with the novel scalable and multi-description codec, will be applicable to the current internet infrastructure, supported by most Internet Service Providers (ISPs).  The joint compression and distribution approach will distribute the 3D media without overloading the network;n�tJoint use of broadcast and IP networks for 3D media delivery � multi-view content will be distributed to the user through multiple paths networks to balance the information load as well as to ensure a more robust 3D multimedia delivery at homes;n�t �Controlled� sharing of content (including user-generated content), i.e. making sure that only authorized content is distributed, as well as content authentication and access control.nThe compression, distribution, and security technologies developed within DIOMEDES will be demonstrated in the form of an integrated test bed. The results of the project will be beneficial to the European media industry as well as to European citizens.  The industry will benefit from having a cost effective method of delivering new, high quality 3D content. The citizens will benefit from the improvements to home entertainment technology brought by DIOMEDES in terms of Quality of Experience.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247996","fundValue":"3615113","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
