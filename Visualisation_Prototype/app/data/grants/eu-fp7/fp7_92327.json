{"id":"92327","title":"Electrochemical Silicon Layers Formation in Fused Salts","abstractText":"'The goal of this project is to create new electrochemical methods of silicon layer formation in fused salt electrolytes in the range of thicknesses from nanometres to micrometres. The research aims to achieve results of high technological significance ï¿½ formation of silicon thin films for photovoltaic applications (e.g. solar cells). The advantages of the proposed electrochemical SiO2 deoxidation include: 1) possibility to use electrons as absolutely clean agents instead of toxic volatile chemicals used in classical processes; 2) energy efficiency; 3) spatial control of the silicon formation from pinpoint to complete layer, which will open new possibilities for microelectromechanical systems and silicon chip technologies; 4) control of the composition, morphology, structure and crystallinity of the layers depending on the operating conditions. Socio-economic reasons of the project stem from the imperative to search for effective substitutes of fossil energy. Solar energy can be converted to electricity with no impact on the environment and the fuel is free. However, so far, solar energy is expensive. The major part of its costs is related to materials, mainly silicon, which is the most widely used material for manufacture of solar elements. The classical processes of silicon production are highly energy consuming, low efficiency and unfriendly to the environment. The project proposes a new advantageous methods, which offer an opportunity to avoid the drawbacks of classical processes. The research results will be important to major European solar electricity programmes.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235272","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
