{"id":"100616","title":"Academia-Industry Pathway to Quick Linux","abstractText":"'The Academia-Industry Pathway, Path2QuickLinux, develops knowledge and transforms practice to accelerate progress toward a European information society (i2010). Path2QuickLinux is a partnership and pathway between Cran (UK) and EXAGroup (Spain), based on a common research project and aiming to increase skills exchange between the two sectors. Cran is the technology originator and provider. An SME, EXAGroup, will contribute to the richness and diversity of the applications and implementations that it will facilitate. In the Path2QuickLinux project, we will implement NFSï¿½s alternative protocols (accelerated NFS or a-NFS) by incorporating the developed parallel-streamed g-Jet engine to accelerate the file sharing traffic. With the accelerated and secure a-NFS that remain fully compatible with the existing IT infrastructures, computer users can open and share remote files (such as vi, Emacs, MySQL, OpenOffice Writer/Impress/Calc, MPlayer, Firefox and Google Earth) on the Internet without having to install new software, upgrade to any new platform or change the way they work. Path2QuickLinux is believed to meet the immediate needs and is positioned to adapt to the needs of i2010 through the minor versioning of the existing data communication protocols. The resulting software will be strengthening the competitiveness of the EC-led software worldwide. The introduction of selected results from the Path2QuickLinux Project to University BSc/MSc curricula and professional training courses will also prepare the next generation of skilled scientist/engineers in EU ensuring continuity after the funding period is over.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"218151","fundValue":"1000962","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
