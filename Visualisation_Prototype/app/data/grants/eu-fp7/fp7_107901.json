{"id":"107901","title":"Nostalgia for the future: transnational belonging as a socio-cultural resource in Europe�s eastern peripheries","abstractText":"'Since the collapse of the Iron Curtain, nostalgia communities along Europe's eastern peripheries have been able to re-assert their transnational belonging in personally rewarding and socially beneficial ways. Through their homeland associations, private networks and NGOs, they have participated in collaborative cross-border activities in a range of sectors, including humanitarian aid, public health, environmental protection, tourism, heritage and arts. These activities point to a gradual, yet significant cultural shift within the traditionally backward-looking social groups, until recently primarily concerned with demanding justice for past injuries. Drawing on disciplines including cultural anthropology, history, human, cultural and political geography, �NostalgiaFuture� will map, document and contextually explain the involvement of two nostalgia communities - the Finns from ceded Karelia, and the Italians from Istria, Venezia-Giulia and parts of Dalmatia - in grassroots cross-border encounters and cooperative initiatives over the last two decades. In doing so, it will also develop greater understanding of the way heritage - both tangible and intangible - has the potential of either contributing to, or hindering the development of a culture of tolerance necessary for further cross-border integration. Findings from the two case studies will be compared and contrasted, generating insights that would not be possible if these areas were investigated separately. With Finland currently making headway in intensifying cultural exchanges with Russia, and Croatia set to join the EU in 2013, the project captures a moment in the history of European borderlands, when significant changes are on the horizon. The project will establish high quality international research links between Australia and select European and regional universities. Cross-institutional collaborative research, graduate student exchanges and long-term mentoring will continue beyond the life of the project.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"330813","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
