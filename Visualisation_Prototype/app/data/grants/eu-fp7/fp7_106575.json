{"id":"106575","title":"Kinetic Inductance Detectors ï¿½ a New Imaging Technology for Observations In and From Space","abstractText":"'We propose to develop advanced imaging arrays of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) for space-based observations at mm-far-infrared (mm-FIR) wavelengths. This development addresses the FP7 topic SPA.2012.2.2-01: Key technologies enabling observations in and from space.\nFuture space science and earth observation missions are limited by the availability of imaging detector array technology for the mm-FIR wavelength range (3 mm to 30 ?m). For the wavelength range 28-45 ?m there is currently no high performance technology with space heritage. For longer wavelengths, 45-2000 ?m there is European expertise in a range of detector technologies, including photoconductors, bolometers, and transition edge superconducting (TES) detectors. However these technologies present significant fabrication difficulties, and lead to a high degree of complexity of system integration and readout electronics for the large format arrays demanded by the next generation of astronomical and Earth observing missions such as FIRI, SPICA, CoRE and Millimetron.\nThe KID is a relatively new and potentially game-changing superconducting detector technology which can provide photon noise limited sensitivity over the entire mm-FIR wavelength range. KIDs are extremely simple both to fabricate and to integrate. Crucially, they can be read out with a high multiplexing ratio which dramatically reduces the complexity of cryogenic interconnections, cabling and electronics enabling larger format arrays than ever before. The reduction in complexity at the cryogenic level in contrast with other ultra-sensitive cryogenic detectors is extremely attractive and enables a dramatic increase in mapping speed for broad band imaging as well as novel applications in spectropolarimetry and hyperspectral imaging.\nThis proposal draws together some of the leading European institutes with experience and expertise in FIR detector technology and includes key members who have made the most significant recent advances in the field'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"313320","fundValue":"2639533.8","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
