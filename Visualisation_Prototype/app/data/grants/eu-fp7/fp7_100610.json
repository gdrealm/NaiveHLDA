{"id":"100610","title":"Development of Ultra Soft Copper Conductors for Crystalline Silicon Solar Photovoltaic Applications","abstractText":"'In the relentless drive for cost-competitive Renewable Energies, progressive reductions in the cost of manufacture of Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic cells are being compromised by damage caused to the cells by the thermal strain at the interface between the increasingly thinner silicon wafers used and the soldered copper conductor. The SolarSoft project aims to solve this problem by developing a novel high purity copper conductor possessing a uniquely low proof stress, thus enabling a substantial contribution to be made towards Solar PV Technology achieving cost parity with conventional power generation.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"286943","fundValue":"1357463.56","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
