{"id":"98033","title":"INNOVATIVE DESIGN OF HUBS AND PROPELLERS","abstractText":"'The IDOHAP proposal is for the detailed design of two CROR models to be installed on an existing wind tunnel test rig. Each model to comprise a pair of hubs and associated propeller blades. This work will be achieved using design engineers experienced in the design of complex wind tunnel models and associated test rigs, using the Catia V5 (V16) software package. These model designs are required for CROR tests planned in the coming years using an existing CROR powered wind tunnel test rig. The IDOHAP proposal is fully compliant with the topic Call Text.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255782","fundValue":"180000","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
