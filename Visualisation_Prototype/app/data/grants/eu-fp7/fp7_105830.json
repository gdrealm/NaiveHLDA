{"id":"105830","title":"Social Innovations Promoting Active and Healthy Ageing","abstractText":"'INNOVAGE is an ambitious project is dedicated to developing and testing, as well as surveying and cataloguing, social innovations that will have a solid impact on improving the quality of life and well-being of older people.  In particular the project aims to make a major contribution to the EU goal of extending healthy life years.  It has four clear and achievable objectives that are intended to create a new paradigm in this field.  These objectives directly address the present major barriers to innovation and to the achievement of the extension of healthy life years across the EU.  The expert multi-disciplinary team is based on a highly successful existing collaboration, which will enable fast take-off and the guarantee of excellent team work.  The work packages are designed to achieve impact in the public, private and third sectors.  The project is built on the closest possible partnership with end users (or stakeholders) including older people themselves.  It will deliver not only four new major social innovations in different EU countries (services models and products) but also a new European platform to promote knowledge exchange about and the sustainable implementation of social innovations to promote well-being in later life.'","grantUrl":"http://www.eurocarers.org","grantId":"306058","fundValue":"3720773.4","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
