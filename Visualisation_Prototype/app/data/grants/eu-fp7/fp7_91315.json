{"id":"91315","title":"Integrating Nanomaterials in Formulations","abstractText":"'A coordination action is proposed to reinforce the international dimension of EU research on nanomaterials in formulations in the Asia-Pasific region. Three mechanism will be implemented to reach the widest possible audience in the appropriate formats that are convenient to the different stakeholders: (1) yearly major events, that will introduce a new concept to scientific gatherings and a departure from conventional meetings, (2) a researchers exchange program to seed new collaborations, facilitate joint projects and the realisation of future coordinated calls, and (3) the creation of a website devoted to nanomaterials in formulations, that will include up to date and reliable information on the newest research developments, funding opportunities, regulations, events and links to other nanotechnology initiatives.'","grantUrl":"http://www.nanoformulation.eu","grantId":"233533","fundValue":"2042792.12","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
