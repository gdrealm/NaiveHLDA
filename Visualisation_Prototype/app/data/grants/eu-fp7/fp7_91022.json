{"id":"91022","title":"ESConet Trainers","abstractText":"'This proposal by ESConet Trainers is to train high-level EC-funded scientists in science communication skills, so that they can interact effectively and confidently with the mass media, so that they can make use of the internet and its capabilities, and so that they can engage European citizens in dialogue about science in society issues. Our team combines the talents of media and policy professionals, with a solid basis in science communication training. It builds on highly successful science communication training workshops and modules developed under FP6, and raises the European dimension in such training.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"230456","fundValue":"609778","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
