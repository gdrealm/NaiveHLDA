{"id":"98880","title":"Security in transition: An Interdisciplinary Investigation into the Security gap","abstractText":"'The twentieth century model of security, based on the rule of law and policing within nation-states and conventional military forces externally is no longer easily applicable to twenty first century global security risks. The security gap refers to the fact that millions of people live in situations of intolerable insecurity as a consequence of armed conflict, organised crime, terrorism, financial crisis, poverty and inequality, environmental degradation, vulnerability to natural disasters to name but some of these risks and yet current public security provision is not designed to address these sources of insecurity and, indeed, as recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown, sometimes makes them worse.\nSecurity in transitionï¿½ is about investigating and identifying the nature of the security gap and tracking the ways in which public and private agents are adapting.
