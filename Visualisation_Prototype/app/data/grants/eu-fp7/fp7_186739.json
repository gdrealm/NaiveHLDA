{"id":"186739","title":"A Quantum RAM Using Superconducting Circuits and Donors in Silicon","abstractText":"'Quantum computers are devices poised to revolutionise aspects of society from fundamental science and medical research to national security. Superconducting circuits hold great promise for the development of large-scale quantum computers. However, superconducting processors currently lack a suitable memory element for the long-term storage of quantum information. The electron and nuclear spins of dopant atoms in silicon could provide a potential solution. Silicon can be isotopically purified in a nuclear spin-zero form, allowing exceptionally long spin coherence times. This research seeks to develop a quantum random access memory (quRAM), by storing the states from superconducting quantum bits in donor spins inside an isotopically enriched silicon chip.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"630070","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
