{"id":"97852","title":"New Frontiers in Protein-based Nanomaterials","abstractText":"'We propose to undertake an ambitious 5 year interdisciplinary programme that introduces a fundamentally new paradigm in protein-based nanomaterials research. The new approach involves two main project themes based respectively on fundamental studies on the structure, function and properties of molten protein polymer surfactant nanoconstructs, and the development of these novel nanomaterials as smart fluids, biotechnological devices and health care products. This proposal represents a new and adventurous area of work for the PI, and will allow unprecedented access to a novel class of nanomaterials with controllable architectures, unique physical properties and inherent biological functionality. In so doing, the work will open up promising new avenues of bionanomaterials research and offer significant advantages over current methods for producing protein-based nanomaterials at extremely high concentration and dosage. In general we expect the research programme to pioneer new frontiers in fundamental research and generate significant economic and societal impact as nanomaterials become increasingly integrated into medical and technological products, and new commercial markets based on nanoscience are discovered.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"266765","fundValue":"2168862","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
