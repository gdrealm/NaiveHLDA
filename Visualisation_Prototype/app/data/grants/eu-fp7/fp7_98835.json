{"id":"98835","title":"INOvative Energy MANagement System for Cargo SHIP","abstractText":"'The global optimization of energy systems aboard future and currently operating cargos is crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emission in a substantial and cost effective way. It is also of major economic interest in the merchant marine sector.\nA holistic approach considering the overall production and management of energy aboard ships (including propulsion systems and energy output optimization) is the most promising approach to accelerate the adoption of low emission-higher energy efficiency cargo ships.\nTaking this consideration into account and based on the array of innovative and renewable sources of energy, the INOMANS�HIP concept aims at proposing a break-through energy management system aboard ships based on a preferred DC network integrating all potential sources of energy. A Life-Cycle Analysis study will be performed. The proposed energy management system will gather data in real time and will be able to anticipate and optimize energy needs for each operational configuration of the ship considering risk levels while systematically favouring less polluting and cost effective sources of energy. The INOMANS�HIP project will therefore contribute to reducing green house gas (GHG) emissions and pollution as a whole (SOx, NOx, Noise). It will foster European competitiveness by providing an innovative global advantage to both European equipment manufacturers and shipyards.\nThe INOMANS�HIP European consortium represents a well balanced combination of European industrial partners, institutions and organisations. It comprises world-class industrial leaders in their fields of activity, leading research organisations and institutions, experts of the world maritime sector and specialists of project management. This unique mix of expertise and knowledge will allow INOMANS�HIP to respond perfectly to the SST.2010.1.1-2. topic of the present call through the successful development of an innovative energy management system optimizing energy efficiency of cargo ships.'","grantUrl":"http://inomanship.eu","grantId":"266082","fundValue":"3341187","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
