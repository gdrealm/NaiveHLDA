{"id":"87542","title":"\"Standards for Designing Out Crime in Europe: Roadmap for Standardisation, Implementation and Evaluation of the European Pre-Norm ENV14383-2\"","abstractText":"'This research project will examine the development, content, application and implementation of the European Pre-Norm ENV14383-2 on 'Prevention of crime � Urban planning and building design � Part 2: Urban planning'. It aims at a thorough analysis of the facilitating and impeding factors for implementation in a range of countries and sites in Europe. It is the overarching objective of the study firmly to establish Europe as a region leading in the development, refinement and implementation of crime prevention through urban planning and building design. The diversity of urban culture, urban policies and crime problems across Europe promise to provide blueprints and good practice for a wide range of countries across the globe, thus taking a leadership in the development and implementation of crime prevention through urban design. The research will provide tools for a crucial period for the implementation and standardization of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design. These implementation tools will be derived from and firmly based in multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of urban studies, criminology, political science and architecture, and will be complemented by a data base for research and evaluation. They include 1) a tool for the critical assessment of different perspectives, ideologies and positions. This tool will help security project designers to identify and solve problems of common understandings, shared objectives and disagreement at an early stage.  2) A tool for designing the process and involvement of various partners. This tool will be based on agent models and identify network and collaboration structures that are successful.  3) A tool for using best practice in the implementation of CPTED projects.  The project will make a major contribution to European security policies. It will make Europe and its cities safer places for citizens and visitors alike, places for leisure and entertainment industries, and business generally.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219782","fundValue":"161225.98","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
