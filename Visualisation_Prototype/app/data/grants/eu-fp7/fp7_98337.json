{"id":"98337","title":"A Novel Approach to the Fabrication of Nanoscale Light Emitting Diodes","abstractText":"'Research in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology will drive the scientific and technological development of future years with revolutionary perspectives in many aspects of our society. Future large-volume applications will require fast and flexible methods to fabricate and miniaturize electronic and photonic components. This proposal will develop a novel approach to the fabrication of nanoscale light emitting diode (LED) and single quantum dot (QD) LED devices that exploits the laser-driven diffusion of hydrogen in III-V and III-N-V semiconductors. This project will impact a wide community. In fact, nano-LEDs have potential for several applications and interdisciplinary research, i.e. intra- and inter-chip communication, ultrahigh-density information storage, bio-imaging, etc.; also, single-QD LEDs will provide opportunities for fundamental studies of low dimensional structures and their exploitation in nanophotonics. Therefore, this programme of research is well suited to tackle important challenges faced by our society and to generate the knowledge needed to ensure the leadership of Europe in a rapidly growing field.\n\nThis fellowship will offer Dr. G. Pettinari opportunities to acquire complementary competencies and skills and to reach a position of professional maturity and independence. The fellow will work in an internationally leading institution, The University of Nottingham, with a strong tradition in condensed matter and semiconductors research. The host institution will benefit from hosting a promising researcher whose innovative proposal and previous experience in hydrogen studies and III-N-V alloys will complement an existing research activity at Nottingham on the fabrication of nanoscale LEDs. Of particular interest is the proposal of using hydrogen in the miniaturization of photonic components. This approach has the potential to be implemented in different semiconductor systems and devices, thus opening realistic prospects for a wide range of applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"272612","fundValue":"199549.6","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
