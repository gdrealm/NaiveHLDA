{"id":"89333","title":"Sustaining research momentum over the coming decades: mentoring the next generation of researchers for tuberculosis","abstractText":"'Tuberculosis is an international public health crisis of catastrophic proportions. The relative lack of TB research and funded investigators over the last several decades has been acknowledged by the The Stop TB Partnership and Global Stop TB Plan. In order to sustain research momentum over the next few decades suitably qualified investigators, who are the next generation of TB researchers, particularly from developing countries, will have to be nurtured and supported. This proposal seeks to, by building on existing research and capacity development programmes, create a scientific fellowship programme focussed on activities encompassing poverty-related disease i.e. tuberculosis (TB). It seeks further to facilitate career progression of developing country clinical-scientists through a programme offering scientific training and a network of mentors.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"223340","fundValue":"1121393.29","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
