{"id":"98925","title":"\"Perturbations, stability and Hawking radiation of higher dimensional black holes\"","abstractText":"'We propose a detailed investigation of the gravitational stability and emission\nof Hawking radiation of diverse higher-dimensional black hole solutions motivated\nby string theory and higher dimensional gravity.\nThe applicant aims at the complete classification of higher-dimensional black holes\naccording to their gravitational stability. In addition, we plan to make further investigation of possible correlations\nbetween gravitational and thermodynamical instabilities in such systems, and, to check if there is a correlation between gravitational instability and existence of closed time-like geodesics.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"273897","fundValue":"202892.8","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
