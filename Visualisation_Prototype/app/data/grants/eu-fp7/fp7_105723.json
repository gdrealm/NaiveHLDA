{"id":"105723","title":"Application of the innovative data fusion based non-invasive approach for management of the diabetes mellitus","abstractText":"'Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a high serum glucose level and by disturbances of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.\nDiabetics had a greater prevalence of skin manifestations in type 2 than type 1, and as the duration of the DM increased, the likelihood of developing skin manifestations also increased.\nEarly referral to the dermatologist may help to detect complications of the skin in diabetes at an early stage and may prevent disability caused by these complications.\n\nThe aim of the project is to develop a more accurate early-stage detection, diagnosis and monitoring that will reduce the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus. The created system using appropriate information and communication technologies would provide more convenient intercommunication among physicians, by performing consultations, information and knowledge exchange. Therefore, the time between the right diagnosis and effective treatment will be minimized and the probability of negative consequences to the patient�s health (limb amputations, or even death) will be avoided. The novel �smart� diagnostic technique and portable equipment which will be developed in the project is indented to be used by offices of general practitioners and local primary care clinics. Also, the low weight and mobile equipment will be suitable to be used for patient homecare as well. The capabilities of the modern telemedicine will give the possibilities to use the outcome of the project especially in rural or underserved areas performing tele-consultations with tertiary level specialist physicians. As a result of this project, scientific knowledge and competency of SME�s will be elevated, knowledge exchange process will be developed and possibilities for new market development will appear. It will encourage the efforts of leading SME�s from the field of medical service and R&D towards the research and innovation.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"314913","fundValue":"1447826.02","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
