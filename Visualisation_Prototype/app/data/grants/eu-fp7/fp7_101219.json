{"id":"101219","title":"Linking European and Chinese Research Infrastructures and Communities","abstractText":"Between 2007 and 2010 the ORIENT project provided the first high capacity link between GEANT and China with FP6 funding support and successfully enabled many innovative EU-China research and application collaborations to flourish.  ORIENTplus addresses Section 3.4 domain (f) of the call ('International cooperation in Research and Education Networking addressing (i) the extension of the European infrastructure to China ')  to maintain and further develop infrastructure between GEANT and China that is open for use by all European and Chinese researchers. ORIENTplus requires EC funding support to increase the capacity and offer point to point services on the link during the project term.nnIn ORIENT China was formally represented by CERNET; this time CERNET and CSTNET are equal partners, reflecting the strengthening research network relationships between the regions and offering scope for coordinated operational and user support.nnThe ORIENTplus proposal has been constructed taking account of the deep expertise of both the European and Chinese partners and building on the experiences of working together in ORIENT.  CERNET and CSTNET, are each committing 1M Euro towards the link costs with CERNET's funding already maintaining the link during first 6 months of 2011.  The EC and European NRENs will match the Chinese commitment over the period to the end of ORIENTplus to reflect the high mutual benefit to China and Europe, with 0.94M of the funds provided by the EC .nThe focus of the proposal is to support the infrastructure link.  In addition the proposal sets out unfunded supporting activities to optimise the performance of the link, promote the use of the link, and provide users with technical support.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"283334","fundValue":"4455580","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
