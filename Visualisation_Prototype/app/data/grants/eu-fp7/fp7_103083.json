{"id":"103083","title":"Life-like visual information processing for robust collision detection","abstractText":"'To be able to detected collision efficiently is of vital importance for the survival of animals that are migrating at speed, especially for those flying in dense swarms like locusts. Vision plays a critical role in collision detection for most animal species in a dynamic world. It is expected that in future, many human made machines, such like ground vehicles, mobile robots, and unmanned aerial vehicles, should all be able to detect and avoid collisions effectively as animals do. The challenge to achieve this is huge. Biological visual neural systems provide ideal models to achieve this goal.\n\nLIVCODE consortium focuses on robust solutions for visual based collision detection. Taking the inspiration from biological visual systems, the consortium will bring neurobiologists, neural system modellers, chip designers, and robotic researchers together and complement each othersï¿½ research strengths via staff secondments, and jointly organised seminars and workshops. The consortium will investigate robust solutions for collision detection in the real world, through neural system modelling, neural model integration, chip realization and application, in order to build strong connections between the European institutions and partner institutions in a fast growing economy.\n\nSix work packages (WPs) are designed to achieve the objectives of the project:\n\nWP0: Project management,\nWP1: Biological plausible visual neural system modelling,\nWP2: Multiple visual neural systems integration,\nWP3: VLSI neural vision chip design,\nWP4: Neural vision systems for mobile robots and unmanned aerial systems, and\nWP5: Dissemination, exploitation, business model.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"295151","fundValue":"728500","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
