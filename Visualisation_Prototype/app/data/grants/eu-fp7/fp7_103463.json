{"id":"103463","title":"Adespota Papyracea Hexametrica Graeca","abstractText":"'The project consists of an edition of the unidentified hexametrical texts on papyri and parchments from Oxyrhynchus, Egypt. The corpus will include 77 papyri, 49 of which are preserved at the Oxyrhynchus Collection in Oxford. New readings will be provided through a direct inspection of the original papyri housed in the Sackler and the Bodleian Libraries in Oxford, in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, as well as 13 other European and American institutions. A revision of the texts will suggest different interpretations of the fragmentary compositions. The candidate will also search for unpublished hexametric material within the Oxyrhynchus Collection in Oxford under the guidance of his mentor, Dr. Dirk Obbink. A complete transcription of only partially transcribed papyri will be provided; 51 of the 77 items, still lacking translation, will be translated and analyzed; 12 previously unavailable photographical reproductions will be included; bibliological and paleographical information on single items will be provided. The draft intended for publication will include: an introductory chapter on the hexametrical compositions copied in the city of Oxyrhynchus during the Roman and Late Antique times; commented editions of the texts; analytical indexes (index of Greek words, indexes of historical and mythological names) and concordances with previous corpora.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"302942","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-09-19","fundEnd":"2015-09-18","dataset":"fp7"}
