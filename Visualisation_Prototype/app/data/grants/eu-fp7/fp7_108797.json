{"id":"108797","title":"The functional role of feedback signals to mouse primary visual cortex","abstractText":"Vision is fundamentally important in our daily lives, and 25% of our brain is devoted to it. Information from the eyes is quickly relayed to the primary visual cortex (V1), where neurons detect elementary features of images such as the orientation of edges within small regions of visual space. However, V1 neurons are not governed by feedforward input alone, but also receive extensive feedback projections from downstream visual areas. Despite their importance in vision, the function of feedback signals has remained elusive, although multiple roles have been suggested. Feedback could account for contextual modulation of neural responses or explain attentional enhancement of responses to behaviourally relevant stimuli. Direct evidence supporting these roles is lacking, largely due to methodological limitations. We propose to take advantage of new imaging and genetic methods that allow for the first time direct measurement of feedback signals. We will inject genetically encoded calcium indicators in secondary visual areas in mice to label axons and synaptic boutons of neurons projecting back to V1. We will then measure the activity of feedback projections with synapse resolution using high-speed two-photon calcium imaging during different behavioural states to establish the functional role of feedback. Specifically, we will determine what information is fed back to V1 by identified axons from functionally defined visual areas during passive and active viewing, during locomotion or navigation. Our results will provide fundamental information about the functional role of feedback signals during visual processing, and will be of great interest to a wide neuroscience audience, including neurophysiologists, psychologists, and computational scientists. Understanding the mechanisms by which feedback shapes responses to sensory input, will benefit our understanding of disorders with deficiencies in the filtering of incoming sensory information such as ADHD and schizophrenia.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"332141","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
