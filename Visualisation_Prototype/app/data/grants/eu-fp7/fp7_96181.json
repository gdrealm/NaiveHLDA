{"id":"96181","title":"Development of Novel X-ray Inspection System for Fast Automated Detection of Counterfeit PCB Components","abstractText":"'Currently, electronics manufacturers do not check all PCB components at goods inwards. Some manufacturers make random checks on single components from batches of component lots. However, components especially the surface mount type are typically supplied on tape reels to assist with component feed for automatic component placement. The manufacturer cannot check all the components. Typically, a check includes visual inspection and in circuit testing. However, performing these checks is disadvantageous for two main reasons. Firstly, the tests can be time consuming and secondly it requires the component to be removed from the packaging or reel invalidating any guarantee to a claim should a counterfeit component be found. Currently, no automatic methods exist to speedily check each single component. In addition the cost of modern X-ray inspection systems prohibits their use for smaller manufacturing concerns. ChipCheck proposal is for the development of a novel X-ray inspection system for fast automated detection of counterfeit PCB components. The aim of such a development is to address the above issues. The system will be developed so that is capable of inspecting PCB components on tape reels and other component feeding mechanisms. In addition separate PCB components will also be examinable with the developed system. Through the selected combination of SME partners involved in the consortium, a new design uniquely combining lower cost off-the-shelf components used from different industries (Industrial NDT, Medical and dentistry) will be developed to enable production of a prototype of particular suitability for goods inward inspection.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"262212","fundValue":"1499852","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
