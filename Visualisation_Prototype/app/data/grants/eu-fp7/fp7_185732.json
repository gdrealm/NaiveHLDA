{"id":"185732","title":"Games Research Opportunities and Research Excellence in Cornwall and the EU","abstractText":"'The GRO project provides for the establishment of an ERA Chair in Digital Games Technology who would lead Research and Innovation in Digital Games at Falmouth University. This is a market which is experiencing exponential growth globally, and one in which Europe could take the lead. As a catalyst for regional development, high level research in this area also has the potential to make a significant contribution to the �Grand Challenges� facing society, such as health and wellbeing and carbon reduction, as Game Technology and Thinking has applications which are potentially significant to the wider economy and society. The appointment of an ERA Chair in Digital Games Technology and an associated research team would also be a catalyst for building a sustainable games sector in Cornwall.  Research excellence in this field would allow us to participate in, and potentially lead Research and Innovation across the commercial, cultural and social sectors.  The ERA Chair will actively contribute to the definition and implementation of Smart Specialisation Strategies at a regional, national and European level.  This will facilitate the integration between research investment and Cohesion Funding, accelerating regional development. Building on this research excellence, Falmouth University will establish a European Institute for Digital Games Design and Technology.  In this the University will create a world-class and sustainable hub for Digital Games research.  Centred in a rural, economically-deprived region, the Institute will build on the University�s engagement with the creative industries and other sectors where games concepts and technologies can create significant benefit.  In this way, we aim to create the conditions required for innovation and high growth business performance in the region and in other European regional economies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"621403","fundValue":"2938487.2","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2019-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
