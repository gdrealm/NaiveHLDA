{"id":"106666","title":"BioEnergy Sustaining the Future : Joint Strategic Planning and Programming to Enable the Implementation of Bioenergy Demonstrations","abstractText":"'BESTF will bring together a number of national and transnational initiatives in the field of bioenergy. These include; research, development, demonstration and financial instruments. They have been stimulated and driven by both public and private participants. By integrating these actions, risk will be minimised and confidence will be provided to private investors in support of bringing bioenergy closer to market and in Europe. This project aims to kick-start large scale investment in close-to-market implementation of bioenergy thereby helping to achieve the key objectives of the European Industrial Bioenergy Initiative (EIBI) Implementation Plan: �To enable commercial availability of advanced bioenergy at large scale by 2020, aiming at production costs allowing competitiveness with fossil fuels at the prevailing economic and regulatory market conditions, and advanced biofuels covering up to 4% of transportation energy needs by 2020. To strengthen EU technology leadership for renewable transport fuels, serving the fastest growing area of transport fuels in the world�. This project will closely address the requirements of Topic ENERGY.2012.10.1.1: ERA-NET_Plus � Bioenergy Demonstrations of the European Industrial Bioenergy Initiative, aligning it to the wider strategic European requirements: to increase the security of energy supply and to increase the sustainability of energy supply.\n\nBESTF will implement a single collaborative funding call that will support projects focused on the generation of bioenergy: energy generated directly or indirectly from sustainable biomass. These projects will have been based on prior high quality research undertaken at a European, national or industrial level but require a final �non-economic step to demonstrate the performance and reliability of all critical steps in a value chain so that the first commercial unit can be designed and performance guaranteed from the outcome of the demo unit�.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"321477","fundValue":"10112529.27","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
