{"id":"109524","title":"Quality-of-Experience Improvement for Mobile Multimedia across Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","abstractText":"'With the rapid innovation in sophisticated wireless communication technologies, the past years have witnessed a dramatic growth of content-rich and resource-hungry mobile multimedia applications that demand high Quality-of-Experience (QoE). The overall objective of this project is to bring together a highly qualified group of researchers from both European countries and China to explore the strategies for QoE improvement of mobile multimedia across heterogeneous wireless networks. Built upon the solid ground of cooperation and knowledge transfer between the partners, this project will be unique in its advocate of the seamless integration of network-aware adaptive multimedia processing at the application layer and multimedia-driven heterogeneous wireless networking at the transmission layer. The optimal interaction through a cross-layer design plays an important role in efficient utilization of scarce wireless communication resources to deliver mobile multimedia and improve the users perceived QoE with the aim of creating a new era where multimedia service providers, network operators and end users all benefit.\nThe techniques to be developed will fill important gaps in the fundamental understanding of QoE-improved wireless multimedia communications and provide the theoretical underpinning for system design and algorithm implementation. By strengthening the mobility of European and Chinese researchers, the project will bring new blood and ideas into the academic research of both regions. Moreover, this staff exchange programme will help to cross-fertilise and exchange ideas in order to accelerate the development and knowledge transfer of wireless multimedia networks, set up future joint research projects, and build up long-term world-class collaboration. This project will contribute to the development and maintenance of the European research communityï¿½s leading international profile and global influence in the fields of wireless networking and multimedia processing.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612652","fundValue":"378000","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2018-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
