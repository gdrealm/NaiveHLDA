{"id":"86777","title":"Nasal Pandemic Influenza Vaccine","abstractText":"'The project is being undertaken in response to the need to develop an effective, user friendly, heat stable vaccine to control the highly pathogenic form of avian influenza virus (H5 and H7 subtypes) which has the potential to cause another global influenza pandemic. The overall objective of this programme is to develop a nasal avian influenza vaccine using ChiSys� (chitosan), which is a chitosan-based technology of Archimedes Development Ltd.. Chitosan has already been tested with several nasally delivered antigens pre-clinically and clinically with excellent results. The most effective way of controlling a pandemic flu would be via the nasal route as this route is advantaged to generate both systemic and mucosal antibodies; the latter allowing virus control at its point of entry. In comparison the currently used injection route cannot achieve the mucosal response. Intranasal vaccination has further advantages: avoids the need for injection and safe disposal of syringes, eliminate the risk of HIV transmission through re-use or accidental contact with body fluids, have greater public compliance and well-suited to rapid mass global vaccination programmes. The scientific objectives of the project are: induce both systemic and mucosal immunity, evaluation of efficacy and toxicity in preclinical studies, evaluation of efficacy and safety profile in humans, provide a substantial level of cross-immunity against a drifted strains of H5 or H7, effective at low dose to meet the global demands from limited vaccine stockpiles, thermal stability so as to avoid refrigeration for storage and transportation and user friendly vaccine applicator. The consortium members have extensive experience in their specialist fields which would enable the success of this project. ChiSys� would be an excellent candidate for developing an intranasal pandemic influenza vaccine to provide a quantum leap in successfully combating pandemic influenza globally.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"202083","fundValue":"4971768.13","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
