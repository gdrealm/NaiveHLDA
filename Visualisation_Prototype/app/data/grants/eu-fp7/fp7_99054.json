{"id":"99054","title":"Systemic signalling in plant � aphid interactions","abstractText":"'While the effects of aphid feeding on leaves are well documented, the influence that the presence of aphids has on distant leaves that are not directly subject to attack is poorly documented and associated systemic signalling pathways are not understood. This proposal therefore seeks to characterize systemic signalling pathways that are specific to aphid feeding in Arabidopsis thaliana and potato to determine how they alter aphid fecundity. Local and systemic responses in gene transcription will be compared, with specific focus on reduction-oxidation (redox) signalling networks and responses. Arabidopsis mutants with defects in the accumulation of the antioxidant, vitamin C and in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and redox processes, which have alterations in defence to pathogens will be characterized to assess the roles of antioxidants and antioxidants in the plant � aphid interaction. Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is the third most important food crop in the world but the value of the crop can be greatly decreased as a result of aphid-borne viruses.\n\nThe aim of the fellowship is to reorient the career path of an experienced researcher in order to broaden her career prospects in line with the needs of the future knowledge-based bio-economy of Europe'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"276206","fundValue":"271136.8","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
