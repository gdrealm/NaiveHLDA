{"id":"186989","title":"FREVUE\nVALIDATING FREIGHT ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN URBAN EUROPE","abstractText":"Eight of Europe�s largest cities, will demonstrate that electric vehicles operating �last mile� freight movements in urban centres can offer significant and achievable decarbonisation of the European transport system. Demonstrators will be deployed in Amsterdam, Lisbon, London, Madrid, Milan, Oslo, Rotterdam and Stockholm. The demonstrators have been designed to ensure FREVUE covers the breadth of urban freight applications which occur across Europe.\nBy exposing 127 electric vehicles to the day to day rigours of the urban logistics environment, the project will prove that the current generation of large electric vans and trucks can offer a viable alternative to diesel vehicles - particularly when combined with state of the art urban logistics applications, innovative logistics management software, and with well designed local policy.\n\nThe project will demonstrate solutions to the barriers currently inhibiting uptake of EVs in the sector and includes leading European researchers who will design and then implement a common pan-European assessment framework to understand the impacts of these solutions. This will ensure that the project creates a valuable European evidence base on the role of EVs in urban logistics. Partners will produce a detailed White Paper on the feasibility of EV rollout in logistics across Europe, with chapters containing best practice advice on EV in logistics for: policy makers, logistics operators, their customers and companies developing technology to support the sector.\n\nThe final overarching objective is to encourage the exploitation of these best practice results through a targeted dissemination campaign aimed at decision makers in the logistics industry. To complement this, FREVUE will also create a network of �Phase 2� cities to directly share the lessons learned from the demonstrators. These cities are expected to be the first cities to expand the successful concepts developed by FR-EVUE.\n","grantUrl":"","grantId":"321622","fundValue":"14250789.34","fundStart":"2013-03-15","fundEnd":"2017-09-14","dataset":"fp7"}
