{"id":"93627","title":"Bridging Research in Ageing and ICT Development","abstractText":"Bridging Research in Ageing and ICT Development (BRAID) will develop a comprehensive RTD roadmap for active ageing by consolidating existing roadmaps and by describing and launching a stakeholder co-ordination and consultation mechanism.  It will characterise key research challenges and produce a vision for a comprehensive approach in supporting the well-being and socio-economic integration of increasing numbers of senior citizens in Europe.nnBRAID responds to the apparent need to consolidate the various existing perspectives, plans, roadmaps and research and to coordinate effectively the stakeholders in ICT and Ageing. It will  utilise knowledge repositories and stakeholder networks to create a self-sustaining, dynamic strategic mechanism for overcoming the fragmentation that has plagued e-inclusion and for improving co-ordination and collaboration among stakeholders.  BRAID has three main objectives, to:nn�tCreate a dynamic ICT and Ageing roadmap that addresses older people&apos;s needs not otherwise well met, that identifies and benefits from best practices in the EU and elsewhere and that analyses current and potential gaps in knowledge and execution;n�tInstantiate a strategic research agenda that tracks and builds upon existing, emerging and disruptive technologies and that responds to the changing socio-economic conditions of stakeholders;n�tExpand the BRAID networks of contacts to build a self-sustaining co-ordination mechanism which is viral and ubiquitous and reaches out across the heterogeneity of stakeholders.nnBRAID will build upon  the experience  and  knowledge developed in previous projects while taking account of e-inclusion efforts in the EU27 as well as Australia, Canada, Japan and the US.  The team is a unique group made up by  representatives of the four FP7 ICT and Ageing roadmap consortia (AALIANCE, CAPSIL, ePAL, SENIOR) and gathers together EU excellence in the field of ICT and Ageing from the main, relevant perspectives.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"248485","fundValue":"1200411","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
