{"id":"98646","title":"Globally Recoverable and Eco-friendly E-equipment Network with Distributed Information Service Management","abstractText":"'The establishment of closer international cooperation to share and develop research on globally sustainable Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) management is timely and significant. This GREENet project is aimed at teaming up multi-disciplinary research teams from the EU and China to enhance the knowledge base and achieve research synergies as integrated technical solutions in the relevant areas. The objectives of the project include:\n-\tTo establish an active international community and effective communication channel for the teams to cooperate on globally sustainable WEEE management\n-\tTo integrate the complementary expertise of the teams to devise ICT (Information and Communication Technologies)-based strategies, solutions and standards to address the multi-faceted requirements of WEEE management\n-\tTo leverage the geographical characteristics of the teams to evaluate and disseminate the research outcomes in different regions of the EU and China\n\n4 European Universities and 4 Chinese Universities/Research Institute will synchronise their research to propose integrated technical solutions. The research strengths of the teams are in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) used for designing global WEEE information management platforms, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) applications used for designing dynamic WEEE tracing services, and manufacturing/remanufacturing information systems and strategies used for designing WEEE remanufacturing planning optimisation services. A series of exchanged programs and 2 industrial seminars will be organised for research sharing, integration and evaluation. The long-term target of the project is to maintain an active, open and leading international community to develop the research and international standards, showcase best practices in applications, and promote the technical solutions and standards to industries and governments to achieve sustainable targets.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269122","fundValue":"457800","fundStart":"2011-07-31","fundEnd":"2015-07-30","dataset":"fp7"}
