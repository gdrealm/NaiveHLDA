{"id":"101079","title":"Robust Silicon-Carbide Technology for Aerospace DC-DC Conversion","abstractText":"'The main aim of this project is to develop a silicon-carbide power module for application within a /-270Vdc DC/DC conversion network on-board aircraft. This project will investigate the exact requirements and fix the specifications; it will generate the knowledge and understanding required to design and manufacture efficient and reliable power modules; it will deliver fully qualified modules compliant with the aircraft operational environment. Moreover, the project will assess the potential and the risks associated with silicon-carbide technology for the specific case of avionic applications and will provide a thorough and in-depth analysis of future development needs in order to ensure that the stringent requirements of high reliability applications can be met in a cost effective and competitive way. An important aspect of this project will be the investigation of the capability offered by silicon-carbide for the modularisation of power conversion equipment, a key aspect of exploitation for increased industrial competitiveness.\nThe work involved covers design, manufacturing and qualification. To ensure compliance with the applicable reliability requirements, the design will base on a built-in reliability approach during all stages of the workflow. The outcomes of this project will benefit European competitiveness in the field of power conversion system development for avionic applications and will have significant spin offs to other application domains.\nIt is a 24 month project involving two partners, 3 investigators, 4 researchers and 2 technicians. The total value is �479,309 and the requested total contribution is �303,426.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"271855","fundValue":"479309","fundStart":"2011-04-18","fundEnd":"2013-10-17","dataset":"fp7"}
