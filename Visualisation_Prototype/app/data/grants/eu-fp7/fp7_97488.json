{"id":"97488","title":"Biomolecular Electronics and Electrocatalysis","abstractText":"'The objective of the joint exchange programme BIOMOLECTRONIC (Biomolecular Electronics and Electrocatalysis) is to strengthen existing scientific collaboration between two EU partners and a third country (Argentina) partner in the field of biomolecular electronics and electrocatalysis. The topic of research is the multidisciplinary approach to study strategies of electrode surface modification with redox molecules and redox biomolecules integrated in electronic and electrocatalytic devices with applications in the areas of molecular electronics (molecular transistors), integrated biosensors and electrocatalysis in biofuel cells. The programme encompases the synthesis of novel redox molecular systems, strategies for surface modification, theoretical modelling and use of electrochemistry and surface vibrational spectroscopy (Surface enhanced Raman �SERS- ; Surface enhanced Resonant Raman �SERRS and Polarization Modulation Infrared Reflection Absorption spectroscopy-PM-IRRAS). The exchange programme consists of short visits of four senior researchers in each other partner group to provide a lecture course for students and staff, three 12 month exchanges of postdoctoral fellows with special skills and experience to be complemented in the partners group with their own specific developments, and exchange of six PhD students who will benefit both from the scientific and cultural exchange in the other partners group.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247491","fundValue":"158400","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
