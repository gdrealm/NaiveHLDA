{"id":"192454","title":"Policy into Practice: EURAXESS Researcher Skills for Career Development","abstractText":"'The PIPERS project (Policy into Practice: EURAXESS Researcher Career Skills for Career Development) is led by the British Council along with 5 partners and 15 associated Third Parties from both the EURAXESS Service Network and other academic and non-academic stakeholders from across Europe and Israel.\nIts aim is to support researcher career development. To do so the project will identify and cascade existing good practice and training resources, develop new tools to support proactive management of researcher career paths and provide an efficient and sustainable way of disseminating these across the Network.\nThe objectives of the project will be pursued over a 24 month period. Core activities will include policy dialogue with employer stakeholders and groups representing researchers� interests; dissemination of good policy practice and training resources in researcher career development through the development of an e-platform and the delivery of nine �train the trainer� workshops for researcher career development staff and four demonstration workshops with researchers; and the development and testing of a self-assessment tool for researchers to enable them to be proactive in their professional and career development.\nBy identifying existing best practice and resources from the EURAXESS Service Networks and the wider research community and bringing staff from these institutions together to learn how to best cascade the training, the project will both strengthen interaction between research institutions in the management of research careers and ensure the relevance of the resources.\nResearchers will be able to set personal targets and demonstrate evidence of achievements based on knowledge and behaviours which will help them to navigate often complex research careers, both within academia and industry as well as skills such as information literacy, leadership, interdisciplinary working and public engagement which will help them to maximise the impact of their research.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"643330","fundValue":"610650.07","fundStart":"2014-10-13","fundEnd":"2016-10-12","dataset":"fp7"}
