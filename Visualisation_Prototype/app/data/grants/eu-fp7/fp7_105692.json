{"id":"105692","title":"Sustainable Recycling of Lighting Products","abstractText":"'The RELIGHT project seeks to test and develop novel technologies in the niche application of CFL recycling, to determine a cost effective means of recovering high value materials from the product. There is not only a strong market force from RELIGHT SME participants point of view to achieve cleaner fractions; it is also a requirement of the legislation. It is the view of the participants that to achieve only recycling of lamps to low value outlets is not ambitious, and that the industry should be seeking to recover valuable materials back to a high value use.  These issues are prerequisite for the lamp recycling industry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"314872","fundValue":"1250556.8","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
