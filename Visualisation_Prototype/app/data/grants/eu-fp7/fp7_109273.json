{"id":"109273","title":"Complementary Synthetic Strategies toward Heterocyclic Boronates","abstractText":"'COSSHNET is a dual-partner Industrial Doctorate (EID) offering research training in state-of-the-art chemical synthesis, catalysis, bioactive molecule design and high throughput library synthesis. Through integration of the complementary, interdisciplinary and intersectorial expertise of the partners, this network will help to strengthen Europeï¿½s human resources in the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The researchers will be supervised and mentored by internationally recognised experts and have access to state-of-the-art equipment. Hands-on training will be supplemented by formal training courses in relevant and related fields, and a wide variety of complementary training courses, summer school and seminars. Researchers will benefit from secondments to the industrial partner for a significant period of the project, thereby gaining extensive exposure to a commercially based scientific environment. Overall, it is anticipated that the COSSHNET project will provide both Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) with an outstanding training experience, through extensive technical and complementary skills development.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"606734","fundValue":"587133.58","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
