{"id":"99582","title":"The Research Olympics","abstractText":"'With the run-up to the Olympics in London starting in September 2011, this is a unique moment to celebrate European research in the shadow of the main Olympic stadium. Queen Mary, University of London (QMUL) will use this opportunity to showcase the innovative, exciting ways in which European and UK funded research makes a difference to our health and well-being and to our heritage, culture and society.\nThe Research Olympics builds on our long experience of bringing our work to a wide audience and in ensuring respect and understanding for the researchers involved. Our contribution to this year�s European Researchers� night is designed to have a high impact both on the evening itself and to make a much longer term, more sustainable difference to the ways in which our local, London, UK-wide and European public audiences understand the place that research plays in their own lives. In sight of the Olympic park, the event and its associated materials will ensure a longer-term global audience for the promotion of European research.\nOur central aim is to enhance public recognition of European researchers and their work in an engaging and exciting manner.\n\nOur experience indicates that while we can expect about 4,000 visitors on the night itself, our pre and post-dissemination materials will reach a substantial international target audience interested in the London Olympics and associated activities.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"287438","fundValue":"65674","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
