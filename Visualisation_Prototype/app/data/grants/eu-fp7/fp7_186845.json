{"id":"186845","title":"Simplifying the non-planar sector of gauge theory","abstractText":"'In recent years, there has been considerable progress on our understanding of scattering amplitudes in the planar limit of gauge theory. The non-planar parts of the theory have seen much less progress. However, some new ideas indicate that information from the planar sector is sufficient to determine properties of the full, non-planar theory when combined with a new class of Jacobi identities. As an example, it is possible to construct the integrand of the complete, four-loop four-point scattering amplitude in maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions using only planar data, and the solution of a linear system of Jacobi identities.\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to establish a research group at the University of Edinburgh which will investigate relations between the planar and non-planar sectors.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"631370","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
