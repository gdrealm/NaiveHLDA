{"id":"108832","title":"'Knowledgeable' Governors of Uncertainty?\nInternational Organisations in the Absence of a Global Migration Regime","abstractText":"'The MIGGOV seeks to break new ground in the analysis of international organizations (IOs) as key objects of study in the broader research field of international migration governance and of international governance more generally. The key questions are: to what extent, how and why do IOs impact upon and shape international migration governance in the absence of a global migration regime. In order to address these questions the project shifts the focus from international governance as a (changing) structure to international governors as sources of agency and to the outcomes that flow from interactions between various agents. As most international migration governance takes place under conditions of uncertainty about future migration scenarios, this project will specifically explore the issues of the production and the use of expert knowledge by IOs striving to impact upon international migration governance. The project will study the involvement of eight IOs in migration governance in Central Asia, which has been selected for analysis because it has so far escaped the attention of scholars despite evidence of multi-layered migration governance in the region.  The project will specifically look at four Central Asian countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan that share many similar features, but also exhibit some distinct political and socio-economic differences that make them highly relevant objects of study. The focus on Central Asia is also justified by the strategic importance that many international actors, including the EU, ascribe to the region. In addition to the Central Asian regional case study and intra-regional comparisons, the MIGGOV will produce overarching comparisons with the EU�s �Eastern Neighbourhood�. The project addresses topics on which the EU has called for further research in its 2013 Work Programme, namely those within activities 8.3 �Major trends in society and their implications� and 8.4 �Europe in the World�.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"331925","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
