This will consist of combining our existing knwoledge on separate electrothermal and electromechancial ice proections systems into a single, integrated, computer code. We will also test (but not manufacture, which is a separate CfP) a hybrid Wing Ice Protection System (WIPS) in an icing wind tunnel. The data gathered during the icing wind tunnel test will be used to validate the new design code'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255657","fundValue":"1194776.4","fundStart":"2010-01-04","fundEnd":"2015-01-03","dataset":"fp7"}
