{"id":"107822","title":"MOBILISING THE POTENTIAL OF ACTIVE AGEING IN EUROPE","abstractText":"'The starting point for MOPACT is the ambitious goals set by Horizon 2020 and the European Innovation Partnership Pilot Project on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIPAHA). Our response is ambitious too: we aim to provide the research and practical evidence upon which Europe can make longevity an asset for social and economic development. MOPACT will create a high quality, multi-disciplinary critical mass of leading researchers and, in the closest possible partnership with stakeholders and through a carefully planned iterative process, build a compendium of essential state-of-the-art and foresight intelligence upon which to develop the policy, practice, service and product developments and innovations required to meet the goals of Horizon 2020 and, in particular, the EIPAHA.  Active and healthy ageing is the primary focus of MOPACT and it will build on the momentum created by EY2012.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"320333","fundValue":"7431559.2","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
