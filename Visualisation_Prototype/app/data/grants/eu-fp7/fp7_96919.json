{"id":"96919","title":"Characterization of factors involved in proliferation of Bacillus subtilis L-forms","abstractText":"'The main objective of the project will be to characterize the molecular cell biology of proliferation in cell-wall deficient (L-form) derivatives of Bacillus. subtilis. L-forms can apparently arise from a wide range of bacteria and are often found in clinical situations. Recent work in the Errington lab has provided a highly tractable model system for studying the L-form state. B. subtilis L-forms proliferate via a remarkable membrane extrusion and resolution mechanism. The aim of the project is to improve our understanding of L-form biology by identifying and characterizing genes required specifically for growth in the L-form state. Two complementary approaches will be used. First, a candidate gene approach, looking at whether genes involved in chromosome segregation or various forms of membrane dynamics are involved. Second, an unbiased genetic screen for such factors. The project will shed light on the basic cell biology of this important and neglected bacterial way of life and provide insights into their remarkable and unexpected mode of proliferation. It may also provide new antibacterial targets for the development of antimicrobial agents acting on persistent bacteria.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255096","fundValue":"172240.8","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
