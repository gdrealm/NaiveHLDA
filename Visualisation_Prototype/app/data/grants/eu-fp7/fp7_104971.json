{"id":"104971","title":"OpenFlow City Experiment ï¿½ Linking Infrastructure and Applications","abstractText":"This Future Internet experiment will create a multi-autonomous-system experimental signalling overlay on the OFELIA OpenFlow infrastructure. We propose to marry an existing NSIS signalling stack, along with an existing multi autonomous system Virtual Path Slice controller, to the OFELIA OpenFlow experimental facility, thereby extending OpenFlow with signalling and multi-domain  interworking on a multi-autonomous-system topology. We will use the Virtual Wall facility to emulate a city broadband network with up to 100 nodes, and will model the network based on best practices as observed in public internet production networks.nnThe work will be conducted in three steps (i) experiment setup and configuration (ii) experiment implementation and (iii) showcase and demonstration.nnAltogether four experiments will be performed. The first experiment will verify the inter-working of NSIS and the VPS Controller with OpenFlow. The second experiment concerns signalling performance; the intention is to measure the performance of the control plane with high signalling load and identify what Busy Hour Connection Attempt (BHCA) performance can be achieved. The third experiment will measure the resilience of the virtual path slice in the context of high background traffic load for uni-directional and bi-directional traffic. Finally, another experiment will investigate how the system reacts under different failure scenarios.nnThe showcase will demonstrate the benefit of signalling for two use cases: (a) a scenario for true HD video; and (b) a HD video-to-video scenario for real-time interactive traffic.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"317576","fundValue":"878015","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
