{"id":"100617","title":"Vehicle Independent Electric Transmission Architectures","abstractText":"'Road transport is key driver of the European economy, and it underpins societal development and our way of life. It accounts for 11% of total European GDP and is a major contributor to EU employment and the competitiveness of many other industrial sectors  This project, involving two SMEs and one University, concerns a rapid development of a European capability in electric drivetrains for low-carbon vehicles, with focus on urban electric vehicles and commercial vehicles, in order to meet the urgent needs of a rapidly growing market, in particular in London and other European cities.  The proposed electric drivetrain is based on the novel concept of a Vehicle Independent Electric Transmission Architecture (VIETA) system, which has been provisionally filed for patent application by Cranfield University. The timely delivery, within the next two years, of a technology demonstration of the VIETA system will significantly enhance the EUï¿½s capability to develop low carbon vehicles with urgency. It will also helps to achieve the long term goal of decarbonisation of road transport, as emissions avoided now are more valuable than those saved later.   This is a people-centred program to mobilize the human capitals of the participating organization so that enhanced and new capability in road transport, and in particular electric drivetrain, is to be developed. For the 10 seconded researchers involved, the VIETA project provides significantly leveraged resources for effective acquisition of new skills, and refreshed career prospects. For the newly recruited researcher, the aim is to develop an accelerated and excellent career within a unique academic-industry partnership over two years. Budgeted at 380k euro, the project thus provides signficant benefits for the EU, with good prospect of high returns for investment, in terms of new and enhanced capability in a key automotive market. and the creation of new jobs and wealth for the EU citizens.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"230734","fundValue":"332592","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
