{"id":"101387","title":"GRAPHENE CHEMICAL VAPOUR DEPOSITION: ROLL TO ROLL TECHNOLOGY","abstractText":"'Graphene has some unique properties resulting from its linear dispersion band structure, its high carrier mobility, and its low dimensionality. However, its use is presently limited by its synthesis and mass production. The project aims to develop the first roll-based chemical vapour deposition (CVD) machine for the mass production of few-layer graphene for transparent electrodes for LED and display applications, and adapts the process conditions of a wafer-scale carbon nanotube growth system to provide a low-cost batch process for graphene growth on silicon. The project focuses on applications such as transparent electrodes for OLEDs and GaN LEDs, optical switches, plasmonic waveguides, VLSI interconnects, sensors and RF NEMs.'","grantUrl":"http://www.grafol.eu/","grantId":"285275","fundValue":"10537738.4","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
