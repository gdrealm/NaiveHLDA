{"id":"104019","title":"Auction and Day-Ahead Markets Spikes","abstractText":"'The on-going restructuring and market design processes for the power sector, with its complex objectives\nof competition, security and decarbonisation has created a need to understand the drivers of change and\nthe nature of electricity price dynamics. Since electricity is a unique commodity, not easily storable\nwith important implications when balancing supply and demand, any imbalances can cause large\nand sharp changes in price. Hence, AaDAMS, a project on �Auction and Day�Ahead Markets Spikes�,\ninvestigates appropriate modeling, forecasting and risk management techniques for the occurrence\nof spikes and abnormal price excursions in electricity markets, focusing upon agent specific as well\nas market level data. AaDAMS has a main objective of understanding abnormal price\ndynamics observed in wholesale electricity prices looking at the behaviour of generators�\nauction offers, as well as related parallel objectives concerning the exercise of market\npower in the European Electricity Markets, the potential interaction of strategic\nbehaviour with new technology characteristics, such as wind intermittency and the effect of\npolicy interventions in market design on price dynamics.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300395","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
