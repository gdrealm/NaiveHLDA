{"id":"108896","title":"MANufacturing decision and supply chain management SYStem for additive manufacturing","abstractText":"'ManSYS aims to develop and demonstrate a set of e-supply chain tools; to enable the mass adoption of Additive Manufacturing (AM). This will allow businesses to identify and determine the suitability of AM for metal products, and subsequently manage the associated supply-chain issues and �facilitating� open product evolution.\n\nThe proposed e-supply chain solution will combine all aspects of AM including; multiple build platforms (Laser and Electron-Beam technologies), modelling, post-processing (Machining, Finishing and Heat-Treatment) and 3D scanning techniques.  This will give a �press-button� solution to the production and challenges of new products. The integrated solution will offer a knowledge driven manufacturing process with significant production benefits; customisation, automation, self-management and reduced material usage and waste.\n\nThe integrated approach will be assessed using a range of demonstration �scenarios� to assess and highlight:\n� Cost-Savings: Assessment of parts (including design optimisation) against existing manufacturing methods � allowing businesses to decided if AM is an appropriate manufacturing approach.\n� Re-action to Customer Need: Demonstrator parts from industry (initially aerospace, and medical) validated by ManSYS end-users, including the ability to allow rapid design variations.\n� Robustness of Supply Network: Development of QA/QC procedures and protocols to allow operation at multiple-locations and across multiple-machines. Demonstrating the ability to handle supply-chain interruptions and improve robustness.\n� Environmental Assessment: Measure the embedded CO2 of the parts made, including assessment of the ability of AM to optimise part design.\n\nThe ManSYS solution will be based on only commercial AM management software (�Streamics�). We propose to develop the ManSYS concept over a period of 36 months with an overall budget of �4.5Million (�3Million EC contribution).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"609172","fundValue":"4405531.92","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
