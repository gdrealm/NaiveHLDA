{"id":"92074","title":"Technology Opportunities and Strategies towards Climate-friendly trAnsport","abstractText":"'The EU has committed to reducing GHG emissions by at least 20% based upon the 1990 level by 2020 and further reductions are expected beyond that timeframe.  However, realizing this and subsequent targets may become increasingly challenging, given the past growth and future projections of transportation GHG emissions.  The proposed activity enables the EU to obtain a better strategic perspective as to what contribution future transportation technologies and fuels could make to reduce GHG emissions.  The project presented here assesses the technical feasibility, economic affordability, and social acceptability of technology policies that would lead toward a lower climate-impact transport system within the EU under different scenario conditions.   The project is organized around three major workshops, which include important stakeholders from academia, industry, government, NGOs, and key participants from relevant existing and former EU projects.  In order to enable informed and focused discussions at each workshop, participants are provided with supporting studies well before each workshop.  The workshops and supporting studies cover (1) a techno-economic assessment of major transport modes (automobiles, buses, trucks, aircraft and railways) and of alternative transportation fuels for reducing GHG emissions; (2) an integration of these technologies in scenarios of European transportation futures; and (3) an estimate of the penetration of future low-GHG emission technologies and fuels for promising policies under the different scenario conditions, along with an assessment of the societal implications of these policies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"234217","fundValue":"743196","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
