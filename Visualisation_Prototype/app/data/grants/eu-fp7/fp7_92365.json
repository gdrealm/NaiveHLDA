{"id":"92365","title":"Non-toxic and Cost-Effective Essential Oil-based Nematicide and Soil Delivery System","abstractText":"'Nematodes or roundworms are one of the most common soil-borne parasites that feed on plant roots, stems, leaves, flowers and seeds - constituting a major contributor to agricultural crop losses.  Yield losses due to the parasitic affects of nematodes vary significantly for different crops, however, it is estimated that over �1 billion/year of crop yield is lost in the EU and the figure is speculated to between �10-20 billion/year world-wide.  There are a number of existing solutions to prevent the huge losses due to nematode infestations, including; chemical nematicides (soil fumigants), solar heating/steaming and robust crop rotation.  However, all of these solutions have significant problems such as very negative environmental impact, high-cost, geographically specific and they all kill nitrogen fixing bacteria.  Nemasys proposes to develop a unique blend of naturally occurring essential oils (EO) as an alternative, cost-effective, soil treatment, which will be delivered by a novel time-release capsule.  A unique EO formulation has been discovered by Plant Impact (SME Co-ordinator), which shows a unique synergistic behaviour, to give significantly improved (>30%) improvement in nematicide efficacy. Allowing lower quantities of EO to be used and overcoming their limiting factor of �taint�.  The main work in the Nemasys will be to further investigate (and optimise) this effect, develop the delivery of the EOs to the soil and undertake the field-trials to allow future commercial funding to license the nematicide (in partnership with an LE distributor) under the pesticide safety directive.'","grantUrl":"http://www.bovinose.eu/","grantId":"232325","fundValue":"1314755.8","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
