{"id":"92038","title":"FUTURAGE: A Roadmap for Ageing Research","abstractText":"'FUTURAGE aims to produce the definitive road map that will guide European research on ageing and health for the next 10-15 years. It represents plans for the most extensive consultation ever conducted in this field and for the mobilisation of not only the leading scientists but also the stakeholders that will determine the fate of the road map. FUTURAGE combines all of the major coordination actions in the ageing field, including an ERA-Net and, on this basis, promises to produce the most comprehensive formally grounded and scientifically credible road map, as well as one that commands wide support. FUTURAGE represents a unique set of partnerships among leading scientists and between scientists and key stakeholders. It builds on and extends the existing ERA-AGE collaboration (12 existing partners) by (i) combining all of the key coordination actions and specific support actions on ageing of the past decade including: FORUM, ERA-AGE LINK-AGE and AGEACTION, (ii) extending the collaboration to new Member States, (iii) integrating scientists and programme managers, (iv) emphasising knowledge translation and policy impact and (v) engaging all key stakeholders. The resulting roadmap will not only represent the state-of-the-art in scientific terms but will also reflect the needs of a wide range of research users including funders, industry, policy makers, practitioners and older people.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"223679","fundValue":"1964885.6","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
