{"id":"102316","title":"Turboprop and Propfan-Equipped Aircraft Noise Emission Model","abstractText":"'This project aims at delivering a multi-disciplinary computer program capable of simulating the\nnoise emission and propagation of modern airplanes powered by turboshaft engines coupled to\nconventional propellers or advanced propellers (propfan). This document describes existing\ncomputer programs (FLIGHT and FLIGHT-NOISE) that comply substantially with the requirements\nof the Call for Proposals (Call). More specifically, the proposal has the following objectives:\n\n�\tTo produce state-of-the-art aircraft noise, emissions & propagation software.\n\n�\tTo validate the software with clear benchmark test cases.\n\n�                  To provide support technical beyond the duration of the project.\n\nThe main project deliverables are:\n\n1.\tThe Software, including an �Airframe Module�, a �Propulsion Module� and �Noise\nPropagation Module�.\n\n2.\tDatabase of turboprop engine performance (flight envelopes).\n\n3.\tValidated prediction tools.\n\n4.\tSoftware documentation, including user�s manuals (20 deliverables).\n\nThe project is expected to deliver benefits in other areas, such as:\n\n1.\tMulti-disciplinary approach to aircraft noise and flight operations.\n\n2.\tFlexibility in predicting sources of noise, noise perception, noise propagation.\n\n3.\tEngineering advancements in the areas of advanced propeller noise.\n\n4.\tPrediction of combustion emissions.\n\nThis project is proposed to compensate for the imbalance between the requirements of the aviation industry and the technology currently implemented in Aircraft Flight and Noise Prediction programs. In particular, noise propagation tools are currently unavailable to the industry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"277580","fundValue":"348870","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
