{"id":"188194","title":"Spatial and Orbital Light for Advanced Systems","abstractText":"'SOLAS project targets the development of disruptive spatial division multiplexing technology merged with the radical new technology of orbital angular momentum fibres to deliver low cost, high capacity communication networks of the future. The proposed concepts will be implemented using spatial division multiplexing as the base technology platform along with orbital angular momentum fibres that provide greater total capacity than current single mode fibres. SOLAS aims to develop new and simplify existing subsystem technologies to allow for a smooth and efficient transition to communication technologies of the future while maintaining compatibility with existing technologies. Furthermore, it offers a continued European leadership in RTD photonics from components to systems, securing the necessary human resources and knowledge to design and produce a new generation of photonic components that support EUï¿½s vision for ubiquitous broadband connectivity to promote European social and economic cohesion and prosperity.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"627545","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
