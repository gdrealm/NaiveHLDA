{"id":"98220","title":"In-fiber optical cavities structures for telecommunications and sensing","abstractText":"'The proposed work is focused on in-fiber optical cavities structures (IFOCS), which are the �in-fiber� implementation of coupled multicavity structures. �In-fiber� optical devices are embedded in an optical fiber, and they are highly desirable because of their easy integration, high power handling, tolerance of harsh environments, flexible form factor, variable wavelength accommodation, low cost and scalable manufacturing.\n\nThe main aim of the proposed research consists of the study and research of the potential applications of IFOCS, focusing on the options for designing and fabricating tuneable devices and the combination of complementary structures , on the following fields:\n\n� Optical communications (OC), using the multichannel capabilities of IFOCS.\n\n� Fiber sensing (FS), using the fact that local perturbations in the fiber affect the local frequencies of the spectral responses.\n\n� Microwave photonics (MP), where the discrete-time impulse response will be exploited for the photonic processing of microwave signals.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"275703","fundValue":"200549.6","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
