{"id":"104940","title":"Particle Physics beyond the Energy Frontier","abstractText":"'The Standard Model of particle physics is incomplete. It fails to address such\nfundamental questions as the baryon asymmetry of the universe\n(i.e. our own existence), dark matter and dark energy, and gravity;\nit has too many free parameters, and suffers from self-consistency\nproblems (the fine-tuning and hierarchy problem).  Nearly all\nalternatives to the Standard Model that address these problems predict the\nexistence of new, heavy particles.\n\nFlavour physics is sensitive to quantum loops that can be affected\nby new particles with masses even beyond those that can be directly\nproduced at the highest-energy colliders - it allows us to see\nbeyond the energy frontier. This makes it highly sensitive to\nphysics beyond the Standard Model  The observed size of the matter-antimatter\nasymmetry of the universe proves that additional, undiscovered\nsources of charge-parity (CP) violation must exist. CP violation\nmeasurements, which are the domain of flavour physics, hold\ntherefore particular promise in the search this 'New Physics'.\n\nWe will use powerful new techniques and the unprecedented datasets\nof LHCb to extract some of the most important, and currently most\npoorly constrained CP violation parameters. We will collaborate\nacross several international collaborations to further improve our\nmeasurements. We will reach new levels of precision that will\ndramatically increase the New Physics reach of the entire flavour physics\napproach.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"307737","fundValue":"1399984","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
