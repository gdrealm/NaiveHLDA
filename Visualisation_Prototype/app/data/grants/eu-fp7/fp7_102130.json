{"id":"102130","title":"Demonstration of Low-Energy Water Hydraulic Actuator System for Valves in the Sanitary Industry","abstractText":"'The HYDRACTDEM project will demonstrate the energy savings and cost effectiveness of switching from pneumatic actuators to water-based hydraulic actuator systems in the sanitary industry. The project represents a major technological breakthrough in the development and use of actuators in the sanitary industry in particular, but could even revolutionize the use of actuators in the entire processing industry. A water hydraulic actuator and remote control system represents a game-changing product in the sanitary industry and the hydraulic actuator system clearly goes beyond current state of the art in the area.\n\nThe HYDRACTDEM project will demonstrate immense positive end-users impact in the sanitary Industry through capital expenditure savings and reduced energy costs. In addition the demonstration will show that the hydraulic actuator system can be fitted to standard valves in the sanitary industry and perform to end-user specifications and in accordance with existing regulations and safety norms (including sterility).\n\nIn a wider perspective, the EU at large will benefit through the pursuit of large energy savings and reductions in CO2.\n\nIn addition the hydraulic actuator system to be demonstrated in the HYDRACTDEM project will increase work safety and processing facility by eliminating the hazards associated with pneumatic valves.\n\nFinally, the project contributes to the innovation and product developments in four European SMEs who utilizes each other strength and know how to push the boundary within the manufacturing industry - an industry which is otherwise under extreme pressure from globalization and China in particular.\n\nThe HYDRACTDEM project is a continuation of the HYDRACT project (project no. 222313 co-funded by the EU through the 2007 Research for SME Call).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"286551","fundValue":"2029614","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
