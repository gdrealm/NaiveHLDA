{"id":"86602","title":"GridTalk: co-ordinating grid reporting across Europe","abstractText":"The impact of Grids has rapidly expanded beyond that which can be disseminated by individual projects. GridTalk will bring the success stories of Europe's e-Infrastructure to policy makers in government and business, to the broader scientific community, and to the general public. The project will co-ordinate the dissemination outputs of EGEE and other European Grid efforts, ensuring their results and influence are reported widely in print and online.<br/>GridTalk's output will come in three main forms. Firstly, a series of reports and briefings will engage policy makers with the specific achievements and impacts of Europe's science Grids. Secondly, the high profile GridCafï¿½ website will be extended to ensure its continued success in informing the general public. And finally international Science Grid This Week, the rapidly growing online newsletter, will provide a resource for scientists using Grid computing and for those considering becoming involved.<br/>Through its international, cross-disciplinary approach, GridTalk will play a vital role in encouraging participation in and co-ordination between Grid projects in Europe, and in particular in preparing for the proposed European Grid Infrastructure and other initiatives aimed at a sustainable e-Infrastructure in Europe. It will also spread awareness of Europe's leading role in Grid development to other geographical areas.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"223534","fundValue":"607249","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
