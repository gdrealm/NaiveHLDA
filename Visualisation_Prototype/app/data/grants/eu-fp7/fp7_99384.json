{"id":"99384","title":"Context dependent sexual selection and the dynamics of colonisation","abstractText":"'One of the main goals of evolutionary biology is to understand the causes and consequences of genetic and phenotypic diversity. A key factor in this process of diversification is the ability of individuals to invade, colonize and adapt to novel habitats. A common feature of colonisation events is the introduction of animals from multiple source populations. Such genetic admixture can have important implications for both the ecological and evolutionary potential of introduced populations, through increases in genetic and phenotypic variance. Despite this, the impact of admixture on the fitness of introduced populations has received little empirical validation. The key reason for this is a lack of studies which link genetic diversity of introduced populations and the agents of selection acting on that diversity. This proposal is an ambitious, but highly achievable, development of a novel and innovative multi-disciplinary research agenda aimed at addressing this fundamental issue in evolutionary biology. Specifically, I will combine genetic, physiological, and behavioural techniques in natural, semi-natural and laboratory settings using the invasive wall lizard, Podarcis muralis, to examine the genetic context dependence of sexual selection and its role on population persistence and evolutionary diversification during colonisation. Specifically, I will experimentally manipulate the genetic admixture of semi-natural populations to provide direct tests of the strength, direction, and targets of sexual selection under different genetic contexts during colonisation events. This data will be used to parameterize an individual-based simulation model to predict how sexual selection can affect the probability of colonization of novel habitats under low versus high genetic diversity, and to generate predictions about the evolutionary dynamics during range expansion.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"275252","fundValue":"202049.6","fundStart":"2011-04-14","fundEnd":"2013-04-13","dataset":"fp7"}
