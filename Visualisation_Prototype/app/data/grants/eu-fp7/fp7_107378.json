{"id":"107378","title":"Flowering Time Pathways Underlying Quantitative variation in heading date of wheat","abstractText":"'Flowering time plays a key role in determining yield performance as it is key for both crop adaptation and yield potential. Flowering time reflects the adaptation of a plant to its environment by tailoring vegetative and reproductive growth phases to local climatic effects. Therefore, in any given environment, flowering time affects the ability of a crop to maximally exploit good growing conditions and to avoid stresses that reduce yield and grain quality. Genes that control the flowering time (photoperiod (Ppd), vernalization (Vrn) and �earliness per se� (eps)) are critical to this wide adaptation. The general objective of this proposal is to extend the analysis of the eps gene located on chromosome 3AS combining molecular and phenotypical strategies to determine the gene�s effect on plant development. At the end of this project we will have the necessary knowledge and tools to understand what components of the network of genes that control flowering time are affected by allelic variation on 3A. In addition, genetic interactions of this QTL with other genes including Ppd-1, Vrn-1, and 1DL QTL will be defined, informing breeders of what alleles can be selected simultaneously for additive or interactive effects on heading date and pleiotropic phenotypes.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329039","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
