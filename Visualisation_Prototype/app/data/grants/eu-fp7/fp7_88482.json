{"id":"88482","title":"Seismology of flaring coronal loops","abstractText":"'Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and oscillations, observed in astrophysical, laboratory and space plasmas provide us with an excellent tool for the remote diagnostics of the plasmas, which are, in particular, implemented in the techniques of solar coronal seismology, Earthï¿½s magnetospheric magnetoseismology, and MHD spectroscopy of tokamaks.  The identification of MHD modes in quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) of the emission generated by solar and stellar flares opens up interesting perspectives for the study of fine structuring of the solar corona, as well as for the diagnostics of stellar coronae.  The aim of the project is to advance our theoretical understanding of MHD modes of flaring plasma structures and the plasma emission modulation by these modes; to develop and implement plasma diagnostic techniques based upon those modes, to analyse QPP of the flare-generated microwave and X-ray emission and to identify the MHD modes associated with them. The detected QPPs will be exploited to do coronal seismology, i.e. by comparing the observations with the models, deducing physical parameters in the solar corona.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"220555","fundValue":"169008.08","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
