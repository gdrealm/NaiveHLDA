{"id":"186233","title":"CHD1 Deletion: Implications to Outcome and Treatment in Prostate Cancer","abstractText":"'Prostate cancer can be stratified as ETS gene rearranged (ETSR) and\nnon-rearranged (ETSNR), with the latter comprising a heterogeneous\ngroup of 50-60% of all cancers. This project will characterize a subgroup\nof ETSNR cancers that have a CHD1 deletion (CHD1del). Recent\nsequencing studies have elucidated CHD1- cancers as ETSNR, and\ncommonly PTEN and p53 wildtype and SPOP mutated, comprising up to\n26% of all prostate cancers (1). ETSR cancers largely have hormone\ndriven oncogenes that may have prognostic and predictive utility (2, 3).\nLess is known about ETSNRCHD1del cancers. Their lack of ETS fusions\nraises concern that these may not be generated through androgen\nreceptor (AR) transcription and are not AR driven. ETSNRCHD1del cancers\nhave a huge excess of somatic intrachromosomal rearrangements (up to\n800) compared to ETSR cancers presumably due to a DNA repair defect\n(1). This is supported by CHD1ï¿½s association with the SSRP1, part of the\nFACT complex, that is implicated in transcriptional regulation and DNA\nrepair (4-9). We hypothesize that CHD1 deleted tumors are less\nsensitive to endocrine and taxane therapy, have a worse prognosis\nand need alternative treatment strategies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"625792","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-04-04","fundEnd":"2016-04-03","dataset":"fp7"}
