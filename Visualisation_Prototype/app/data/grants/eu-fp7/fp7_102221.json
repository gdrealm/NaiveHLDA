{"id":"102221","title":"Novel Compact Terahertz source based on Dual Wavelength Lasers and Photomixers","abstractText":"'TERA proposes to perform a joint industry academia research programme capitalising on the knowledge and expertise of the partners through exchanges of researchers and transfers knowledge between research centres in Photonics and Nanoscience at the University of Dundee and SME UAB TERAVIL with expertise in different aspects of laser physics, material science and THz radiation.  The aims are to overcome scientific and technical barrier to the realisation and adoption of low-cost technologies for the fabrication of compact room-temperature terahertz sources emitting few tens of ?W powers at 0.3ï¿½1.5 THz and beyond for Biophotonics and Safety and Security applications. The THz radiation will be obtained by difference frequency generation from CW or pulsed dual wavelength laser produced by combination of laser diodes with novel volume Bragg reflectors . Together the project partners will evaluate several variants for the THz generation procedures. Photoconductive mixers based on traditional and new materials and photovoltaic travelling-wave mixers will be assessed, targeting increased conversion efficiency'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"285974","fundValue":"1104208","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
