{"id":"104732","title":"3D Stereoscopic Interactive User Interfaces","abstractText":"'Stereoscopic display devices have recently been introduced in the consumer market. Through these displays users can perceive the depth of three-dimensional content. Up until now this possibility was the privilege of immersive environments such as the CAVE. This led three-dimensional user interfaces to remain confined to research and hi-tech professional environments. Instead, consumer stereoscopic displays have the potential of bringing true 3D visualization and interactivity to everyone. However, recent research has highlighted that knowledge on the design of 3D UIs is still in its early stages, especially in the field of 3D visualization tools.\nThe 3STARS project will explore novel strategies for designing 3DUIs making use of stereoscopic displays. We will explore how the depth dimension can convey information and provide new interaction possibilities. To reach these goals, a multimodal approach will investigate how low-cost devices, together with these new displays, can provide semi-immersive 3D visualization tools able to support users in analysing data. The project will contribute towards the establishment of a body of knowledge supporting the design, development and evaluation of 3DUIs supporting visualization tasks ï¿½ some among the major challenges in the fields of 3D interaction and visualization. Dr. Adalberto Simeone, who has experience both in the development of Information Visualization tools and 3D environments, will implement this 24-months project, with the career goal to reach a position of international authority in the field of 3D interaction.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"302221","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
