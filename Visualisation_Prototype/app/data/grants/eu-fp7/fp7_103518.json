{"id":"103518","title":"The Set Theory of Semantic Theories of Truth","abstractText":"'This project will draw from techniques in contemporary descriptive set theory to develop more powerful tools for the analysis and application of semantic theories of truth. In particular, we shall use Gï¿½del's constructible hierarchy to answer open question pertaining to revision theoretic truth definitions. More broadly, we shall develop a network of infinitary tableau systems for semantic theories of truth, drawing on techniques from descriptive set theory and mathematical proof theory. This work will provide the foundation for semantic theories that aim to talk about their own semantic concepts. Moreover, it will provide simple techniques for the production of consistency proofs for contemporary research into logics of truth.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"302083","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
