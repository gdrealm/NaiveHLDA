{"id":"106727","title":"PROmoting Global REsponsible research and Social and Scientific innovation","abstractText":"'Delivering European Renewal relies heavily on the advancement of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) ï¿½ that is, research and innovation which is:\n\n- is ethically acceptable,\n- is sustainable by avoiding significant adverse effects and\n- drives towards the common good, i.e. societal desirability.\n\n\nTo achieve maximum impact where it is most needed, ProGReSS concentrates on the underexplored and least converging part of RRI, namely achieving societal desirability. The project will link existing international networks of RRI from all continents with European partners and policy-makers, policy-advisors, funders, industry and non-governmental organisations. In interactive discussions with relevant societal actors as well as innovators, we will move RRI debates from the national or regional to the global level and achieve the following objectives:\n\n1. Link existing international networks of RRI with relevant societal actors on a global scale to focus innovation on societal desirability.\n\n2. Complete a major fact-finding mission comparing science funding strategies and innovation policies in Europe, the US, China, Japan, India, Australia, and South Africa.\n\n3. Advocate a European normative model for RRI globally, using constitutional values as a driver to inform societal desirability.\n\n4. Develop a strategy for fostering the convergence of regional innovation systems at the global level.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"321400","fundValue":"1715490.03","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
