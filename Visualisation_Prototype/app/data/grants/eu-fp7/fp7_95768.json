{"id":"95768","title":"Computations of Automorphic Galois Representations","abstractText":"'In groundbreaking work, the researcher has developed the first ever algorithm for explicitly determining the mod l-Galois representations of classical modular forms. He has applied this to the Inverse Galois Problem and to Lehmer&apos;s Conjecture on the non-vanishing of the Ramanujan tau-function. Arguably the greatest advance in arithmetic geometry within the last decade has been the proof by Khare and Wintenberger of Serre&apos;s Conjectures over the rationals. A version of Serre&apos;s Conjectures over totally real fields has been suggested by Buzzard, Diamond and Jarvis, complete with explicit formulae for the Serre &apos;weights&apos; and &apos;levels&apos;. The broad objectives of the proposal are as follows: 1. Improve the researcher&apos;s algorithms for the explicit determination of mod l-Galois representations of classical modular forms. 2. Give a corresponding algorithm for Hilbert modular forms. 3. With the help of 2, provide systematic evidence for Serre&apos;s Conjectures over real quadratic fields. 4. Systematically apply the Galois representations of classical and Hilbert modular forms to the Inverse Galois Problem.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252058","fundValue":"164540.8","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
