{"id":"90812","title":"Between Segregation and Social Integration: Recent Immigrants and Foreign Workers in the USA and in the UK","abstractText":"'The central research objective of this project is to compare processes of, and opportunities for, social integration of immigrant communities in the United States and the United Kingdom. Case studies will be carried out in Seattle (WA) and Glasgow and Edinburgh (Scotland)  To summarize: the project will focus on the following 1. Political contexts of migration discourses and policies 2. Contexts of integration opportunities (social integration policies) 3. Local integration/segregation contexts a. demographic characteristics of immigrants/residents b. lifestyle, welfare and well-being of immigrants/residents c. attitudes towards human rights and values of immigrants/residents 4. Potential effects of transnational immigrant community networks This project aims to examine the lives of immigrants and, in particular, attitudes towards their new surroundings and the host country in the USA (Seattle) and in the UK (Glasgow, Edinburgh). A further objective is also to ask US and UK citizens and long-term residents about their perceptions of recent immigrants. In terms of quantitative analysis the project will attempt to examine how mutual perceptions of newcomers and residents are affected by their various nationalities, religions, languages, levels of education etc. Furthermore this project investigates how government regulates the flow of immigrants and what kind of civil society organisations try to help the new arrivals and how those activities are managed.  Qualitative methods will focus on specific in-depth interviews with representatives of community associations and local government organizations that have a stake in or knowledge of social integration issues. This shared UW and CRCEES project will help develop an international network relationship facilitating future research collaboration between the two participants and even other potential partners, through the applicantï¿½s connection with Hungary and other Central European countries.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"219671","fundValue":"334235.79","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
