{"id":"110057","title":"Interference Aligned Wireless Communications","abstractText":"'Interference alignment is a new radical idea that would enable a much higher data throughput than previously thought possible in multiuser wireless communications. Basically, Interference Alignment works as if each user can own half of the spectrum, regardless of the number of users. There is a great variety of applications, where Interference Alignment may be implemented including multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) networks, X networks, two-way communication networks, multihop multiflow networks, cooperative communication networks, and cellular networks,. In this project, we aim to develop new practical Interference Alignment schemes based on these applications. This project will deal with code design, performance analysis, decoding algorithms, and implementation of Interference Alignment based on multilevel coding. The outcomes of this project would vastly improve the quality and efficiency of existing communication systems, and contribute to the affirmation of Europe as the foremost leader in information and communication technologies. The resulting schemes may also reduce energy consumption and radiation, making future telecommunications more environmentally friendly.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"330806","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2014-01-13","fundEnd":"2016-01-12","dataset":"fp7"}
