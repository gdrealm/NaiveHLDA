{"id":"105275","title":"Fully integratable lasers and optical amplifiers in silicon","abstractText":"'The proposal aims to develop an optimum pre-commercialisation strategy for silicon based light emission and detection technologies developed under the ERC Advanced Investigator Grant SILAMPS (Silicon Lasers and Optical Amplifiers). The university spin-out company Si-Light will be used as the commercialisation vehicle. The company plans to sell licenses to manufacturers in several major market sectors: fully integrated fibre to the home transceivers for passive optical networks, infrared sensors for gas detection, medical products for surgical applications and inter and intra chip communications. We will research the major customers and performance expectations for products in each sector and establish market size and growth expectations. Visits to the most likely licensees will be scheduled to demonstrate the technology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"324595","fundValue":"149181","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
