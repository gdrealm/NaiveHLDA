{"id":"102417","title":"Polaritonic TeraHertz Devices","abstractText":"'THz band remains the last region of electromagnetic spectrum which does  not have wide application in modern technology due to lack of solid state  source of THz radiation: compact, reliable and scalable. Fundamental  objection preventing creation of such source is small rate of spontaneous  emission of the THz photons: according to the Fermi Golden rule this rate  is about tens of inverse milliseconds, while lifetime of the charge  carrier in the solid typically lies in  picoseconds range due to the  efficient interaction with phonons. The rate of spontaneous emission of THz  photons can be increased by application Purcell effect, but even in this\ncase cryogenic temperature is required for the operation of solid state  THz devices. Further increase of emission rate can be achieved via bosonic  stimulation, when THz radiative transition occurs into the quantum state,  in which condensate of bosons is formed. Such situation can be realized  for transition between upper and lower polariton state in semiconductor\nmicrocavity in polariton lasing regime, in the case when parity excitonic  parts of upper and lower polariton states is made different. In this case  emission of THz radiation characterized by substantial quantum efficiency  can be achieved even at room temperature. Further, pronounced non-linear  properties of polaritonic systems lead to various non-linear effects in\ncoupled system of polaritons and THz photons, what open the way for  development of novel class of solid state devices, like compact THz short  pulse generators, THz switch, and THz detectors.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"295187","fundValue":"374300","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
