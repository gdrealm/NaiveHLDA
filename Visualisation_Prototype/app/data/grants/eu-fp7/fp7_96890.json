{"id":"96890","title":"Global Ethics in Science and Technology","abstractText":"'GEST aims to explore the role of ethics in science and technology (S&T) policy as it is currently developing both in Europe and in the two main global emerging economies of China and India. S&T ethics has been widely debated in Europe in the last two decades leading to a number of policy initiatives that have influenced the development of new technologies in the European Research Area. The way in which ethical considerations are incorporated in S&T policy in Europe creates an environment that inevitably affects the EUï¿½s global position.\n\nAt the same time Europe is increasingly co-operating and competing with the two major emerging economies of China and India, which are also keen to develop their S&T sectors. Interdependences between these three global actors require ever closer collaboration, preferably undertaken in a highly transparent manner. However S&T debates in each of the three regions follow local dynamics that are not necessarily easily understood, even by expert communities in those regions. Interdependent development (and even positive competition) requires mutual respect and understanding, but this relies upon close collaboration in exploring common issues and significant differences.\n\nGEST aims to create such collaboration between key S&T policy advisory institutes in the three regions in order to provide a clear understanding of the role of ethics in S&T debates. GEST offers a unique chance to analyse and debate relevant issues while learning from experience gathered in Europe and in the two emerging economies. A group of experts with a wide disciplinary and geographical distribution will provide input for kick-starting a global debate on the dynamics of ethics in S&T policy. In order to address the implications for effective global governance of science, GEST will provide concrete, realistic policy recommendations in the form of a collaborative roadmap and an action plan for science in society that will consider policymaking needs in all three r'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"266592","fundValue":"892295","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
