{"id":"187836","title":"The circulation of naturalistic knowledge in Modern Europe (1500-1850): a micro analytical perspective","abstractText":"'The aim of this project is to give new tools and new techniques to give a better understanding of Cultural Heritage that in this case is meant as the botanical and scientific knowledge of the past, through the combination of cultural history, history of science and landscape history analysed from a micro historical point of view.\n\nThe project brings together a young researcher, trained in a multidisciplinary group (LASA, Laboratory of Archaeology and Environmental History � University of Genoa) through an historical � geographical approach in the study of botanical iconography, and a prestigious research group from the University of Nottingham with the expertise of the landscape history, cultural and historical geography and environmental history of north west Italy, to develop a new methodology combining different disciplines together to study the circulation of naturalistic knowledge.\n\nScholars from different academic background have tended to examine these sources in light of the current spirit and essence of their own discipline. The current fields of research can be roughly divided into in at least four separate areas: botanical, historical, art historical and linguistic. However, the nature of these threads of research do not place emphasis on the contextualization such as landscape, geography, production of the object such as its who and how it was made are lacking. These four and separate disciplinary approaches are rigorous but lack the focus and illumination which a fully multidisciplinary approach can provide and each fails to provide contextualization which gives meaning and coherence to the study. The botanical, historical, art historical and linguistics researches are essential but not sufficient and this research, and the funding sought are essential to bring about this much needed refocus so as to complete our understanding of Naturalistic Cultural Heritage in this field.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"624310","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
