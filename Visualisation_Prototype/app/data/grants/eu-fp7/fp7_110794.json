{"id":"110794","title":"Novel materials architecture based on atomically thin crystals","abstractText":"We propose a new paradigm in materials science � heterostructures based on two-dimensional atomic crystals (and their hybrids with metallic and semiconducting quantum dots and nanostructures), and develop several devices which are based on such concept. Two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals (such as graphene, monolayers of boron nitride, molybdenum disulphide, etc) possess a number of exciting properties, which are often unique and very different from those of their tree-dimensional counterparts. However, it is the combinations of such 2D crystals in 3D stacks that offer truly unlimited opportunities in designing the functionalities of such heterostructures. One can combine conductive, insulating, probably superconducting and magnetic 2D materials in one stack with atomic precision, fine-tuning the performance of the resulting material. Furthermore, the functionality of such stacks is �embedded� in the design of such heterostructure. We will create several types of devices based on such heterostructures, including tunnelling transistors, charge and spin drag, photodetectors, solarcells, lasers and other optical and electronic components. As the range of available 2D materials broadens, so the possible functionality of the 2D-based heterostructures will cover larger and larger area. We will concentrate on creating and understanding of the prototypes of such hetersotructures and apply efforts in developing methods for their mass-production suitable for various applications. The development of such novel paradigm in material science will only by possible by bringing together a Synergy group of researchers with complementary skills, knowledge and resources.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"319277","fundValue":"13352308","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2019-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
