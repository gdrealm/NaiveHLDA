{"id":"185397","title":"Vascular remodelling and miRNA therapeutics","abstractText":"'The central hypothesis of VascmiR is that microRNAs (miRs) fundamentally control pathological remodelling of the vasculature. The complexity of vascular bed heterogeneity and subsequent response to injury, the potential importance of miRNA in vascular pathology and the paucity in knowledge relating to many facets of miRNA function in the vessel wall including target pathways, mechanistic features of miRNA-mediated cell:cell communication mediated by miRNA export and uptake etc. provides an excellent opportunity for groundbreaking basic and translational research in the field. VascmiR will envelop these concepts in a broad, cutting edge portfolio of high risk and in-depth studies that encompass fundamental research, mouse genetics to create novel models and miR intervention studies in small and large animal models coupled with targeted miRNA therapeutics. Collective synergy by assessing pulmonary as well as peripheral venous and arterial pathological vascular remodelling models of disease under a single funding mechanism will afford substantial scientific advancement. VascmiR will go beyond current state-of-the-art and create new knowledge of miRNA in vascular pathologies, all of which have \timportant unmet clinical need. VascmiR will streamline fundamental new opportunities for targeted miRNA-based therapeutics to improve human health in cardiovascular setting. I envisage that a co-ordinated, multifaceted and integrative programme in these vascular pathology settings to better understand the mechanistic role of miRNA in vascular remodelling will have a major impact on the field, leading to early translation of advanced miRNA therapeutics in the vasculature.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"338991","fundValue":"2494944","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2019-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
