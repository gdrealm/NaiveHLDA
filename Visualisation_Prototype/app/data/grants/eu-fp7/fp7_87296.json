{"id":"87296","title":"A combined approach to smart imaging agents- using heterometallic lanthanide complexes as diagnostics","abstractText":"'This proposal aims to develop new contrast agents, derived from heterobinuclear lanthanide complexes, for use in imaging. These will combine the interesting properties of gadolinium complexes used in magnetic resonance imaging with those of luminescent lanthanide ions used in time-resolved micrscopy and assay applications.  Our aims are fourfold, namely: To develop synthetic strategies which allow us to prepare heterometallic complexes suitable for multimodal imaging, using multi-component reactions or approaches involving diazo coupling to access these complexes; To develop methods by which nucleotide or PNA recognition domains are used to facilitate rapid transport of imaging components and programmed self-assembly of the multimodal imaging edifice at the target site; To develop switchable multi-modal agents, whose properties are altered by chemical or electrochemical change; and To prepare and study a range of multimodal imaging agents that can be targeted to cell surface receptors, and which have sufficiently high relaxivity to provide meaningful MRI contrast at low concentrations.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"221281","fundValue":"177740.04","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
