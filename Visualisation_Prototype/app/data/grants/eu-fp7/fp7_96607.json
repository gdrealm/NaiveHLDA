{"id":"96607","title":"Development of Synthetic Jet Actuator Hardware for the Green Regional Aircraft Low Noise Configuration","abstractText":"'Call JTI-CS-2009-1-GRA-02-003 requires an effective, efficient and reliable Synthetic Jet Actuator (SJA) system to be supplied as a complete plug-and play unit for wind tunnel testing. Based on recent experience gained in the EU FP6 AVERT programme in which this capability was demonstrated, the University of Manchester (UoM) proposes to develop such a system in conjunction with the manufacturing and windtunnel operational expertise of the Aircraft Research Association (ARA). The proposal has the potential to considerably advance the state of the art in SJA technology through use of a novel scalable cantilever based electro-mechanical conversion element. The AVERT system and others show that UoM and ARA will have the ability to produce an advanced system based on the best realization of the current diaphragm-based concept as a risk reduction measure, in order to ensure that the objectives of the call are met.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255797","fundValue":"145682.4","fundStart":"2010-02-15","fundEnd":"2011-04-14","dataset":"fp7"}
