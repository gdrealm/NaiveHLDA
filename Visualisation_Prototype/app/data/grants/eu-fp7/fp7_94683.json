{"id":"94683","title":"Territorial politics in Ukraine during transition from authoritarian rule","abstractText":"'This project is aimed at studying the interconnection between territorial politics and democratization processes in Ukraine. The project will bring new knowledge on this crucial EU partner and uncover a huge explanatory potential of territorial politics in Ukraine by studying the changes in distribution of political and economic power between national and sub-state levels, sub-state territorial politics, and territorial strategies across the country. The research will seek to apply theoretical insights and methodological tools of the Western European / North American tradition of studying territorial politics to complement work in the post-Soviet studies tradition on democratic practices in Ukraine. Conducting research through a territory-centred prism of analysis will complement the vision of democratization, which is provided by a state-centred approach of the field of post-Soviet studies. This will contribute to a broader understanding of democratization processes and generate new ideas on how democratic transformation is driven from sub-state levels. The project will use quantitative and qualitative research methods. The knowledge transfer strategy of the project includes presenting its results at informal series of seminars at the Institute of Governance, preparing two conference papers and two journal articles, organization of an international workshop on territorial politics in Eastern and Western Europe and presenting its results as an edited volume, and preparing an academic course �Territorial Politics of Ukraine in Comparative Perspective�. Also, the added value of this research will go beyond academia. The project will create favorable conditions for long-lasting cooperation of European and Ukrainian experts on sub-state democratic processes.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255522","fundValue":"164040.8","fundStart":"2010-09-13","fundEnd":"2012-09-12","dataset":"fp7"}
