{"id":"110825","title":"A step-change in sensitivity for two dimensional laser infrared spectroscopy","abstractText":"'Here, we propose a novel design for a significantly improved detector for the emerging field of coherent two-dimension infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy, which is an optical analog of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR). 2DIR is a cutting edge technique which is rapidly growing and has applications in subjects as diverse as energy sciences, biophysics, biomedical research and physical chemistry. Currently, the single most important technical problem that is generally agreed to limit applications of the methodology is the sensitivity with which the signals are measured. Having worked on multiple stabilisation techniques during the ERC funded research it was realised that a straightforward design alteration of the infrared detector will improve the sensitivity very significantly, theoretically by more than one order of magnitude. Here, the technical principles are explained, and a plan for commercialising the instrument in collaboration with the current market leader - Infrared System Development Corp. (ISDC) -. We apply for funding to develop the prototype.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"620070","fundValue":"168223.18","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
