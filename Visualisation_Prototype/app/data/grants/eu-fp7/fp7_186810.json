{"id":"186810","title":"Hydrothermal Biomass Upgrade into Carbon Materials and Levulinic Acid for Sustainable Catalysis","abstractText":"'The goal of this proposal is the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into both nanostructured materials as well as valuable chemical platforms for biofuels production. This will be accomplished in one single hydrothermal treatment step.\nThe resulting nanostructured carbons will be used as heterogenous catalysts for the conversion of  the bio-derived chemicals from the liquid phase into biofuels. We will particularly focus on the conversion of biomass-generated levulinic acid into levulinate esters, gama-valerolactone and valerate esters using low cost biomass-derived carbon catalysts.\nThis will offer a closed cycle on biomass upgrade where both solid carbonaceous materials as well as liquid chemicals can be easily produced and further exploited for renewable energy purposes with zero emissions.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"631092","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
