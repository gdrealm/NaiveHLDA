{"id":"98843","title":"Deformation Theory and Moduli Spaces in Algebraic Geometry","abstractText":"'We will look for proving a number of different results in Deformation Theory and Moduli Spaces in algebraic geometry.  In our project, we will mainly use the modern language of algebraic geometry, based on DGLAs and L-infinity algebras.\n\nAs first objective, we seek to give an explicit description of the DGLA controlling infinitesimal deformations of morphisms of schemes.\nWe will also try to extend this construction to the case of morphisms of stacks. In particular, we will be dealing with the key case of morphisms from a singular curve in a smooth variety (like the case of stable maps).\n\nOnce we have the DGLA for this problem, we will attempt  to define a semiregularity map.\nBy semi-regularity map we mean a map whose kernel contains all obstructions to deformations. This map will allow us  to handle the problem of  obstructions, providing  a technical tool to understand the local behavior of  the associated moduli space (in particular the one  of stable maps).\n\nMoreover, we will try to apply these techniques to construct new examples of dg-schemes and dg- manifolds.\n\nFinally, we will seek to use all these new tools for computing new Gromov-Witten invariants. Mainly, we will be dealing with the cases in which the classical theory fails, working out new examples of  reduced Gromov-Witten invariants.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"273285","fundValue":"193349.6","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
