{"id":"88901","title":"Solid State Energy Efficient Cooling","abstractText":"'We propose to develop a high efficiency heat pump and an air conditioner based on a magnetic refrigeration cycle. Both devices will operate at room temperature. The core materials research will centre around the identification, synthesis, modeling and production of low cost, environmentally friendly magnetic refrigerant materials that operate in low magnetic fields and the synthesis and production of inexpensive permanent magnets ï¿½ the two key materials components of a magnetic cooling engine. By involvement of an SME, a medium scale materials manufacturer and a major systems end-user, we will ensure industrially-guided feedback on materials design and performance. Furthermore, we will have the opportunity to integrate and assess our materials with the systems components (heat exchangers, motors and pumps) required to produce a heat pump and an air conditioner by completion of the project.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"214864","fundValue":"3272050.8","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
