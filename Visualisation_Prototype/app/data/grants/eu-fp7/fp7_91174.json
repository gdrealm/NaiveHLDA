{"id":"91174","title":"Cities and science communication: innovative approaches to engaging the public","abstractText":"'Science cities are becoming increasingly important across Europe. Their central strategic aim appears to be boosting the knowledge economy nationally and to support the goals defined in the Lisbon strategy. In order to do this, it is important that the �triple helix� of universities and research organisations, business and the public sector work together to ensure that research and development (R&D) and innovation is world-class. The premise of science cities is that the best place for this interaction to happen spatially is within cities; where all actors are present. However, to significantly improve quality of life in urban areas, it is also necessary to address the extra dimension of public engagement in science in the more recently termed quadruple helix. An engaged public can make informed choices about the way they live; they can participate in scientific debate; they are able to look critically at mediated information provision and they can contribute more effectively to the knowledge economy. The Science in Society work strand of FP7 will allow the CASC project to form a wide geographical network able to explore best practice and exchange different ideas on ways of working to improve the ways in which �the public� might be engaged in science. A central aim of the project will be dissemination of this best practice through new media and open events; it will culminate with development of policy recommendations for the European Commission, but also for national, regional and sub-regional levels of governance.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"229642","fundValue":"1119582.39","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
