{"id":"95939","title":"Advanced Surface Protection for Improved Reliability PCB Systems","abstractText":"'To investigate the scope, extent and factors causing black pad and related problems on printed circuit boards with an electroless nickel / immersion gold (ENIG) solderable finish . To develop a non-destructive test method to show the presence of black pad. To develop and test lower cost, less aggressive surface protection chemistries as replacements for conventional ENIG using both aqueous and ionic liquid based electrolytes. To introdude these to the European PCB industry and to support the introductiuon of new standards around their use.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"243626","fundValue":"3011558.86","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
