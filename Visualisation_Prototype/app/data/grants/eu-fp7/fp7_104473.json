{"id":"104473","title":"China-EU FDI","abstractText":"'The CHEUFDI (China-EU FDI) project aims at providing a comprehensive outlook of Chinese companiesï¿½ investment behaviour in the EU, together with an assessment of their positive and negative impacts on the European economy and growth strategies. The objectives are to map and analyse outward Chinese investments in the EU, highlighting their areas of concentration and countries/sectors of choice, and to evaluate their impact on the EU recovery.\nThis analysis will be carried out at macro and micro-economic level by the three cooperating institutions, Coventry University Business School (CU), Grenada University of Economics (UGR) and Jiangxi University of Economics and Finance (JUFE). The project will also establish a standing working group for investigation on the Chinese presence in Europe, with the three partners as founding institutions. The group will build on the project's outcomes and will provide an opportunity for training and research in international business studies to graduate and post-graduate students.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"318947","fundValue":"163800","fundStart":"2013-01-07","fundEnd":"2016-01-06","dataset":"fp7"}
