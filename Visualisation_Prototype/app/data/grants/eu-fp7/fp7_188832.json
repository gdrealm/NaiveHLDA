{"id":"188832","title":"European Reanalysis of the Global Climate System","abstractText":"'Production of an extended climate reanalysis of the 20th century, with consistent descriptions of the global atmosphere, ocean, land-surface, cryosphere, and the carbon cycle. Production of a new reanalysis of the satellite era with near-real time data updates for climate monitoring. Research and development in various aspects of coupled data assimilation to improve the use of observations in future fully coupled earth-system reanalysis productions. Preparation of input data sets required for reanalysis, including uncertainty assessments, homogenisation, data reprocessing. Data rescue activities aimed at improving climate reanalysis capabilities, including imaging and digitisation of historic in-situ observations as well as recovery and assessment of early satellite data records. Development of data services and visualisation tools for reanalysis output products, and for the observations used to create them.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"607029","fundValue":"15890993.18","fundStart":"2013-11-11","fundEnd":"2017-01-01","dataset":"fp7"}
