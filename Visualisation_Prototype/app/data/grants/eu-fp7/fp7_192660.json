{"id":"192660","title":"Engineering model of the Global Atmospheric Electric Circuit","abstractText":"I propose here the possibility of modelling the global atmospheric electric circuit as a network of electrical elements and simulating it using existing engineering software for simulations of electrical circuits. With the use of new findings in the area of atmospheric electricity and newest data sets and models of atmospheric parameters this model gives an attractive prospect of extensive studies in this field.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"203298","fundValue":"30000","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
