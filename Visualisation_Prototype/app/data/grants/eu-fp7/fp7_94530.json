{"id":"94530","title":"Power System Wide-area GPS Synchronized Monitoring with Phasor Measurements and Low-Frequency Oscillation Mitigation Analysis","abstractText":"'Electric power is essential to modern society. Economic prosperity, national security, and standard of living depend on reliable electric power systems. But increases in open access transactions, heavy loading, weak connections, hidden failure in protection, and other unexpected events may cause the system to lose balance and even lead to catastrophic failures. To compete in the new global market, European industry must have a more sustainable energy system and increase the efficiency, flexibility, safety, reliability and quality of the European electricity systems and networks. Thus, there is the need for a new action to bring Europe up to date with the state-of-the-art power system measurement, control and protection ideas, methodologies, tools and techniques. As a new class of measurement, synchronized phasor measurements greatly elevate the availability as well as the quality of data and information useful to improve system monitoring, protection, control, and operation of the increasingly stressed power systems. The project proposed here consists of syncronized phase measurement and the study of low-frequency oscillation mitigation. The major objective of this project is to enhance the available knowledge and tools that will promote a better system-wide monitoring accuracy and devolop new control and reliability tools for electricity systems through the applications of synchronized phasor measurements. Therefore, the project which is of considerable importance in contemporary electrical science as well as for numerous technological applications will focus on the specific research topics as following: 1) Study on the method of optimal PMU placement; 2) An alternative for including phasor measurements in state estimators; 3) Synchronized frequency measurements under dynamics; 4) Study on low-frequency oscillation characteristics and mitigation method; 5)Adaptive out-of-step protection and control using wide area measurement.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235880","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2010-06-14","fundEnd":"2011-12-13","dataset":"fp7"}
