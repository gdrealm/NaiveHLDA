{"id":"89325","title":"Engineered Nanoparticles: Review of Health and Environmental Safety","abstractText":"'The overall aim of the ENRHES project is to perform a comprehensive scientific review of the health and environmental safety of fullerenes, CNTs, metal and metal oxide nanomaterials. The review will consider sources, pathways of exposure, the health and environmental outcomes of concern, in the context informing the regulation of the potential risks of engineered nanoparticles.  We will employ a standardised information management strategy and a matrix approach to maximise the gain to partners and beneficiaries involved with the review.      The specific objectives will be to review information on:  � production, use and exposure to the target engineered nanomaterials � persistence, bioaccumulation and interactions of the engineered nanoparticles in living & environmental systems; � differences in toxicity posed by variations in size, type and chemical composition.  On the basis of the review, prioritised recommendations on each of the above points will be developed and set in the context of informing policy makers in the development of methods to address exposure as it relates to the potential hazards posed by engineered nanoparticles, and in the development of appropriate regulation.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"218433","fundValue":"279659","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
