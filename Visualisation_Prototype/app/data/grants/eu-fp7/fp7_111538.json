{"id":"111538","title":"Innovative Reuse of All Tyre Components in Concrete","abstractText":"An estimated one billion tyres are discarded each year. Post-Consumer tyre arisings for EU countries (2010) are 3.4M tonnes per year. At the moment nearly 50% of all recycled tyres/components still end up as fuel, in low grade applications or in landfill.\n\nAll tyre constituents (rubber, high strength steel cord and wire, high strength textile reinforcement) are high quality materials and deserve to be reused for their relevant properties.\n\nConstruction is the highest user of materials with concrete being the most popular structural material. Concrete is inherently brittle in compression (unless suitably confined) and weak in tension and, hence, it is normally reinforced with steel bars or fibres. The authors believe that highly confined rubberised concrete can lead to highly deformable concrete elements and structures and that tyre steel and textile fibres can be used as concrete reinforcement to control shrinkage cracking.\n\nHence, the aim of this proposal is to develop innovative solutions to reuse all tyre components in high value innovative concrete applications with reduced environmental impact.\n\nTo achieve this aim, the proposed project will have to overcome scientific and technological challenges in:\n� Development of novel confined rubberised concrete materials and reinforcement\n� Development of high deformability RC elements suitable for integral bridge elements and base isolation systems for vibrations and seismic applications\n� Development of concrete mixes using recycled steel fibres for use in various applications such as slabs on grade, suspended slabs, precast concrete elements and pumpable  self compacting concrete or screed\n� Development of concrete mixes using recycled tyre polymer fibres for crack control\n� Development of novel concrete applications using combinations of the different tyre by-products\n� Undertaking demonstrations projects using the developed materials/applications\n� Development and implementation of standardised LCA/LCCA protocols","grantUrl":"","grantId":"603722","fundValue":"4499466.8","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
