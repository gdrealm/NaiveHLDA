{"id":"108921","title":"CompAct highly mobile Next generation construction, Demolition and excavation waste recoverY system","abstractText":"The enclosed project focuses on the Sustainable building products and the Materials recycling priority of the 2011 CIP ECO-INNOVATION call and is focused on the development and validation of an advanced Aggregate washing system for the construction and recycling sector.\nAt present the CD&E Waste recycling sector is dominated by contractors employing traditional crushing and dry screening methods. This results in poor quality aggregate, highly variable product quality standards and lost commercial opportunity for the EU construction and demolition sector. Aggregate washing enables effective recycling, creates commercial product with added value and diverts material away from landfill.\n\nThe CANDY project will focus on the development of the next generation of washing plant for the recycling of Construction, Demolition & Excavation (CD&E) waste. The project will see the implementation of advanced liquid / solid separating technology and the creation of a genuine mobile road transportable washing system. A key element of the project will be to replicate the high level of aggregate recycling that takes place in the UK (in 2009 23% of aggregates were from recycled sources) into a wider European context where aggregate recycling ranges from 0-19%. If we achieve this level of replication we would prevent the extraction of 560m tonnes of virgin aggregate per year.\n\nThe application is led by a leading UK SME developer of aggregate washing systems (CDE Global), to develop the next generation of washing system. The lead SME requires the support from European partners that provide critical system component technologies and access to waste streams in continental Europe. The key output for this project will be the development and demonstration of the CANDY Aggregate washing system operating in different continental setting on differing (C,D&E) waste steams to fully validate the system performance against ambitious commercial and environmental objectives.\n\n","grantUrl":"","grantId":"304362","fundValue":"1750734","fundStart":"2012-09-14","fundEnd":"2014-12-13","dataset":"fp7"}
