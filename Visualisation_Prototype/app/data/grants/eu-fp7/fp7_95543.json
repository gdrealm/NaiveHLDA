{"id":"95543","title":"\"GWAS, endophenotypes and gene environment interactions in eating disorders\"","abstractText":"'Eating disorders (EDs) are diseases predominantly affecting young women. The existing scheme for classifying these disorders is unsatisfactory and anomalous for both clinical practice and research. Research in the field of weight related disorders needs to examine the specificity of endophenotype (in most cases most of the criteria have only been met for AN). We will use an integrated multidisciplinary approach to identify genetic, behavioral and cultural underpinning of various endophenotpyes (phenotype and/or genotype) and the interplay between genetic and environmental factors through high quality, adaptive collaborations between various institutions in Europe and the United States. We hope that such an approach will refine our models of EDs so as to facilitate the development of innovative, and more targeted treatment strategies with improved outcomes. A structured dialogue will integrate ethical, social legal and wider issues, and disseminate through training of the applicant in the host institution (Institute of Psychiatry, King�s College London, UK). The purpose of the training is to develop the next generation of a highly skilled independent investigator in the field of EDs. The applicant will receive advanced training in disordered eating related research (from �cell to society�) along with intensive training focused on her chosen areas of interest (e.g., genetics, endophenotypes and gene environment interactions). The fellow will emerge with a rich, integrated understanding of both the phenotypic aspects of EDs, as well as new skills in genetics that she will then use to develop further collaborations across Europe. This will strengthen the ERA; improve the skills and mobility of the applicant and the expertise of clinicians, patients, carers and families.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254774","fundValue":"172740.8","fundStart":"2010-07-30","fundEnd":"2012-07-29","dataset":"fp7"}
