{"id":"103082","title":"Energy Systems Engineering","abstractText":"'The main idea of the ESE proposed project is to exchange and transfer knowledge between 3 European Research groups (Imperial College - UK, University of Pannonia - Hungary and Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece) and 3 distinguished and top university groups from China (Tsinghua University and Fudan University) and Korea (Yonsei University). The selected groups are leaders in the energy systems engineering field and working following different approaches and for different industrial case studies. Thus, the ESE proposed project will practically implement its programme through the following main activities:\n(i) Short-term secondments (2-6 months) of 86 researcher months from EU research groups and\n82 researchers months from the Chinese and Korean partners (WP1). A well balanced scheme\nof both Early-stage (PhD students) and experienced researchers will participate in the exchanges.\n(ii)  Short-term selected research projects covering a range of challenging energy systems engineering problems which will provide the basis for the transfer of knowledge activities (WP2)\n(iii) Organisation and implementation of a well-structured training programme including trainings\ncourses, seminars, workshops and summer schools open to external and industrial participants\n(WP3).\n(iv) A well structured dissemination and exploitation plan including joint publications in peer\nreviewed international journals, joint conference presentations, presentation to the industrial partners of the consortium, and a web portal to facilitate internal communication other dissemination activities (WP4).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"294987","fundValue":"352800","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
