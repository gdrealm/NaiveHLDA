{"id":"107196","title":"Impact of Magnetic Fields on Electrochemistry - Fundamental Aspects and Fututre Applications","abstractText":"'The aim of this project is the fundamental understanding of the various possible impacts of magnetic fields on electrochemical processes. The area has hitherto been plagued with controversy and irreproducibility between different laboratories. The project will resolve these issues, to the ultimate benefit of applied electrochemistry, by novel carefully designed and well-controlled experiments allied to rigorous theoretical modelling. Two analytical methods that enable precise control of the various electrochemical parameters will be applied in presence of magnetic fields for the first time: nanoparticle impact based chronoamperometry and voltammetry in weakly supported electrolytes. Theoretical modelling will enable the applicant to distinguish between individual magnetic field effects and to quantify them. The gained knowledge on fundamentals will be used to set up proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating the benefit of applying magnetic fields in future real world devices. Superior performance of photocatalytic cells and sensor devices shall be demonstrated to emphasise the relevance of magnetoelectrochemistry for future technologies. For the successes of this project the fellowship of the applicant, Dr. Kristina Tschulik, and the scientist in charge, Prof. Richard Compton, is crucial since the first has a strong background in magnetoelectrochemistry, while the latter has unique expertise in analytical and theoretical chemistry and in transferring research results to industrial applications. The host of this fellowship will be the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oxford, which provides all required devices and a modern world-class infrastructure for training of the applicant in a vast variety of scientific and complementary skills.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327706","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
