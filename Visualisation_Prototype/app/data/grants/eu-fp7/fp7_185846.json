{"id":"185846","title":"Enhancing Thermal Properties of PCM Using Nano Materials","abstractText":"'Energy Storage Technologies have long been a subject of great interest from both academia and industry and are crucial for achieving the European climate energy objectives as defined in the European Union�s (EU) �20-20-20� targets  and in the European  Commission�s   Energy Roadmap 2050. The focus of this proposal is on Latent Heat Storage which is currently a key international priority and  is based on the use of Phase Change Materials (PCMs).\n\nOne of the major challenges in the development of compact high performance Latent Heat Storage  systems is the low heat conductivity of such PCMs.\n\nThe   main objective  of this project  is to perform systematic rheological, micro-structural and morphological analysis of the PCM composites with a combination of various nano-carbon additives with up to 5 wt%. Such parameters as the  geometrical shape, orientation, alignment, cohesion, dispersion, distribution and interaction (contact) of nano-carbon particles with each other and PCM matrix will have a most significant influence and define the thermo-physical properties  of PCM composites. Two types of PCMs will be investigated which includes  organic (paraffin) and inorganic (crystallohydrate) materials with operating temperatures in the range between 60 and 100 deg.C.\n\nA correlation will be established between the rheology, micro-structure and morphology parameters and thermo-physical properties of the PCM composites.  Such correlation will be used in manufacturing advanced cost effective PCM composites with optimised rheology, morphology and  microstructure parameters  and thermo-physical properties.\n\nAdditionally thermal cycling tests of the selected new PCM composites will be performed  to determine deterioration of  thermal properties in time.\n\nOutcomes of the project will be used by a number of industrial companies across EU engaged in production of PCMs and Latent Heat Storage systems for various industrial and domestic applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"622883","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2014-05-19","fundEnd":"2016-05-18","dataset":"fp7"}
