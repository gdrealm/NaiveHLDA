{"id":"104998","title":"Towards Sustainable Zero Carbon Transport through Innovation Procurement","abstractText":"'The TRANS-FORM project will apply both proven and emerging methodologies for innovation procurement to the diverse and complex area of sustainable transport in cities.  It will thus advance the state-of-the-art in general and help accelerate the much needed market transformation in this important area for European society and Innovation Partnerships.  A tripartite core group of nine organisations will carry out the project and draw on their existing networks of public authorities, major companies that will control extensive supply chains and national/regional innovation agencies.  It will be led by innovation procurement experts from the UK and the Netherlands that will provide practical know-how and proven methodologies. The public/private sector procurement community will be represented by City Councils from Barcelona, Birmingham and Rotterdam for the public sector and also the EU Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change.  Innovation Agencies from Poland, Spain and the UK will complete the triangular partnership and provide the gateway to the fruits of FP7, national R&D and the most innovative companies in Europe.\n\nSince it will build on a strong foundation of previous European/national initiatives, the three year project will go well beyond the networking stage.  A larger group of influential organisations from both the procurement and innovation communities will engage in joint procurement strategy development activities through procurement foresight workshops.  The objective will be to facilitate collaborative procurement projects that have sufficient critical mass to achieve market transformation and replication impacts.  These will be realised through leader-led actions and/or joint statements of procurement demand (Compacts) involving both the core consortium and a wider group of associated procurers.  The lessons learned will be disseminated widely through case study publications and existing networks of procurement professionals.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"316356","fundValue":"936713.8","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
