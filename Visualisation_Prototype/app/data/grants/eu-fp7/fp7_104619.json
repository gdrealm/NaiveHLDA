{"id":"104619","title":"Innovative Modelling for Pharmacological Advances through Collaborative Training","abstractText":"'This project forms an interdisciplinary collaborative partnership between AstraZeneca (AZ, Sweden) and the University of Warwick (UoW, UK) to train Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) in systems modelling tools and techniques enabling them to perform research projects at the forefront of international pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis. This project will build upon extremely strong research and training links already formed between the UoW and AZ (UK) in PK/PD modelling and will support the clearly identified need within AZ worldwide to train more personnel with high-level skills in systems modelling for future drug development.\nThe most effective drugs are those that produce clinical benefit by modulating disease biology and are given to patients at an optimal dose and schedule. In order to deliver new drugs it is necessary to quantify, translate and simulate from the test tube to the patient. This includes being able to model biological pathways, quantify relationships between dose/exposure, target engagement, efficacy and safety in pre-clinical tests and humans and utilising all relevant information efficiently and quantitatively. The development and application of innovative modelling techniques to tackle current problems in drug development allied to the training of researchers with skills to perform these tasks are key drivers for the partners.\nA unique blend of multidisciplinary training will be offered to the ESRs by both partners through well-established, extensive and innovative programmes at their sites with the appointed ESRs registered for PhDs at the UoW. The ESR projects will be based on research problems and data generated at AZ. The outcomes of the projects will not only maintain the positions of AZ and the UoW at the forefront of international research in PK/PD analysis, but also greatly enhance the EUï¿½s standing worldwide in this area, whilst also enhancing the future job prospects of those trained within the AZ group worldwide'","grantUrl":"http://www.csr-impact.eu","grantId":"316736","fundValue":"1467958.8","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
