{"id":"186692","title":"Potential Antimalarial and Anticancer Lead Compound Discovery from Cameroonian Medicinal Plants","abstractText":"'Cameroon enjoys a rich biota including a plethora of medicinal plants, which have traditionally been used for hundreds of\nyears to treat various ailments, and form the basis of the countryï¿½s primary healthcare system. Medicinal plants of the\ngenera Fagara (F: Rutaceae), and Hannoa and Pierreodendron (F: Simaroubaceae) belong to the Cameroonian flora, and\nare used by the local people to treat malaria, cancer, rheumatism, bacterial infections, pain, inflammations, typhoid, skin\ninfection and other serious disorders. Previous studies carried out on certain species of these genera afforded various\nphytochemicals (quassinoids, furoquinoleine, acridones, cathinone alcaloids, triterpenoids and steroids) and revealed\ninteresting pharmacological properties (cytotoxicity, antiplasmadial activities). This project proposes to employ a\ncombination of chemical fingerprinting-based dereplication, assay-guided fractionation and reversed-phase preparative high\nperformance chromatographic methods to identify potential anticancer and antimalarial lead compounds from plants of the\ngenera mentioned above, selected on the basis of ethnobotanical information as well as literature data. The structures of\nthe isolated compounds will be elucidated by spectroscopic means (UV, IR, MS, NMR and X-ray). Structural modification to\nincrease activity of compounds will be carried out applying modern semisynthetic approaches in order to establish structureactivity\nrelationships. Total synthesis will also be carried out to increase to quantity of the lead compounds. Suitable in vitro\nbioassays, relevant to cytotoxicity, antimalarial and toxicity determination will be utilised to aid isolation processes as well as\nfor the determination of bioactive potencies of the isolated lead compounds. The main objective is to discover and develop\nbioactive natural products and their analogues as clinical trial candidates.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"629482","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
