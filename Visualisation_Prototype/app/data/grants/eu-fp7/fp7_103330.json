{"id":"103330","title":"Sustainable Hydrothermal Manufacturing of Nanomaterials","abstractText":"'It is vital that nanomanufacturing routes facilitate an increase in production whilst being 'green', sustainable, low cost and capable of producing high quality materials. Continuous hydrothermal synthesis is an enabling and underpinning technology that is ready to prove itself at industrial scale as a result of recent breakthroughs in reactor design which suggest that it could now be scaled over 100 tons per annum. Academic specialists with international reputations in reactor modelling and kinetics and metrology will develop the �know how� needed to scale up the current pilot scale system. Selected project partners with expertise in sustainability modelling and life cycle assessment will quantify the environmental impact and benefits of a process that uses water as a recyclable solvent, whilst producing the highest quality, dispersed and formulated products. In addition to scale up production, the process will be improved through case studies with industrial end users in four key areas � printed electronics with SOVY; surface coatings with CRF, PPG and SOVY; healthcare and medical with ENDOR and CERA; hybrid polymers and materials with TopGaN and REPSOL. Further value will be added to the Project by working on new materials that have been identified as key future targets but cannot be currently made, or made in significant quantities. The consortium is founded on the principle that the whole value chain (from nanoparticle production to final product) must be involved in the development of the technology. This will not only inform the development stages of the production process but also maximise �market pull�, rather than simply relying on subsequent �technology push�.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"280983","fundValue":"9557846.64","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
