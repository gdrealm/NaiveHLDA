{"id":"96859","title":"\"Micro/Nano Exploration, Manipulation and Assembly: Telehaptics and Virtual Reality System Development and Investigation of Biomechanics and Neuroscience of Touch\"","abstractText":"'The primary objective of the proposed project is to develop robot mediated human interface technologies to manually explore, manipulate and assemble progressively smaller objects ranging from micro- to nano-meter scales and a secondary objective is to demonstrate the power of the interface system in the investigation of the fundamental mechanics and neural mechanisms of touch. The proposed system will consist of a master-slave robotic teleoperation (TO) subsystem and a virtual reality (VR) subsystem. The master robot will enable the user to touch, feel and manipulate (1) real micro/nano structures through the slave robot or (2) computer models of micro/nano structures in the virtual reality environment. Specific aims of this effort are as follows: (1) design and develop a custom master system to enable the user to have real-time visual, auditory, and bimanual haptic interactions; (2) design and develop a slave system consisting of microscopes and manipulators progressively augmented to enable micro to nano-precision movements and forces; (3) develop modular software architecture with device abstraction to support multiple master and slave devices; (4) integrate virtual reality software to enable the user to have real-time visual, auditory, and bimanual interactions with virtual models at micro- to nano-meter scales based on empirical data or to test hypotheses; (5) use the system to perform biomechanics and neurophysiology experiments at progressively micro- to nano-precision movements and forces; (6) develop mathematical models of mechanotransduction for quantitative understanding of touch mechanisms at multiple scales.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247401","fundValue":"3264188","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
