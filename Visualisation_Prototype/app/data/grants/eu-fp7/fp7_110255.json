{"id":"110255","title":"Individualised Diagnostics and Rehabilitation of Attention","abstractText":"'We propose a training network based around a linked set of research projects which attempt to improve the diagnosis and rehabilitation of neuropsychological disorders of attention, with each project linked to an external industrial partner in order to commercialise emerging diagnostic and rehabilitation procedures. New diagnostic procedures will link clinical measures of attentional disorders to a detailed mathematical account, which can in turn be linked to computational models of neuronal function. These behavioural measures will be integrated with brain imaging indices (using fMRI, EEG, MEG) to explain attentional disorders at a neural as well as a functional level. The emerging diagnostic procedures will be used to target individualised rehabilitation for patients, assessing effects of direct brain stimulation, EEG-based biofeedback, cognitive training of attention, and drug intervention. Each project will operate across both academic and industrial partners in the network, giving a unique commercial orientation to the training. Overall the project will advance neuropsychological diagnostics and rehabilitation, while giving trainees state-of-the-art inter-disciplinary research and entrepreneurial skills.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"606901","fundValue":"3723247","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
