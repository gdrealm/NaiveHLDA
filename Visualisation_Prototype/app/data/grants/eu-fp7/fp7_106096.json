{"id":"106096","title":"Bringing Human Neuromotor Intelligence to Robots","abstractText":"'The H2R project will bring a solid theoretical understanding of human neuromotor control, and develop novel control methods for robots interacting with environments and with humans, based on  human control strategies for interactions. The biomimetic motor behaviour for robots will perform better than the existing robotic controllers, and closer to human performance in terms of compliant interaction with the environment and adaptation to its dynamic characteristics, intrinsic safety and reliability, and energy efficiency. This novel controller will be implemented and demonstrated on rehabilitation and cooperative robots, in collaboration with European partners. This project may deeply impact applications where successful task completion requires people and robots to collaborate directly in a shared workspace.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"275078","fundValue":"194849.6","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
