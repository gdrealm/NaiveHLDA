{"id":"92197","title":"Integrated Interventional Imaging Operating System","abstractText":"'The scope of the present consortium is to provide technology and training for the integration of ultrasound and biophotonics based imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to define the specs of an Integrated Interventional Imaging Operating System (III OS) aimed at minimal invasive treatment of common life-threatening disorders, e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease and structural heart defects. Effective therapy of these conditions will require a range of safe surgical and interventional devices used with the necessary visualization and tracking under real-time image guidance. The consortium includes a critical mass of industrial and university research institute partners with high expertise in design, development, and manufacture of these devices and instruments. To ensure medical the safety and economical usability of the system and to allow an optimal integration into the future hospital workflow, 6 university hospitals will contribute their clinical and administrative expertise to the consortium in the fields of Interventional Radiology/Cardiology, Anaesthesia, Oncology, General and Cardiovascular Surgery and preclinical Image guided procedures. The consortium of the IIIOS research and training process includes two Biomedical Technology Societies: DGBMT and SMIT&amp;MEDIS Foundation in Rumania providing expert networking and conference organization. The is involved in the consortium and will play a key role in the exchange of knowledge and expertise to the new member states of the EU through hosting conferences such SMIT 2009 in Sinaia (www.smit2009.com).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"238802","fundValue":"3712345","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
