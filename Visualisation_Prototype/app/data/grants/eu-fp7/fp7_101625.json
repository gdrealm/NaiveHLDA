{"id":"101625","title":"Modelling of Adaptive Wing Structures","abstractText":"'An adaptive wing tip concept will be developed to enable controlled wash-in and wash-out\nthroughout the entire flight envelope. The concept, based upon adaptive stiffness structures\nenables control of the aeroelastic deflections, and also facilitates gust load alleviation.\nFurthermore, a mathematically based design tool will be developed making use of Reduced Order\nModels (ROMs) of the wing structure and aerodynamics such that an inverse approach can be\nemployed to determine the required sizing of the internal aircraft structure, and also the position\nand sizing of any adaptive structural components and actuators. The adaptive structural concept\nand the inverse ROM approach will be demonstrated and evaluated on two real-size aircraft test\ncases.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"270640","fundValue":"199999.4","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
