{"id":"102651","title":"Intelligent Decision Making Systems in European Business and Economics","abstractText":"'In this proposal we want to develop new decision making models and analyze its usefulness in European business and economic problems. For doing so, we use a wide range of techniques commonly used in the area of soft computing. Especially, we focus on the use of the ordered weighted average (OWA). The OWA operator is an aggregation operator that provides a parameterized family of aggregation operators between the minimum and the maximum. Thus, in decision making it can be used as a tool for measuring the degree of optimism (pessimism) that the decision maker is using in the decision process. We will develop a wide range of new OWA operators by using other tools such as probabilities, weighted averages and distance measures.\nWe will give particular attention to decision making problems in the area of business administration and economics. For example, we will consider problems in the area of financial management, strategic management, human resource selection and public sector management. Some of these models will bring a strong connection with other related areas including politics and law. Political decision making will be a part of our analysis when economic decisions are involved such as the fiscal and monetary policies of a country. Juridical decision making will be also considered especially from the context of the European Union because the establishment of laws needs a previous decision making analysis in order to obtain the most appropriate ones.\nFor doing so, the researcher of this proposal wants to move to the Manchester Business School (MBS) at the University of Manchester to work with Jian-Bo Yang, a leading expert in this area and the Chair of Decision and System Sciences at MBS.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300062","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
