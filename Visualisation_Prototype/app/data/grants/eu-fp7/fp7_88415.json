{"id":"88415","title":"Sustainable Aquaculture Research Networks in Sub Saharan Africa","abstractText":"'The project concept is to build a sustainable aquaculture research network based on academics and other professionals between Europe and Africa, with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. The three-year work plan will strengthen alliances among experienced and emergent players in the African and wider aquaculture scene that will build on an existing framework knowledge resource base and exchange platform - the �Aquaculture Compendium�. Project partners: Institute of Aquaculture, University of Stirling (coordinator; UK); CIRAD (France); WorldFish Center (Egypt), CABI (UK HQ); Asian Institute of Technology (Thailand), Bunda College of Agriculture (Malawi); IRAD (Cameroon); and ETC (Netherlands). This consortium has a balance of expertise in aquaculture research, development and policy information technology; ability to work in different linguistic areas; and a track record in the implementation of activities at local to international levels. The project will work across a wide range of stakeholders (researchers, SMEs, government agencies, NGOs, producers and others) throughout Sub-Saharan Africa; between anglophone and francophone regions in Africa; between Africa and Asia; and between Europe and Africa. In 6 Work Packages, the project will deliver (1) the comprehensive interdisciplinary knowledge base required for Sub-Saharan African aquaculture to develop in a sustainable way; (2) a sustainable process to identify and nurture new initiatives for Sub-Saharan African aquaculture research, with key involvement of European stakeholders; (3) learning and adaptation for Sub-Saharan Africa of the processes  of aquaculture research�into-practice through multi-stakeholder collaboration  of research-to-practice networks developed in Southeast Asia; (4) maximal dissemination of project outputs; and (5) tools to aid policy-making for aquaculture in Africa. Mechanisms will be in place by the project end to enable sustainability of the networks established during the project.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"213143","fundValue":"1216824.4","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
