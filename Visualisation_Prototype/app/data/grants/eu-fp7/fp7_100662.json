{"id":"100662","title":"Development and Manufacture of High Temperature Composite Aero Engine Parts","abstractText":"Cobham will develop and manufacture lightweight carbon fibre reinforced polymer matrix composite test components for the SAGE 4 Geared Turbofan demonstrator. The components will be manufactured from suitable high temperature resistant thermoset resin which is capable of a continuous service temperature of 350ï¿½C. Initial working sessions shall be held to review the candidate components and to develop the draft technical requirement specifications. The composites manufacturing process selection shall be dependent upon the components to be manufactured. A study shall be carried out by Cobham to identify the most cost effective manufacturing route which achieves the required performance requirements for the selected components.\n\nDevelopment of the selected manufacturing process will be conducted in collaboration with MTU so that key design-for-manufacturing requirements are captured. Demonstrator components will be manufactured in accordance with MTU specifications and drawings. Material characterisation data will be generated for unaged and thermally aged test coupons in order to validate the composite designs.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"278483","fundValue":"753112","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
