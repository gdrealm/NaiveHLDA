{"id":"111544","title":"Algorithms and Lower Bounds: A Unified Approach","abstractText":"'One of the fundamental goals of theoretical computer science is to\nunderstand the possibilities and limits of efficient computation. This\nquest has two dimensions. The\ntheory of algorithms focuses on finding efficient solutions to\nproblems, while computational complexity theory aims to understand when\nand why problems are hard to solve. These two areas have different\nphilosophies and use different sets of techniques. However, in recent\nyears there have been indications of deep and mysterious connections\nbetween them.\n\nIn this project, we propose to explore and develop the connections between\nalgorithmic analysis and complexity lower bounds in a systematic way.\nOn the one hand, we plan to use complexity lower bound techniques as inspiration\nto design new and improved algorithms for Satisfiability and other\nNP-complete problems, as well as to analyze existing algorithms better.\nOn the other hand, we plan to strengthen implications yielding circuit\nlower bounds from non-trivial algorithms for Satisfiability, and to derive\nnew circuit lower bounds using these stronger implications.\n\nThis project has potential for massive impact in both the areas of algorithms\nand computational complexity. Improved algorithms for Satisfiability could lead\nto improved SAT solvers, and the new analytical tools would lead to a better\nunderstanding of existing heuristics. Complexity lower bound questions are\nfundamental\nbut notoriously difficult, and new lower bounds would open the way to\nunconditionally secure cryptographic protocols and derandomization of\nprobabilistic algorithms. More broadly, this project aims to initiate greater\ndialogue between the two areas, with an exchange of ideas and techniques\nwhich leads to accelerated progress in both, as well as a deeper understanding\nof the nature of efficient computation.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"615075","fundValue":"1274496","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2019-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
