{"id":"111336","title":"Magnetically Geared Induction Machines","abstractText":"'Magnetic gears offer substantial advantages compared to mechanical gears such as reduced maintenance, improved reliability, minimum acoustic noise and inherent overload protection. Furthermore, magnetic gears can have comparable or better performances than their mechanical counterpart. Physical and hermetic isolation between input and output shafts are also specific to such contactless torque transmission devices.\nThen, the idea of having a magnetic gear and an electrical machine as a single electromechanical device naturally came. The 'pseudo' direct drive (PDD) term has then been employed to describe this device where high-torque, low-speed applications have been considered.\nAt our best knowledge, there is curiously no papers that deal with the PDD concept in which other electrical machines are used instead of PM ones.\nThe research proposed here will focus on some areas where induction machines are usually associated to mechanical gearboxes to transmit the torque from a prime mover to the load.\nThus, when a magnetic gear is integrated on the bore of a conventional induction machine, the resulting PDD device could offer significant advantages in high-speed applications (blowers, fans, compressors, pumps, turbines and spindle machines), wind-powered generation,etc.\nA magnetic gear may be combined with an induction machine in several ways to achieve the PDD.\nTwo topologies of Magnetically Geared Induction Machines (MaGIM) will be studied and one structure devoted to high-speed applications will be constructed and tested.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"330833","fundValue":"231926.4","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
