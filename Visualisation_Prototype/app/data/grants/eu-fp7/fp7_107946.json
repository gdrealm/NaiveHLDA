{"id":"107946","title":"Functional DNA nanomaterials","abstractText":"'Solid phase DNA synthesis is certainly one of the most influential developments of the last century. Together with the understanding of DNA structure and function, not only biology and molecular genetics have advanced significantly, but also new emerging fields such as bio-nanotechnology would not have evolved. The term 'DNA architectonics' is probably most descriptive for the current directions the field of DNA synthesis is taking, where DNA becomes more and more a construction material and intelligent glue while not downgrading its importance in the life sciences.\nThe research proposed here will evaluate novel functional DNA nanomaterials and will significantly advance the field by combining DNA nano-technology with chemically modified nucleosides, incorporating designer molecules to add specific programmed function and apply these systems to make ground breaking advances in electronics, photovoltaics and medicine.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"331952","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
