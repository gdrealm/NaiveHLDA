{"id":"95610","title":"\"Integrability, Symmetry and Quantum Space-time\"","abstractText":"'String theory is a prime candidate for a consistent theory of quantum gravity. It should therefore be able to address fundamental questions, such as the origin and structure of space-time. The key to an understanding of these deep problems is to uncover of the symmetry principles that underlie string theory and to gain control of string theory in its non-perturbative regime. This project is motivated by some of the very recent progress in string theory, which is related to symmetry and integrability: the remarkable achievement in our understanding of the role and applicability of integrability in string and Yang-Mills theory on the one hand, and the discovery of the long sought after description of multiple coincident branes in M-theory. We feel it is extremely timely to form a partnership that combines researchers who have significantly contributed to these recent advances with the hope that our combined effort will lead to a further and deeper understanding of the underlying theory and its properties. Our proposed joint research programme includes two institutes from EU member states and two institutes from third countries: - The Centre for Particle Theory, Durham University, UK (UDUR) - The Max-Planck-Institut fï¿½r Gravitationsphysik, Albert-Einstein-Institut, Potsdam, Germany (AEI); - The Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University, Japan (YITP) - The Center for Quantum Space-time, Sogang University, Korea (CQUeST). This project brings together leading researchers with broad, complementary expertise: from conformal field theory, gauge theory, supergravity, string theory, to the more mathematical aspects of integrable systems and non-commutative geometry, to form a team with the common goal of understanding the fundamental nature of quantum gravity. Moreover, it will support and reinforce collaboration among the participants, help to educate young researchers, and help to develop and establish future long-term research collaboration.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247523","fundValue":"111600","fundStart":"2010-08-19","fundEnd":"2014-08-18","dataset":"fp7"}
