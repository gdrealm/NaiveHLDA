{"id":"185834","title":"USEFUL SUPERCONVERGENCE EXTRACTION FOR FILTERING OF UNDERRESOLVED SOLUTIONS","abstractText":"'The objectives of this proposal include: to investigate how various superconvergent techniques modify the approximation coefficients, and further how this modification changes the spectrum analysis;  to reduce the dissipation resulted from the filtering by addressing SIAC filtering and wave number resolution;  to apply the filtering techniques for nonlinear equations and LES simulations. In order to address these objectives, the Fellow and the Host have together identified the key tasks that need to be undertaken in order to make significant steps in the research area of LES filtering.  We note that this combines the joint talents of the Fellow and the Host.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"622845","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
