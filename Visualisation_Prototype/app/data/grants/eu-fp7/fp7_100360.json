{"id":"100360","title":"Approximate algebraic structure and applications","abstractText":"'This project studies several mathematical topics with a related theme, all of them part of the relatively new discipline known as additive combinatorics.\n\nWe look at approximate, or rough, variants of familiar mathematical notions such as group, polynomial or homomorphism. In each case we seek to describe the structure of these approximate objects, and then to give applications of the resulting theorems. This endeavour has already lead to groundbreaking results in the theory of prime numbers, group theory and combinatorial number theory.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"279438","fundValue":"1000000","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
