{"id":"92488","title":"Formation and evolution of planetary systems","abstractText":"'The goal of this research project is to obtain a global and precise view of protoplanetary disks.  To define a consistent line towards this long term objective, the proposal will rely on 1) an extension of multi-wavelengths modelling of disks, on one by hand, by generalizing this kind of studies to an increasing number of disks, on the other hand, by including complementary observations, in particular coming from very large equipments. This step will go through a continuation of the efforts on numerical modelling to 2) take into account radiative transfer in the gas phase of disks (kinematics and abundances). The long term research programme will take part in a willing to develop 3) an approach linking in complementarity observations and modeling of physical processes within disks so as to bring quantitative observational constraints to the models of disk evolution and planet formation.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"220891","fundValue":"168256.91","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
