{"id":"103635","title":"Reliable and Efficient Combustion of Oxygen/Coal/Recycled Flue Gas Mixtures","abstractText":"Most coal-fired utility boilers are fired with pulverised coal and the use of this technology for power generation far outweighs that of alternatives. The consortium have identified key issues that need to be addressed to pave the way for full-scale deployment of oxy-coal firing. As most previous work has been undertaken at pilot-scale so that, in addition to medium scale demonstration activities, there is also a need for more fundamental underpinning studies to provide improved understanding of oxy-fuel firing technology before it can be taken reliably even to the large scale demonstration stage. The overall aim is to undertake a systematic and focused series of applied research, development and demonstration activities involving both experimental studies and combustion modelling work to resolve existing technical uncertainties and barriers which inhibit commercial deployment of the technology. Attention will be paid to the generation of design rules and methods which can be employed for scaling up results from pilot and laboratory studies to the full-scale. The data obtained in the experimental tests and from the developed modelling tools will be integrated to produce detailed designs for both a retrofit oxy/coal/RFG system for an existing boiler as well as a novel design for �new build� plant. The programme of work will therefore enable full-scale early demonstration plant to be designed and specified with greater confidence as well as providing improved assessment of the commercial risks and opportunities.\n","grantUrl":"","grantId":"268191","fundValue":"9905359.8","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
