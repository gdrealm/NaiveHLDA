{"id":"102786","title":"Food Futures: Providing Independent Research and Advice to Food Businesses and NGOs","abstractText":"'This proposal seeks to develop and advance the potential commercial application of the knowledge acquired during the course of an ERC Advanced Investigator Grant on Consumer culture in an �age of anxiety� (CONANX). The CONANX project (2009-12) examines the extent to which consumer anxieties shape the contemporary food system at all points along the supply chain (from �farm to fork�) and at a variety of geographical scales (from the global scale of agri-food markets and questions of international food security to the household scale of consumer practices and domestic food hygiene). The proposal seeks to demonstrate the commercial significance of our theoretical understanding of social anxieties about food, drawing on a range of empirical work in the UK, Sweden, Thailand, Brazil and China concerning issues of food safety, quality and provenance, innovations in product reformulation and food labelling, and questions of marketing, mediation and consumer practice.  Building on our current contacts with industry, government and NGOs, we propose to test the market for our ideas, offering our services as consultants, providing independent research and advice to a variety of clients in the food industry (including manufacturers, retailers and food service organisations) as well as to voluntary groups, NGOs and food campaigners, using an innovative workshop model, closely tailored to the specific needs of our prospective clients.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"297444","fundValue":"162258.6","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
