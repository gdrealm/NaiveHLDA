{"id":"105894","title":"Adsorbent carbons for the removal of biologically active toxins","abstractText":"'The aim of the project is to manufacture an adsorbent carbon based cartridge within a perfusion system for the removal of strongly, protein bound and macromolecular toxins and inflammatory molecules including hepatic and uremic toxins, exotoxin, endotoxin and cytokines. These molecules are responsible for systemic toxicity effects and their removal is negligible or unsustained in current systems available for the treatment of renal, hepatic and multiple organ failure (MOF) related to sepsis. Additionally, removal of these molecules during perfusion of organs for transplant will moderate the inflammatory stress response which currently limits the success of marginal organs. The project considers economical and environmental impact in the development of processing strategies which optimise the adsorptive, biocompatible and hydrodynamic design properties of the resultant system for these applications. The project brings together a multidisciplinary consortium of specialists with many years experience in the development, analysis and clinical implementation of adsorbent biomaterials in extracorporeal systems and in the development of transplant organ preservation techniques.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"286366","fundValue":"1449659","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
