{"id":"107419","title":"Organocatalytic Desymmetrization and C-H  Bond Activation in Complex Natural Product Synthesis","abstractText":"'The aim of this research is to develop novel organocatalytic desymmetrizatoin and novel C-H bond formation reaction, and to apply these methodologies to the total synthesis of bioactive lueconicine A, B and strychnan alkaloids. These organocatalytic desymmetrizatoin and C-H bond activation provide an excellent method for the rapid construction of complex ring systems, such as the octahydro-1,6-ethanoindole with good streocontrol. However, despite the great potential of these kinds of organocatalytic desymmetrization and C-H bond activation reaction, only small number of results have been reported. Therefore, these types of reactions are highly innovative and would constitute an extremely powerful example of the possibilities offered by organocatalysis. Definitely, to apply these methodologies to the total synthesis of bioactive natural products such as leuconicines and other strychnan alkaloids would provide sufficient material for thorough biological studies and would also constitute a milestone for the study of structure-activity relationship.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"331606","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
