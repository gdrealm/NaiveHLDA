{"id":"96371","title":"Fabrication of three dimensional magnetic nanowires for information storage","abstractText":"'The objective of the proposal is the fabrication and study of three dimensional (3D) magnetic nanowires for ultra-high density information storage. Current memory architectures are 2D, composed of one layer of active components. The extension of data storage devices into the third dimension could result in information densities of hundreds of Gb/in2, causing a technological revolution. The project aims at implementing a 3D version of the existing 2D host institutionï¿½s idea of domain wall based shift registers to store data. In this scheme, the data bits are stored using the two possible directions of the magnetisation in thin and narrow nanowires made of soft ferromagnetic materials. The fabrication of the 3D devices will be done by using a novel promising nanolithography technique: focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID), with unique capabilities for the creation of 3D nanostructures. We have recently demonstrated the required possibility to control domain walls in cobalt nanowires created by this technique. The patterning of magnetic nanostructures by means of conventional lithography, such as electron beam lithography and ion milling, will be explored in parallel. The control of the domain walls will be probed by magneto-optical magnetometry and magneto-electrical measurements. The two directions to be investigated for the creation of 3D magnetic devices will be the stacking of 2D magnetic nanowires, and the direct fabrication of 3D nanowires. The host group possesses patents protecting the ideas presented in this proposal. The success of the project would place the European Union in a privileged position to lead the next steps in the development of Information Technology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251698","fundValue":"172740.8","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
