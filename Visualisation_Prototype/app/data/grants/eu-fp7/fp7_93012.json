{"id":"93012","title":"System and Actions for VEhicles and transportation hubs to support Disaster Mitigation and Evacuation","abstractText":"'SAVE ME aims to develop a system that detects natural (i.e. earthquake, fire,�) and man-made (i.e. terrorist attacks) disaster events in public transport terminals / vehicles and critical infrastructures (i.e. tunnels, and bridges) and that supports quick and optimal mass evacuation guidance, to save the lives of the general public and the rescuers, giving particular emphasis to the most vulnerable travellers (i.e. children, elderly and disabled). To achieve this, it develops a common ontological framework for hazard recognition, classification and mitigation, innovative algorithms on human behaviour under stress, panic and strong emotions, standardised interface elements for intuitive human guidance, a holistic disaster mitigation strategy and intelligent agents algorithms for guidance personalisation. It employs a Wireless Sensor Network for emergency detection, environmental awareness and travellers� position and movements monitoring, as well as a fault tolerant communication network infrastructure. It integrates simulator model data with real time data from these sensors, to reach enhanced crowd behaviour models and uses them in a Decision Support System, to supervise the overall disaster mitigation operation. Thus, it supports the infrastructure operator, guides the rescue team through PDA and the trapped travellers by environmental displays and audio systems, as well as personalised guidance in their mobile phone to the nearest safe and free exit, taking into account their profile (i.e. disability, agility, language, etc.). It also develops appropriate training curricula, content and tools for operators, rescuers and the general public; guidelines to the infrastructure / vehicle operators and designers and standardisation proposals to the policy makers. All project developments are thoroughly and iteratively tested and optimised by lab tests as well as two in pilot sites, at a metro station in Newcastle (UK) and the Gotthard tunnel (Switzerland).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"234027","fundValue":"3905730.38","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
