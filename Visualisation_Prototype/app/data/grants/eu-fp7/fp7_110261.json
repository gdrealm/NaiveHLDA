{"id":"110261","title":"Reactions of Cold Molecular Ions","abstractText":"'I propose to examine how reactions occur at very low temperatures ï¿½ providing accurate and precise experimental data on important ion-neutral molecule reactions for the first time.  Novel experiments will be developed to achieve state selectivity of molecular ions (such as DCl^ and C2H2^) using a laser-driven, blackbody radiation-mediated rotational cooling scheme.  The reactions of these molecular ions with cold, state selected neutral species (such as ammonia) will subsequently be investigated with unprecedented precision and control.  A second objective will pioneer the study of cold, doubly-charged calcium ions (Ca^2), investigating how they react with slow moving neutral molecules such as water.  The examination of Ca^2 under cold conditions would facilitate the first precise measurements of important reaction rates and energetics.  Furthermore, such work would provide stringent benchmarks against which theoretical models could be tested.  Conducting this pioneering research will ensure that the European scientific community remains at the forefront of cold chemistry research.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"618156","fundValue":"52083.33","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
