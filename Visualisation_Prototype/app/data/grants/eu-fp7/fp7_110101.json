{"id":"110101","title":"Sustainable Manufacturing Adaptive Services with Cloud Architectures for Enterprises","abstractText":"'It is paramount and timely for European manufacturing companies to adopt energy/carbon-related evaluation, planning and monitoring systems to enhance their sustainable competitiveness. This project is aimed at establishing effective industry-academia partnerships and pathways for sustainable manufacturing management by developing, deploying and demonstrating intelligent Cloud-based services (SMARTER services) to address dynamics and complexity in product development and manufacturing. The overall, project-level objectives include:\n� Objective 1: To team up and second intersectoral researchers to enrich knowledge bases and achieve research synergies in sustainable manufacturing by sharing the latest research on know-how, strategies, technologies and industrial case studies, and to provide cross-sectional engineering training to researchers to develop versatile and multi-disciplinary applied research skills;\n� Objective 2: To integrate and demonstrate the complementary expertise of the intersectoral teams to devise Cloud-based sustainability services and supporting platform. The services and platform will be developed through integration and further development of core technologies from academic and industrial partners, and verification by real-world case studies in product development and manufacturing. The services and supporting platform will address the multi-faceted requirements and dynamics of modern manufacturing;\n� Objective 3: To showcase as real-world shop-floor demonstrators deployed in various venues of European industries and research institutes for technical demonstration, promotion and adoption; and to organise knowledge sharing and outreach activities for relevant communities and stakeholders in wider regions of the EU to increase the awareness of the project outcomes and to exploit the proposed solutions in order for EU manufacturers to shift towards sustainability efficiently.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"610675","fundValue":"1515296.93","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
