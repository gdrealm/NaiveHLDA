{"id":"94451","title":"Telomere function in meiosis","abstractText":"'Telomeres have long been known to play crucial roles in protecting chromosome ends from attrition and fusion and thus safeguarding genome stability, but their complete functional repertoire has yet to be fully understood. Among the fundamental roles of telomeres is their role in meiosis, the process by which parental genomes are recombined and halved, allowing the generation of genetic diversity via sexual reproduction. As cells progress from mitotic to meiotic cycles, telomere functions change radically as all telomeres gather to a small region of the nuclear periphery near the centrosome to form the telomere bouquet . While this bouquet is widely conserved, the challenges of manipulating meiosis in most eukaryotes has made bouquet function a matter of speculation until recently. We utilize the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model to study telomeres, as this organism provides a powerful combination of genetic manipulability and striking conservation of chromosomal structure/function with human. Recently, we made the unexpected discovery that the bouquet controls the behavior of meiotic centrosomes and spindles. Furthermore, we find that the bouquet is required not only for proper spindle formation, but also for attachment of meiotic chromosomes to the spindle via their centromeres. Using molecular genetics, quantitative live analysis and biochemistry, we propose to define the mechanisms by which the gathered telomeres control spindle behavior. We will also investigate what aspect of the telomere confers proper centromere-spindle attachment and what goes wrong at centromeres in cells lacking the bouquet. These studies will illuminate mechanisms of communication between chromosomes and the spindle apparatus that should be widely conserved among eukaryotes.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"250326","fundValue":"1451943","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
