{"id":"188156","title":"Simple Atto Molar Detection and Nanoscale Kinetics of Biomolecules","abstractText":"'Single Nano-Particles undergoing Brownian motion in solution colliding at an inert ultramicroelectrode, can serve as nano-electrodes during the time of contact. This provides an entirely new approach to nanoelectrochemistry. Hitherto, this new technique has been used for understanding simple redox reactions. We propose to experimentally study the electron transfer kinetics of single redox active proteins under steady state diffusion conditions, in this elegant configuration. In this way realistic mimicking of electron transfer based natural events will be achieved. In addition, the fundamentals of biological electron transfer will be revisited and re-evaluated. In parallel to this, we plan to use the natural redox activity of selected amino acids within a protein to establish a simple type of biosensor, with approximately attomolar detection sensitivity for label free proteins. Recently, the ability to observe electrocatalytic activity of single NPï¿½s (due to collision with an electrode) was established. In the same way, we plan to use proteins as nanoparticles for biosensing applications. By immobilizing specific aptamers on an inert substrate, the absorption of label free proteins on top of the aptamers will be tracked. Chronoamperometric profiles measured on ultramicroelectrode under potential control should allow detection of attomolar concentrations.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"629038","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-07-02","fundEnd":"2016-07-01","dataset":"fp7"}
