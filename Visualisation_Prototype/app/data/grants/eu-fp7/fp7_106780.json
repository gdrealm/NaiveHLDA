{"id":"106780","title":"Novel organometallic anticancer compounds","abstractText":"'Currently the most widely used drugs for the treatment of cancer are platinum compounds, used in nearly 50% of all chemotherapeutic regimens. However the platinums can suffer from problems of resistance, a limited spectrum of activity, and side-effects. Hence new agents with new mechanisms of action are urgently needed.  We have discovered novel organometallic osmium and iridium compounds with more potent anticancer activity and unique mechanisms of action. Initial work on an osmium compound has demonstrated promising activity against colorectal cancer without toxic side-effects, providing an opportunity to satisfy unmet clinical needs.\nThe ERC PoC funding will allow the discovery phase to be advanced, to turn hits into leads by establishing and validating target sites, and elucidating mechanisms of action. The techniques employed to achieve this PoC will combine high throughput proteomcs/genomics approaches with image analysis of cancer cell morphology in a mathematical analysis to determine the mechanism of action. Data from cancer models will validate the efficacy of the most active compounds. This portfolio of data, together with desk research on potential patient populations, will provide a strong basis for attracting a partner in the next stage of preclinical development.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"324594","fundValue":"156795.96","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
