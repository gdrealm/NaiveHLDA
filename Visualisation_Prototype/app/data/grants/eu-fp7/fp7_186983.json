{"id":"186983","title":"STEP-UP - Strategies Towards Energy Performance and Urban Planning","abstractText":"STEP-UP - brings together excellence on energy planning from Glasgow; Ghent; Riga; and Gothenburg � 4 ambitious, northern European, historic, port cities together with their industrial and research partners.\n\nThe initiative is supported at the highest political level in all 4 cities � and city leaders will be active  in the project throughout its life, ensuring it delivers its objectives, and has clear and significant impact in the partner cities and beyond.\n\nSTEP-UP takes an integrated  approach to energy planning, integrated project design, and implementation by addressing 3 vital themes together:  energy and technology;  economics; organisation and stakeholders.\n\nSTEP-UP partner cities will significantly enhance their Covenant of Mayors Strategic Energy Action Plans (SEAPs) to tackle all three Europe 2020 energy targets:  energy efficiency / energy reduction; growth of renewable energy;  carbon emissions reduction.\n\nSTEP-UP will draw on the partner cities�  experience of integrated energy planning, and will build on this through learning and adapting experience from other cities and partners to create a coherent and easy-to-use model for energy planning.  This model  will be adopted in multiple cities to deliver faster and greater impacts for Europe�s 2020 energy targets � and wider policy objectives such as improving security of energy supplies,  urban regeneration, economic growth, and tackling fuel poverty � making these cities better places to live, work, learn, and do business.\n\nKey deliverables are:\n\nAn integrated model for delivering ambitious realistic integrated SEAPs;\n\nEnhanced SEAPs in all partner cities;\n\nInnovative energy projects in all partner cities that integrate different technologies and stakeholders;\n\nA learning network of cities to replicate this action across Europe;\n\nWork with the Central Party School to replicate this model in China;\n\nTraining programmes for professionals\n\nA new Masters Course on Sustainable city planning and implementation.\n\n","grantUrl":"","grantId":"314679","fundValue":"4692274.62","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
