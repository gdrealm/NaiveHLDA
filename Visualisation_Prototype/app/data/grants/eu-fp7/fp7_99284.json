{"id":"99284","title":"System-wide analysis of regulatory processes that mediate at the boarder of metabolome and proteome","abstractText":"'The metabolic network has a modular architecture, is robust to perturbations, and\nresponds to biological stimuli. The balance of the network, and the passageway of\nnetwork substructures to operate at different activity, requires intensive interactions\nbetween the metabolic network, the transcriptome and the proteome. However, the\nbiochemical mechanisms monitoring the metabolic network are only barely understood.\nChanges in network activity are often mediated through so called reporter metabolites:\ngeneral -network interconnecting cofactors and reaction substrates - and specific pathway\nintermediates. These metabolites bridge the gap between the small molecule and\nmacromolecular universe of the cell.\nHere we propose combining systematic yeast genetics with targeted metabolomics and\nproteomics to understand mechanisms of metabolic regulation on a genome-scale level. In\nprinciple, we will elaborate multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assays that facilitate\nquantification of enzymes and intermediates of selected metabolic pathways via liquid\nchromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The analysis will be performed on metabolic\nprocesses that influence aging; those will be analyzed and the results validated by\nchemical-genetic profiling and competitive lifespan experiments.\nThe anticipated results will yield in a system-wide picture of interactions between the\nmetabolome and regulatory components of the cell. Furthermore, it will identify novel\ngenetic and biochemical interactions of the aging process. Understanding these\nmechanisms will stimulate new research directions in Systems Biology and support the\ndevelopment of therapeutic strategies against diseases of aging.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"260809","fundValue":"1499996","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
