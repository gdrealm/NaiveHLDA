{"id":"89668","title":"\"An integrated study on three novel regulatory hubs in megakaryocytes and platelets, discovered as risk genes for myocardial infarction by a genome-wide association and platelet systems biology study\"","abstractText":"'The overarching objective of the ITN is to offer an intercalated study environment for young and talented researchers in the field of coronary artery disease (CAD) research.  12 PhD fellows operating in a unique training environment will work as a multi-disciplinary team to perform research spanning the full spectrum from basic to translational to bring novel inventions to the bedside.  The fellows will be mentored by world-leading experts to shape a new generation of European leaders in biomedical science and overcome current fragmentation in Europe.  The research is at the forefront of biomedical science because of the UK genome-wide association study in 2000 myocardial infarction (MI) patients and our EU-FP6 integrated projects Bloodomics and Cardiogenics.  We will exploit our knowledge about the genetic architecture of MI to investigate the hypothesis whether sequence variation of genes encoding network hubs poses a greater risk for network destabilisation compared to genes encoding regular nodes.  Focusing on three hub genes we postulate that genetic/bio-markers associated with hubs can be integrated in algorithms for MI/CAD risk prediction.    Success will critically depend on new developments in computing, machine learning, pattern recognition and advanced data mining and statistical analysis.  To have a free development path from basic discovery to health care improvement young scientists must be taught to cross the classic barriers between academic disciplines.  We offer a timely and necessary alternative to Europeï¿½s classic PhD programmes by providing a seamlessly integrated multi-disciplinary environment in an academic-private sector partnership free of boundaries.      Our aim is a targeted strategy for prevention and treatment based on a better understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanism of disease. This will deliver major advances in public health and patient care, which can only be achieved if a new scientific cadre is developed.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"215820","fundValue":"2851384","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
