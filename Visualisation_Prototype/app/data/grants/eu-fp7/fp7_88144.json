{"id":"88144","title":"A European Collaboration to optimise research for the care of cancer patients in the last days of life","abstractText":"'The project aims to explore, share and collate existing knowledge and practice in each of the key themes identified within the work programme. It aims to reach consensus (based on current practice and available research evidence) on the optimum care to be delivered in the last days of life and gaps in the knowledge base. In addition, it aims to develop innovative ways of addressing gaps in knowledge with the specific aim of improving care for cancer patients in the last days of life. Clearly, such improvements would also impact positively on their informal carers and health professionals delivering the care. Importantly, it aims to do this systematically and collaboratively across Europe and beyond to integrate knowledge from a range of healthcare enviroments and cultures and to avoid duplication of resource and effort.'","grantUrl":"http://www.opcare9.eu/index.htm","grantId":"202112","fundValue":"3224156","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
