{"id":"105459","title":"\"Retinal Vascular Modeling, Measurement and Diagnosis\"","abstractText":"'The REtinal VAscular Modeling, Measurement And Diagnosis (REVAMMAD) project will train a new generation of scientists able to effectively translate the latest vascular modeling theory and computerized image analysis techniques into effective interventions for some of the most important chronic medic conditions afflicting the EU, including hypertension and diabetes. It will particularly ensure that there is rich clinical and industrial involvement to ensure that the training is focused with end-users and exploitation in mind.\nThe vasculature undergoes changes in response to early stages of these diseases, reflecting fundamental physiological processes within the vessels.\nThe retina provides a unique �window onto the vasculature,� allowing it to be viewed and measurements made in vivo, and advances in imaging technologies make it increasingly possible to measure subtle changes using computer vision algorithms, including through routine medical checks such as eye tests.\nThe field is currently fragmented, with many excellent pockets of collaboration focused on defined specialisms, particularly between clinicians and modelers, or clinicians and measurement specialists, but lacking overall structure. Despite the importance and incidence of the diseases and the evidence for the possibility of better diagnosis through imaging, there has been relatively little translation of theory into clinical practice.\nIntegrative action is required to train researchers who understand the medical, clinical, technological and commercial aspects of the problem domain and to establish common working methodologies and tools across the field. REVAMMAD will train early careers researchers who combine these skills in order to motivate the introduction of high impact interventions in the future.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"316990","fundValue":"3768601","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
