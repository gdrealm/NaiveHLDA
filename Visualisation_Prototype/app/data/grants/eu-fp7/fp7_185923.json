{"id":"185923","title":"Advanced plasmonic-on-fibre devices for optical communication and sensing applications","abstractText":"'The proposed knowledge transfer project on Advanced plasmonic-on-fibre devices for optical communication and sensing applications (Plasm-on-fibre) via this International Incoming Fellowship (IIF) programme will transfer the knowledge and expertise of the Marie Curie IIF Fellow Dr J Zhang from the Institute of Solid State Physics (ISSP) of Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is specialised in plasmonics and nanophotonics,  to the EU host � Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies (AIPT) at Aston University in the UK to carry out the world-class research in the new emerging science area � Plasmonics. Working in the defined four key research objective areas: R1: In-depth theoretical study and advanced fabrication of novel fibre gratings for efficient excitation of surface plasmon polaritons; R2: Exploring nanomaterials and nanostructures for novel plasmonic functions; R3: Developing ultrafast magneto-plasmonic modulation function and devices based on novel hybrid multi-layer excitation of surface plasmon polaritons; R4: Developing next generation plasmonic-on-fibre biosensors based on hybrid fibre gratings and plasmonic nanostructures, we anticipate this project will generate new knowledge, explore potential functions and develop novel plasmonic-on-fibre devices for optical communication and sensing applications and lead to long term collaboration between AIPT and ISSP. In parallel, this IIF project will also aim to train Post-docs and Ph.D and Master students at AIPT and form a network with 4 academic and 3 industrial partners in Europe. The outcome of this project will enhance the EU leading position in fundamental knowledge, new ideas and novel devices and technologies in modern plasmonics.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"623473","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-11-15","fundEnd":"2016-11-14","dataset":"fp7"}
