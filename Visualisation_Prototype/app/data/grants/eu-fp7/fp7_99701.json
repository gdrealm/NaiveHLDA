{"id":"99701","title":"Transition to Turbulence of Volumetrically Heated Flows","abstractText":"'Numerical techniques are proposed that can capture the transition to turbulence of shear flow and in the process they offer the capability of state of the art control of such transitions. The methods can enhance the calculation of fluid flow by identifying the hierarchical bifurcation of the evolving states. Thus, the predictive power of the underlying mathematical models is strengthened. Concurrently they offer the unique possibility of unifying the results with those obtained by techniques that are developed with the sole aim of capturing the fully developed turbulent state. The novel methods can be used to pinpoint the transition of the flow from its laminar (basic) state to its fully developed (turbulent) state. Meanwhile programmes that are designed to capture the nature of the flow at its final (turbulent) state will be benchmarked against the programmes that pinpoint its transition. Software that unifies the programmes will be able to oversee the development of the fluid flow throughout its evolution. The emerging software will run on single or shared memory (parallel) hardware, thus reducing dramatically the computational costs. It is the ultimate aim of this set of programmes to apply the resulting software to complex configurations applicable to a variety of configurations. Simple geometries will be considered at first to act as benchmarks and common ground for the two different state of the art software avenues at our disposal: the proprietary code developed at Aston University and a commercially available CFD code. We intend to use the results of our studies to be applicable to the Nuclear Industry to model regime transition in complex systems where molten metals, molten salts and water are used as the coolant.  Operating regimes of interest include the thermo-hydraulic behaviour of the coolant in reactors undergoing passive decay heat removal. Meteorological and geological applications will also be considered as a by-product of our studies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"274367","fundValue":"272980","fundStart":"2012-01-16","fundEnd":"2014-01-15","dataset":"fp7"}
