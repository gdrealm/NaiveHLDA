{"id":"106486","title":"ISO Shipping Container Tracking and Monitoring System Demonstration Project","abstractText":"'The ISOTRACK Research for SME Associations(R4A)  project had developed a system to monitor intermodal containers� location, integrity and load in real-time throughout the supply chain.\nThe main innovations include:\n-  composite container door that is transparent to radiofrequency\n-  that has embedded electronic systems to monitor the internal condition of the container\n-  wirelessly transmit information from inside the composite door, without an external antenna\n-  achieve greater integrity by having a device that is inaccessible to tampering\n-  utilise ZigBee mesh networks to for higher signal integrity and minimal power consumption\n\nThe results from the original project have been very promising and we have six members of the R4A consortium, including 4 SMEs from 3 countries (UK, France and Slovenia), an SME Association and an end-user of the system, as well as 2 new participants wanting to partake in this demonstration activity to bring the results to market.\n\nThis project will benefit European SME manufacturing and produce an innovative container security device (CSD) that is validated by an end-user shipping company and a multinational manufacturing company with a multi-billion �uro supply chain. We will demonstrate our ISOTRACK system by fitting it to 100 containers, 3 container liners and seven container port terminals that support the logistics supply chain of our end-users and trialling it over a 12-month period.\n\nThis demonstration activities is vital in supporting our SME manufacturing supply chain bridge the gap between the end of our research project and bringing the results towards a successful commercial outcome. The SME associations member will benefit by having access to an enabling technology and the association will receive royalties.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"315723","fundValue":"1253050","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
