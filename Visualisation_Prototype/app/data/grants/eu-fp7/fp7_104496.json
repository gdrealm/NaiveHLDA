{"id":"104496","title":"Theory of Fundamental Interactions at the Nanoscale","abstractText":"'At the heart of this multi-disciplinary research project lie two emerging prominent theoretical models developed by the applicant in the past 12 months, which underpin the fundamental interactions taking place at the nanometre scale. In 2010, the applicant proposed a general solution to the fundamental problem of the attraction between like-charged dielectric nanoparticles. This is the first time a comprehensive solution to this problem has been presented, and it has the potential to transform our understanding of how charged nanoparticles interact in the gas phase and solutions.\n\nStudies of nanoparticles have opened new avenues for exploration of the principles that underpin the transition from the gas phase to the solid state. The capability of nanoparticles to modify their shape in order to minimize the free energy leads to structure modifications that can be observed on a time scale accessible by electron microscopy techniques. A unique computational methodology has been developed by the applicant, which has an advantage over the state-of-the-art image simulation techniques in its ability to simulate the dynamics of structural transformations under the influence of the electron beam.\n\nThe proposed core theoretical frameworks are central tools of the project. Their fundamental nature offers solutions to problems across wide-ranging disciplines. The models will be advanced during the project and introduced to the experts in the application areas in order to find solutions to a number of common problems, which to date remain un-solved. The application areas, which will be addressed, include the electrostatic charging of pharmaceutical powders during manufacture and handling; the charge scavenging in the formation of solar systems; self-assembly of charged nanoparticles in solutions; proton transfer in biological molecules; structure-property correlations of nanomaterials; and design of innovative oxidation catalysts using inorganic polyoxometalates.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"307755","fundValue":"1400341","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
