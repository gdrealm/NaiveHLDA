The project will:\n\n�Deliver a mapping of on-going initiatives in the field of substitution of CRM at the EU level and Member States that will allow for the identification of key champions and synergies. The mapping will also consider other initiatives of international character.\n�Develop a methodology to establish clear criteria for the prioritisation of applications which are at �threat� and the technological and non-technological needs regarding the substitution of CRM.\n�Propose a roadmap for the substitution of CRM in coordination and cooperation with all stakeholders across the CRM substitution value chain while paying close attention to the specificities of critical industrial sectors as well as possible synergies.\n�Create one or more Pole(s) of Excellence in the field of substitution of CRM that will ensure the relevance and usefulness of the project results and constitute a dynamic, open and proactive platform for the entire stakeholder community aiming to support and enhance the competitiveness of the EU industry and economy. CRM-Innonet will carry out a feasibility study considering the potential models and routes for this Pole(s) to endure after the project termination and decide upon concrete future actions in this respect.\n�Prepare a document containing recommendations, future initiative ideas and suggested actions for policy makers with the widest possible endorsement and consensus of all stakeholders involved.\nThe CRM-InnoNet consortium is comprised of recognised and experienced key actors across the value chain of substitution of CRM representing academia, research establishments and industry bodies of relevant sectors that will ensure a wide European coverage and high potential to reach and engage other necessary players across the European Research Area.'","grantUrl":"http://www.criticalrawmaterials.eu/","grantId":"319024","fundValue":"3878134.78","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
