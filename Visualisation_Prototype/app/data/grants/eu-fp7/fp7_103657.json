{"id":"103657","title":"Modelling human ageing: developing and interrogating an integrated model of ageing to identify causal relationships between hormonal changes and gene expression changes","abstractText":"'Ageing has a profound impact on human society and modern medicine, yet it remains a major puzzle of biology. Both hormonal and gene expression changes have been implicated as causal mechanisms of ageing. It is not clear, however, which molecular or physiological changes are more important drivers of the process of ageing or how they influence each other. This project aims to develop and interrogate an integrated model of ageing to identify causal relationships between age-related changes at different biological levels. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) Build a mathematical model of age-related gene expression and hormonal changes with age; 2) Determine the causal relationship between these age-related changes using in silico analyses. 3) Develop a new model of ageing based on the results obtained to highlight the new causal relationships identified.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"303343","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-11-15","fundEnd":"2014-11-14","dataset":"fp7"}
