{"id":"108756","title":"Structural joints for building frames of pultruded fibre reinforced polymers","abstractText":"'Project PFRPStruJoin shall conduct advanced, transformative and timely research for the preparation of scientifically founded design guidelines for mechanically fastened connections and joints in (building) frames of pultruded Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite materials, as well as training in high-level skill acquisition.\nThe major scientific accomplishments to be made are:\n1. new contributions to knowledge and understanding of FRP structural materials by using analytical methodologies based on advanced finite element analyses, that, for (safety critical) connections and joints, reliably simulate the initiation and progression of damage, at a level of refinement not yet attained.\n2. to link predicted joint behaviour to the response of frames for minimum weight designs.\n3. to prepare benchmarked and verified design information to enable clients and designers to adopt structural FRP composites more cost-effectively and appropriately in  building construction.\nThe principal long-term socio-economic objectives are:\n1. to promote a sustainable and resilient built environment within the European policy to reduce CO2 emissions and support a healthier and better environment that provides well-being to the society.\n2. to protect the FRP industry by means of standards and codes of practice in order to enable growth in civil engineering and construction, which are mass-production markets.\nOn completion, the programme of work shall add value to the strategy of the European committee CEN/TC250 to prepare a structural Eurocode, by way of research, for the construction material of FRPs. It will furthermore contribute to the structural and technological change in the framework of the Europe 2020 Strategy and its flagship initiatives on (i) a �Resource Efficient Europe� towards a low carbon or green economy to achieve sustainable growth and (ii) �Innovation Union� under the action �Delivering the ERA� by promoting mobility of a researcher in Europe and knowledge transfer.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327142","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
