{"id":"107257","title":"Optimization of the corrosion resistance of Friction Stir Welds in High Strenght Aluminium Alloys","abstractText":"'This project will seek to establish the corrosion mechanism of friction stir welds in 7075 alloy and develop technical solutions and guidelines for improving the corrosion resistance of FSW welds in 7075 alloy. These objectives will be achieved through FSW process optimisation, mechanical testing, corrosion testing and microstructure characterisation. FSW welding trails will be carried out to develop procedures for achieving high quality welds in 7075 alloy and establish the effects of process parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the weld. Different corrosion tests will be carried out to establish corrosion mechanism and generate technical data on corrosion and stress corrosion cracking behaviour of FSW welds in 7075 alloy. Microstructural evolution during FSW welding will be examined to establish characteristics of microstructures in different regions of the welded joint and their responses to corrosions/cracking. Technical solutions and practical guidelines for improving the corrosion resistance of FSW welds in 7075 Al alloy will be produced based on the results achieved.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"328487","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2013-10-21","fundEnd":"2015-10-20","dataset":"fp7"}
