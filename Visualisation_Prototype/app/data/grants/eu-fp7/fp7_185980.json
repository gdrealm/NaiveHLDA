{"id":"185980","title":"Enhanced Computer Animation by Fusing Computer Graphics Technology with Smart Data Management","abstractText":"'The animation and games industry is one of the most rapidly growing industries. However, animation production is unfortunately very time-consuming requiring a large amount of manual input, which makes it hugely expensive. �AniM�, the fellowship, aims to improve this issue by developing next generation computer animation technology through knowledge transfer and combining the strengths and excellence of two leading institutions in the field:  Communication University of China and the National Centre for Computer Animation in the UK. This bi-site multidisciplinary research will bring new insights and formal understanding of creativity in computer animation to advance the capability of computers to automate the process.\n\nBy making use of a pool of patents and competencies from the home and host institutions, the fellow will develop �smart solutions�, which innovatively fuse computer graphics technology and smart data management. In addition to fundamental research, �AniM� will develop enhanced software tools, which realise the theoretic insights. Moreover, concept designs, examples, practical guidance and standard will be further developed for future technologies. As a result, it will help increase EU�s competitiveness and positively impact on the creative industries. As a pathfinder for new research streams of ICT, �AniM� will boost creative competitiveness in many related sectors, including education, health care and manufacturing where animation provides effective communication media. It will fill the bill of handling EU challenges of ICT for Creativity and Learning, specifically tackling Objective ICT 2013.8.1 in the ICT FP7 programme by forming technologies and scientific foundations in the field of creativity.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"623883","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-11-10","fundEnd":"2016-11-09","dataset":"fp7"}
