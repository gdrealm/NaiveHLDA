{"id":"101524","title":"3D Imaging Across Lengthscales: From Atoms to Grains","abstractText":"'Understanding structure-property relationships across lengthscales is key to the design of functional and structural materials and devices. Moreover, the complexity of modern devices extends to three dimensions and as such 3D characterization is required across those lengthscales to provide a complete understanding and enable improvement in the material�s physical and chemical behaviour. 3D imaging and analysis from the atomic scale through to granular microstructure is proposed through the development of electron tomography using (S)TEM, and �dual beam� SEM-FIB, techniques offering complementary approaches to 3D imaging across lengthscales stretching over 5 orders of magnitude.\n\nWe propose to extend tomography to include novel methods to determine atom positions in 3D with approaches incorporating new reconstruction algorithms, image processing  and complementary nano-diffraction techniques. At the nanoscale, true 3D nano-metrology of morphology and composition is a key objective of the project, minimizing reconstruction and visualization artefacts. Mapping strain and optical properties in 3D are ambitious and exciting challenges that will yield new information at the nanoscale. Using the SEM-FIB, 3D �mesoscale� structures will be revealed: morphology, crystallography and composition can be mapped simultaneously, with ~5nm resolution and over volumes too large to tackle by (S)TEM and too small for most x-ray techniques. In parallel, we will apply 3D imaging to a wide variety of key materials including heterogeneous catalysts, aerospace alloys, biomaterials, photovoltaic materials, and novel semiconductors.\n\nWe will collaborate with many departments in Cambridge and institutes worldwide. The personnel on the proposal will cover all aspects of the tomography proposed using high-end TEMs, including an aberration-corrected Titan, and a Helios dual beam. Importantly, a postdoc is dedicated to developing new algorithms for reconstruction, image and spectral processing.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"291522","fundValue":"2337330","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
