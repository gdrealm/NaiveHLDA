{"id":"90540","title":"Novel Magnetic Ventilation System for Building Application","abstractText":"'This International Incoming Fellowship will bring a leading Chinese researcher to work in the Europe. The project has been carefully chosen to match Dr Dai&apos;s expertise in heat and mass transfer and energy efficient systems with the expertise in cost-effective HVAC technologies at the University of Nottingham so as to maximise the benefit to the Europe. Solid desiccant systems have been widely adopted for many building HVAC systems because of their energy recovery ability and low cost of dehumidification, but their efficiencies are low owing to the small temperature difference between the supply and the exhaust air. The proposed system is expected to improve their performances by integrating with magnetocaloric material. When a magnetocaloric material is subjected to a magnetic field, the temperature of the material rises and when the magnetic field is removed, the temperature decreases. This warming and cooling in response to the application and removal of an external magnetic field will be used in the proposed system to improve its efficiency. The proposed system explores a new area of application for these magnetocaloric materials ï¿½ magnetic ventilation. The proposed research aims to investigate, theoretically and experimentally, heat and mass transfer properties of various desiccant and magnetocaloric materials for application in dehumidifying, cooling and heating. An experimental device will be designed and constructed and tested under a range of conditions. The proposed programme of work will take a maximum of 24 months to complete. The training of the researcher will be achieved through regular supervision and mentoring and a carefully managed research programme including computer modelling of heat and mass transfer, development of an experimental device, laboratory test as well as economic and environmental analyses.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"234821","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2010-04-26","fundEnd":"2012-04-25","dataset":"fp7"}
