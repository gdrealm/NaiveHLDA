{"id":"93013","title":"Chromosomal addresses and mechanism of chromatin binding by the Scc2/Scc4 cohesin and condensin loading complex","abstractText":"'In eukaryotic cells, cohesion between sister chromatids allows chromosomes to biorient on the metaphase plate and holds them together until they separate into daughter cells at anaphase onset. Accurate control of the mechanisms implicated in sister chromatids cohesion after DNA replication and chromosome condensation during mitosis are essential for faithful chromosome segregation during cell division. The aim of this project is to characterise the chromosomal features underlying Scc2/Scc4 binding to chromosomes and to understand the mechanism by which cohesin and condensin are loaded onto chromatin by the Scc2/Scc4 complex using as model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The understanding of the mechanism of action of this complex is of particular interest since mutations in human Scc2 also result in sister chromatid cohesion defects, and are the cause of a severe developmental disorder, called Cornelia de Lange syndrome. The latter has been linked to Scc2 and cohesinï¿½s role in transcriptional regulation, which the complexes also participate in. It is also worth to mention that chromosome segregation defects are commonly observed in cancer cells. Gaining insight into how the Scc2/Scc4 complex contributes to sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome condensation and even transcriptional regulation will advance our knowledge of fundamental aspects of chromosome biology and help in the understanding of human disease.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"234992","fundValue":"171867.63","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
