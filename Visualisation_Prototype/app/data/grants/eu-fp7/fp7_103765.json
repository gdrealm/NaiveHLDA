{"id":"103765","title":"Diagnostically Robust Ultrasound Video Transmission over Emerging Wireless Networks","abstractText":"'The objective of this project is to develop a unifying framework for the error-resilient communication of medical ultrasound video over emerging 3.5G and 4G wireless networks that is suitable for critically-needed clinical diagnosis. The goal is to develop new methods as well as integrate state-of-the-art methods in video coding, wireless networks, and medical video quality assessment into an adaptive, automated framework. The anticipated system will be validated in cardiovascular remote diagnosis applications. The system will be independently validated by at-least two clinical experts in the transmission of symptomatic atherosclerotic plaque ultrasound video (associated with critical stroke events) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. In both cases, timely surgical intervention may be needed. The approach will establish how specific diagnostic decisions can be safely made based on transmitted medical video.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) causes nearly half of all deaths in Europe. The Medical Standing Committee of the European Science Foundation has recognized the development of new technologies for cardiovascular diseases as a target priority. Life saving surgery is needed for suspected, symptomatic atherosclerotic plaque ultrasound cases so as to prevent the possibility of a future stroke event. Similarly, aortic rupture due to AAA can lead to death. In both cases, timely interventions, especially for the elderly and patients with mobility problems will be supported by the proposed mobile-health (m-health) ultrasound video transmission system. Moreover, early diagnosis of patients at remote locations is expected to reduce patientsï¿½ risks to more general cardiovascular diseases.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"301476","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
