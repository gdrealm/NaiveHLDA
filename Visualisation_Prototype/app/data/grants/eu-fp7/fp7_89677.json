{"id":"89677","title":"Industry-Academia Partnerships and Pathways on Stratified Combustion for Quiet Low Emissions Aero-Engines","abstractText":"'The objective of this proposal is to create long-term collaboration between industry and academia within Europe in critical areas of science and technology to develop clean and efficient combustion in aeroengines. Specific goals of the partnership are: � To create a network of highly trained scientists and engineers in a key area of gas turbine combustion research, with both industrial experience and trained in state-of-the-art scientific methods and innovative technologies. � To spark future research initiatives via the interaction of researchers involved in the project with industry as well as other existing networks. � To advance the state of the art in understanding the effects of mixture stratification on emissions and combustion instabilities. The proposal involves two academic (Cambridge University, UK, and Technische Universitaet Darmstadt, Germany) and three industrial partners (Rolls-Royce, UK, Rolls-Royce,Germany, and Camcon, UK). The project will combine the experimental and numerical expertise of all partners to investigate new concepts in turbulent stratified combustion. The results will be immediately used in industry via incorporation into CFD codes and concept development. The project will also significantly benefit Cancom by employing its fast acting valve technology and further developing it for use in a new application.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"217970","fundValue":"707036","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
