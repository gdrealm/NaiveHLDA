{"id":"111498","title":"Smart UNattended airborne sensor Network for detection of vessels used for cross border crime and irregular entrY","abstractText":"'The SUNNY project aims to contribute to EUROSUR by defining a new tool for collecting real-time information in operational scenarios.\nSUNNY represents a step  beyond existing research projects due to the following main features:\n�A two-tier intelligent heterogeneous UAV sensor network will be considered in order to provide both large field and focused surveillance capabilities, where  the first-tier sensors, carried  by medium  altitude,  long-endurance autonomous UAVs, are used to patrol large border  areas to detect suspicious targets and provide global situation  awareness. Fed with the information collected by the first-tier sensors, the second-tier sensors will be deployed\nto provide more focused surveillance capability by tracking the targets and collecting further evidence for more accurate target recognition and threat  evaluation. Novel algorithms  will be developed to analyse the data  collected by the sensors for robust  and accurate target  identification and event  detection;\n�Novel sensors and on-board processing generation, integrated on UAV system, will be focus on low weight, low cost,  high resolution that can operate under  variable  conditions such  as darkness, snow,  and rain. In particular,  SUNNY will develop sensors that generate both RGB image,  Near Infrared (NIR) image  and hyperspectral image  and that use  radar  information to detect, discriminate and track objects of interest inside complex  environment with focus on the sea borders. Alloying to couple  sensor processing and preliminary detection results (on-board) with local UAV control, leading  to innovative  active sensing techniques, replacing low level sensor data communication by\na higher abstraction level of information communication.\n�The exploitation  and adaptation of emerging standard wireless technologies and architectures as IEEE\n802.11a/g/n, IEEE 802.11p, DVB-T2, Mobile WiMAX, LTE, and Wi-Fi@700MHz will be considered due to their low cost and advantageous features.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"313243","fundValue":"14439544.88","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
