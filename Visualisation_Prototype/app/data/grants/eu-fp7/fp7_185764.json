{"id":"185764","title":"Solar Collector and PCM Thermal Fa�ade for Low Carbon Buildings","abstractText":"'This International Fellowship will bring an excellent Chinese researcher Dr Xin Wang from Tsinghua University to work in Europe. The project has been carefully chosen to match Dr Xin Wang�s expertise in Energy Storage for Energy Efficiency Building as well as Heat and Mass Transfer in Built Environment with the expertise in sustainable energy and buildings technologies at the University of Nottingham so as to maximize the benefit to Europe.\n\nDr Xin Wang has strong experience of PCM energy storage for building applications and energy efficient building technology. She has strong expertise on heat and mass transfer for energy storage and building performance simulation and control system development. The participation of Dr Xin Wang could bring the expertise of PCM energy storage for energy efficient building applications and associated technology transfer into European countries. The six Creative Energy Homes project at Nottingham University directed by Professor Saffa Riffat has showed their flexibility to allow testing of different aspects of building construction and sustainable technologies in order to identify the most cost effective and environmentally sound solutions for affordable homes. All these technologies and trainings will combine with Dr Wang�s technology in this project to enhance the efficiency of power saving for the sustainable building technology.\n\nThere are seven main steps in this project: (1) CFD simulation of air flow and energy outputs in the novel fa�ade; (2) The novel fa�ade design and integration of solar collector and PCM; (3) system simulation of the COLPCM fa�ade coupled to a building and optimisation. (4) Development of COLPCM system control; (5) Prototype of the COLPCM fa�ade development, construction and lab-testing; (6) Installation and commission of the prototype system in a building and testing the system under real-life context; (7) Assessments of economic, environmental and life cycle impacts of the COLPCM fa�ade system.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"622117","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2014-08-15","fundEnd":"2016-08-14","dataset":"fp7"}
