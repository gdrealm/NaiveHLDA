{"id":"96319","title":"Efficient Synthesis using Alkynes as Masked Ylides","abstractText":"'The chemicals arena is vital to our continued way of life, be it though materials synthesis, agrochemicals, pharmaceutical production or in biological probes. All these areas depend on our ability to make molecules. This is achieved by the coupling of fragments, and the manipulation of various functionalities. This process can be time-consuming, produce large amounts of waste material and require the use of significant amounts of limited resources, not least energy and chemical precursors. Therefore it is vital that we develop more efficient, cleaner and quicker strategies for molecular synthesis. The current best methods to prepare the valuable reactive intermediates known as sulfur ylides, employ the use of complex and potentially dangerous functionalities. As these are ultimately lost from the material, only after having been introduced at significant cost, these routes are rendered unattractive in terms of safe-handling and synthetic efficiency. In this proposal we show a way in which sulfur-ylides can be prepared directly from simple, readily available precursors, without the currently associated problems. This method employs gold catalysis, and will be used to develop new reactions that allow the preparation of complex molecules by the coupling of simple units. The products will be of significant use, as either final targets or in synthesis of compounds of importance. In this proposal, new reactions will be developed that show high synthetic efficiency and flexibility. The reactions will be established and their scope and limitations probed to demonstrate their applicability to the chemical community.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253979","fundValue":"172240.8","fundStart":"2010-08-09","fundEnd":"2012-08-08","dataset":"fp7"}
