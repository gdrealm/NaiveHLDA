{"id":"108336","title":"Dual stimuli-responsive nanoparticles as novel topical drug delivery systems","abstractText":"'This project aims to develop new stimuli-responsive nanoparticles (SRNï¿½s) reacting to changes in temperature and pH, and to evaluate their applications for both topical and transdermal drug delivery. New multifunctional materials, thermoresponsive as well as nanogels and dual pH-Tm responsive materials, using a combination of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), poly(2-oxazolines) and chitosan will be synthesized and characterized. The main objective of this project will be to develop stimuli responsive nanoparticles based on the new multifunctional materials and evaluate their use as drug delivery nano-systems for skin application. Different techniques such as coprecipitation, oil/water solvent evaporation and high dilution radical polymerization will be used to generate nanoparticle with different physicochemical characteristics. Their clinical potential will be evaluated using preclinical in vitro skin models. The stimuli responsive nanoparticles proposed in this project may be characterized as an innovative approach to the development of new multifunctional skin delivery systems allowing the drug to be released, only when the tissue itself give the appropriate message, in terms of temperature and/or pH response.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329207","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
