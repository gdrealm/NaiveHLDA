{"id":"104699","title":"Centre for Integrative Theoretical and Experimental Analytical Science for Application to Bacterial Cell Division and Quality by Design","abstractText":"'Analytical science is key for the success of any fundamental or applied research programme and underpins industrial progress and production. To achieve the next level of innovation in European research and industry we need new experimental and theoretical analytical methodologies, and new ways of applying existing techniques. Achieving this requires European analytical scientists trained to think creatively, innovatively, critically, and practically, who can apply analytical science to particular problems and transfer skills to new areas. The ESRs of CAS-IDP will each undertake a world-leading multi-disciplinary multi-sectoral analytical science research project in one of two themes, a) Predictive modeling of bacterial cell division and b) �Quality by Design� of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products. Each project involves technique development and application, with integrated industrial and international secondments.\n\nWe propose an IDP model, with Warwick being the hub and providing a physical centre, but with substantial contributions from 8 other universities, 9 SMEs and 3 large/multinational companies. This model will maximize cohort identity and team spirit among the 13 x 36 month ESRs for whom funding is sought. Daily contact between the ESRs will add considerable value given the varied and multi-disciplinary scientific remit of the IDP. Each ESR will be undergo individually-tailored and structured scientific training supplemented by Warwick�s unique academically accredited transferable skills programme.\n\nOur IDP will have impact at the European level given the widespread relevance of analytical science � the ESRs will be in great demand in both the private and public sectors; European industry through new instrumentation, new products, improved process performance, new academic contacts and collaborations; society through eventual improvements in healthcare and industry competitiveness, improved scientific awareness through ESRs trained in outreach.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"316630","fundValue":"3816692.22","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
