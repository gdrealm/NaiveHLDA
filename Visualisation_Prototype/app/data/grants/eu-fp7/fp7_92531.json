{"id":"92531","title":"\"VR Surgical Simulation for training: simulator design, optimisation and assessment\"","abstractText":"'The better surgeons are trained, the safer surgery procedures will be. Virtual reality (VR) surgical simulators offer new possibilities for surgeon learning, training and assessment, but they are complex to design, requiring contributions from different disciplines, such as engineering, medicine and psychology. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve a proper interdisciplinary communication. Most projects in surgical simulation are strongly influenced by the engineering point of view, with weak contributions from the rest. This unbalance and the lack of industry support often lead to a premature end of the project. The fellowship aim at the Imperial Robotics and Imaging Research Group, in the Faculty of Medicine, is to evolve to a professional maturity and to reach a multidisciplinary view to improve the way simulators are applied to minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The training objectives are focused on enhancing my research skills and strengthening my interdisciplinary knowledge by acquiring medical complementary skills. This will allow to apply my previous background on computer science, VR and simulation techniques (see the commercial insightARTHROVR� simulator) to satisfy surgeons� needs. The main research objectives are: 1. To develop education and training programs for surgeons based on learning theory, using the potential of virtual reality resources. 2. To research which algorithms and simulation techniques need to be improved in order to make surgical simulators a more valid tool; and to design VR surgical simulators adapted to the surgeons� needs. 3. To perform surgical simulator assessment and to research on the evaluation of surgical competencies. A Personal Review and Development Plan in conjunction with Dr. F. Bello and the Staff Development Unit at the Imperial will be compiled. They will mentor me, supervising the attainment of the fellowship aims for relevant contribution to European excellence and competitiveness.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"236642","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2009-09-07","fundEnd":"2010-09-06","dataset":"fp7"}
