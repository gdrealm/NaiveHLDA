{"id":"106542","title":"Photocatalytic Materials for the Destruction of Recalcitrant Organic Industrial Waste","abstractText":"'The project brings together a consortium of EU and ASEAN researchers with the aim of developing a solar powered photocatalytic waste-water treatment system capable of mineralising the recalcitrant organic matter that is not removed by current biological methods. With an emphasis on generating novel materials and new understandings of photocatalytic materials and processes, the interdisciplinary team aims to develop cost effective prototype photocatalytic reactors capable of deployment in remote areas and of treating contaminated water from small scale industrial producers at rates of up to 500 m3 of a day.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"309846","fundValue":"5148336.61","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
