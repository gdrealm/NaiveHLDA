{"id":"103152","title":"Control and Alleviation of Loads in Advanced Regional Turbo Fan Configurations","abstractText":"'A novel adaptive winglet concept will be developed to enable controlled cant angle orientation and twist throughout the flight envelope whilst also providing a passive gust loads alleviation capability.  A CFD based aerodynamic design of the device applied on a baseline Turbo-Fan Aircraft configuration model will be undertaken, followed by a preliminary lay-out definition of the structure and actuation system required for the device.  Detailed parametric studies will then be performed to investigate the performance of the device in terms of both drag and loads alleviation capabilities on its own, and also in combination with conventional control actuators, and both compared to the baseline configuration.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"287078","fundValue":"450379.2","fundStart":"2012-01-28","fundEnd":"2013-09-27","dataset":"fp7"}
