{"id":"94786","title":"Mobile Optical Clock with Neutral Atoms in a Blue Magical Optical Lattice","abstractText":"'In today�s world, clocks play a very fundamental role in science and technology ranging from the Global Positioning System (GPS), international time standards to the test of the fundamental laws of physics at an unprecedented level of precision. In particular, millions of ultra cold neutral atoms confined in periodic light potentials can be used for precision metrology and quantum measurements. By carefully choosing the wavelength and polarization of the lattice laser, one can arrive at a situation where the two probed electronic states of an atom experience the same light shifts. In such a magical lattice, perturbations on the two electronic states due to light field cancel out and the spectroscopy becomes independent of the motion of the centre-of-mass of the atom. The main aim of this project is to create a novel mobile optical clock using Sr atoms in a �magic� blue detuned 3D optical lattice. The ultra narrow, 698 nm transition from 5s2 1S�0 to 5s5p 3P�0 is used as a clock transition. The clock, the first of its kind, has the fundamental limit at the level of 2�10-19 which is the minimum level of fractional uncertainty to date. In the first stage the project aims at a device to demonstrate relativistic geodesy and explore first applications. Furthermore this project will deliver enabling technology for various cold atom applications, such as force sensors for oil and mineral exploration or quantum simulation as a first step to full scale quantum information. These applications are now becoming mature with many fascinating laboratory demonstrations but suffer from a critical lack of readiness in terms of robust device-ready technology. This project aims at intra-European transfer of such technology from the German QUANTUS BEC in microgravity project to the UK and at the same time widen the application of the technology developed. It will link to ESA-programmes and closely collaborate with potential end users in geology and environmental sciences.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255000","fundValue":"231427.2","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
