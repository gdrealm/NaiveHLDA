{"id":"109386","title":"ENRICH: EC-ChiNa Research Network on Integrated Container Supply CHains","abstractText":"'The overall aim of this proposed exchange programme �ENRICH� is to bring together an international team of researchers to establish a research network, with a wide variety of skills in operations research, safety and security studies, green logistics, economic modelling, ICT, and intermodal management to develop a container supply chain (CSC) integration methodology, aimed at addressing long-lasting changes in operational, environmental, economic, technical and managerial practices in different segments of the rail, road, air and sea transport industries from an overall supply chain perspective. The network is a physical and virtual grouping of academics and researchers designed to create an interdisciplinary think-tank and knowledge exchange platform for enhancing CSC resilience and sustainability in today�s and tomorrow's operational environments, in which a high level of uncertainty exists due to economic crisis, security risks, climate change, and every changing technologies. The proposal is for a project of eight partners (5 EU members, 1 AC member and 2 Third Country members) with extensive exchange of both experienced researchers (ERs) and early stage researchers (ESRs) during four years to fully explore the complementary strengths and synergies within the consortium. This project will support and reinforce the collaborations amongst the participants and help establish a long-term research co-operation. The research will increase the European research capacity in this vital and rapidly developing container transportation field, and also maintain and enhance the EU�s leading position in the areas of supply chain resilience and sustainability. Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed exchange programme offers a link for research and training of the involved ERs and ESRs in a collaborative academic environment.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612546","fundValue":"592200","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
