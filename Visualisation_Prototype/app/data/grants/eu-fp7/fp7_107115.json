{"id":"107115","title":"New concepts in ceramic conducting oxides for improved energy storage devices","abstractText":"'Nowadays, there is an imperative aim to decrease the fossil fuel dependency and to promote an environmentally-friendly energy economy what will have great benefits in the society needs. For this reason, the implementation of green energy sources (solar, wind, geothermalï¿½) has been boosted in the last years. However, the exploitation of these sources requires the support of energy storage systems to compensate their intermittent power generation. It is as important, however, to develop, at the same pace, technologies that can store this energy in portable form. Two main electrochemical systems for chemical storage are the focus of this work. On the one hand, high energy density secondary batteries (Li/Na ion and lithium- air batteries) and on the other hand, high temperature steam electrolysis (SOE) systems reversibly used for zero emission hydrogen production (energy storage) or energy production as a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) as a function of the energy demand. Large-scale commercialization of these devices urgently needs the design and implementation of novel materials with improved properties and low cost; a complete breakthrough in materials science. Ceramic materials can be obtained with a wide variety of stoichiometries, crystal structures and therefore, electrochemical properties with applicability in both proposed devices. The aim of this project is to explore beyond the conventional materials used in the last decades (mainly perovskite-and fluorite-related materials) trying to investigate and identify new networks of open crystal structures for highly conducting ceramics: mixed ionic-electronic conductor electrodes and pure ionic electrolytes (proton, oxygen and/or ion-alkaline).  The study of the relationships between the chemistry, structure and electrical properties will be used to determine the factors governing the transport properties allowing the design of the desired properties in the materials.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"331298","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
