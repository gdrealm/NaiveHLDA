{"id":"90507","title":"CARBOSORB - Carbon (Nano) Sorbents for Environmental Remediation","abstractText":"'The aim of this project is to develop and manufacture permeable composite �filters� in which carbon-rich nanoparticles (or nanoporous materials) will be embedded (and contained in a recyclable 3D structure), and use these as the basis of recyclable, high performance water clean-up devices, for application in the environmental and industrial sectors.  It brings together a multidisciplinary consortium of specialists in different areas of environmental (geo)chemistry, nanotechnology, and physical, analytical, synthetic, polymer and surface chemistry, working with a common aim of developing new and efficient methods of contaminant removal from surface and groundwaters, drinking waters, and trade and industrial effluents.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"230676","fundValue":"1284892","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
