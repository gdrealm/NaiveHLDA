{"id":"101735","title":"Miniaturised Robotic systems for holistic in-situ Repair and maintenance works in restrained and hazardous environments","abstractText":"'MiRoR aims to develop a fundamentally novel concept of a Miniaturised Robotic Machine (Mini-RoboMach) system, that equipped with intelligence-driven and autonomous abilities, will be demonstrated for holistic in-situ repair and maintenance of large and/or intricate installations.\nThis will be done via the following research steps:\n-Develop a novel concept of Mini-RoboMach, with unique complementary miniature systems: (1) novel �free-leg hexapod� (i.e. without base platform) for providing both �walking� and 6-axis processing capability; (2) an original stiffness-controlled flexible-arm robot for enabling �snaking� and 6-axis light processing ability. The complementarily means that a hybrid configuration of Mini-RoboMach, i.e. �walk & snake-in� can be utilised.\n-Develop MiRoR intelligent controller equipped with following key abilities:\nSelf-positioning: enable walk and/or snake navigations to/from work and calibration of end-effectors on required features;\nReasoning: decide on methods of accessing the working area (walking and/or snaking-in mode) while learning from these experiences.\nPlanning: schedule task successions and optimise Mini-RoboMach path in reference to intervention on different places within the installation\nAdaptation: modify the parameters of treatment procedures for developing a self-protection ability of Mini-RoboMach in case it encounters harmful/unfavourable conditions.\n-Develop a unique virtual test bench for the hardware (e.g. Mini-RoboMach) and software (intelligent controller) of MiRoR so that its robustness and capability to work unsupervised within required harsh/remote workspaces can pre-assessed and corrected before its effective utilisation.\n-Demonstrate MiRoR by performing in-situ holistic repair/maintenance works (e.g. inspection and processing � material deposition, removal) on high investment, large and/or intricate industrial such as (power plants, aero-engines, construction / infrastructure, offshore platforms, etc).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"284959","fundValue":"5038220.32","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
