{"id":"186697","title":"Living the Law: Transitional Justice in Colombia","abstractText":"'The proposed project �Living the Law: Transitional Justice in Colombia� is intended to help the researcher to attain a leading independent position as a socio-legal scholar.The researcher, a social anthropologist, will acquire new skills and knowledge in empirical socio-\nlegal research and will return to her host institution equipped to teach and publish in the still under-represented field of socio-legal studies in Europe.Dr Brunnegger�s research seeks to develop an understanding of the complexity and specificity of �transitional justice� which proceeds through the legal framework of the �Justice and Peace Law� in Colombia.The project aims to recover an account of the subjective experiences of a range of different players involved in transitional justice (lawmakers, demobilized soldiers and victims).It will then try to make sense of these fragmentary experiences in the context of some broader, socially and legally committed characterization of justice through quantitative data. In method, the project will therefore be both qualitative and quantitative as it seeks to assess a range of processes and  impacts of the �Justice and Peace Law�.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"629510","fundValue":"379665.2","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2019-05-01","dataset":"fp7"}
