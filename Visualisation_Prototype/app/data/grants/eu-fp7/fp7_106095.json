{"id":"106095","title":"Natural History Museum Science Night","abstractText":"'NHM NIGHTS will deliver the mass participation of a diverse public audience in a unique event to meet many of the Museum�s most dynamic and engaging scientists from around the world in an unprecedented festival of scientists in central London. With a rich and vibrant community of research scientist and PhD students that are accomplished science communication practitioners the NHM is well position to breakdown existing public stereotypes of researchers, to drive home to the public the role and value of scientists and to inspire the next generation of young researchers.\n3500 participants will visit the large campus to be greeted by over 50 working scientists delivering more than 30 different engaging activities and formats alongside professional educators in a fun and relaxed atmosphere. The impact of this event on the 3500 participants will be profound, perhaps life-changing for some, and at an approximate spend per head of �55 represents excellent value to foster a long term engagement with science.\nThe intense and wide reaching awareness campaign will ensure mass participation and broad awareness of the NHM NIGHTS project as well as the European Researcher Nights initiative across Europe. This campaign aims to reach a wider audience of over 2 million people giving excellent return on a �0.1 spend per head.\nAll 300 scientists at the NHM engage the wider public but NHM NIGHTS will particularly target young female researchers and scientists from a wide range of ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds to meet an equally diverse public audience. As well as addressing  science and research this event will be unique in celebrating EU research, international collaborations and the global nature of science as a human endeavor of immeasurable value to society.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"265791","fundValue":"132000.02","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
