{"id":"101404","title":"Development of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes for the Chemical Manufacturing Industries","abstractText":"'The objective of the P4FIFTY project is to deliver a trans-European network of industrially oriented white biotechnologists fully trained in the application of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) for application in the chemical manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries. This will\ninvolve academic groups investigating P450 diversity exploration from the wild type enzymes and their genes, genome mining for novel P450s, the expression of these in suitable hosts, the enzymology and molecular biological manipulation of these (including directed evolution and high\nthroughput screening [HTS] methods), the chemical application and finally the chemical and biochemical engineering aspects of application. These inputs are supported by two industrial partners one from the pharmaceutical industries (drug metabolism and synthesis) and one from the large scale chemical manufacturing industry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"289217","fundValue":"4165298.77","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
