{"id":"94639","title":"Striatal Neuron Anatomy and Physiology in Parkinsons Disease","abstractText":"'The basal ganglia are a group of interconnected subcortical nuclei that comprise one of the brain�s fundamental processing units. Striatal circuits lie at the centre of the basal ganglia, and are critical for the performance of the high-level computations required for complex motor and cognitive behaviours. The striatum is composed primarily of projection neurons, but the small proportion of interneurons is highly influential in controlling activity across the structure. Striatal neurons are also the main target of dopaminergic signals arising in the midbrain, the loss of which underlies Parkinson�s disease, a common neurodegenerative disease. Depletion of dopamine in the striatum leads to abnormal network oscillations in the basal ganglia and it has been hypothesized that such activities cause the cardinal symptoms of Parkinson�s disease; rigidity and akinesia. Despite the importance of striatal circuits, the mechanisms by which the different types of striatal neuron interact to support behaviour are not well understood. The overall aim of this project is to define the roles played by different types of striatal neuron in both the normal brain and a model of Parkinson�s disease, with particular emphasis on network oscillations. To achieve this, we will define the in vivo physiological properties of neurochemically- and morphologically-identified striatal neurons, including both projections neurons and interneurons. We will combine this with multi-electrode recordings of large neuronal networks, to effectively account for several levels of functional organization. This multidisciplinary project utilises the coordinator�s proven expertise in the electrophysiology of the striatum, while also offering him an unparalleled opportunity to learn new skills in neuroanatomy, as well as transferable skills for career development, at the host institution. The successful completion of this project will thus greatly facilitate the coordinator�s progression to full independence.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"256598","fundValue":"45000","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
