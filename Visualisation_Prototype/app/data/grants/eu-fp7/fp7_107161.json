{"id":"107161","title":"Greater Operating Temperature Alloy","abstractText":"'The objective of Greater Operating Temperature Alloy [GOTA] will be to select a titanium alloy capable of being fabricated into intermediate compressor casings, and enduring operating temperatures of at least 500 deg C in this service. Industrial manufacture of the selected alloy will be demonstrated, by the production of rolled rings; gravity cast and centrifugally cast samples; sheets, welding wire, and welded samples.\n\n�\tTIMET UK Ltd., [TIMET] will be the Principal Participant, and will lead the Management of the project.\n�\tSwansea University will lead the review of literature and prior industrial work. A candidate alloy (Ti) will be selected based on this review, and on commercial and industrial factors.\n�\tTIMET will supply Ti billets to Forgital Italy S.p.A. which will manufacture, heat treat, and sample rolled rings.\n�\tTIMET will supply Ti casting stock to Deritend International, which will manufacture stepped section cast samples by both gravity and centrifugal casting, aiming to overcome the prior low ductility reported in castings of highly creep resistant titanium alloys.\n�\tTIMET will manufacture sheet; welding wire, and welded samples of the Ti alloy. Significant process development work is required in this task.\n�\tSwansea University will test the samples of the candidate to generate a database of mechanical properties for this titanium alloy in cast, wrought and welded forms and analyse the samples to rationalise the test results.\n�\tThe tests will consist of tensile; creep; LCF; and fatigue crack propagation tests at both room temperature and 500 deg C. Also, tensile tests will be repeated after exposure to air at 500 deg C for extended time period, to check for deterioration in ductility.\n�\tTIMET UK Ltd., will lead the reporting of the project, and the Participants will disseminate the results through industrial meetings with potential end users (principally Volvo Aero and Rolls Royce) and through publications in academic journals and conferences.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"323378","fundValue":"796726.81","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
