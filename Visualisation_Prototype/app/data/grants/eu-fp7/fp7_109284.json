{"id":"109284","title":"The systematic Integration of Novel Aerospace Technologies","abstractText":"'Aircraft are but one sub-system operating within a global air transportation �system of systems�. The design and operation of an aircraft as one integrated system is becoming an ever stronger requirement due to increased complexity, demands in performance and market pressures forcing the industry to better integrate its design, processes & operations to meet their targets. It is not sufficient to develop the vehicle in isolation. An overall strategy for developing integrated systems requirements to meet these demands is required and suitable training needs to be provided which allows in-depth technical studies combined with a global vision, inclusive of exploitation and operations, for air transportation. An overall, performing air transport solution needs to see integration of aircraft and their operation and be looked at as a super-system in its own right.\n\nINNOVATE aims to train the next generation of highly skilled engineers and scientists able to understand, undertake and support state-of-the-art technological activities and challenges for the aero-sector in a multi-disciplinary environment.\n\nIt will cover training spanning civil, electrical, manufacturing, materials and mechanical engineering as well as human factors and computer science departments at the University of Nottingham. This will be complemented by secondments to leading organisations in the aerospace industry to provide a real industrial component to the training and external training events hosted by world-leading experts. Individual research projects will deliver individual system concepts connected to innovations in propulsion, airframe, ground operations, navigation and communication technologies.\n\nThe outcome of the projects will link up to underpin a Virtual Demonstrator integrating the benefits of the various research strands and embodying the system vision developed by the Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) engaged in the programme.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"608322","fundValue":"3816692.22","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
