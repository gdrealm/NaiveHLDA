{"id":"189975","title":"Kinematic Identification of Developmental Disorders","abstractText":"'The high levels of deprivation and multi-ethnic nature of Bradford�s population make it an ideal setting in which start a developmental disorders epidemiologic study.  Bradford is the 6th largest metropolitan borough in England with a population of ~ 500,000 and includes some of the most deprived areas in the UK. Problems which begin in early childhood often translate into lifelong inequalities in health and wellbeing. Sixty per cent of babies born in Bradford are born into the poorest 20% of the population of England and Wales based on the index of multiple deprivation (IMD). Therefore being able to deliver potentially beneficial interventions from as early as possible in a child�s life is vital to reduce inequalities. Bradford therefore also offers an invaluable opportunity to test intervention therapies in a manner which is sensitive to the wider issue of health inequalities. Early identification of developmental disorders will be effective in engaging and helping those individuals which are expected to be in most need of intervention and yet also some of the most difficult to reach. The main aims of the project are: 1. To identify a selection of children who may have Developmental disorders. 2. To profile in detail these children to identify exactly their difficulties. 3. To ascertain how these difficulties influence activities of daily living or academic performance. 4. To elaborate an individual intervention plan for each child including recommendation for parents/teachers.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"630038","fundValue":"166204.8","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
