{"id":"101312","title":"Development of a Closed Loop Flow Control Algorithm for Wing Trailing Edge Flow Control Including Experimental Validation in Two Low Speed Wind Tunnel Tests","abstractText":"'Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA) aims to develop and test passive and active flow control technologies to improve the high lift performance of a wing. The purpose of this research is to develop and demonstrate a closed loop flow control to minimise the separation on a trailing-edge flap. The active flow control will improve the aerodynamic performance by delaying the trailing-edge separation on a single element trailing-edge flap. The flow control will be pulsed blowing applied near the leading-edge region of the flap. The pulsed blowing will be through spanwise segmented slots. A closed loop flow control system will be designed to demonstrate flow control on a mid-scale wind tunnel model. The Topic Description calls for two directions of closed loop flow control methods. The first is a pre-modelled approach which would allow the calibrating of the algorithm. This algorithm development will be devoted for future use in flight test activities. The second method is an adaptive algorithm, which will be adjusted by a �learning-by-doing� system. This approach will be demonstrated in mid-scale wind tunnel tests.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"271866","fundValue":"559191","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
