{"id":"100758","title":"Digitally Integrated Scientific Data for Patients and Populations in User-Specific Simulations","abstractText":"The DISCIPULUS SA aims at the grand challenge of the 'Digital VPH Patient'. It is an avatarnof the models and individual data that allow health prediction and disease treatment whennthe 'Digital Me' of a citizen needs to avail itself of health services. In essence, it constitutes anrevolutionary Clinical Prediction and Decision Support System. To realise this vision,nDISCIPULUS develops a sound ICT research and innovation roadmap, informed bynconsultation and engagement of diverse groups from modellers and technology developersnto end users, healthcare providers and regulators. The final goal is to deliver a single,nuniversally useful, all-encompassing VPH-based avatar.nTo prepare for this, DISCIPULUS consolidates relevant RTD results by examining criticallynthe state-of-play of both research and innovation throughout the VPH Community. Itndocuments and maps output central to the successful realisation of the Digital Patient. Itncaptures and quantifies the needs of stakeholder communities, particularly those ofnclinicians and patients, which are key for the crafting of a successful, usable Digital Patient.nThe structure of DISCIPULUS has been designed to optimise interactions betweennworkpackages. Technical activities (analysis of scientific/technical challenges,ntranslation/clinical scenarios) & roadmap production are facilitated by operationalnactivities (management, community building/engagement, dissemination).nThe five consortium partners, supported by global experts, assemble all the expertisenneeded to assure excellence of the final roadmap. DISCIPULUS lasts for 18 months, thenminimum time span to fully engage the VPH community and the diverse stakeholders, andnto deliver high quality results. Effort of 145 PMs is estimated, EC contribution solicited isnabout �1.4m, with substantial own contributions of �500k.nA strong impact is anticipated on buttressing EU leadership in VPH research, industrialnexploitation, quality and sustainability of future healthcare.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"288143","fundValue":"1573537","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
