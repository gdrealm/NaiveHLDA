{"id":"100839","title":"HOST FACTORS THAT FACILITATE AND RESTRICT HIV-1 REPLICATION","abstractText":"'The efficient replication and spread of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of the AIDS pandemic, requires that it parasitize an array of cellular proteins, many of which are unknown or uncharacterized, to facilitate its replication. In addition the virus must also defeat or subvert the human immune defences arrayed against it. Some of these immune defences, the innate retroviral restriction factors, have the capacity not only to directly interfere with the replication of the virus, but potentially to relay the information of its presence to activate a wider immune response � so called innate immune �sensing�. Molecular characterization of these processes for in vitro and in vivo replication of HIV-1 are essential for our understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS. Additionally, it will provide strategies for the development of novel therapeutics for HIV treatment, and also potentially provide new paradigms that are applicable to other pathogenic mammalian viruses. To fill these gaps in our understanding this application seeks 5 years of ERC Starter Grant funding to explore two major research aims. Firstly we propose to characterize the interactions of retroviral restriction factors with the wider systemic immune response focusing on Tetherin/CD317/BST2 as a model system. In particular we will build on preliminary data suggesting that Tetherin can act as a general �pattern recognition molecule� for sensing assembling enveloped viruses by: A) transducing a proinflammatory signal and B) targeting nascent viral particles for antigen processing and presentation. Secondly we will apply novel genetic methods based on a haploid human cell line to identify, isolate and characterize human proteins that are required for early post-entry events in HIV replication or the function of the viral accessory protein Vpu.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"281598","fundValue":"1500000","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
