{"id":"101446","title":"Libralato Engine Prototype","abstractText":"'The Libralato rotary engine is a potential breakthrough technology, an �eco-engine� for the 21st century, with a new thermodynamic cycle and very different mechanical dynamics than is the case with conventional internal combustion engines. The project will investigate the design potential of the Libralato engine through an iterative cycle of simulation and modeling, prototype construction and test bed evaluation. The main claims made about the Libralato engine are:\n\n1)  Only 4 principal moving parts: leading rotor , following rotor, sliding connecting vane, rotating exhaust port - dynamically balanced with exceptionally low vibration.\n\n2)  New Libralato thermodynamic cycle based on gas exchange between three chamber interfaces.\n\n3)  Predicted 9% absolute efficiency increase (30% CO2 reduction relative to 30% efficient gasoline engine and 22% reduction relative to 40% efficient diesel engine).\n\n4)  Predicted 4% thermal efficiency increase due to asymmetrical compression and expansion volumes.\n\n5)  Predicted 5% mechanical efficiency increase due to rotary design - torque transferred directly to output shaft.\n\n6)  Predicted to exceed Euro 6 emission standards due to longer and more complete combustion phase, homogeneous type fuel air mixing, complete scavenge of residual exhaust gas and lower demand on after treatment.\n\n7)  Predicted 50% size and weight reduction due to rotary design (similar to Wankel).\n\n8)  Predicted 30% reduction in cost due to: reduced mass, elination of con-rods, crankshafts, valvetrains, camshafts etc and reduced manufacturing tolerances.\n\n9)  Predicted 50% reduction in noise due to rotary design and low velocity exhaust gas.\n\nThe consortium comprises 2 academic partners and 6 industrial partners plus an Industrial Advisory Group (Deutz AG, SMTC UK, JCB, Mahindra and BAE Systems) providing a balance of research expertise, SME business innovation skills and commercial exploitation capability.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"266059","fundValue":"2490460","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
