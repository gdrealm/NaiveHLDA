{"id":"101132","title":"Novel nanoparticles for drug delivery to the skin","abstractText":"'The aim of the NANODRUG Network is to contribute to the defragmentation of the emerging field of nanomedicine by providing a unique training programme that will cover all different aspects ranging from NP synthesis and characterisation, drug delivery, molecular biology to nanotoxicology, preclinical studies, risk assessment and nanotechnology policy making. The NANODRUG training program is far superior to any training that individual partners can provide and will equip researchers with innovative and creative skills and enhance their career prospects in the public and private sectors. The scientific aim of this research training network is to develop and characterise a selected set of novel intelligent nanomaterials and to study their suitability as novel drug delivery systems targeting inflammatory skin diseases. The development and use of the NP described in this project aims to overcome the current difficulties that limit the applications of NP to skin drug delivery. The unique physico-chemical properties of these novel NP such as ultra small size, large surface to mass ratio, high reactivity and the capability to tailor them to applications will ensure that when complexed with drugs the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index of the delivery systems can be significantly improved compared to the free molecules and the capability to pass the SC of the skin greatly enhanced. This project brings together 6 academic groups and 2 industrial teams as full partners, complemented by 3 associate partners, one of which is an industrial team, distributed over a total of 6 EU member states and 1 non-ICPC country.  The consortium brings together groups with a very interdisciplinary expertise ranging from polymer synthesis and characterisation, computational modelling and physicochemical characterisation of materials to bioavailability, NP formulation, drug distribution and nanotoxicity, genetics, drug delivery and clinical dermatology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"289454","fundValue":"3752752.62","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
