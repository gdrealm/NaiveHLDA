{"id":"96576","title":"RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILDING SECURITY","abstractText":"'The RIBS-project supports the design of effective and viable integrated security measures aimed at protecting infrastructures without impacting on their business dynamics. In a global context where national interests are increasingly interrelated, the most vulnerable infrastructures in Europe, and particularly the most critical ones, are primary targets for terrorists. Attacks, carried out under a national, political, or religious banner, now strike regularly in our cities, causing deaths, damage and disruption on an unprecedented scale. In the past seven years alone, 1300 terrorist incidents have taken place on European soil. The RIBS project will deliver more effective and viable security measures by supporting a design process that integrates a broader understanding of the environment (and the contextual factors such as human elements) within which these measures are meant to be implemented. The particular objectives of the project include: � a set of functional and non-functional requirements that will drive an effective security system design process. � a set of protection measurement techniques that can be used to assess the level of protection offered by candidate security products proposed to be implemented in buildings and infrastructures. This work will be carried out for a range of security systems aimed at securing buildings against hostile reconnaissance, intruders and hazardous attack (including chemical, biological and explosive). The RIBS-project will derive a scientific method for security system engineering design that can be challenged and improved over the years, similarly to other areas of engineering and physical sciences. � Phase 1: Study of a &apos;live&apos; building and its �eco-system�, its protection measures, and threats; and integration of these elements into a single multi-layer model. � Phase 2: Identification of vulnerabilities through incident analysis and protection-measures analysis. � Phase 3: Development of design requirements.'","grantUrl":"http://www.ribs-project.eu/","grantId":"242497","fundValue":"4406966.8","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
