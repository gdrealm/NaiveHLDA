{"id":"189882","title":"Understanding the Concept of Self as a Phenomenal Concept","abstractText":"'Each subject uses a concept of self (or �I�) to reflect on and store information about herself. Possessing this concept, and thus being able of explicit self-representation, is arguably what makes a creature a fully-fledged self, or subject. The fundamental hypothesis of the proposal is that this I-concept is interestingly akin to phenomenal concepts (i.e. those concepts, like �red�, �shrill� or 'painful' we use to describe how our experiences feel to us).\n\nThe key research questions that this new theory is designed to answer are: (1) What is the semantics of the self-concept, i.e. what representational mechanism do we deploy to refer to ourselves through it? (2) How does the proposed semantics help solve some open philosophical issues concerning the self-concept? These include issues (2a) in epistemology; (2b) in the metaphysics of persons and moral philosophy. (3) What further implications does the proposed semantics have for issues raised by the self-concept in neighbouring disciplines, such as cognitive psychology, neuropsychology and psychopathology?\n\n(1) I propose a new semantics for the I-concept, conceived for the first time as a special type of phenomenal concept; this semantics is inspired by that of a class of linguistic expressions called indexicals. (2a) On this basis, I transpose what is known about phenomenal knowledge to the case of self-knowledge. (2b) The theory also suggests a new account of what grounds the special value we ascribe to persons as such, and why subjects care about their own survival through time. (3) I argue that psychiatric troubles (e.g. schizophrenia, Cotard syndrome) affecting personal identity and the mastery of �I� come from a dysfunction of the phenomenal �sense of self� I posit to explain how we can come to acquire a self-concept.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"622127","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2015-04-27","fundEnd":"2017-04-26","dataset":"fp7"}
