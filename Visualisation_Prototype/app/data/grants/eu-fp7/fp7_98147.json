{"id":"98147","title":"Biomedical Research and the Future of Property Rights","abstractText":"'This research project investigates the dynamics of private and public property in contemporary biomedical research. It will develop an analytical framework combining insights from science and technology studies, economic sociology, and legal and political philosophy, and pursues a social scientific investigation of the evolution of intellectual property rights in three fields of bioscientific research: 1) the use of transgenic research mice; 2) the legal status of totipotent and pluripotent stem cell lines; and 3) modes of collaboration for research and development on neglected diseases. These three domains, and their attendant modes of appropriation, will be compared across three general research themes: a) the production of public scientific goods; b) categories of appropriation; and c) the moral economy of research. The project rests on close observation of research practices in these three domains. The BioProperty research programme will track the trajectories of property rights and property objects in each of the three fields of biomedical research.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"263447","fundValue":"887602","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
