{"id":"98693","title":"Unravelling the  Mechanism of Phosphine-Borane Dehydrocoupling for the Synthesis to Order of Valuable New Materials","abstractText":"'This project addresses the fundamental steps behind the transition-metal catalysed dehydrocoupling of phosphine boranes which will lead to the production of new polymeric materials that promise to deliver an exciting set of new main group polymers with potentially unique properties. The complementary expertise of the applicant (Miguel Huetos, MAH) and the host laboratories (Professor A. S. Weller, ASW) will allow for rapid progress to be made, providing a unified picture of all the factors crucial to the delivery of this challenging goal that will have long-lasting impact on materials science and technology, catalytic methodology and main-group chemistry. To this end, well-defined transition metal catalysts, precatalysts, intermediates, main group compounds and model complexes related to phosphine-borane dehydrogenation and dehydrocoupling will be synthesized and studied. This will be followed by the application of these systems in the synthesis to order of new phosphine-borane polymeric materials. These novel and unexplored materials are anticipated to useful properties such as: being elastomeric, flame retardant, etch resistant and preceramic properties. As well as providing outstanding training and career development opportunities for MAH the project will have a significant legacy in the development of low coordinate transition metal chemistry, main-group and new materials synthesis.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"273235","fundValue":"200049.6","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
