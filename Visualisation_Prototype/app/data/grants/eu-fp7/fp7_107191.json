{"id":"107191","title":"Tandem Catalysis: New Processes for Meta-Selective Functionalization of Arenes","abstractText":"'Catalytic C-H functionalization holds great promise as a tool to simplify the synthesis and modification of organic compounds. A complete set of C-H functionalization methodologies would allow the synthesis of most molecules of interest. Despite important advances in the last decades, major challenges remain, in particular, on how to control the regioselectivity of C-H activation amongst the many C-H bonds present in the molecule.\nThe aim of the research activities detailed in this proposal is to develop a cascade process that will use CO2 as an invisible Directing Group leading to an array of novel direct meta-functionalization methodologies. Our new methodology will proceed through a multi-catalytic system where (a) CO2 is captured ortho to a group R, (b) a CO2H directed ortho-fuctionalization occurs, and (c) CO2 is removed leading to the product of meta-functionalization. Thus, this ground-breaking methodology will present enormous advantages respect to �traditional� cross-couplings in terms of cost (cheaper starting materials), and waste generation (only water and carbon dioxide generated), becoming a remarkably greener approach to the synthesis of the important biaryl unit.\nClearly, the development of a meta-selective C-H functionalization methodology with increased substrate scope would be highly desirable, improving the access to biaryl motifs, which are ubiquitous in natural products, pharmaceuticals and organic materials, offering a more direct, economic and significantly greener approach.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"326792","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-03-18","fundEnd":"2015-03-17","dataset":"fp7"}
