{"id":"111134","title":"Meredith Hanmer","abstractText":"'The project studies the life and works of Meredith Hanmer (1543-1604), a historian of Welsh descent whose fascinating track record as a clergyman, controversialist, scholar and converter of Turks still awaits investigation. Through (a) archival research and the assessment of documentary evidence, (b) historical and biographical enquiry and (c) the textual analysis and critical appraisal of his written production, I intend to fill a research vacuum by producing an accurate and historically timely biography of this interesting figure thus contributing to the reconstruction of the intellectual panorama of early modern Britain. The complexity of Hanmer's figure makes the research inherently interdisciplinary and the heterogeneity of primary sources � manuscript and print, historical and literary, comprising translations, history writing, pamphlets and sermons � will require the combination of differing research methodologies, thus making the project an ideal gateway for the exploration of new interdisciplinary linkages between research fields. Further, Meredith Hanmer�s colourful career is particularly well-suited to engage an audience beyond academia with scholarly research and with the study of the cultural, social and political implications of the activity of a learned figure of the past. Finally, the focus on the work and life of an early modern English intellectual will provide an avenue for collaboration between European scholarly communities devoted to the study of the early modern English language, literature and culture, and undertaking such a project within the mobility experience of a IEF fellowship will foster international networks of excellence towards the development of collaborative linkages for research dissemination.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327060","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2014-11-17","fundEnd":"2016-11-16","dataset":"fp7"}
