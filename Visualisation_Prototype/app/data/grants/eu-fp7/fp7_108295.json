{"id":"108295","title":"\"In-situ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Investigation of the Critical Failure Mechanism of Lithium Batteries: Toward safer, highly reliable and energy dense storage.\"","abstractText":"'The objective of this proposal is to gain detailed information on the initiation and propagation of dendritic lithium metal deposits in lithium batteries, a critically important and potentially violent failure mechanism in all forms of lithium batteries. With the use of powerful and non-invasive Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques, complemented with electrochemical and X-ray methods, unique insights are sought to impact the entire battery community. This research represents the development of adequate and timely solutions to aid the transition to renewable energy and a more secure and sustainable energy economy.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"330505","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
