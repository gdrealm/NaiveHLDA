{"id":"105411","title":"Innovative Radiochemistry to Advance Molecular Imaging","abstractText":"'The RADIOMI Initial Training Network (ITN) has the goal of providing training in a superbly suited academic and industrial environment uniquely equipped to conduct a scientific research program that addresses one of the key aspects of functional imaging, the underpinning radiochemistry essential for preparation of radiotracers currently difficult or not possible to access. This will be exploited for biomarkers development inclusive of preclinical investigation to maximise research and training output. The network will enhance the European knowledge economy via the provision of trained and mobile researchers equipped with the skills necessary to pursue successful careers across a wide range of employment sectors in the face of increasing global competition. Molecular imaging is a booming research field of critical importance to facilitate diagnosis of disease states, to monitor response to therapy and to streamline the process of pharmaceutical drug development. Upon completion of this ITN, a group of highly skilled radiochemists will be available to carry out cutting edge research in the field of radiotracer development and naturally enhance the global standing of European culture. From a research output point of view, a series of innovative and new concepts for radiolabeling will emerge, thereby facilitating tremendously the production of probes for molecular imaging. Novel biomarkers with  preclinical evaluation will be made available upon completion of the project.'","grantUrl":"http://radiomi.chem.ox.ac.uk","grantId":"316882","fundValue":"3918481.6","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
