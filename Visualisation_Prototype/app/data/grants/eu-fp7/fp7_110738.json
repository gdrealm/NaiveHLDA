{"id":"110738","title":"Reinforced Bioresorbable Biomaterials for Therapeutic Drug Eluting Stents","abstractText":"'Active therapeutic biodegradable and biocompatible materials are highly in demand. These are required for the production of medicinal products in a variety of areas including implant technology, tissue engineering, drug delivery and wound healing. Within implant technology such biomaterials can be used for dental, bone and cardiovascular implants. Tailored mechanical properties, biocompatibility and degradation rate is the key to the development for a specific implant.\n\nStents are tubular type implants that are deployed most commonly to recover the shape of narrowed arterial segments. Although, the clinical use of stents is widespread, they cause adverse responses including inflammation, in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Endothelialisation of the stent greatly reduces these adverse reactions. In contrast to permanent stents there is great attraction in the notion of a biodegradable stent that recovers and maintains arterial shape and then gradually disappears and avoids further complications.\n\nIn this multi-institution & disciplinary SME focussed project we will aim to provide the technological framework that leads to the production of reinforced polymeric biomaterials tailored towards stent manufacturing without adverse effects. Both natural and synthetic polymers will be produced and used. These will be reinforced and functionalised using a variety of techniques. Controlled delivery of suitable positive additives including antimitotic factors will be aimed for and their release monitored. These highly functionalised active biomaterials will be characterised thoroughly for material properties, biocompatibility, rate of biodegradation and used for the production of ideal stents. These will be characterized thoroughly leading to preclinical validation. All required production and manufacturing guidelines will be followed.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"604251","fundValue":"5874420","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
