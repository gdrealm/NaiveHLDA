{"id":"95966","title":"Ion Beam Applications to High-density Memory Archives","abstractText":"'Nowadays, safe archival data storage has become an urgent issue. The IBAHMA project concerns a new approach to providing ultra-stable (>50 years), ultra-high density (>1Tbit/sq.in.) data storage for archival applications, using ion-implantation to write nanoscale data into hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) films. Wide bandgap optical materials, such as a-SiC:H, when exposed to moderate ion doses develop useful optical contrast between regions of different irradiation levels. Absorption coefficient change of 1-2 orders of magnitude can be achieved by ion bombardment with chemically active species, like Ga. The optical contrast formation mechanism is based on the ion beam induced structural and chemical modification of the implanted material, leading to considerable optical band-gap decrease and hence optical absorption increase. Furthermore, high-resolution digital (or analog) features of about 10 nm minimum size can be generated using focused ion beams (FIB), leading potentially to ultra-high storage densities. The use of Ga as an implanted species is of particular interest due to its widespread use in FIB systems and its relatively low melting point, which favours Ga incorporation as dispersed clusters or small nanoparticles in the host material. In this project, the precise nature of Ga incorporation into a-SiC:H films will be investigated, and the role of implantation conditions and post-implantation treatments on the achievable data density, readout contrast and data longevity will be investigated, and optimised conditions determined. In particular the precise role of temperature, both of the SiC &apos;target&apos; during implantation and of post-implantation annealing treatments in determining the data storage characteristics (density, contrast, longevity) will be determined. The likely limitations for the practical application of this potentially very important new approach to data storage will also be assessed.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251845","fundValue":"117213.6","fundStart":"2011-01-05","fundEnd":"2012-01-04","dataset":"fp7"}
