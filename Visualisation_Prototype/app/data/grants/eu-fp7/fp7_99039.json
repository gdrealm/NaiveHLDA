{"id":"99039","title":"Fairground Attraction - Molecular Machines","abstractText":"'We will construct molecular assemblies (machines) of unprecedented complexity leading to unique function. The machines will be anchored to surfaces, like their macroscopic counterparts, and are molecular variants of familiar fairground attractions the �Big Wheel� and �Teacups� ride. The functional units which make up the assemblies are phthalocyanines and porphyrins such that they are themselves multichromophore arrays designed to allow energy and electron transport to and from a metal surface. There are possible applications of these structures including potential for multielectron processes of relevance for new generation energy capture systems, molecular computing, data storage and security. The challenge is to construct, in a controlled manner, complex assemblies using recently described chemistry from the hosting group as a starting point. This new chemistry, which allows the controlled construction and functionalisation of silicon, gemanium and boryl macrocycles, makes such assemblies achievable for the first time. The molecules are aesthetically beautiful and likely to capture the imagination of the wider scientific community. Characterisation and evaluation of these entities will be a crucial aspect of this programme and will be important to determine the potential of this approach for constructing functional molecular device components. Surface bound assemblies/machines will be characterised spectroscopically, electrically and microscopically. Preliminary function will be interrogated using time resolved spectroscopy, electrochemistry and interfacial charge injection processes, and spectroelectrochemistry. The programme combines high-impact research with exposure to wide-ranging training and experience. In addition to new synthetic techniques and protocols, the researcher will be the link-point in a multidisciplinary project, gaining exposure to advanced characterisation techniques, surface science and microscopy, photochemistry and device applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"273309","fundValue":"201049.6","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
