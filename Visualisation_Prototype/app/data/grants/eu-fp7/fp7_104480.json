{"id":"104480","title":"Optimal Control Technologies in Quantum Information Processing","abstractText":"We seek to bring together all major European and Israeli research centres in Optimal Control of Quantum Information Processing. This project will coordinate ongoing research activities, best practice dissemination, personnel training and public engagement as well as interaction with public stakeholders and policymakers for 17 established research groups from 15 universities in 6 countries � a total of about 60 scientists and 30 PhD students, spanning a variety of nationalities, races, cultures, social backgrounds, genders and career stages.<br/>The proposed Consortium will join the forces of multiple EU and Israeli research groups to explore a radical alternative to the currently established information processing technologies � quantum information processing, where bits are carried by atoms or elementary particles and dramatic acceleration is believed to be possible for several types of computational tasks. Our specific research area within Quantum Information Processing is optimal control of quantum bits � a set of technologies that enable extremely accurate manipulation of quantum bits with minimal expenditure of energy.<br/>Within this Coordination Action, we aim to create a vibrant, productive and efficient European research community, to deliver value to the society and to grow a new generation of young European physicists.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"297861","fundValue":"486751","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
