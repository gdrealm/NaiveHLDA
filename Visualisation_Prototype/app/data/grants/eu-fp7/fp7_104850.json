{"id":"104850","title":"Children and War: Resilience Beyond Programmes","abstractText":"'The aim of this fellowship is to develop an integrated theoretical social (re)integration framework for children born of war and their ex-combatant mothers in light of the unique but extreme challenges faced by these children in contemporary African armed conflicts. Five objectives will be pursued, namely; 1. Identify and analyse the situation of �(re)integrated� ex-combatants and their children born out of forced pregnancies and rape by enemy soldiers in post conflict northern Uganda; 2. Identify and analyse the situation of �(re)integrated� ex-combatants and their children in post conflict countries of East Timor, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); 3. Compare social (re)integration policies and practices associated with study communities in Northern Uganda, East Timor, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the DRC; 4. Apply findings to the existent theoretical framework and thus revise and make more effective the social (re)integration approaches to benefit ex-combatants and the children born of war; 5. Participate in international discussions and contribute to building scholarship for improvement of social (re)integration policies and practices globally. Tasks will be accomplished in five phases, namely; preparatory; extensive and elaborate comparative analysis of study communities; in-depth analyses of social (re)integration policies and practices; development of alternative framework(s) for social (re)integration of children born of war and their ex-combatant mothers and the return phase to enable the emerging framework be tested on study communities in Oyam and Otuke districts in northern Uganda and thus, inform further refinement of the framework.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"299934","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
