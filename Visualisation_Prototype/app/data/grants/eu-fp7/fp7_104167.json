{"id":"104167","title":"�New Bi-Functional Catalyst and Meso-porous Layer for PEM Fuel Cells: Low Loading of Pt Nanoparticles on One Side of a Hydrophobic CNF Layer�","abstractText":"'Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) in combination with hydrogen are considered one of the best candidates to help to mitigate the climate change. However, there are still some challenges to release this technology to the market. One of the main costly issues for its commercialization is the amount of the platinum (Pt) that is used as catalyst, especially in the cathode where the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) takes place. Even though progress has been made during the past years decreasing the Pt loading, the utilization and stability of Pt must be increased to meet the application demands by changing the current commercial carbon support (mainly Vulcan XC-72). Here it is proposed the use of a hydrophobic carbon nanofiber (CNF) layer as Pt support that combine high stability to oxidation, high specific surface area without micropores and large pore volume.\n\nThe first part of the project consists of the growth of a CNF layer, which is directly grown on one side of a carbon paper substrate. The first objective of the project is the direct deposition of Pt nanoparticles on only one side of the CNF layer while avoiding a deep penetration of the Pt particles and maintaining certain hydrophobicity. The external location of the Pt particles, close to the central membrane, is crucial for a high fuel cell performance. On the other hand, certain hydrophobicity is needed to improve the evacuation of water formed in the cathode eliminating, or at least reducing, the use of PTFE. The second objective is the study of the influence of the addition of proton conductive polymers in the electrocatalytic ORR of the electrode. Finally, the last objective is the fuel cell electrochemical characterization of the electrodes by preparing membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) by using commercial and/or in-house prepared anodes and membranes, so that the fuel cell performance can be measured and compared with a commercial MEA based on Pt/Vulcan XC-72.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"302197","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"no date","fundEnd":"no date","dataset":"fp7"}
