{"id":"98828","title":"Untangling the network of RNA silencing pathways in plants","abstractText":"'This project aims to understand RNA silencing pathways in plants using the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model. The aim is to characterise the different modules in the RNA silencing pathways, the ways that they interact to form complex regulatory networks and the effect of these networks on growth and development. The initial approach will involve genetic and molecular characterisation of components in RNA silencing machinery. Having identified these components, I will then use different approaches to modify the different modules and assess their involvement in growth and progression of the algal life cycle. Chlamydomonas is an appropriate model because it has RNA silencing pathways that are simplified versions of those in higher plants, but in which there is still the potential for complexity given the existence of different types of pathways associated with suppression of gene expression at the RNA and chromatin level. In addition, because Chlamydomonas can be cultured synchronously, it is possible to carry out a system level analysis of regulatory networks: the extracts will represent the content of a single cell type at a defined stage of the cell cycle whereas with higher plants there are complications for this analysis associated with different cell types.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"276037","fundValue":"200549.6","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
