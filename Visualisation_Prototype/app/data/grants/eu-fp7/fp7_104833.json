{"id":"104833","title":"Research Network on Flexible Risk Assessment and Decision Science","abstractText":"'The overall aim of this proposed exchange programme is to bring together an international team of researchers, with a wide variety of skills in order to develop a formal safety assessment framework with appropriate support models for application to marine, oil and gas, supply chain management nuclear and transport areas. Life cycle safety of large complex engineering systems will be investigated in terms of the design, manufacture, installation, commissioning, operations and maintenance phases. A variety of appropriate subject topics such as uncertainty modelling, expert knowledge elicitation, human and organizational factor study, risk prediction, software tools, probabilistic risk estimation, cost benefit modelling and multiple criteria decision making will be investigated in the selected industrial sectors using the expertise the partners of the consortium possess. The proposal is for a project of five partners (3 EU members, 1 AS member and 1 ICPC member) with extensive exchange of both experienced researchers (ERs) and early stage researchers (ESRs) during four years to fully explore the complementary strengths and synergies within the consortium. This project will support and reinforce the collaborations amongst the participants and help establish a long-term research co-operation. The research will increase the European research capacity in this vital and rapidly developing field, and also maintain and enhance the EUï¿½s leading position in the area. Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed exchange programme offers a link for research and training of the involved ERs and ESRs in a collaborative academic environment. It also bridges both the gaps between fundamental and applied research and research in risk assessment and decision science.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"314836","fundValue":"384300","fundStart":"2012-09-03","fundEnd":"2016-09-02","dataset":"fp7"}
