{"id":"106998","title":"\"Design, Manufacturing and Impact Testing of Advanced Composite Materials\"","abstractText":"'Carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) are a composite material normally manufactured from a cloth weaved from carbon fibre cloth set within a thermoset resin. CFRP has an extremely high strength to weight ratio and will play a key part in the reduction of weight in aircraft structures and hence emissions. It has been proposed that the use of a nanofilled thermoset resin in the manufacturing of a structural CFRP panel may potentially lead to structural property enhancements (such as impact resistance) as well as to the occurrence of new functional properties (electrical, conductivity, flame retardancy). These enhancements are based on the specific nano filler chosen for the resin production.\n\nThe primary objective of this research project is the demonstration of nanocomposites technology for structural and functional improvements in CFRP panels for use in aerospace applications. Working in conjunction with Haydale, a Welsh SME, two nanocomposite thermoset resins containing carbon nanotubes (CN) and graphene nano platelets (GNP) will be developed. The resin will then be used to manufacture a series of CFRP panels using Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM). The panels will then be impacted and then mechanically tested. An evaluation of the improvement in structural properties will be made and is the primary deliverable of the research programme.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"298156","fundValue":"149995.85","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
