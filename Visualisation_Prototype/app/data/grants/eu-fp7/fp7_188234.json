{"id":"188234","title":"Holography for Ricci-flat and asymptotically flat spacetimes","abstractText":"'With this proposal the fellow intends to explore the AdS/Ricci-flat correspondence in order to understand and develop holography in Ricci-flat and asymptotically flat spacetimes. This correspondence is a `generalized dimensional reduction' that maps families of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes (i.e. with a negative cosmological constant) to families of Ricci-flat spacetimes, solutions to Einstein vacuum gravity.\n\nObjective I consists in formulating holography for Ricci-flat spacetimes and developing a holographic dictionary for them. This will be done by mapping the well-known holographic dictionary of AdS/CFT to the Ricci-flat spacetimes.  The fellow would then extend the AdS/Ricci-flat map to more general settings and develop applications, such as understanding the hidden conformal symmetry of asymptotically flat black holes (Objective II). Finally, Objective III focusses on using the map to transfer knowledge in the other direction, from Minkowski to AdS. The fellow would concentrate on using the map as a solution-generating technique, on the definition of an AdS S-matrix, and on properties of String Theory on AdS backgrounds.\n\nThe outcome of this project would be of fundamental importance in our quest for a quantum theory of gravity, and for developing novel holographic applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"628104","fundValue":"299558.4","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
