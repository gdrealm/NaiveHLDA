{"id":"105249","title":"Metal-Piezoelectric-Insulator-Semiconductor Field-Effect-Transistor for high temperature pressure sensing applications","abstractText":"'This project, entitled �Metal-Piezoelectric-Insulator-Semiconductor Field-Effect-Transistor� (MPIS-FET), will fabricate a metal-piezoelectric-insulator-semiconductor field-effect-transistor device for pressure sensing, in order to perform high-sensitivity strain detection (gauge factor>100) under harsh conditions (high temperature>500oC).  High-temperature pressure sensors are of extreme importance for automotive, aerospace, aircraft, power generation industry, and scientific instruments. The current pressure sensors suffer from various drawbacks such as poor thermal stability, low sensitivity, poor chemical inertness, high complexity in readout circuit, and high cost.\n\nThis project will bring a very talented researcher (Dr Meiyong Liao) from one of the world leading research institutes (National Institute for Materials Science, NIMS, Japan), specializing in the diamond doping, etching and sensor fabrications, to work with a leading Nanoscience Research Group (NRG) at Aston University (UK), specializing in diamond sensors and power devices, with a combined expertise to address the specific challenge described above. The project will transfer the skills and knowledge from one of the world leading Japanese institutions to the Europe through the Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship Scheme.  The proposed novel pressure sensor will contribute to the aerospace, automotive, and industrial society of Europe.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300193","fundValue":"278807.4","fundStart":"2014-03-11","fundEnd":"2016-03-10","dataset":"fp7"}
