{"id":"193017","title":"Development of a novel method for rodent control","abstractText":"'The Piedpiper project (funded under the FP7-SME2011scheme) started in December 2011 with its aim being to transform the Pest Control industry. To date it has developed (ahead of schedule) a new transdermal toxin and a new Pest Control Device using an aerosol to deliver the toxin.\nWith the EU ban on warfarins due to take effect in 2014 we believe that this project is not just viable but essential to offer the EU a product that is effective, safe and environmentally friendly. Rats and mice carry over 60 diseases that can be transmitted to man and cause damage to crops,buildings and infrastructure which costs billions of euros a year.The ever increasing rat population needs to be controlled. Rats have developed a tolerance to currently used warfarins, our product addresses this problem as one shot=one kill. Although toxic to rats our product is safe for humans and other species, resulting in a safe pest control system with a lower environmental toxic load and a lower carbon footprint than other methods.\nThe aim of PiedpiperDA is to fill the gap between the development of the new technology and bring it to market. This will require\nA business plan to be drawn up for use in the raising of finance\nRegistration, CE marking, finalisation of IP Protection to take place\nTransdermal Toxin and PCD to be commercialised and undergo field trials\nFurther Market Research and a program of  raising awareness of the new technology to be undertaken.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"605574","fundValue":"594800","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
