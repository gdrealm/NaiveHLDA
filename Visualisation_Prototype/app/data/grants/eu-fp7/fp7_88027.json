{"id":"88027","title":"Expanding the Potential of in vitro Compartmentalised Screening and Selection Approaches","abstractText":"'In vitro selections offer the potential to select from large libraries, with fewer constraints than current cell-based selections. The key practical consideration in directed evolution of functional biomolecules is the linkage of genotype and phenotype, which can be provided by water-in-oil emulsion droplets that act as femtolitre reactors.  Novel applications for catalytic selections of cellulases, key enzyme in teh production of bio-fuels, will be developed by in vitro compartmentalisation techniques in microfluidic devices that the host group has recently developed.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"220701","fundValue":"178874.06","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
