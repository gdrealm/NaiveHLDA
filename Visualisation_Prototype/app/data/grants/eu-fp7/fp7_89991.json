{"id":"89991","title":"Bridging the gap between science and stakeholders: phase I common ground","abstractText":"Together, the stakeholder and scientist participants in GAP1 will initiate cooperative research by making plans to combine knowledge in future participatory research. They will engage through a series of European and regional workshops. GAP1 represents phase 1 of a three-phase programme that aims to explore the complementary nature of alternative knowledge and investigate how to combine it in ways that will enhance understanding and management of natural resources. Tied to knowledge, GAP1 is an evidence-based approach that uses participation as the vehicle to improving understanding on fisheries research and management issues of common concern to stakeholders, scientists and policy makers. This is a pre-requisite for fostering the mutual respect essential for successful future collaboration.\nThrough initiation of cooperative research and helping build the capacity of stakeholders to engage in participatory research, GAP1 contributes towards the wider aspiration of the Science in Society programme. In particular, to enhance democratic debate with a more engaged and informed public, thus providing better conditions for collective choices on scientific issues relating to sustainable management, conservation of ecosystem integrity and biodiversity of the marine environment.\n\n","grantUrl":"","grantId":"217639","fundValue":"795383","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
