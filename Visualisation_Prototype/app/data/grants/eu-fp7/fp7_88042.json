{"id":"88042","title":"A device for biological high-throughput assays based on in vitro compartmentalisation","abstractText":"'The vision of putting a lab on a chip has far reaching implications for biological research. Microfluidic systems can now be built that - for example in past research by the applicant - can be used for protein crystallisation with only minute amount of precious proteins. A second challenge is to carry out functional biological assays on a chip. Such assays are used in high-throughput screening, e.g. for novel drug molecule or protein mutants with improved properties for directed evolution of functional proteins. In each case the economy of the assay system (total numbers screened, speed, reliability, quality of the kinetic readout) will crucially determine the success of this combinatorial approach. Water-in-oil droplets within microfluidic channels have the potential to serve as isolated reaction compartments, just like natural cells. Their femtolitre volumes minimise sample consumption and eliminate dispersion of substrates or products. To this end the candidate will build novel microfluidic devices that incoproprate the principle of in vitro compartementalisation. The fabrication of this device, and especially the integration of the various components is a significant challenge.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"220946","fundValue":"178874.06","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
