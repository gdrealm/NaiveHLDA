{"id":"109089","title":"PEDCA\nPan-European Data Centre Academy","abstractText":"'Data centres are the cornerstones which underpin the digital economy, and create the essential environment for both business and employment to flourish. It is becoming urgent for established data centre states to contribute to R&D, share and develop skills, define standards and promote strategies for network investment. All of these activities will lead to increased trust of new technology such as cloud computing and encourage collaboration and interoperability.  EU states with a less established data centre industry and  footprint, but with a need for it to grow can benefit greatly from the knowledge transfer, insight, experience and raised profile.\n\nInitial research and workshops held between industry leaders and academic institutions within UK, The Netherlands and Germany has confirmed that Europe would benefit greatly from the creation of a Pan-European Data Centre Research and Development Academy.\n\nMost data centre related standards, guidelines and research comes from the USA which often causes a confusing mix of conflicting information with little relevance to Europe. Therefore, many new innovations that promote energy efficiency and general improvements are misinterpreted, not taken up or developed. This is due to a perceived risk factor due to lack of testing, validation and education.\n\nThe vision, which is shared by the vast majority of the data centre sector, is to build upon existing collaboration within the data centre industry via the DCA. The foundations of such a initiative and broad agreement has already been reached. The proposal is to establish and extend the facility to all European Union states encompassing both higher education and the wider data centre industry. This is in order to meet the challenges laid out within the Europeï¿½s Digital Agenda.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"320013","fundValue":"1889811.13","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
