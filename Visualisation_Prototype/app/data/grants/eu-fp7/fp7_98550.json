{"id":"98550","title":"Latin Amercian Chinese European Galaxy Formation Network","abstractText":"'The focus in cosmology is shifting from the determination of the basic cosmological parameters to developing an understanding of how galaxies formed. Progress in this field has been driven by a combination of computer simulation and observational breakthroughs. Over the next few years, groundbreaking new facilities will come online and will provide data of unprecedented quality with which to test theoretical models. The key objective of our proposal is to allow European scientists to play a leading role in advancing our understanding of galaxy formation, by forging new links and research collaborations with scientists in Latin America and China, which host some of these new experiments. Our research programme covers all aspects of numerical galaxy formation. In addition to building new research capacity, we will organise a series of events to avoid fragmentation of research expertise and to help train a new generation of galaxy formation modellers.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269264","fundValue":"779100","fundStart":"2011-05-15","fundEnd":"2015-05-14","dataset":"fp7"}
