{"id":"87512","title":"Cross-layer Optimization for the Coexistence of Mobile and Wireless Networks Beyond 3G","abstractText":"'This Intra-European Fellowships proposal aims to boost the career of Fernando J. Velez through a research programme and a series of initiatives on next generation mobile networks in a context of coexistence to be developed in the Centre for Telecommunications Research / King�s College London. It will help him on gaining professional maturity, and having conditions to a fruitful reintegration in his original team and Institution in Portugal.  Networks of the future are tending towards a diverse wireless networking world, where scenarios define that the end-user will be able to attain any service, at any time on effectively any network that is optimised for the application at hand resulting in �flexibility and choice� to enhance the quality of life of the individual, in a context of seamless interoperability between network operators and access technologies, complemented by a business exploitation strategy that adapts to future economic infrastructures.  The economic vision targets a converged network and service infrastructure for communication, computing and media applications that will create new market opportunities for 3rd party service providers. The drive for ubiquitous, cost-effective communication in unison with new service provisioning opportunities provided the impetus for the OPTIMOBLE proposal. It intends to design, implement and demonstrate �cooperative networking and optimisation strategies� for next generation networks that will provide a significant step towards network convergence in a truly heterogeneous environment. Cooperative-common radio resource management strategies are considered, assisted by context-aware information for maximising network utility and QoS delivery, and by incorporating ad-hoc relaying and mesh networking mechanisms to ensure virtually collocated heterogeneous systems and coverage. These visions will be complemented by a business feasibility study, and will include innovative graphical cellular planning tools.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"221823","fundValue":"183018.23","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
