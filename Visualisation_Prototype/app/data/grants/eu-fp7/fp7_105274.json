{"id":"105274","title":"\"Design, implementation and validation of an automatic learning cure cycle optimisation process for the eco-efficient autoclave processing of composite materials\"","abstractText":"'Historically, most designers of high quality structural composite components for aerospace applications have taken for granted the need for an autoclave cure. A range of toughened resin systems with suitable properties for autoclave cure became available and were certified for use in primary structures, such as wings, fuselages and empennage components with integrated stiffeners. The use of autoclave has been justified as the highest of material performance standards is required (i.e. void contents of less than 2%, and glass transition temperatures (Tg) above 180oC) and as the required process certification is provided by the tight control of temperature and pressure. The temperature control system performance of large autoclaves has been a challenge for the process equipment manufacturers.\nThe OPTO-CLAVE project will provide a software that can simulate the cure process inside the autoclave and provide information about the material state of the composite. The software will be auto-learning so that signals from thermocouples and dielectric sensors will be continuously improving the simulation output.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"323520","fundValue":"99706.6","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
