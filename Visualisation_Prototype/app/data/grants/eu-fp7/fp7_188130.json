{"id":"188130","title":"\"Filling �empty� landscapes, mapping the archaeological continuum\"","abstractText":"'The research proposal envisages a two-year interdisciplinary program designed to stimulate changes in the way in which archaeologists in Italy in particular but also more generally in the Mediterranean world study the archaeology of landscapes, moving from an essentially site-based approach to a truly landscape-scale perspective. The aim is to help in the development and wider application of new paradigms for landscape analysis based on the integration between �traditional� approaches, multidisciplinary studies and new technologies in the form of large-scale geophysical survey and the collection and analysis of high-resolution LiDAR data.\nThe geographical focus of the project will lie for the most part in central Italy (Tuscany and Lazio) where the candidate has been working on two sample areas. The objectives of the Marie Curie project can be summarized as follows:\n1.To place the experience so far gained in Italy in a broader European and Mediterranean context through the review of information about relevant case studies elsewhere on the Continent and in the UK.\n2.To continue and expand the fieldwork in central Italy, mainly filling gaps so as to achieve a more continuous picture of the areas under study by improving the size of the samples.\n3.To confront and hopefully fill the gap between palaeo-environmental history and anthropic evidence by introducing environmental studies in the Italian context.\n4.To focus on archaeological analysis and GIS-based interpretation in a multi-scale landscape context.\n5.To improve understanding through the application of new technologies with particular regards to:\na. Evaluating the influence on changing historical patterns across time.\nb. Improving understanding of the likely returns from different methodologies.\nc. Improving planning and conservation strategies and policies in Italy and in the Mediterranean area.\n6.To learn from more advanced practice in the United Kingdom compared with the Mediterranean world.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"628338","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
