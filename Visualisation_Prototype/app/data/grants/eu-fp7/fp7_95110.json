{"id":"95110","title":"Elucidation of the architecture and dynamics of the bacterial cell wall by an interdisciplinary approach","abstractText":"'The fellowship will provide the researcher with a word class, career defining, interdisciplinary training in bacterial cell architecture and dynamics. The project is at the interface of biology, chemistry and physics, at an extremely timely moment at the forefront of technological developments. Peptidoglycan (PG) is the main component of the bacterial cell wall, crucial for cell shape and viability. PG is unique to bacteria and its importance is illustrated by the incredibly wide use of cell wall antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin. PG is a single macromolecule that surrounds the cell and whilst very strong, is also dynamic, allowing cells to growth and divide. Although the basic composition of PG is quite simple, its complex PG architecture has remained elusive. In a truly interdisciplinary approach the host institution has pioneered the application of high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) to the study of PG architecture of the rod shaped bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. The initial work has provided exciting new and unexpected information, overturning previous models. A key question now arises as to how bacteria with different shapes solve their engineering problems of maintaining cell integrity whilst allowing growth? The researcher has a great pedigree in the study of the biochemistry of the PG of the ovococci (which include a number of important human pathogens). The architecture of the PG of the ovococci is currently unknown. Thus the project will be a fantastic synergy between the researcher and the host laboratory, providing cutting edge training, not only in the application of novel AFM techniques, but also in their development. Such a cross disciplinary project will lift the fellow to be at the forefront of research in the field worldwide. This will give him an ideal platform for his reintegration and establishment as a mature and successful scientist on the international stage.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251336","fundValue":"239289.6","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
