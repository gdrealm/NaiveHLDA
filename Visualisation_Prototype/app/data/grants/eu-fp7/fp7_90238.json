{"id":"90238","title":"OLEFIN  METATHESIS AS A PRACTICAL SYNTHETIC TOOL","abstractText":"'Catalysis is a well-established area that is well known for shortening molecular assembly protocols. The beneficial overall environmental impact emerging from catalytic uses is also well understood.  Making use of catalysis, we plan to develop a program focusing on a very important reaction in organic and homogeneous catalysis that has not yet reached its potential; Olefin Metathesis.  The 2005 Nobel Prize was awarded to three pioneers in this area for their seminal contributions but the areaï¿½s potential has not yet been achieved. The program involves the de novo design, testing, application and commercialization of novel olefin metathesis catalysts. The proposal makes use of unique European expertise in metathesis. The assembled team is composed of leaders in olefin metathesis from various areas: catalyst design, application specialists in polymer and small molecule synthesis, heterogeneization of homogeneous catalyst, computational experts and industrial catalyst production and sales to end users in the pharmaceutical and bulk chemical industries.  This is a true conception to commercialization effort.  Economic and social impacts are foreseen as major.'","grantUrl":"http://www.eumet.unisa.it","grantId":"211468","fundValue":"5409094.2","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
