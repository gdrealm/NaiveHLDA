{"id":"102080","title":"Engineering Tribochemistry and Interfaces with a Focus on the Internal Combustion Engine","abstractText":"'The main aim of the ENTICE proposal is to provide professional development in the multidisciplinary field of ENgineering Tribochemistry and Interfaces for IC Engines, capable to develop the new generation of clean and energy-efficient engines.  It aims to train the next generation of researchers to work in diverse teams, to cross disciplinary and sectoral boundaries and apply advanced communication and information technologies to work across many scales of time and space. Detailed project objectives are:\n1.  To provide scientific and professional development to a highly motivated group of early stage researchers (ESRs) to address a number of key interdisciplinary research issues of great importance to the future of transport industries.\n2.  To facilitate and support scientific and professional development of two experienced researchers (ERs) to enable them to become the research leaders in two challenging interdisciplinary research areas.\n3.  To disseminate the knowledge and products developed through scientific research to industry, policy makers and the wider academic community for maximum impact of the research.\n4.  To initiate a sustainable long-term research, training and educational collaboration between the partners involved.\nHere we propose the development of a training network that brings together some of the key active research groups in Europe, with a leading international reputation, in complementary areas relevant to the fields of tribochemistry and interface design. A number of leading industrial companies, comprising of SMEs and LEs, will engage in training and facilitate the Transfer of Knowledge (ToK) to and from the industrial partner through research programmes for 12 ESRs and 2 ERs. The training programme proposed comprises two key elements; generic training to cover aspects of training required for future research leaders in academia and industry and on-the-job training which will include specialised project-specific skills and development.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"290077","fundValue":"3369190","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
