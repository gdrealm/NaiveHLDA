{"id":"96717","title":"Peptide-based Nanoparticles as Ocular Drug Delivery Vehicles","abstractText":"'This project will develop methodology for the manufacture of novel peptide-based nanoparticles and nanocapsules to satisfy an unmet clinical need: sustained drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye. The proposed consortium brings together internationally leading groups in self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle and nanocapsule preparation by chemical (Durham) and genetic (Nijmegen) approaches, drug loading and in vitro release studies (Helsinki &amp; Madrid), in vitro and in vivo assessment of nanoparticle biocompatibility and functionality (Helsinki, Madrid &amp; Tï¿½bingen) and polymer synthesis, processing and industrial validation of manufacturing processes (DSM). Polyester micro- and nanoparticles that have been proposed for ocular drug delivery have several major drawbacks: acidic degradation products cause inflammation; drug release is difficult to control; and peptides and proteins are difficult to encapsulate. A platform of novel, peptide-based nanomaterials, formed through bio-inspired self-assembly processes, will be developed to overcome these problems. Peptide-based materials have a number of attractive features: biodegradation gives non-inflammatory products; self-assembly occurs under mild conditions; they possess a rich chemical diversity; they are defined at the sequence level. Polypeptides and peptide hybrid materials will be processed into nanoparticles, polymeric vesicles (polymersomes) and nanocapsules. These biodegradable and biocompatible materials will be used as containers for the loading, controlled release and cellular delivery of therapeutic molecules. The consortium therefore will enable the industrial manufacture of as-yet unobtainable, high value nanotechnology-based products utilising intrinisically low-energy demand nanobiotechnological phenomena. These will produce a step change improvement in the quality of products for sustained drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye, enhancing the competitiveness of European industry.'","grantUrl":"http://www.panoptesfp7.eu/","grantId":"246180","fundValue":"5453873.41","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
