{"id":"90519","title":"New catalytic strategies for chemical synthesis: Enantioselective Organocatalytic Dearomatization ï¿½ From flat molecules to complex 3-D architectures in a single step","abstractText":"'Despite the changing face of organic chemistry one aspect remains persistent: the ability to make molecules to order is something that, even now, is still unique to the synthetic chemist. What is changing in synthesis is the way that we go about achieving our goal. The use of catalysts to control the synthesis of architecturally complex and enantiopure molecules is a key aspect for the future of organic chemistry. Not only does this concept impact strongly on all aspects of chemical synthesis but also the continued development of chemical biology, medicinal chemistry and materials science. The challenge for the synthetic chemist is to develop novel strategies for complex molecule synthesis that combine the factors of atom economy, catalysis and stereocontrol.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"236737","fundValue":"171867.63","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
