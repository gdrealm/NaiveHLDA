{"id":"87823","title":"Computational Modelling and Analysis of Automotive Vehicle Body Noise and Vibration","abstractText":"'This Marie Curie IAPP involves two partners � the University of Sussex UK, and CDH AG, a German SME employing around 30 people, supplying high-quality computer-aided engineering to the global automotive industry. A 4-year project is proposed involving secondments of both early-stage and experienced researchers. The proposed topic of research is on the probabilistic modelling and analysis of uncertain structures important to vibro-acoustic design of automotive vehicles, aerospace, and marine structures. The research project will attempt to extend a new approach developed by the partners which has been tested in the low-frequency region, but also has the potential to work in the mid- and high-frequency regions, where the SME currently has limited capability. Extensions of the method will provide an excellent training and career development path for researchers who wish to work on uncertain structures across the entire frequency range. Each partner plans to recruit an experienced researcher at respective locations for continuous periods of two years, phased appropriately. This recruitment will hopefully lead to the creation of a more flexible method than currently exists for use in the mid-frequency range, since existing high-frequency approaches are quite difficult to use in the mid-frequency region, and cannot be used in the low-frequency region. A successful outcome to this proposal will: i) give a number of early-stage and experienced researchers exposure to advanced vibro-acoustic analysis methods in both a traditional university setting and a challenging commercial environment, ii) enhance both partner research capabilities in the high-frequency vibro-acoustic region, iii) create a more flexible mid-frequency technique needed by the automotive industry, and iv) enhance the SME�s software product capability in the mid- and high-frequency regions.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"218030","fundValue":"766922","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
