{"id":"107849","title":"Embodied Minds and Mentalised Bodies","abstractText":"'How does our acting, sensing and feeling body shape our mind? The mechanisms by which bodily signals are integrated and re-represented in the brain, as well as the relation between these processes and body awareness remain unknown. To this date, neuropsychological disorders of body awareness represent an indispensible window of insight into phenomenally rich states of body unawareness. Unfortunately, only few experimental studies have been conducted in these disorders. The BODILY SELF will aim to apply methods from cognitive neuroscience to experimental and neuroimaging studies in healthy volunteers, as well as in patients with neuropsychological disorders of body awareness.  A first subproject will assess which combination of deficits in sensorimotor afferent and efferent signals leads to unawareness. The second subproject will attempt to use experimental, psychophysical interventions to treat unawareness and measure the corresponding, dynamic changes in the brain. The third subproject will assess how some bodily signals and their integration is influenced by social mechanisms.  The planned studies surpass the existing state-of-the-art in the relevant fields in five ground-breaking ways, ultimately allowing us to (1) acquire an unprecedented �on-line� experimental �handle� over dynamic changes in body awareness; (2) restore awareness and improve health outcomes (3) understand the brain�s potential for reorganisation and plasticity in relation to higher-order processes such as awareness; (4) understand how our own body experience is modulated by our interactions and relations with others; (5) address in a genuinely interdisciplinary manner some of the oldest questions in psychology, philosophy and medicine; how embodiment influences the mind, how others influence the self and how mind�body processes affect healing.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"313755","fundValue":"1453284","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
