{"id":"110346","title":"Novel conducting polymer composites for applications in medicine","abstractText":"'The goal of the PolyMed project is to develop a lasting collaboration between top class research teams in Europe and the US/Canada that fosters progress in the broad area of organic bioelectronics through progress in materials science. This will be realized via a cross-European, trans-continental network. Such a network is required as materials science is a discipline that has emerged first from a convergence of chemistry and physics, but has also recently embraced biological sciences, gaining cues from biological processes for design of novel materials. The PolyMed network will be a key driver for materials science through rapid identification and development of novel applications for existing and new materials, and will advance technological processes by building in enhanced capabilities in devices made from these materials; for example for sensing biological events or indeed acting as surrogates in case of biological dysfunction, i.e. in prosthetics. The combined expertise in PolyMed is essential to achieve a transformative impact.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612538","fundValue":"121800","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
