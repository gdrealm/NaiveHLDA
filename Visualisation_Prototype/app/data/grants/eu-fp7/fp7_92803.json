{"id":"92803","title":"Increasing Capacity for Implementing Gender Action Plans in Science","abstractText":"'The goal of GenSET is to develop practical ways in which gender knowledge and gender mainstreaming expertise can be incorporated within European science institutions in order to improve individual and collective capacity for action to increase women�s participation in science. This will be achieved by facilitating a sustainable, collaborative dialogue between gender experts and science leaders to agree on practical guidelines for implementing gender action plans within existing institutional mechanisms. Involved in the debate are 100 European science stakeholder institutions, 15 international gender experts, and eight European strategy decision-makers. Together with the Consortium, they will work towards improvements in five key areas where gender bias disadvantages women�s participation in science: 1) assessment of women�s work; 2) recruitment and retention; 3) science knowledge-making; 4) research process; 5) science excellence value system. The dialogue will be facilitated by GenSET consortium through a range of capacity building support activities, including consensus seminars, interactive workshops and dissemination and valorisation events. The outcome will be increased capability of European institutions to implement gender equality policy recommendations and a strengthened position on research excellence in the European Science Area.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"244301","fundValue":"1198630","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
