{"id":"107432","title":"Islamic fashion and the politics of belonging in contemporary Turkey","abstractText":"This project focuses on the current articulation of the politics of belonging in Turkey and addresses an important question about regions that are ambiguous in relation to European identity and politics and the influence of contemporary Islam. In this project, Islamic fashion is considered a privileged terrain for analysis. This controversial domain is debated in relation to a series of conceptual dualities that are crucial in the formulation of the politics of belonging too, from un-veiling and Westernisation versus re-veiling and Islamicisation to fashion versus Islamic fashion. The innovative nature of this project consists in its employment of a material culture perspective to investigate how the politics of belonging are materialised, and not only explicitly verbalised, within this domain. The following objectives guide the investigation: to explore constants and innovations in the design of fashionable Islamic garments; to analyse discussions of styles and trends in Islamic fashion; to analyse the institutionalisation of Islamic fashion; to investigate practices of assembling fashionable Islamic outfits and ways of discussing fashion and fashionable outfits; to analyse arguments for and against the very existence of Islamic fashion. The field research for this project will be carried out in Istanbul for nine months and will involve interviews with designers, fashion writers, producers and consumers, ethnographic observation, visual analysis and content analysis of debates in the media and social media. The expected results are fresh insights into the current politics of belonging. The project aims to contribute to a better understanding of Turkey�s cultural and political positioning and its implications for EU�s enlargement process and EU�s relations with Muslim communities within and beyond its borders. Thus, the project aspires to support efforts to effectively tackle social and political problems that Europe is currently confronted with.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327169","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-07-22","fundEnd":"2015-07-21","dataset":"fp7"}
