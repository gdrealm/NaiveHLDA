{"id":"92758","title":"Integrable systems in the theory of waves in fluids","abstractText":"'This project is aimed at studying nonlinear differential equations that arise in fluid mechanics. The equations that arise in nonlinear theories have many remarkable mathematical properties. The best known examples of such equations are the KdV, sin-Gordon and Nonlinear Schrï¿½dinger equations which are exactly solvable (integrable). In the recent years the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation has caught a tremendous deal of attention from mathematicians with different areas of expertise: spectral problems, integrable systems, analysis, differential geometry etc.The interest in the Camassa-Holm equation inspired the search for various generalizations of this equation with interesting properties and applications. A two-component generalization of the CH equation recently gained wide popularity. The project aims to investigate two main strands. The first one concerns the applied side of the integrable systems. It will focus on the investigation of the application of the two- and multi-component generalization of the CH equation (MCH) in models from hydrodynamics, theory of shallow water waves and the theory of metamorphosis. The second strand will be dedicated to the purely mathematical analysis of MCH, including development of solution techniques, investigation of global properties of the solutions etc.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235419","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2009-09-02","fundEnd":"2011-09-01","dataset":"fp7"}
