{"id":"104572","title":"Innovative Transport SME Support Action","abstractText":"'INTRASME focuses on the changing role, which SMEs have on innovation in the transport sector.  SMEs employ approximately 55% of the EU workforce in transport, and their important role in the value chain is expected to increase and change, especially in the emerging Low Carbon Transport (particularly road and air transport) sector, where reduced fuel consumption, reduced emissions and alternative power sources require innovation in a wide range of technology.\n\nThe rigid value chain of the transport sector is stifling the introduction of innovation by SMEs into new vehicles and transport-related products. SMEs (usually Tier 2 suppliers) find it difficult to interact with vehicle manufacturers, as they generally have short-term supply contracts to Tier 1 companies, who are strongly linked to specific large volume OEMs. Tier 2 SMEs have no collective voice or influence at European level and the EU is not taking advantage of or supporting directly the thriving innovative companies in this sector.\n\nINTRASME will address this market failure and focus on the opportunities that new markets offer to innovative and dynamic businesses. Responding to the call for proposals TPT.2012.3-2: �Bringing innovative products and services to the market:  analysis of pathways and best conditions for innovation�, INTRASME addresses the European manufacturing capability offered by SMEs of different EU Regions targeting the main goal of �how to bring more efficiently and quicker innovative products and services to the market.� The emerging Low Carbon Transport market will be used to examine barriers to innovation and to develop mechanisms to support the innovation potential of SMEs\n\nINTRASME brings together key European partners, in the areas of transport innovation. The partners have been selected to provide unrivalled access to national activities and associations on both a national and European level, to support INTRASME knowledge sharing, dissemination and impact.'","grantUrl":"http://www.intrasme.eu/","grantId":"314587","fundValue":"1563436.3","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
