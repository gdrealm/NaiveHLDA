{"id":"109574","title":"\"Wind turbine blade Anti / De-icing, combined Ultrasonic guided wave and vibration system\"","abstractText":"'The DeICE-UT project will overcome the current limitations of existing wind turbine blade de-icing systems by developing an innovative dual de-icing system combining both high power ultrasonic guided waves and low frequency vibrations. Previous work on helicopter blades has shown that low frequency vibrations are highly effective at de-icing across the blades except at the leading edges, whilst the application of ultrasound shows very good de-icing where the US power is high. The DeICE-UT project will apply these 2 technologies in combination to wind turbine blade applications, where the synergistic effects of the 2 technologies both prevent ice accumulation and remove already formed ice. To achieve high ultrasound powers within the required regions of the blade, guided wave US technologies will be utilized. By doing this, DeICE-UT will provide a solution that will enable the safe and reliable operation of wind turbines in adverse weather conditions and achieve the following benefits:\n� Significant reduction of downtime for ice-prone sites across the EU leading to increased efficiency and reliability of the wind turbines and increased income for wind turbine operators.\n� Significantly reduced maintenance and increased component lifespan, leading to reduced maintenance costs for wind turbine operators.\n� Significant reduction of energy to operate system � 2% of turbine power output for DeICE-UT compared to >12% for other systems.\n� Significant increases in the number of wind turbines located in extreme climatic regions and reduced residential complaints.\n� Significantly reduce the danger of accidents resulting from ice thrown from the blades.\nThe SME consortium target a significant penetration of the EU market within a 5 year period, achieving sales of ~ �71.5 million and creating ~475 jobs. Implementation of the technology across the EU will make a significant contribution to increasing the renewable energy share and reducing CO2 emissions.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"605138","fundValue":"1380668.94","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
