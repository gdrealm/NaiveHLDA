{"id":"103022","title":"PRODIMA: PRObabilistic Data and information Integration with provenance  MAnagement","abstractText":"'The PRODIMA project investigates provenance-based probabilistic information integration in the semantic web. During the project, a notion of uncertain provenance will be defined for probabilistic information integration frameworks suitable in the semantic web context. Properties of this notion of uncertain provenance will be formally and logically investigated. Furthermore, scalable reasoning algorithms will be developed for collecting, storing and querying provenance information in order to facilitate the computation of probabilities but als in order to enable provenance-based mapping debugging. By this means reasoning, mapping debugging and provenance management shall be combined through scalable algorithms. The properties algorithms will be investigated formally and logically. At the end of the project, a small demo system will be implemented showing the benefits of provenance-based probabilistic information integration in the semantic web context.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"302397","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
