{"id":"95157","title":"Fluorescent nanocrystals for activation and delivery of platinum drugs","abstractText":"'Chemistry has made major contributions towards fighting cancer (Europe's major cause of death) by developing small molecules which can act as anticancer drugs. But despite extensive research efforts, defeating cancer is proving to be an enormous challenge. Inorganic chemistry has made its most important contribution in the form of platinum (Pt) complexes, which provide highly effective chemotherapy for testicular, ovarian, neck, cervical and esophageal cancers. Drug resistance and toxic side effects means that there are many occasions when Pt-based treatment must be discontinued and limit the ability of Pt drugs to cure other forms of cancer such as the more common colon and breast cancers. The problem is that the drugs are not �smart� � they are not capable of identifying cancer cells and they react with a wide range of molecules. Another significant limitation is that it is not possible to control when and where they exert cytotoxicity. Here we propose a novel methodology to make: 1) Pt complexes capable of identifying cancer cells, 2) Pt drugs with a built-in security device �a switch which we can turn on externally to make the Pt drug active only when it reaches the tumour.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252840","fundValue":"173240.8","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
