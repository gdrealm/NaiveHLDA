{"id":"107386","title":"Engineering of Energy Efficient Extraction of Critical Materials- Application to the Processing of Niobium and Tantalum Minerals","abstractText":"'Current situation: European Union (EU), economic growth is threatened by the unsecure supply of materials which affect main sectors of the economy such as the energy, health and digital. Historically the main resources of such mineral are located in few countries which either suffer from weak political structure or, belong to the growing economies in which the national strategies are promoting unfair competition especially in EU, thereby smothering growth within. Research Project Objectives: The E4-Crit-Mat MC is going to explain the general principles for demonstrating environmentally clean minerals and chemicals processing, which is based on alkali roasting treatment of mineral concentrates at elevated temperatures (900oC), followed by leaching and recovery of alkali by recycling CO2 and further refining. In E4-CritMat we primarily focus on the processing of Nb and Ta minerals, as a case study because of their importance in the EUï¿½s micro-electronics, communication, and aerospace industries. Training Objectives: 1. Technological training involving high-temperature, aqueous chemical processing and characterization techniques, 2. Training in a business environment and learning its culture including exploitation and process economics analysis at the London & Scandinavian Metallurgical co in UK, 3. Enterprise training courses and its applications in industry for technology exploitation including the patent filing and licensing, 4. Environmental aspects of process engineering in mineral industry.  Impact expected: 1. Provide the MC Fellow with the tools needed to reach a professional maturity. 2. Strengthen the EU companies in the market for Critical Materials via long term relationships with Brazil and helped in reducing significant environment impact.   3. Reduce the dependence of fossil fuels in terms of chemicals and energy consumption and enhance the development of energy efficiency devices, contributing to reduce the carbon footprint in EU.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"331385","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
