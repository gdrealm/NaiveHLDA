{"id":"87800","title":"Developing advanced Biorefinery schemes for integration into existing oil production/transesterification plants","abstractText":"'An ambitious and achievable vision for 2030 is that up to 25% of the EU�s transport fuel needs could be meet by clean and CO2-efficient biofuel. To achieve this, it will be necessary to promote the transition towards �second generation biofuels� (e.g. lignocellulosic ethanol, syngas gas based fuels, pyrolysis oil based biofuels) but also support the implementation of currently available biofuels including biodiesel via integrated production of energy and other added-value products trough biorefineries. The aim of SUSTOIL is to develop advanced biorefinery schemes to convert whole EU oil-rich crops (rapeseed, olive and sunflower) into energy (fuels, power and heat), food and bioproducts (chemicals and/or materials) making optimal uses of the side streams generated during farming/harvesting, primary processing (e.g. oil extraction and refining) and secondary processing (e.g. transesterification). This will be achieved by bringing together the appropriate skills in Europe so as to create a critical mass of expertise necessary to develop the Biorefinery scheme. SUSTOIL will integrate the expertise of a number of Project Partners with the expertise of an Advisory Board composed of experts from the EU, US and beyond. Economic, social and environmental costs benefits of optimal integrated schemes will be assessed and main technological challenges/knowledge gaps will be identified, resulting in recommendations of key activities for future collaborative projects. SUSTOIL will disseminate the results of the action via the media, a dedicated website and the internationally recognised �Renewable Resources and Biorefinery� conference series'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"213637","fundValue":"1178873.86","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
