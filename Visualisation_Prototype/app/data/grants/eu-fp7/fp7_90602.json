{"id":"90602","title":"Multicomponent Radiochemical reactions","abstractText":"The main focus of this research proposal is to diversify the portfolio of radiochemical reactions for the production of known and new 18F-radiotracers. The strategy we propose to investigate is based on the use of readily available 18F-labelled building blocks in the context of multicomponent reactions. This approach has the potential to deliver 18F-radiotracers not amenable to direct 18F-labelling due to poor reactivity or he unavailability of suitable reaction conditions. The project therefore concerns the development of various two-step synthetic sequences for the preparation of architecturally complex 18F-radiolabelled tracers applying sequences that will combine a nucleophilic 18F-fluorination process with a multicomponent reaction involving an 18F-labelled building block. The application of this unprecedented approach to the synthesis of radioactive biomarkers which are notoriously difficult to label by conventional methods will be investigated. This project will advance radiochemistry for molecular imaging and therefore indirectly contribute to improve human health.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235744","fundValue":"177948.7","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
