{"id":"105682","title":"Composite Pipes and Fittings for Aero-Engines Dressing","abstractText":"'The object of this project is to update the concept of aero-engine dressing to the most advanced concepts already used in commercial aircrafts.\nThe existing design concepts and components utilised within the engine dressings have remained largely static for a long period of time; there is little difference in the components and materials used in the engine dressings on the latest Trent engines to the early RB211�s.\nIn today�s competitive aero-engine market, the primary product discriminators are cost-driven. Typical cost savings of 20-30% delivered by PMCs in replacing incumbent metal parts; therefore, provide added incentive for wider application of these materials. With these impressive advantages on offer, it may seem difficult to understand why composite materials do not dominate the latest civil and military engines.\nCOMPipe will allow to design and manufacture an agreed set of non-metallic pipes and support systems to replace traditional metallic variants in engine dressings. It will also identify the manufacturing processes that could be used to scale up the production requirements to meet future delivery needs.\nThe scientific and technical objectives to reach along the project will be\ni.\tTo design and develop a new concept of non-metallic pipes and fittings suited for aero-engines, specifically drains, scavenge, sensor and vent lines\nii.\tTo select materials meeting the required environmental constrains, both in the range of temperatures and in the chemical resistance to different products present in the aero-engine, such as Skydrol hydraulic fluid, oil and aviation fuel.\niii.\tTo develop one or more manufacturing practices and to improve existing methodologies driving to\na.\tTo a product standard with a near to zero wall�s porosity\nb.\tTo produce 3D geometries of according to the already existing metallic technology.\nc.\tTo assess the future full automation of the process.\nd.\tTo ensure that Nadcap qualification will be reached in a short time'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"323514","fundValue":"1800000","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
