{"id":"104187","title":"Understanding the importance of viral Fitness Impairment after Transmission of HIV: Implication on HIV vaccine design","abstractText":"There is an urgent need to develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines to combat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS pandemic, currently responsible for ~2 million deaths/year worldwide. The challenges encountered in developing vaccines to elicit broadly-neutralizing antibodies capable of blocking infection with diverse HIV strains, together with the wealth of evidence showing the importance of HIV-specific CD8 T cells in control of virus replication, have prompted efforts to develop T cell-inducing vaccines to combat HIV. However rational vaccine design is hampered by the current lack of understanding of features of an optimally-protective HIV-specific T cell response. HIV�s ability to evade T cell control by mutating to escape from T cell recognition suggests that it may be critical for vaccines to elicit broad T cell responses to limit viral escape. However T cell escape mutations can have fitness costs that may offset the effects of escape; furthermore transmission of unfit virus could lead to reduced viral replication in the recipient. We propose to perform an in-depth prospective analysis of viral interactions with the host CD8 T cell response in acute HIV infection to determine the importance of i. the fitness of the transmitted virus ii. the extent and kinetics of viral escape from the earliest CD8 T cell responses and iii. the viral fitness cost incurred in escaping from these early responses, in determining the prognostically-important set-point persisting viral load. This unique analysis of virus-host interplay will be made possible by the expertise in state-of-the-art molecular virological techniques that the fellowship applicant will bring to complement the host laboratory�s immunological expertise. Results from this study will give insight into whether vaccines should aim to induce CD8 T cell responses from which there is limited escape and/or induce responses that drive selection for escape mutations that reduce viral fitness.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"298450","fundValue":"278807.4","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-22","dataset":"fp7"}
