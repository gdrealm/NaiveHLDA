{"id":"111048","title":"Machinery for Molecular Factories","abstractText":"'The widespread use of molecular-level motion in key natural processes suggests that great rewards could come from bridging the gap between the present generation of synthetic molecular systems�which by and large rely upon electronic and chemical effects to carry out their functions�and the machines of the macroscopic world, which utilize the synchronized movements of smaller parts to perform particular tasks. The aim of this project is to design, construct and investigate the operation of synthetic molecular machines capable of performing sophisticated tasks in chemical synthesis. Its successful demonstration would give mankind the beginnings of a potentially game-changing new approach for the synthesis of organic molecules.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"339019","fundValue":"2142556.8","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
