{"id":"92111","title":"Experimental Resource for the Investigation of dialogue procesSes","abstractText":"'The primary goal of ERIS is training-through-research under supervision by two of the world's leading dialogue researchers. This will enable the fellow to expand his repertoire of experimental methods, including obtaining training in specific forms of experimental design, training in statistical analysis, complementary skills training, and exposure to new experimental problems at Stanford and Edinburgh. The vehicle for this training consists of an experimental programme that addresses key problems in dialogue research: the role of clarification requests, acknowledgements, disfluencies, alignment, semantic co-ordination and language change, in dialogue and multilogue.\nCentral to this programme is the development and refinement of the use of text-based dialogue as an experimental methodology into a fully-integrated experimental resource that supports interdisciplinary collaboration between multiple research institutes. It will enable the fine-grained, context-sensitive manipulation of between- and within-turn phenomena of multi-party dialogue.\nThe skills and knowledge acquired during the Outgoing phase, together with feedback from the international distribution network, will be incorporated into the experimental resource, which will include a repository of experimental tasks and interventions. On returning to Edinburgh, the experimental resource will be disseminated to the wider dialogue research community.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"236632","fundValue":"237878.97","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
