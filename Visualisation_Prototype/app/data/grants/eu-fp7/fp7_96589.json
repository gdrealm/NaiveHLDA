{"id":"96589","title":"\"Advanced Lagrangian Optimization, Receptivity and Sensitivity analysis applied to industrial situations\"","abstractText":"'In the last ten years there has been a surge of interest in non-modal analysis applied to canonical problems in fundamental fluid mechanics. Even in simple flows, the stability behaviour predicted by non-modal analysis can be completely different from   and far more accurate than   that predicted by conventional eigenvalue analysis.\n\nAs well as being more accurate, the tools of non-modal analysis, such as Lagrangian optimization, are very versatile. Furthermore, the outputs, such as receptivity and sensitivity maps of a flow, provide powerful insight for engineers. They describe where a flow is most receptive to forcing or where the flow is most sensitive to modification.\n\nThe application of non-modal analysis to canonical problems has set the scene for step changes in engineering practice in fluid mechanics and thermoacoustics. The technical objectives of this proposal are to apply non-modal analysis to high Reynolds number flows, reacting flows and thermoacoustic systems, to compare theoretical predictions with experimental measurements and to embed these techniques within an industrial design tool that has already been developed by the group.\n\nThis research group s vision is that future generations of engineering CFD tools will contain modules that can perform non-modal analysis. The generalized approach proposed here, combined with challenging scientific and engineering examples that are backed up by experimental evidence, will make this possible and demonstrate it to a wider engineering community.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"259620","fundValue":"1301196","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
