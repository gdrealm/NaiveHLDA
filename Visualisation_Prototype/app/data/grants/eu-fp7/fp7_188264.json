{"id":"188264","title":"Polymer Optical Sensing System Innovation Benefits Leadership Education","abstractText":"'Project POSSIBLE seeks to draw on recent developments in optical fibre sensors to tackle two important industrial sensing problems: the provision of an all optical fuel gauging system for aircraft and the development of simple, highly sensitive acoustic and vibration sensors for geophysical surveying and surveillance. Importantly, the project will form an excellent stage on which to prepare the Marie Curie Fellow for a future academic career involving innovation in collaboration with industrial partners.\nKey to the research is the developing maturity of fibre Bragg grating strain sensors recorded in polymer optical fibres, rather than the more established silica fibre. The much lower elastic modulus of polymers means that the sensors are much more sensitive to stress than their silica counterparts and therefore can offer enhanced sensitivity in certain applications, such as those targeted in this project.\nThe project brings together an early stage researcher who already possesses significant expertise with silica fibre sensors as well as some experience of the polymer devices, with the Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies who are by several measures world leaders in polymer grating fabrication and applications development.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"628604","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
