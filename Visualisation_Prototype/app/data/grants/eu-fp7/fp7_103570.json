{"id":"103570","title":"GAZE-BASED PERCEPTUAL AUGMENTATION","abstractText":"'The analysis and visualisation of increasing amounts of data is pervasive and indispensable in many of the crucial activities for a countless number of professions. Moreover, the amount and types of data that is available for visual inspection and analysis keeps growing.\n\nThe DeepView project proposes the use of gaze-tracking technology (i.e., hardware and software that can judge where the user is looking at within a screen) to extend the basic perceptual abilities of the user. The project will iterate on prototypes and empirical evaluations to explore the space of gaze-contingent manipulations that can improve perceptual performance in common tasks such as colour differentiation, visual search, and maxima finding.\n\nThe project will also seek to apply the results of the initial phases to applied scenarios in other disciplines other than Human Computer Interaction and Information Visualization.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"303780","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
