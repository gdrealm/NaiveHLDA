{"id":"94781","title":"Active liquid crystal colloids","abstractText":"'ACTOIDS aim at a vibrant multidisciplinary scientific field of complex soft matter materials, intertwining fundamental questions of activity generated dynamics and technologically attractive self-assembled structuring of colloids in complex fluids. We propose novel materials - active liquid crystal colloids � which possess a unique combination of active, self-propelled, material flow and the discrete ordering of inactive colloidal particles. The subtle coupling of the active flow to the particle dynamics suggests strong potency for interesting material characteristics and applications, such as particle-controllable microfluidic flow-patterns, self-assembly of colloidal structures by material flow, and controllable steering of the flow by external fields. The questions raised range from fundamental and applied material science to transport in living cells. The materials will be approached by continuum mesoscopic modelling based on generalized liquid crystalline dynamics, combined with collaborative experiments. The wide outreach of the proposed research will offer training for the fellow in diversity of skills and competencies building upon his scientific excellence. The fellow will train also on non-scientific issues, including communication and presentation skills, intellectual property rights, ethical issues, language proficiency and cultural awareness. ACTOIDS will be implemented at University of Oxford, an experienced host institution, renown for its ingenuity and highest scientific standards. Mobility of the fellow will create cohesion and institutional connections at bi-lateral and Community level. Strong ties with European and global scientific community, will put the fellow at the cutting edge of the �frontier research� as well as create links to commercialise high-tech research results.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253995","fundValue":"180603.2","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
