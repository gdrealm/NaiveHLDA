{"id":"90562","title":"Computational modelling of electromagnetic control of melt flows and heat/mass transfer during manufacturing of bulk photovoltaic materials","abstractText":"'This is a continuation of our experimental and numerical study of instabilities of melt flows in Czochralski growth of optical oxide crystals, which we plan to extend for bulk growth of photovoltaic materials. Our general target is a full-scale computational modeling of a bulk crystal growth technological process. The research is based on state-of-the-art numerical codes, and experimental and numerical results, which were developed and obtained in our previous studies, in which we established cooperation between Tel-Aviv University (Israel), University of Nottingham (UK) and Institute of Crystal Growth (Berlin, Germany). Our recent results posed new unanswered questions and problems, which are being addressed now. This application is assumed to cover the expenses of a one year stay of Israeli PI in University of Nottingham. The computational codes we developed, as well as setups built for experimental modeling allow us to extend the study to other monocristalline materials. In the present project we wish to focus on manufacturing of photovoltaic materials needed for wider and more effective utilization of solar energy. In the framework of the project the model experimental studies will be continued in Tel-Aviv University, the computational codes will be developed in University of Nottingham by joined efforts of UK and Israeli PIs, crystal growth experiments and the heaviest computations will be carried out in Berlin. The numerical codes will be extended to include additional physical effects and to be able to run fully 3D simulations thus reflecting real growth conditions.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"237411","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
