{"id":"108033","title":"Formulating an Understanding of Tribocorrosion in Arduous Real Environments ï¿½ Bearing Emerging Technologies","abstractText":"'FUTURE-BET addresses tribocorrosion of bearing systems. BET will address bearing design and performance to alleviate the effects of tribocorrosion in industrial sectors which have a great impact on the EU economy; namely (a) offshore wind power, (b) automotive, (c) offshore oil and gas, (d) new renewable energy technologies, (d) paper manufacturing and (e) hydropower. Each of the aforementioned application areas have different stringent and challenging performance criteria which continually pushes bearing technology to the limit. The impact of the Network will extend beyond these major sectors and develop a broad base of fundamental knowledge with even wider applicability to European Industry.\n\nThe main aim of FUTURE-BET is to provide professional development in the multidisciplinary field of tribocorrosion relevant to the successful operation of bearing technologies across a wide range of industrial sectors.  Tribocorrosion bridges the tribology and corrosion disciplines and describes the diverse range of surface/surface, surface/environment, surface/lubricant interactions and processes that can affect the integrity of the engineering system or affect the efficiency of that system in operation.\n\nFUTURE-BET brings together a major public (University of Leeds) and a private (SKF Engineering and Research Centre) sector organisations to deliver training to five early stage researchers in a flagship and highly original European Industrial Doctorate training programme, forming a cohort of uniquely skilled, highly employable scientists/engineers. The researchers will spend 50% of their time in each of the public/private sector partner organisations and will develop skills across to ensure they will develop to be the research (in an academic or industry environment) leaders of the future.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"317334","fundValue":"1467958","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
