{"id":"108269","title":"Performance Active Nanoscale Devices Obtained by Rational Assembly","abstractText":"'The key challenge of this proposal is to create artificial nanostructures that perform active tasks inspired by biology such as transport, chemical synthesis and molecular motion. Instead of bio-molecules, ligand-stabilized metal nanoparticles will be used as the main components that will operate embedded within a biological or non-biological matrix, i.e. a cell compartment, a membrane, an emulsion or a gel. Chemical multi-functionality of the nanoparticles will be achieved through a simple but conceptually new modular approach by which rationally selected different functional moieties are attached to the surface of the particles. While the global vision behind this proposal is to build the foundation for a technological implementation of active nanomaterials that operate far from chemical equilibrium, the research itself is purely fundamental. It seeks to demonstrate that the thermodynamic conditions essential to living organisms can also be applied to artificial nanoscale assemblies and enable these to imitate some functional aspects of life.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"321172","fundValue":"2494730","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
