{"id":"100903","title":"\"Health Effects of Social Change in Gender, Work & Family: Life Course Evidence from Great Britain\"","abstractText":"'Immense changes in work and family lives of men and women are well-documented, but their relationship with health and wellbeing remains unclear. The aim of this study is to use data from four longitudinal British birth cohort studies to assess the health impact of social change in women's and men's work-family life courses, for both the women and the men themselves, but also for their children and partner's. Generational changes in these relationships will also be investigated as biographies diversify over time.\n\nThe objectives of the study are:\n1. To characterise cohort differences in women's and men's participation in paid work, unpaid domestic work and family forms in Britain using longitudinal typologies.\n2. To examine gender differences in relationships between work-family typologies and health and whether these relationships differ by cohort.\n3. To investigate whether relationships between work-family typologies and health vary by socioeconomic position for men and women in different cohorts.\n4. To examine the effects of changing work and family patterns on children's emotional and physical development.\n5. To investigate the extent to which changing relationships between work-family typologies and health are mediated by changes in the social relations of gender.\n\nState-of-the-art contributions will be four-fold:\n1. The inclusion of biological measures of health, in addition to measures of perceived health, to examine the interface between the social (gender) and biological (sex) in national, longitudinal population studies.\n2. The use of life course data across cohorts to examine generation and gender differences in the health effects of increasing individualization.\n3. Investigating the health effects of social change within families, focusing on health effects among men and children in addition to women.\n4. The application of sociological theory to quanitative social epidemiology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"281957","fundValue":"681582","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
