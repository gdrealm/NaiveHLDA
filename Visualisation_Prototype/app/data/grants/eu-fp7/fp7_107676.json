{"id":"107676","title":"New Catalytic Methods for the Synthesis of Peptides and Peptide Conjugates","abstractText":"'The proposed research project is centred around the discovery and development of fundamentally new ways to construct organic molecules in the most challenging of environments. Herein the exploitation of a completely innovative methodology for the synthesis of biologically important structural motifs is envisaged; this should take place in an aqueous environment under aerobic conditions catalysed by a metal promoter. This new concept is expected to have enormous potential and a significant impact on research in this area. The overall objective of the proposed research project should yield methodology capable of joining complex molecules to one another, while generating new derivatives potentially exhibiting diverse biological activities. Therefore, the compounds prepared in this project will be tested in particular for anti-cancer potency.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327691","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
