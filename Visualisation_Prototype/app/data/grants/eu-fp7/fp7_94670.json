{"id":"94670","title":"Promoting science: does it work? Evidence from program evaluation","abstractText":"'The proposed research aims at evaluating the impact of policies that promote scientific education. It will address the effect of monetary cost reduction on enrollment into scientific subjects and achievement. It will address the impact of intense training in science at earlier stage of the educational process on subsequent take-up and attainment in science subjects. It will work out differences across gender and socio-economic characteristics in the impact of the policies; it will provide a cross country analysis of different policies aimed at promoting scientific education. Research will be mostly empirical, and exploit information in large British and Italian data sets. To accomplish the project, I will spend two years in the Department of Economics at UCL under the supervision of Professor Meghir. This is a leading institution for Applied Micro-Econometrics and Economic of Education in Europe. The department and its associated research centers do not only provide the expertise, but also the facilities and infrastructure to conduct top academic research of this kind. The project will give an important stimulus to my academic career. I will be able to draw on the unique expertise at UCL on the various aspects important for her project, develop technical skills and knowledge on my field of study, build strategic links and a more policy oriented profile. The current project has strong resonance with the EU policy of promoting women participation in science and meeting the objectives defined in the Lisbon Agenda and in the higher education strategy. It may also have beneficial spill-overs towards the creation of scientific links between UCL and my home university, the University of Turin, to which I intend to return at the end of the project, thus contributing to the regional policy of the European Community.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251668","fundValue":"165540.8","fundStart":"2010-05-10","fundEnd":"2012-05-09","dataset":"fp7"}
