{"id":"111254","title":"Measuring Youth Well-Being","abstractText":"'MYWeB takes a balanced approach to assessing the feasibility of a European Longitudinal Study for Children and Young People (ELSCYP) through prioritising both scientific and policy imperatives. Striking the appropriate balance between science and policy is guaranteed through the use of an evaluation/appraisal methodology which ensures that the outcomes will be methodologically robust, technically feasible and will represent value for money. A full scale pilot study in six countries means original empirical data on field experiences will provide direct evidence of the feasibility of an ELSCYP. Engagement with a wide range of stakeholders including policy-makers at a European, Member State and regional level ensures that the project outcomes take into account the broadest range of policy makers. Questions about the �value added� that a longitudinal survey can offer over a cross-sectional survey will, therefore, be fully informed by policy agendas. Children and Young People are integrated into the project plan to contribute to the operationalisation of notions of well-being as well as in understanding the best modes of conducting an ELSCYP.  The MYWeB consortium contains researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds and provides expertise in the areas of children and young people�s well-being, childhood care; education; the environment in which a child grows up, childhood/youth work and leisure and participation.  In addition, all teams are experienced in undertaking questionnaire survey research. Each Delivery Partner and Collaborator in the consortium is part of the FP7 funded MYPLACE project and have direct experience of working with one another on a large and complex project and the requirements to deliver to contract.  The consortium contains a team with international repute in the methodology of longitudinal surveys ensuring that the project outcomes are informed by cutting edge scientists working in this field of methodology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"613368","fundValue":"1659881.71","fundStart":"2014-03-03","fundEnd":"2016-09-02","dataset":"fp7"}
