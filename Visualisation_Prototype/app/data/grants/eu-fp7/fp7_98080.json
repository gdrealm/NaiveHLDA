{"id":"98080","title":"Correlated Multielectron Dynamics in Intense Light Fields","abstractText":"'Application of intense light fields opens the opportunity to image structures and dynamics of individual molecules with the combination of sub-Angstrom spatial and attosecond temporal resolution. However, intense light fields inevitably excite complex dynamics. The success of imaging techniques depends on our understanding of these largely unknown dynamics, creating demand for the theory of complex systems in intense fields. The scientific objective of the proposed network is to develop theoretical methods capable of (i) modeling multielectron dynamics in polyatomic molecules and clusters in intense light fields and (ii) reconstructing these dynamics from experimental observables. An important objective of the network is the development of a flexible software package for modeling intense-field multi-electron dynamics, addressed at the general scientific community.\n\nThe overall project requires synergy of different areas in atomic and molecular physics, quantum chemistry, molecular spectroscopy and dynamics, and software development. Thus, the network will provide an ideal multidisciplinary environment for training young researchers in the combination of physics, chemistry and computational methods used by different communities and taught at different departments. Training its fellows by research at the forefront of sciences, the network will also deliver the forefront software technology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"264951","fundValue":"3766281","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
