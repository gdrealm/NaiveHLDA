{"id":"110968","title":"Improving progress for lower achievers through Formative Assessment in Science and Mathematics Education","abstractText":"'The project aims to research the use of technology in formative assessment classroom practices in ways that allow teachers to respond to the emerging needs of low achieving learners in mathematics and science so that they are better motivated in their learning of these important subjects.\nThis international project will adapt and develop existing research-informed pedagogical interventions (developed by the partners), suited to implementation at scale, for working with low attaining pupils and transforming teaching.\nThe project will seek to: report the differences in the way that systemic structures influence the trajectories of lower achieving students within the participating countries; identify their typical pathways through the school system and reveal the educational opportunities that are open to these students. It will report on the varying assessment tools that are used to identify lower achieving students and may determine these pathways, with attention paid to the different interpretations of low achievement in each country.\nThis project aims to:\n�\tfoster high quality interactions in international classrooms that are instrumental in raising achievement for low achievers;\n�\texpand our knowledge of technologically enhanced teaching and assessment methods addressing low achievement in mathematics and science\n\nMajor objectives for the project are to:\n�\toffer approaches for the use of new technologies to support the formative assessment of lower achieving students.\n�\tdevelop sustainable teaching practices that improve attainment in M&S for the targeted students.\n�\tproduce a toolkit for teachers to support the development of practice and a professional development resource to support it\n�\tdisseminate the outcomes'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612337","fundValue":"2478828","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
