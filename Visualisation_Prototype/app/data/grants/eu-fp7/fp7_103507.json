{"id":"103507","title":"A NOVEL TRI-GENERATION SYSTEM POWERED BY SOLAR ENERGY","abstractText":"'This International Incoming Fellowship will bring a leading Chinese researcher to work in the Europe. The project has been carefully chosen to match Dr Huang's expertise in heat and mass transfer and solar energy systems with the expertise in renewable energy application in power supply and HVAC technologies at the University of Nottingham so as to maximise the benefit to the Europe.\n\nThe project aims to develop a tri-generation technology that can be used to provide decentralized electricity, heating and cooling powered by solar energy.  The tri-generation is achieved by integration of steam engine with desiccant cooling/heating technology. The desiccant cooling/heating system will use an innovative membrane technology to maximise heat and mass transfer between the air and the desiccant solution and also eliminate the carryover issue associated with liquid desiccant systems. The proposed research investigates electricity output, heat and mass transfer properties through theoretical and experimental measures. A small scale prototype system will be designed and constructed and tested under a range of conditions. The proposed programme of work will take a maximum of 24 months to complete.\n\nThe training of the researcher will be achieved through regular supervision and mentoring and a carefully managed research programme including computer modelling of heat and mass transfer, development of a prototype system and primary test as well as economic and environmental analyses.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"298340","fundValue":"270145.8","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
