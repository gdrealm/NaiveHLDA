{"id":"96682","title":"Laboratory simulation of cosmological magnetic fields","abstractText":"'The advent of high-power laser systems in the past two decades has opened a new field of research where astrophysical environments can be scaled down to laboratory dimensions, yet preserving the essential physics. This is due to the invariance of the equations of ideal magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) to a class of self-similar transformations. In this proposal, we will apply these scaling laws to investigate the dynamics of the high Mach number shocks arising during the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe.  Although at the beginning of cosmic evolution matter was nearly homogenously distributed, today, as a result of gravitational instability, it forms a web-like structure made of filaments and clusters. Gas continues to accrete supersonically onto these collapsed structures, thus producing high Mach number shocks. It has been recently proposed that generation of magnetic fields can occur at these cosmic shocks on a cosmologically fast timescale via a Weibel-like instability, thus providing an appealing explanation to the ubiquitous magnetization of the Universe. Our proposal will thus provide the first experimental evidence of such mechanisms. We plan to measure the self-generated magnetic fields from laboratory shock waves using a novel combination of electron deflectometry, Faraday rotation measurements using THz lasers, and dB/dt probes. The proposed investigation on the generation of magnetic fields at shocks via plasma instabilities bears important general consequences. First, it will shed light on the origin of cosmic magnetic fields. Second, it would have a tremendous impact on one of the greatest puzzles of high energy astrophysics, the origin of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays. We plan to assess the role of charged particle acceleration via collisionless shocks in the amplification of the magnetic field as well as measure the spectrum of such accelerated particles. The experimental work will be carried both at Oxford U and at laser facilities.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"256973","fundValue":"1119690","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
