{"id":"88892","title":"Pathogenomics and Systems Biology of Fungal Infections ï¿½ An Integrative Approach","abstractText":"'The vision of the FINSysB Network is to generate bright, ambitious and well-trained young researchers capable of contributing significantly to the knowledge-base and economy of the European Union.  We will achieve this goal by providing a strong, multidisciplinary training for early stage and experienced researchers in the pathobiology, genomics, molecular biology, bioinformatics and systems biology of the medically important fungus, Candida albicans.  This microbe causes frequent infections in otherwise healthy individuals and is a common cause of potentially lethal hospital acquired infections in intensive care patients in the EU.  Our well-integrated research programme will dissect and model the molecular interactions that take place between this fungal pathogen and its human host during disease progression.  FINSysB partners are all internationally renowned, contributing complementary expertise in pathobiology, genomics, molecular biology, bioinformatics and systems biology.  Our two SME partners provide a well-defined route for the translation of our research into the development of novel, clinically useful diagnostic tools and antifungal therapies.  Our research activities will be supplemented by well-structured training programmes in research skills and complementary transferable skills.  This training extends successful programmes that were established during FP6.  They will impart state-of-the-art skills in modern predictive and experimental biology as well as useful generic skills.  The personal development plans of our young researchers will be enhanced further by secondments to industrial and academic partners and by attendance at advanced summer schools (e.g. on Human Fungal Pathogens, and Yeast Systems Biology).  Using this combination of approaches we will provide our early stage and experienced researchers with well-defined career opportunities and equip them with the tools to compete effectively on the international stage.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"214004","fundValue":"3638872","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
