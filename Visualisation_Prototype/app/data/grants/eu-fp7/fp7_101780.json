{"id":"101780","title":"Biological Mechanisms for Bayesian Inference","abstractText":"'A growing body of experimental evidence suggests that animals, and in particular humans, are\ncapable of inferring knowledge about reality from uncertain or incomplete data in a way that\nis, according to Bayes� theorem, mathematically optimal [1, 2]. The case that the brain is, at\nsome level, a Bayesian inference machine was made much stronger when Ma et al. [3] recently\ndescribed a mechanism whereby a neural network could indeed store and manipulate\nprobability distributions � a mechanism that reduces Bayes� theorem to a sum [4]. We shall\nbring together tools and recent advances from in the fields of Complex Networks [5] and\nComputational Neuroscience [6] with a view to: a) designing methods and algorithms for tasks\nsuch as grammar inference or network routing; b) putting forward neural network models\nwhich are capable of integrating Bayesian inference with other necessary brain functions, such\nas working memory or information processing; and c) exploring, in greater detail, how\nBayesian inference could be carried out in realistic biological settings.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.O.
