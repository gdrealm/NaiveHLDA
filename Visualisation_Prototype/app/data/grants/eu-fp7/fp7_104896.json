{"id":"104896","title":"Detection of Biomarkers using Nanorods and Nanopore technologies","abstractText":"'The application for the FP7-PEOPLE-2012-CIG is to support a move and integration of a new academic moving to Loughborough University, UK to take up a position of Lecturer in Analytical Chemistry. The researcher to date has published 21 peer reviewed journals and has a current h-index of 9. The funding is to secure and facilitate the long term integration of the researcher building upon his years of research experience and his existing independent research which has already produced patent applications and publications. In moving to Loughborough the applicant will be positioned within a world renowned department active in the field of analytical chemistry and biomarkers detection.\n\nThis research proposal outlines a new technique capable of screening biomarkers with the capability of working directly in biological samples. The benefits of monitoring biomarkers lie in their ability to reveal signs of disease before the onset of major symptoms. The proposed technique will involve synthesizing nanoparticles that will be functionalized with aptamers/ or antibodies. These functionalized particles will capture the biomarkers directly from solution resulting in particle aggregation, and in conjunction with a resistive pulse sensing technology, will allow the quick separation and detection of the analyte, creating a new diagnostic technology.\n\nThe experimental details will deliver a single process capable of capturing the analyte as well as performing the initial sample purification and pre-concentration stage that screens multiple biomarkers for several diseases across a wide range of molecular weights and functionalities\n\nWhen combined with the support infrastructure in place at Loughborough, the award will deliver a world leading research group integrated into the EU, delivering a new diagnostic technique to enhance the European research portfolio.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"321836","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
