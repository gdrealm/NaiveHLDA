{"id":"109367","title":"Sustainable Manufacturing through Advanced Robotics Training in Europe","abstractText":"'The proposed training network will prepare the next generation of leading Advanced Roboticists to secure a Sustainable Manufacturing (SMART-E) sector in Europe.  It will train 13 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs)  and 1 Experienced Researcher (ER) and develop a leading European doctoral training programme, sustainable beyond the networkï¿½s duration. The SMART-E combines state-of-the-art techniques and utilizes innovative technologies in new or lesser known areas involving a team consisting of experts in Embodied intelligence (UZH), Soft Robotics (UZH, SSSA), Compliant Robotics (IIT, USAL) Smart materials (IIT), Safety and Human machine interaction (TUM and FESTO), logistics robotics experts (USAL), and a leading manufacturers and automation in aerospace and food R&D companies (Airbus, FESTO). The team is supported by a number of additional leading Universities, research laboratories and industries as Associated partners.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"608022","fundValue":"3948470.64","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
