{"id":"96497","title":"Controlled exfoliation of one-dimensional nanostructures; understanding the surface chemistry","abstractText":"'The aim of the proposed work here is to produce and characterise high quality dispersions of one-dimensional nano materials, unlocking their remarkable properties � properties that would be severely limited in their aggregated form, thus allowing researchers to realise their full potential. Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and bacteria cellulose (BC) are examples of such materials and will be the focus of this work; they form aggregates that display dramatically inferior properties when compared to their isolated, debundled states and are both known to be insoluble in most common solvents. Thus, in order to exploit their superlative properties, this work aims to produce stable, high quality dispersions � where understanding the surface chemistry involved in such dispersions is seen as central. This project proposes to investigate the surface chemistry of SWNTs in the presence of gas phase dispersants using Inverse Gas Chromatography (ICG) (a technique highly sensitive to small changes in surface make-up). Interactions between dispersant and SWNT, seen as crucial to SWNT bundle exfoliation, will be identified. This study will allow for a much greater understanding of the criteria needed in SWNT dispersants. Knowledge of such criteria will be extended and adapted to charged SWNT solutions. Finally, we propose to investigate the solubilisation of Bacteria Cellulose Nano-Fibrils (BC). The exfoliation of these one-dimensional intractable solids will call on skills and knowledge gained from dispersing SWNTs. Exfoliation of the BC nanofibrils will be characterised in a range of suitable solvents leading to dispersions rich in debundled BC nanofibrils � dispersions that should lead to superior composites and applications.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253048","fundValue":"171740.8","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
