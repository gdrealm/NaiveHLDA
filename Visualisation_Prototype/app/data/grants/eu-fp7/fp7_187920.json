{"id":"187920","title":"River flood Embankments Subject to Climate change: Understanding Effects of future floods and novel �low-carbon� adaptation measures","abstractText":"'The RESCUE project will develop a state-of-the-art approach to assess the impact of future climate-induced floods on stability of existing river flood embankments, both locally and at a regional scale. The �local-scale� approach will be validated against case studies made available by flood management agencies in UK, Italy, and Germany (Associated Partners). The regional-scale approach will be built upon hands-on learning resulting from the implementation of hazard maps for existing flood defence systems from Associated Partners. In line with the combat to climate change, RESCUE will therefore focus on the development of carbon-efficient adaptation measures.\nRESCUE will allow Dr Annarita Pozzato to shape an independent leading position in the management of flood defence systems in the context of climate change. She will be able to diversify her individual competencies by acquiring multi-disciplinary skills (stochastic hydrology, bio-engineering) and undertaking significant inter-sectoral experience through synergic collaboration with European public agencies. RESCUE will be instrumental in the creation of a European spin-out company, which is the career that Dr Pozzato is aiming to embrace. RESCUE will also give Dr Pozzato the chance of resuming her research career after a professional and maternity break.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"625258","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
