{"id":"102804","title":"The Catalytic Synthesis of Sulfonamides","abstractText":"'Sulfonamides are functional groups that feature in a significant number of pharmaceuticals, with applications in a variety of indications.  Conventional syntheses of sulfonamides usually involve two or three synthetic operations, and often feature low-yielding steps.  The chemistry involved also limits the substrates that can be converted to sulfonamides.  This proposal seeks to develop an alternative synthesis of sulfonamides; the proposed synthesis will be achieved in a single operation, employ readily available reagents and substrates, and be conducted under mild conditions.  The key to the proposed synthesis is to employ a three-component synthesis involving the catalytic combination of an aryl halide, an amine and sulfur dioxide.  Achieving the synthesis in a single operation will have significant advantages in terms of waste production, energy required, as well as the time needed to prepare the desired sulfonamides. These are important considerations for both small scale discovery synthesis, as well as the large scale synthesis of these materials. The developed methodology should also be applicable to the preparation of related sulfonate esters and sulfones.  The latter stages of the project will explore the application of the developed method to the synthesis or selected target structures that are difficult to access using conventional methods, and to the synthesis of heterocycles.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300343","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"2012-09-17","fundEnd":"2014-09-16","dataset":"fp7"}
