{"id":"92231","title":"\"Intellectual Capital, Work and Well-being\"","abstractText":"'The aim of this project is to identity how Intellectual Capital (IC) impacts upon work and well-being, and how IC may be promoted through workplace policies. Research will be undertaken in Bulgaria, Finland and Scotland; EU member states with varied economies, social and welfare polices. Data will be collected from national and EU organisations, and SMEs in the study countries in the growth sectors of ICTs, finance, care services and tourism. The research draws upon the disciplines of economics, sociology and industrial management. Since the Lisbon Strategy of 2000 , many political and legal measures have continued to reflect the EU objective of becoming �the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world� (Lisbon, 2000 and subsequent strategies). There has, only been limited research on the links and interactions between IC, work and well-being. IC includes forms of knowledge that are generated and exploited. Technological, social and economic developments have placed increased focus upon IC and today it is a basic component of knowledge businesses. Over 24 months the fellow will undertake: - a comparative scoping exercise to identify legislation, policies and practices at the EU and the member states in this project - a survey of 30 companies in each country will be undertaken to establish the policies and practices in place in SMEs in growth sectors to identify and support IC and workers - 10 interviews will be undertaken in each country to allow for exploration of survey data. Interviewees will be drawn from workers to managers and national IC organisations - develop models and practices for supporting IC -on-going dissemination which will include diverse media and audiences. The project will make a contribution on how to support the development and exploitation among SMEs and the workforce. The project will have a positive impact on fellow�s academic growth and professional maturity.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"236334","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2010-01-11","fundEnd":"2012-01-10","dataset":"fp7"}
