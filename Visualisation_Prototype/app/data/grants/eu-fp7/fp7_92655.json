{"id":"92655","title":"A Micro-generation System Using PV/heat-pipe Roof Modules","abstractText":"'The proposed project aims to investigate a novel PV/hp (photovoltaic/heat-pipe) roof module able to work with a heat pump cycle to provide electricity and heat for buildings with enhanced efficiency. The system comprises prefabricated PV/hp roof modules that are inter-connnected and fitted into the roof truss to act as the roof finish, an electricity generator and the solar collector/evaporator for the heat pump. The system also incorporates a compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve and a heat storage device. Integration of PV and heat pipes in a prefabricated roof module will provide high efficiency in terms of solar energy conversion and roof space requirement, and in so doing, offer the potential to create a low cost solution for electricity and heat production. The PV/hp modules would be architecturally pleasing and easy to install. Specific objectives of the programme are: 1. Develop a computer model to optimise the configuration of the PV/hp roof module and the module based heat pump/micro-generation system. 2. Construct and test the optimised PV/hp modules and the module based heat pump/micro-generation system, and validate the modelling results using the test data. 3. Develop an intelligent heat utilization strategy for the system and carry out economic and environmental analyses.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"234843","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2009-11-06","fundEnd":"2011-11-05","dataset":"fp7"}
