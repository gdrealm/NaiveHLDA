{"id":"110499","title":"COaching and Mentoring of sMEs for Research CommercIALISation and Exploitation","abstractText":"'The Commercialise project will be to provide knowledge to the European Commission, enabling them to implement an efficient and effective coaching and mentoring scheme to increase the commercialisation of R&D results from the dedicated SME instruments in Horizon 2020. Despite high demand, existing programmes to support SMEs have not delivered the impact on Europe expected. As stated in the 2013 Research for SME Work Programme, �Too many good ideas and research results are not commercially exploited because companies lack the skills, competencies and capabilities to develop and to implement strategic business plans ensuring deployment and commercialisation of innovation.� Growth coaching has been shown across Europe to effectively eliminate the barriers to growing through innovation, and many lessons can be learned and applied to the EC's dedicated SME instrument. Commercialise will take a structured approach to assessing existing coaching and mentoring programmes of relevance, using this knowledge to design best-in-class support, and piloting the support in challenging environments across Europe to ensure the model is robust and ready to be applied. As shown in this proposal, we believe a well-designed coaching and mentoring programme could increase the European GVA generated by the dedicated SME instrument by up to �1.7 billion.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"604739","fundValue":"763164.48","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
