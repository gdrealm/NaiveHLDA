{"id":"186819","title":"Practical Organic Synthesis Inspired by Nature","abstractText":"'The aim of this research is to use nature as a source of inspiration and direction to improve and develop synthetic organic\nchemistry. Through targeted total syntheses I will investigate and learn about the highly sophisticated way nature utilizes\ndimerizations to rapidly generate molecular complexity. I will demonstrate the power of this biomimetic strategy by\nsynthesizing a wide variety of complex dimeric natural products including phenylethanoids, alkaloids, lignans, and\ncoumarins. The expected outcome will be uniquely efficient synthetic strategies that significantly surpass all previous\napproaches and new synthetic methodology that will be of broad use in organic synthesis. More generally I will learn how\nnature uses relatively simple processes to rapidly generate molecular complexity in a highly selective manner.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"631132","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
