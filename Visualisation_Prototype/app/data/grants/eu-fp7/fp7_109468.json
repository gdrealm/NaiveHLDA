{"id":"109468","title":"Mapping Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases Research Activities and their Impact","abstractText":"'MAPPING_NCD moves beyond the state of the art in the research area via three distinct means: by providing accurate mapping of research funding activities at Member State (MS) and European Union (EU) level; by providing bibliometric mapping and analysis of the volume of research outputs in the EU and MSs relevant to chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and, by using input from both the above to provide an analysis of potential overlaps, synergies, gaps, opportunities and overall impact of NCD research funding to help identify a research agenda for the future.  As a package, MAPPING_NCD comprises qualitative surveys of the five broad disease areas (diabetes and its complications; cardiovascular disease; cancer; mental health illnesses; and chronic respiratory diseases) and bibliometric analysis. It identifies current EU-funded, as well as national, regional and charitable research programs and initiatives in the field of NCDs, describing funding sources and overall investments and output.  Using publications of research findings as a proxy indicator for research impact, it produces a high-resolution bibliometric analysis of the impact of NCD research by geographical distribution and characteristics, including: classification of NCD, individual disease and approaches to tackling the disease.  Thus, MAPPING_NCD contributes to the capacity of the EU to develop evidence-based policies towards coordinated approaches to NCD research and initiatives. It also contributes to a cooperative approach to NCD research by providing the EU with crucial information about whether research funding is appropriately spent, by ensuring that future research activities are more efficient, and potentially, by freeing currently under-utilized resources to fund additional activities on under-researched areas both at MS and EU level.'","grantUrl":"http://www.ncd-map.eu/","grantId":"602536","fundValue":"2238887.44","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
