{"id":"90523","title":"Cooperative Mobile Network Optimization","abstractText":"'This proposal targets some crucial challenges of LTE, the next generation mobile communication system beyond 3G. From the strict technological point of view, the proposal promises to develop novel methods for the problems of optimal radio resource allocation and intra/inter-system handover. To achieve this goal the idea is to introduce cooperativity into the control mechanisms, i.e. the aim is to propose distributed algorithms involving various elements of the network (i.e. both the mobile nodes and the different components of the access network) into the decision making. Using this approach the users are directly involved into the control processes of the network, which raises important privacy and security issues. These questions will also be investigated. In order to evaluate the proposed solution, an efficient and accurate system level LTE simulator will be developed as an extension of the simulator that has been developed at the host - CWiND.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"237713","fundValue":"172618.8","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
