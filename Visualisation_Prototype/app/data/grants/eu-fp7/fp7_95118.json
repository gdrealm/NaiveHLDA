{"id":"95118","title":"Cultural Approach of Radical Islamism in the Context of European Pluralism: Radical versus Moderate Muslims","abstractText":"'The radical Islamism is often presented in the political debate through the prism of religion or geopolitics. Following March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks the European commission has, for the first time, assumed this phenomenon to be the expression of the problem of radicalisation. Moreover, this phenomenon is analysed in the global strategic debate without taking into account the anthropological knowledge of the radicalisation at the local and national levels. Our project consists in filling this gap by leading an empirical, innovative and independent study of the cultural process of Islamist radicalisation in Europe. The Islamist radicalization is presented in the numerous studies in social sciences as the revival or the continuity of the ancient Islamic tradition or of the classical Islamic religious. We intend to confront in the empirical way the cultural tradition and the Islamism. The radicalisation expresses itself by excluding the other, including the non radical Muslims. For us, this phenomenon arises the political question of alterity and ethnicity. Iterdisciplinary our research project arises in the field the question of the emergence, in the democratic political contexts, of the new political forms of dissidence in cases of Moderates and Radicals Muslims in Spain, France and United-Kingdom.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254833","fundValue":"230927.2","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
