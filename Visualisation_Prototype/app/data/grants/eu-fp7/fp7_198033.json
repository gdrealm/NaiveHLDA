{"id":"198033","title":"\"THE EUROPEAN ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY NETWORK FOR INNOVATIVE MARITIME TRAINING, EDUCATION AND R&D\"","abstractText":"'The Community�s maritime sector must sustain and improve its competitive advantage, with the groundwork for future international competitiveness resting with high quality and innovative education and training. Employees in the maritime transport sector need innovative educational opportunities that focus on their special working conditions. The KNow-ME project addresses this need by engendering a modern �image of shipping� which attracts young people to maritime careers at sea and ashore and instils an awareness of the industry as a driver of EU development and an attractive employer. This can only be achieved though critical dialogue with industry on potential future developments, current and future strengths and weaknesses, and the support required to ensure a forward thinking sustainable industry. The KNow-ME consortium argues that maritime training and education requires a life-cycle approach, where demand-oriented transnational e-courses and supporting material are developed in line with industry expectations and modern lifestyles. Enhanced education and training for the industry�s professions must cater for a multicultural working environment, gender neutrality and maximum accessibility independent from time and space.  A modern image, career management and e-training and education will be promoted by establishing an e-portal that integrates with other �e-maritime initiative� developments. Implementation of the proposed education and training strategies require the support of both industry and proactive national and regional policy and practices that enhance the transparency, transferability and compatibility of training and educations standards. The KNow-ME project will establish a network of excellence in Europe, integrating experience from leading maritime research institutions. The pilot applications of e-courses developed within KNow-ME will allow for CPD, with the outcomes expected to contribute to improved living and working conditions on board vessels.\n'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"265966","fundValue":"2047392","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
