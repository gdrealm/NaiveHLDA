{"id":"106511","title":"Vascular Endothelial interactionS and SpEciaLization","abstractText":"'The vascular network plays essential roles in animal biology. Local disruption or impaired function of the vascular network is known to cause various pathological conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and stroke. The angiogenic growth of blood vessels is critically required during development, growth and regeneration, but it can also promote the growth of cancer cells and contribute to diabetic retinopathy and other diseases.  Various blood vessels possess different biological characteristics in order to fulfil their tissue- and organ-specific roles. The VESSEL network brings together 12 academic and industrial partners with a common interest in morphogenesis of blood and lymphatic vessels and their role in tissue homeostasis. This training program covers major research areas from embryonic development of blood and lymphatic vessels, to the analysis of their structural integrity and function in various adult tissues in normal and pathological conditions, and aims to address critical demand to provide state-of the-art training for future specialists in vascular biology working in academia, industry and health care systems. By employing cutting edge innovative technologies, this project establishes strong bonds between academic and industrial partners and has a strong potential to generate new IP in this area. This project has a strong clinical relevance based on gaining insight into critical vascular biology processes and on developing novel cutting edge imaging and drug delivery technologies. Through cooperation of the different Centres, the VESSEL consortium will develop integrated, highly specialized, curricula for young scientists, which will open new career perspectives in academia and industry.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"317250","fundValue":"4086572.39","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
