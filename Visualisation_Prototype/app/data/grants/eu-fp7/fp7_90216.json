{"id":"90216","title":"�C-E-E-S�  (Citizen oriented Evaluation of E-Government Services: A Reference Process Model)","abstractText":"'The research program aims to develop a process model for the measurement of citizen satisfaction index for e-Government services. The aim is achieved by the knowledge exchange program between two academic partners (Brunel University and American University of Beirut.) and one private sector partner (Turk Satellite or TurkSat). The large bureaucratic public sector structures are often unable to embrace change and are grounded in years of tradition thus, there is not the environment for innovation or established tools to measure satisfaction and this sets benchmarks for performance improvement.  As a result, there are research initiatives to develop a citizen satisfaction model (CSM) for e-government services. However, existing researches are focusing on the specific CSM model and do not suggest a systematic process which can be used for the developed CSM model by e-government system managers. In addition, these CSM models have been developed separately in different countries based on their own requirements. Furthermore, the processes used to measure the CSMs in different countries are different from each other and this makes it difficult for the other e-Government stakeholders in different or even the same countries to benefit from their experience. The aims of the C-E-E-S project are to develop a reference process model and a scientific evaluation framework to measure citizen satisfaction on e-Government services. This will be a harmonized and standardized process model which could be used by other e-Government implementers worldwide. The idea is to develop a reference process model for measuring citizen satisfaction on e-Government services and to allow other e-Government stakeholders to use the reference process model and the benchmarking outcomes from the evaluation framework to project inefficient e-Government services for further improvement in their designs. Total 72 researcher-months will be exchanged among the partners to complement their knowledge.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"230658","fundValue":"374155","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
