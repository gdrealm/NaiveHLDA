{"id":"95358","title":"Managing Interactions between International Agreements: Dealing with Diversity in Global Climate Governance","abstractText":"'The proposal seeks to support the career development of an experienced researcher, by completing an interdisciplinary research project on dealing with interactions in global climate governance, and enabling the fellow to acquire new knowledge and academic skills at a renowned university. The scientific objectives of the research are to analyse how the diversity in global climate governance, and interactions between different international agreements have affected the normative development of these agreements; to assess legal techniques and political mechanisms for dealing with the diversity in global climate governance; and to provide policy and research recommendations, and disseminate the findings of the research project. Three cases are used to illustrate the interactions, and to assess the legal and political options to manage interactions. These cases allow for a comprehensive analysis of the various forms of fragmentation in global climate governance, while at the same time providing broader insights for other areas of international law and global governance studies. The host institution for the fellow is the Environmental Change Institute (ECI) at the University of Oxford. ECI hosts many experienced scholars relevant to the proposed research, and has an excellent reputation in interdisciplinary climate change research. The Institute also has an outstanding track record of training researchers. The research training objectives are to contribute to the fellow�s writing and publication skills, through significant progress in completing his doctoral thesis and the publication of peer-reviewed articles; to enhance the fellow�s knowledge on interactions in global environmental governance; to participate in postgraduate courses, lectures, seminars and other events held at the University of Oxford; and to collaborate and interact with scholars at ECI on research areas of mutual interest.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253090","fundValue":"124030.6","fundStart":"2010-06-07","fundEnd":"2011-12-06","dataset":"fp7"}
