{"id":"105625","title":"Technology for Wafer-scale Carbon Nanotube Applications","abstractText":"'Carbon nanotubes are materials with a set of unique electrical, mechanical, surface and thermal properties. Yet their adoption in mainstream applications has been limited by mass production and device integration. This project develops the first 300mm wafer-scale equipment for production of carbon nanotubes on surfaces. The project will cover the design, engineering, process control, quality assurance, qualification and process development. It will develop applications in cathodes for time resolved X-ray sources for X-ray tomography, cathodes for high power microwave amplifiers, interconnects for VLSI, thermal management surfaces, low stiction surfaces for micro-fluidic channels and filters, wafer scale fabrication of spin valve devices, and sensor surfaces for integrated sensors on CMOS.'","grantUrl":"http://www.technotubes.eu","grantId":"228579","fundValue":"8350500.54","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
