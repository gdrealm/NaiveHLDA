{"id":"105304","title":"Lean Burn Control System Verification Rig","abstractText":"'The objective of this project is to provide a novel, fully operational and commissioned test facility for the system verification of the new, highly complex lean burn engine control system necessary for more fuel efficient medium and large aero-engine system applications. This validation facility does not exist today and capability will include interaction with the donor-engine fuel system with no adverse effect, system performance across the operational envelope, fault insertion, fuel spike measurement, high speed data logging and confirmation of adequate sensing and acquisition. The approach will be to connect the real fuel system components to a drive head using a test skid enabling donor engine and lean burn fuel control system components to be secured in engine and fuel pipe representative positions. The project is split into nine work packages and the overall aim is to design, build and commission a lean burn system test facility utilising the expertise of Aero Engine Controls and SCITEK, an SME, both of whom have pedigree in the development and validation of aero engine control fuel systems. Following successful completion of this project the Partners anticipates upgrading test facilities to the new configuration for future validation of lean burn systems both for development platforms and original equipment manufacture, resulting in increased and sustained employment and supporting the production of potentially 3000 lean burn fuel systems per year.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"296671","fundValue":"963912.6","fundStart":"2012-01-03","fundEnd":"2014-01-02","dataset":"fp7"}
