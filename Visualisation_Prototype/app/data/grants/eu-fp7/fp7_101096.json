{"id":"101096","title":"Hydrogen Transport in European Cities","abstractText":"'This proposal focuses on creating two new European hydrogen passenger vehicle deployment centres in London and Copenhagen � cities that are widely recognised as synonymous with the goal of developing and then adopting ultra-low carbon urban transport solutions.\nThe HyTEC project will also create genuine links between the new and existing hydrogen passenger vehicle demonstration projects across Europe, with a view to informing ongoing strategic planning for hydrogen rollout and also ensuring a �common voice� towards the expansion of the hydrogen vehicle fleet in Europe towards commercialisation. To do so, a fleet of passenger cars will be deployed in Oslo, one of the early demonstration centres, continuing the rollout of the hydrogen vehicles at this site.\n\nThe goal of the project is to implement stakeholder inclusive vehicle demonstration programmes that specifically address the challenge of transitioning hydrogen vehicles from running exemplars to fully certified vehicles utilised by end-users and moving along the pathway to providing competitive future products.\nA European consortium of 17 members from 5 member states has been assembled to deliver the project, which will:\n�\tDemonstrate 25 new hydrogen vehicles in the hands of real customers, in two vehicles classes: taxis (5), passenger cars (19). In addition fuel cell hybrid hydrogen scooters will be demonstrated as a proof of concept in London and at Ride and Drive type events. The passenger cars will be supplied by leading global OEMs.\nThese will be supported by new hydrogen refuelling facilities, which together with existing deployments in each city will lead to two new city based networks for hydrogen fuelling. These networks work on different concepts, one based on on-site production (Copenhagen) and the second on hydrogen delivery (London), allowing different pathways to be tested and compared.\n�\tAnalyse the results of the project, with an expert pan-European research team. The analysis will consider the full well to wheels life cycle impact of the vehicles and associated fuelling networks, demonstrate the technical performance of the vehicles and uncover the non-technical barriers to wider implementation.\n�\tPlan for future commercialisation of the vehicles, as well as providing an approach for the rollout of vehicles and infrastructure, which builds on the demonstration projects.\n�\tDisseminate the results of the project widely to the public to improve hydrogen awareness. This will be supported by targeted dissemination to, other regions, key industrial stakeholders and policy makers.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"278727","fundValue":"29256315.91","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
