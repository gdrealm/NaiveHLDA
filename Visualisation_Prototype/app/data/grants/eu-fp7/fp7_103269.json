{"id":"103269","title":"Glassy Quantum Dynamics in Strongly Interacting Ultracold Atomic Gases","abstractText":"'This project brings together two international researchers, Dr. Cenap Ates from Germany and a dedicated, enthusiastic Scientist-in-Charge Dr. Igor Lesanovsky at the University of Nottingham, UK, to carry out internationally competitive research. The project will work on understanding, probing and exploiting equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena in structured gases of highly excited atoms, with particular focus on quantum glasses. This research will benefit Dr. Cenap Ates career development by becoming an expert of atomic and condensed matter physics and raising his profile in an international level. The host institution and the scientist in charge will benefit from this project and Cenap Ates presence by enriching the research areas and international collaborations. The European Research Area will benefit\nfrom the project because the results will provide insights into the understanding of quantum matter out of equilibrium. In the long term this will promote practical applications such as the development of new materials with exotic properties and thus enhance the competitive edge. The research will emphasize the leadership of Europe in this field and create an ever widening gap between European Research Area and other regions.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"299843","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2013-04-02","fundEnd":"2015-04-01","dataset":"fp7"}
