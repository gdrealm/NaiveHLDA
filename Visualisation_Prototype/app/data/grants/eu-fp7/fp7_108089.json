{"id":"108089","title":"The reconstruction of hunting techniques as an instrument to understand the diffusion of populations and ideas in European Palaeolithic","abstractText":"'This project aims to reconstruct changes in hunting strategies during the European Upper Palaeolithic through the analysis of stone tools and bone points in order to understand the mode and timing of the spread of new techniques and ideas and whether they relate to physical movement of people or assimilation of ideas.\nA new multidisciplinary and methodological approach involving the techno-functional analysis of projectile points, residue analysis and a thorough ethnographic study, will be used to compare data from different archaeological contexts. The main phase of the project will involve the comparative analysis of hunting equipment from the principal Moravian Gravettian sites (Doln� Vestonice and Pavlov, Czech Republic) with that from the Italian site of Grotta Paglicci to determine whether tools share morphological and functional characteristics and how they are linked to hunting in different natural environments.\nThe project will link to the interdisciplinary 'Moravian Gate'  project currently hosted by the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge. This aims to understand human adaptation to climate change and natural resources during the Gravettian (30,000 � 20,000 BP) in a crucial, densely populated area of Central Europe, Moravia. The Paleohunt project will take this a step further and extend it to the Epigravettian and the mediterranean zone.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"328502","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
