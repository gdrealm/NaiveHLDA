{"id":"102229","title":"Targeted delivery for liver cancer treatment","abstractText":"'The Liver cancer drugs market is expected to become an active ground for competition in the future. According to recent market analysis, the liver cancer market in 2009 was valued at approximately US$0.4bn, indicating a growth rate of 27.1% between 2001 and 2009.  It is estimated that the liver cancer market in 2017 will be $1.2bn, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.5% between 2009 and 2017. The growth of the liver cancer market is driven by the growth of the aging population, the greater access to medical care in the emerging new economic regions like China, and the innovative therapies such as targeted therapy\n\nIn this project target delivery for liver cancer treatment using biomarker functionalized vehicles is planned. Due to the lack of the needed expertise in one centre or region a consortium is formed. The consortium focuses on the development of nano-vehicle materials for targeted delivery and the relevant practices towards in vitro level of understanding of the effect of the delivery systems on cancer cell treatment. In this consortium, four work packages (WPs) are formed, namely, WP-1: Pharmaceutical materials; WP-2: Formulations; WP-3: Cancer cell imaging; and WP-4: Cancer cell treatment. To support this consortium, biomarkers will be selected from the available products in terms of the functionality of the biomarkers. The consortium comprises 4 partners (2 from EU, 1 from China, and 1 from USA), who are centers of excellence in their unique areas of expertise: Sichuan for preparation of functional polymersomes, Navarra for drug formulations, FIU for cancer cell imaging, and UoW for cancer cell treatment. Most importantly is the development of novel liver cancer therapy, fostering strategic collaborations between EU and China and knowledge transfer and dissemination through staff mobility.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"295218","fundValue":"105001","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
