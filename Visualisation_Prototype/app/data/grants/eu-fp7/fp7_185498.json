{"id":"185498","title":"Economic impacts of Cybercrime","abstractText":"'Some progress has been made in understanding and managing cyber crime as well assessing its economic impact. Yet much remains to be done. Lack of co-ordination in law enforcement and legislation, lack of common consensus on the nature of cyber crime and lack of knowledge sharing and trust are just some of the issues that both afflict cyber crime responses and cloud our understanding of cyber crime. E-CRIME addresses these well-known problems, while analysing the economic impact of cyber crime and developing concrete measures to manage risks and deter cyber criminals in non-ICT sectors. E-CRIME does so by adopting an interdisciplinary and multi-level-stakeholder focused approach that fully integrates a wide range of stakeholdersï¿½ knowledge and insights into the project. First, the project will create a detailed taxonomy and inventory of cyber crime in non-ICT sectors and analyse cyber criminal structures and economies by combining the best existing data sources with specialist new insights from key stakeholders and experts. Second, E-CRIME will assess existing counter-measures against cyber crime in non-ICT sectors in the form of current technology, best practices, policy and enforcement approaches, and awareness and trust initiatives. Third, having mapped the as-is of cyber crime, the project will use available information and new data to develop a multi-level model to measure the economic impact of cyber crime on non ICT-sectors. Fourth, E-CRIME will integrate all its previous findings to identify and develop diverse, concrete counter-measures, combined in portfolios of inter-sector and intra-sector solutions, including enhancement for crime-proofed applications, risk management tools, policy and best practices, and trust and confidence measures. The analysis will proceed in close co-operation with relevant and diverse stakeholders. This will be achieved through conducting interviews and survey, organising workshops and setting up an E-CRIME Stakeholder Forum.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"607775","fundValue":"3749288.94","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
