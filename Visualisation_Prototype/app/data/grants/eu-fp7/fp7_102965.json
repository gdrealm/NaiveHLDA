{"id":"102965","title":"\"Research Networks for Educational Reform\n A �School-University Research Network� Perspective on Linking Teacher Education, Knowledge and School Development\"","abstractText":"'School-university research networks aim for closer integration of research-based knowledge and practice by means of teacher research, which can provide sustainable educational development in both schools and universities. Recently, scholars have suggested that master�s programs for in-service teachers may be a promising avenue in developing such research networks for educational reform. This worldwide innovative approach can reveal promising directions for linking teacher education, knowledge and school development, which may ultimately contribute to improving education and enhancing student achievement. As such, it contributes to the European Union goal of improving higher education and education in general (Europe 2020 � Flagship initiative Youth on the Move).\nGiven the recent proliferation of a �school-university research network� perspective on in-service teacher education there remains limited empirical work about this type of research networks. This study aims to address this pressing research gap and the need for finding new ways of improving educational systems. Two innovative and promising contexts in the U.S. and U.K will be explored. Theory and methods from the interdisciplinary field of social networks and the fields of teacher learning and education studies will be combined.  An original combination of quantitative and qualitative methods will be used as well as longitudinal network modeling to examine networks and processes over time. The project aims to provide the fellow with training and career development support at two world class universities to become a mature and excellent scholar in the European Research Area (ERA). The outgoing (University of California,U.S.) and return host (University of Cambridge,U.K.) have robust infrastructures to manage/implement the project and mentors are renowned scholars in the field of educational networks. Outreach activities and an international advisory board will secure application of experiences/results in ERA'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"298865","fundValue":"283568.1","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
