{"id":"108107","title":"Well-defined Conjugated Block Copolymer Nanofibers and  their Applications in Photovoltaic Devices","abstractText":"'This proposal for a Marie Curie Fellowship focuses on the preparation of well-defined nanofibers from conjugated polymers and their use in photovoltaic devices.  This project will be highly interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, involving polymer synthesis, polymer self-assembly in the solution state, polymer crystallography, polymer physics, the physics of semiconducting materials, the fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic devices, and nanoscience.  Therefore, this research is expected to have a substantial multidisciplinary impact ranging from polymer chemistry to polymer physics, to materials science, and to expand our knowledge of photovoltaic devices.  To achieve the project goals it will be vital to combine the expertise of the applicant, Xiaoyu Li, on nanofibers and polymer-based device fabrication, with that of the host, Prof. Ian Manners, on polymer synthesis and crystallization-driven self-assembly of block copolymers in solution. Mr. Li is completing his Ph.D. in Canada and after working with Prof. Manners in the UK he aims to find a faculty position in China, his country of origin.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329195","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2013-04-08","fundEnd":"2015-04-07","dataset":"fp7"}
