{"id":"85449","title":"Trilogy: Re-Architecting the Internet. nAn Hourglass Control Architecture for the Internet, Supporting Extremes of Commercial, Social and Technical Control","abstractText":"This Trilogy proposal is for a 3-year Integrated Project targeting Challenge 1 of the 7th Framework Programme: 'Pervasive and Trusted Network and Service Infrastructures'. The project scope lies entirely within Objective 1.1, 'The Network of the Future'.nThe aim of the project is to develop new solutions for the control architecture of the Internet that remove the known and emerging technical deficiencies while avoiding prejudging commercial and social outcomes for the different players. The focus is the generic control functions of the Internet ï¿½ the neck of the hour-glass, but for control:n* Reachability: The main focus is the problem of inter-domain routing, including policy control but also integrating filtering at trust boundaries (e.g. firewalls,  NATs). Key issues include multihoming, scalability and fast convergence.n* Resource control: The main focus is how to deliver effective and efficient control of sharing of resource. Key issues include how to share resources fairly and stop cheating, high speed congestion control and load balancing (traffic engineering).nBut further, all this must be under:n* Social and Commercial Control: the architecture will permit conflicting outcomes to coexist and evolve and will not embed assumptions that unreasonably favour certain types of industry player: 'designed for tussle'.nOur objective is bold: to re-architect the world's ICT infrastructure. In order to be credible, we will have to deliver a coherent set of changes solving technical and commercial problems together: a unified control architecture for the Internet that can be adapted in a scalable, dynamic, autonomous and robust manner to local operational and business requirements.nOverall the project delivers:n* new technical and economic concepts, architecture and protocols;n* simulation, prototyping, strategic analysis and dissemination work, especially standardisation at the IETF.nThe focus moves from the first to the second over the project's lifetime.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"216372","fundValue":"9115722","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
