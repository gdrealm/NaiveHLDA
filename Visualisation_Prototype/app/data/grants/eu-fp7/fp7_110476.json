{"id":"110476","title":"Buffet Control of Transonic Wings","abstractText":"'The aim of this work programme is to develop a capability to understand and predict transonic buffet on wings fitted with buffet control devices.\n\nWind tunnel tests will be performed on a half model with buffet control devices fitted to measure dynamic flow characteristics during buffet onset.\n\nUnsteady RANS and DES CFD calculations will be carried out, validated against the wind tunnel data.  The CFD calculations will then be used to develop an improved understanding of transonic wing buffet.\n\nAn industrialised computational method will be developed to enable buffet prediction to be carried out during wing design with buffet control devices fitted'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"336948","fundValue":"1269375.04","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
