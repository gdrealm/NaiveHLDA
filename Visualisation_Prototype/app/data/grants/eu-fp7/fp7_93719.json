To achieve this goal 3DLife will integrate complementary expertise, enable resource optimization and sharing, and foster research in Media Internet technology.n3DLife addresses wide, Pan-European integration through dedicated activities aiming at sharing laboratory facilities, technological developments and resources, including people. To ensure this wide cooperation and to guarantee that the targeted integrative research profits from, feeds back into, and fosters links with research groups of the 12 new EU member states, a Pan-European Integration Board will be part of the project. The technical and integration goals will be influenced by two other external and independent Boards of Industrial and Scientific Advisors.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247688","fundValue":"4087097","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
