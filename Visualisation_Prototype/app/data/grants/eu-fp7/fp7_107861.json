{"id":"107861","title":"Luminescence Amplification by Metal organic framework-Polyoxometalate composites","abstractText":"'The goal of this proposal is a fundamental study leading to development of robust display materials with tunable properties. For this, two different classes of materials with promising potential will be combined: Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) will serve as highly porous hosts for polyoxometalates (POMs).\nMOFs are porous networks between metal ions and organic linkers, with considerable flexibility in composition, structure and properties. A similar flexibility is shown by POMs, oxidic clusters of transition metals, which can be doped with photoactive elements. Immobilization of luminescent POMs in the pores of MOFs will not only lead to new materials which easily can be structured but especially will solve the problem of leaching of the active POM from the luminescent material. POMs can serve as templates around which the MOF is formed. The new luminescent materials will be synthesized by inclusion of differently functionalised POMs into frameworks of different compositions to tune the final functionality. Furthermore, the option to functionalise the obtained materials further in post synthesis steps will be explored. The project addresses fundamental questions regarding the synergy between the two components of the composite material.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"329341","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2013-05-02","fundEnd":"2015-05-01","dataset":"fp7"}
