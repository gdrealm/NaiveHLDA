It will analyse the range of ways in which autobiographical forms and discursive practices are being transformed at the frontier of technological change; then consider the implications of the new forms and practices for such notions as autobiography, selfhood, subjectivity, individuality, self-intelligibility, agency, creativity, privacy, and sociability. Based in the interdisciplinary Centre for Life-Writing Research in the School of Arts and Humanities at Kingï¿½s College London, it will combine a humanistic, life-writing theory approach with an interdisciplinary methodology, in collaboration with researchers from Sociolinguistics, Culture Media and Creative Industries, Digital Humanities, Medical Humanities, Psychiatry, War Studies, and Education.\n\nKeywords:\nLife-writing, Self-Presentation, Autobiography, Subjectivity, Agency, New Media, Social Media, Immediacy, Discourse, Digital Narratives, Internet, Web 2.0'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"340331","fundValue":"2206994","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2019-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
