{"id":"98501","title":"\"Polygermane Block Copolymers: Synthesis, Self-Assembly, and Applications in Nanotechnology\"","abstractText":"'Polygermanes, polymers with a -GeR2- repeat unit, are a potentially useful class of inorganic polymers with exciting chemical, physical, and electronic properties.  Although recognized for having much promise, the study of polygermanes has been severely hindered by inadequate synthetic routes.\n\nIn this proposal we target the creation of novel organogermanes as precursors for use in living anionic polymerizations.   The realization of living polygermanes will allow for their incorporation into block copolymers such that self-assembled germanium containing nanostructures can ultimately be achieved.    Potential nanotechnological applications are envisioned in nanolithography, photonics, and nanoelectronics.\n\nThe applicant�s experience in synthetic germanium chemistry, combined with the host�s expertise in polymer and materials science, will be key to the proposal�s success.  The project is both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary and includes aspects of organometallic chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials science, and nanotechnology.  The project will utilize the host�s existing international collaborations and will also establish new partnerships.   The proposal will significantly enhance Europe�s position in the fields of nanotechnology and materials science, an important goal of the FP7.  At the end of the fellowship the applicant aims to return to his home country to take up an academic position at a top university.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"274135","fundValue":"210092.8","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
