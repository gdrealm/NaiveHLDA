{"id":"98328","title":"African Vector Control:  New Tools","abstractText":"'The AvecNet consortium will develop practical solutions to the current limitations of vector control strategies in Africa using a combination of translationally-aware, state of the art science and end user analysis to ensure successful development and uptake of the new and improved approaches to malaria control and elimination.  Our carefully balanced, multidisciplinary team of European and African experts includes vector biologists, engineers, epidemiologists, social scientists and leaders of large supranational consortia.  These partners are all prominent members of global vector control research programs having unique specialization in Africa-centric projects.\nTogether we have developed a proposal focused specifically to address the three major research challenges that confront efforts to interrupt mosquito-mediated transmission of malaria in Africa:\n1. The need for practical strategies to prolong the efficacy of existing insecticide-based vector control methods,\n2.The need to develop new interventions that target all major malaria vectors, that are simultaneously effective, socially acceptable and sustainable,\n3. The impact of the major demographic and environmental changes occurring in Africa on malaria epidemiology and control.\nThese research activities are cross-linked by specific tasks to reinforce our commitment to ensure sustainability, engage all stakeholders and strengthen research capacity in Africa.\nOverall, the project will add significant value to the international research effort in vector control by taking forward the state of the art and translating this into new or improved control tools that will be trialled within the time frame of this project. The studies planned in this collaborative project will provide scalable solutions, giving the solid platform upon which ongoing and future vector control programmes can be built.'","grantUrl":"http://www.avecnet.eu/","grantId":"265660","fundValue":"15401867.89","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
