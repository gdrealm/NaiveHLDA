{"id":"107197","title":"Software management of non-volatile memory hierarchies","abstractText":"'This project will investigate techniques for software management of hybrid memory hierarchies composed of conventional DRAM memory technology and upcoming non-volatile memory (NVRAM) technology. The scientific objective is to gain understanding of the memory behavior of programs and to construct co-designed hardware/software policies for NVRAM management based on this understanding. The technological objective is to enable a step-change reduction in the memory systemï¿½s energy consumption. Energy and cost efficiency are becoming as important as processing power in computing systems. Major reductions of energy consumption will enable high-performance computing facilities to reach exascale performance, which will in turn enable scientific advances in computational physics, biology and other computational sciences.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327744","fundValue":"309235.2","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
