{"id":"109236","title":"Novel multizone thermodynamic model and specialised software for rapid optimisation of  working process strategies and design parameters of Internal Combustion Engines run on advanced biofuels","abstractText":"'International Energy Agency  envisages that advanced biofuels will contribute significantly to reducing emissions by increasing from 2-3% of total transport energy supply today to 27% by 2050. Transportation experts propose that  R & D of next-generation biofuels must be carried out in conjunction with the development of advanced combustion engines.\nAt present very intensive R & D works are being conducted by all major internal combustion (IC) engine manufacturers on the development of engine designs  capable to work on blends with up to 100% of biofuel. Similar works are being conducted on retrofitting  the  old park of motors. The main challenge in such activities is to satisfy EU regulations on emission levels. To successfully achieve this goal  it is necessary to carry out a combination of fundamental theoretical and experimental research. One of barriers  in conducting theoretical part of investigations is absence of  specialised software  dedicated to accurate  modelling the operation of IC engines on different biofuel blends and which would allow developers to optimise  the working process strategy  and design parameters of engines.\nThe main objective of the �Bio-Green-IC-Engine� project is the creation of the extensive database on properties of  biofuels, development of the advanced multizone thermodynamic model for the simulation of  IC engines operating on various advanced biofuels and incorporating it into user-friendly software for rapid optimization of high performance clean engine design parameters. The accuracy of the deployed model will be enhanced by using data from three-dimensional CFD modelling of the fuel spray evolution and detailed chemistry  analysis of  biofuels combustion.\nThe developed software will be  used for industrial, research and educational purposes across EU countries and will improve the technological and industrial practice related to manufacturing IC engines and their fuel supply systems to operate on advanced biofuels.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"328361","fundValue":"299558.4","fundStart":"2013-12-02","fundEnd":"2015-12-01","dataset":"fp7"}
