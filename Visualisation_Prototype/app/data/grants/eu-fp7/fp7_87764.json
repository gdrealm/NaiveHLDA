{"id":"87764","title":"Implementation of Membrane Technology to Industry","abstractText":"'The IMeTI proposal aims to create a programme of applied research for implementation of membrane technology into industry based on experience and knowledge transfer between Academia and Industry. New membranes with improved chemical stability in a wide range of solvents, and better controlled cutoff properties and commercially viable membranes with high selectivity and flux for gas separations will be developed. The overall scientific and technical aim of the IMeTI project is to make important paradigm shifts in organic solvent nanofiltration and high temperature gas separation/purification, using cutting edge technologies based on membranes. The project involves the integration of the invention of new membranes and applications in the University/ Research Institute Partners with the subsequent development of the necessary membrane technology up to processing scale by the SMEs. A key feature of this project will be the interdisciplinary nature of the Partners, and the fact that they bring inter-sectorial competence to the network. We aim to create widely applicable, scalable, high performance process techniques and technologies.  The knowledge transfer and training programme involves Early Stage Researchers (ESR), at both university and industrial partners, each of whom gain high quality experience through combination of local and network wide research experience. Experienced Researchers (ER) will provide in depth knowledge, and will assist in mentoring the ESR. Visiting scientists will provide expertise from outside the network. In addition to their individual research, ESR and ER will increase their research capacity and knowledge through attendance of high level research conferences and workshops. IMeTI seeks to contribute to improving the European knowledge supply chain through this industry-academia programme of applied research aimed at developing engineers and scientists who are academically excellent and industrially experienced.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"218068","fundValue":"1806477","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
