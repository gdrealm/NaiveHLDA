{"id":"103054","title":"Neural substrates of depth perception:\nfrom surfaces to complex 3D forms","abstractText":"'The ability to retrieve information about three-dimensional (3D) structure in the environment is critical for the recognition of objects and for the execution of actions (e.g., grasping and manipulating objects).  One of the strongest cues to depth and shape is binocular disparity, which results from slightly different images of an object seen by the two separated eyes on the head.  To date, research that has been dedicated to understanding the processing of binocular disparity cues has mainly used simple surfaces and comparatively little is known about how these cues are used to retrieve more complex 3D shapes.  The proposed project will investigate whether the same neural networks implicated in previous studies using simple surfaces underlie the perception of more complex and biologically relevant 3D structures.  The experiments in the project will integrate state-of-the-art fMRI and brain stimulation (rTMS) methods with concurrent behavioural measures of perception in order to link neural activity to perceptual states.  Findings from this project will not only provide novel insights as to the neural concomitants of depth and 3D shape perception from disparity in humans, but will also have implications extending to clinical settings, artificial systems, and entertainment technologies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"299610","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-03-15","fundEnd":"2014-03-14","dataset":"fp7"}
