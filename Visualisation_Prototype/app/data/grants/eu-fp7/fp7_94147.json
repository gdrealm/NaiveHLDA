{"id":"94147","title":"Roadmap Enabling Vision and Strategy for ICT-enabled Energy Efficiency","abstractText":"REViSITE will contribute to the formation of a European multidisciplinary 'ICT for energy-efficiency' research community by bringing together the ICT community and 4 important and complementary application sectors: grids, building/construction, manufacturing and lighting.nThe objectives of REViSITE are to: (1) Establish communication between sectoral ICT4EE communities in the 4 key industrial domains; (2) Develop causal model on the impacts of ICT on energy efficiency and apply this methodology for identifying high-impact RTD priorities; (3) Develop a cross-sectoral RTD roadmap by identifying and harmonising common topics; (4) Promote interoperability and standards; (5) Awareness raising.nThe main activities of the workplan are: (1) Community consolidation; (2) Identification of RTD priorities based on impact assessment; (3) Multi-disciplinary RTD roadmap for ICT-enabled energy efficiency; (4) Dissemination and awareness-raising.nThe consortium consists of 7 patners from 7 countries with wide geographic coverage of EU. Participants are active players in the 4 domains and the related European Technology Platforms, notably: Artemis, ECTP, ManuFuture, Photonics21 and SmartGrids.nThrough dissemination and awareness-raising activities, REViSITE aims at creating the following impacts: (1) Multidiciplinary European ICT4EE community;(2) Rational selection of priorities for RTD on ICT4EE;(3) European ICT4EE research agenda;(4) Convergence of ICT standards across sectors;(5) ICT4EE as a cross-discipline path in education and training.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"248705","fundValue":"1815870","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
