{"id":"100936","title":"The Fragments of the Republican Roman Orators","abstractText":"'This project gathers together, edits and interprets the surviving evidence for the orators of the Roman Republican period whose speeches do not survive in complete form. Its scope includes material which is, or is preserved as if it is, the actual words spoken by Republican orators as well as material about occasions when men spoke, who their audiences were, and the kinds of arguments they used in order to persuade. Cicero is the only Republican orator whose speeches are transmitted in their entirety; the work of his predecessors and rivals is scattered across the surviving texts of antiquity. By making the fragments and testimonia of all Republican orators accessible to the scientific field, this project will transform our understanding of Roman public life, political ideology, and culture. The Project Team, based at the University of Glasgow and supported by an international Advisory Board, will i) prepare the edition of the fragments and testimonia ii) disseminate the findings of the project through a series of colloquia and a major international conference in 2015 iii) engage the scientific community with the project through invited colloquia and conference presentations and organised panels at other relevant conferences and scientific gatherings.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"283670","fundValue":"1161451","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
