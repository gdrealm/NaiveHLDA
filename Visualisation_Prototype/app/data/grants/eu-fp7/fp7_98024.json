{"id":"98024","title":"Development of High Temperature Survival Electronic Devices for Engine Control Systems","abstractText":"'This proposal is concerned with the development of distributed high temperature electronics platform for integration with sensor elements to provide a high integrity serial digital data link that can be fed into FADEC (Full Authority Digital Electronic Control) and/or EHMS (Engine Health Monitoring System) units on an aircraft engine. To date most of the work undertaken and reported has been in the United States, which has concentrated on the development of high temperature electronic control systems, with high levels of functionality and more complex components, such as the Honeywell HTMOS products. This proposal aims to design and develop a lower cost distributed electronics platform with fir for purpose functionality that can be deployed close to the sensors and integrated into a miniature multi-chip module. The unit will be designed to provide signal conditioning for a range of sensor outputs and managing the signal to enable high integrity digital signal tranmission to the FADEC/EHMS units. The target long temperature of operation is 250oC for up to 5 years.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255749","fundValue":"1436925","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
