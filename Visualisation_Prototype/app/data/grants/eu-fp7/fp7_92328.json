{"id":"92328","title":"Trophodynamics of Organic Pollutants Studied by Compound-Specific Isotope Analysis","abstractText":"'Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and emerging pollutants are of global concern, yet their potential to become biomagnified in the aquatic food webs has not been determined. �TOP� aims to tackle this question by coupling the analyses of pollutants, lipid content, trophic position, and compound-specific stable isotope analyses (CSIA). The objectives are to develop and validate CSIA methods; to refine and apply sampling, extraction and analytical methods to target pollutants in water, sediment and biological samples; to perform field sampling in the UK and China followed by chemical and isotopic analyses; and to predict the transport and fate of the target compounds in the aquatic systems using a multi-compartment (water-plankton-invertebrates-fish) model. Both the host institute and fellow have a proven track record in pollutant fate studies and isotope analysis. TOP therefore supports the collaboration and development of dynamic world-class human resources in the European research system. This proposal consists of a scientific project and scientific and complimentary training. The fellow will receive scientific training to acquire further skills in environmental investigations and data analyses; to design, conduct and report on cutting edge research on emerging pollutants; and to develop novel CSIA approaches. Complementary training will involve the fellow learning and practising transferable skills, e.g. presentation, project management and grant applications, as part of his career development plan. The objectives will be achieved through careful planning and management of the fellowship. The proposed scientific project is timely and appropriate methodology has been established. Novel and state-of-the-art techniques will be used. The supervisors and the fellow have relevant expertises. Regular meetings will be held to ensure progress. The fellow is expected to become an international researcher by the end of the fellowship.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"235291","fundValue":"","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
