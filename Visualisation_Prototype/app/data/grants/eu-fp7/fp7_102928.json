{"id":"102928","title":"Health consequences of the alcohol hangover","abstractText":"'Need for the research\nLittle is known about next day, so called alcohol hangover effects. However, assembling and disseminating evidence on alcohol hangover effects falls under priorities 5.4 and 5.5 of the European Commission Strategy on Alcohol. The proposed research into the cognitive consequences of alcohol hangover and the relationship between hangover symptoms and risk for alcoholism will fill significant gaps in the existing knowledge base.\n\nHost and researcher\nThe host, Dr Richard Stephens (Keele University), is a prominent psychobiology researcher and one of the world�s leading alcohol hangover researchers. The planned research will enable Dr Stephens� lab to continue to grow, expanding its members skills and widening its network of collaborators. The candidate research fellow, Dr Lauren Owen (Swinburne University of Technology), is one of Australia�s most-published young researchers. Dr Owen will transfer knowledge and expertise in computerised neurocognitive assessment into Europe, while herself gaining new skills and developing a wide network of contacts in the area of alcohol / alcohol hangover.\n\nMultidisciplinary nature\nA multidisciplinary project is proposed bringing together researchers with expertise in psychobiology, neurocognitive assessment, cognitive science and analytical chemistry. The research aims to gather and disseminate reliable data on the behavioural and dependence consequences of alcohol hangover.\n\nBenefits to Europe\nBenefits are transfer of knowledge into Europe pertaining to state of the art computerised neurocognitive assessment and providing deliverables essential to the continued success of European-based research on alcohol / alcohol hangover. The European Research Area will be promoted by (i) the planned outreach activities of the fellowship stimulating more people to take up the research profession; (ii) in recruiting Dr Owen the fellowship will be attracting a very high calibre researcher into Europe.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"301424","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
