{"id":"102297","title":"Sport across international boundaries: building knowledge through shared understanding","abstractText":"'The establishment of closer international cooperation to share and develop research on the management and coordination of sport is timely and significant. This project aims to provide a platform for exchange and dialogue between Europe and Asia, promoting good practice and the development of interdisciplinary, international networks leading to the dissemination of knowledge about EU law and practice in the sport sector. The objectives of the project include:\n�\testablishing an active international community and effective communication channel for the teams to cooperate on global sports management topics\n�\tintegrating the complementary expertise of the European and Chinese teams to devise best practice case studies and standards to address the multi faceted requirements of managing sports; ensuring a positive, sustainable impact\n�\testablishing an EU/China research hub specifically addressing current challenges in sport to operate as a central resource dispensary on research in the area\n�\tleveraging the geographical characteristics of the teams to evaluate and disseminate the research outcomes in different regions of the EU and China\n�\n\nTwo European Universities and One Chinese University will synchronise their research to propose integrated solutions and examine the effectiveness of current policies in a global context through case studies from the partners.\n\nThe research teams each have different, but overlapping strengths across the societal, economic and organisational aspects of sport and employ a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies.\n\nA series of exchange programs and two industry seminars will be organised in order to share, integrate and evaluate the research. The value of this project will be in exploiting the objectives in order to have a wide impact across various sections of European policy. It will create a platform to continue the formation of transnational links to address key current issues and ensure the integrity of sport.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"295244","fundValue":"205800","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
