{"id":"97404","title":"Translation of Computational Heart Models into the Clinic","abstractText":"'The main objective of ComHeart2Clinic is the integration of multi-scale computational models of the heart into the clinic, addressing the translational challenges of this research. The project is focused on the Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy � CRT, a treatment for Heart Failure. This therapy consists of the placement of three pacing leads in the heart of the patient to restore its synchrony. There is currently a rate of 30% of non-responders to CRT. Recent developments in heart computational models are providing promising tools that could increase CRT effectiveness, broaden inclusion criteria, maximize the CRT benefit and avoid unnecessary procedures. The research hypothesis is that such models will reduce the uncertainty of diagnosis and predict the response to CRT. The expected result is the development and validation of a �ComHeart-assisted CRT� system for an enhanced CRT clinical outcome by a better patient selection, lead position planning and pacemaker configuration. The project will address the personalization of the computational models, the system prototyping and the model verification &amp; system validation.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"250429","fundValue":"30000","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
