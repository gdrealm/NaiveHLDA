{"id":"108974","title":"Global in flight health monitoring platform for composite aerostructures based on advanced VIBRATION based methods","abstractText":"'In order to reduce the sensor number, one has to be based on signals carrying information about the �global� structure state. The structure�s vibrational behavior is definitely a global characteristic. The idea is thus the development of a vibration based, in flight, SHM platform, which can be applied in aircraft structures in practice.\nThe main practical problem for the application of vibration based SHM methods in real world aircraft parts, is the large number of �training experiments� that are normally required for a successful fault detection, identification and localization. In the present project the real world training experiments will be replaced by simulated experiments using a proper analytic model, which will be fine tuned (updated) based a limited number of real world experiments. Furthermore, the existing vibration based methods will be adapted in order to be efficiently coupled with the new �training� procedure.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"605549","fundValue":"1962206.33","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
