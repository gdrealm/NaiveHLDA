{"id":"92164","title":"\"Strategies, payoffs and incentives\"","abstractText":"'The principles of game theory provide testable implications for strategic behaviour. Outside of experimental work, empirical analysis requires access to suitable real world data. Working with data from sporting competition is a useful way forward because not only can we see decisions being made but we also have an abundance of information about those decisions. Having data and decisions in hand enables us to investigate the role of incentives, payoffs and strategic behaviour in a way that is not easily done outside of a sports setting. Original data sets from football and cricket will be analysed using appropriate statistical techniques.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"239291","fundValue":"50000","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
