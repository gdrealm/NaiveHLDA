{"id":"109128","title":"REtrofitting Solutions and Services for the enhancement of Energy Efficiency in Public Edification","abstractText":"'RESEEPE will bring together design and decision making tools, innovative building fabric manufacturers and a strong demonstration programme to demonstrate the improved building performance through retrofitting. The core idea of the RESSEEPE project is to technically advance, adapt, demonstrate and assess a number of innovative retrofit technologies. Reductions in the area of 50% will be achieved in terms of energy consumption .A systemic process will be also implemented that will allow the selection of the best possible retrofiting mix, customised to the needs of the particular building..\n\nSeveral remarkable innovative technologies and materials will be integrated in the retrofitting process:\n- Envelope Retrofitting: Ventilated Facades, Aerogel-based Superinsulating mortar, Wooden Insulating Wall Panel and VIP Panel\n- Integration of RES: PV Energy, Thermal Collectors\n- Energy Storage Systems: Thermal storage and PCMs\n- Nanotechnologies and smart materials: EC/PV Windows\n- ICT: Strategies at building and district level\n- Intelligent Building Controls: HVAC systems\n\nThe RESSEEPE framework will be validated and refined by a strong demonstration programme, envisaging the renovation of 102.000 square meters of public buildings, arriving to a total renovation of 205.000 square meters that will be deployed in the following years. The estimated average of energy consumption in the renovated demo sites, on final energy, will be 66 kWh/m2�year, representing a 63% of reduction in energy consumption compared to the current situation. CO2 emissions will be 48,15 kg/m2�year, corresponding to more than 60 % of reduction. The total emissions avoided by the demo sites will be 2257 tCO2/year.\n\nAssociated investment costs to building renovation are expected to represent a maximum of 19% on average of the total costs of building an equivalent new building in the same location. On average, the return on investment will be around 7,6 years.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"609377","fundValue":"13682891.84","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
