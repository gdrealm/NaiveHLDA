{"id":"98614","title":"Binuclear Non-Coupled Copper Enzymes in Neurobiology: An Integrated Computational/Spectroscopic Investigation","abstractText":"'Every third protein contains metal as cofactor. Cu-enzymes plays crucial rules in key processes in bioenergetics, mitochondrial respiration, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, antioxidation and pigmentation Therefore they are intensive targets for discovering new drugs and the understanding of their structure-functions relationships will provide new insight in translational and biomedical research.\nIn this  Marie Curie  International Outgoing  Fellowship  I will investigate the mechanism  of  important two bi nuclear cupper enzyme ï¿½ Peptidylglycine ?-Amidating Monooxygenase (PAM) and  Dopamine ?-Monooxygense (DBM) which catalyze  hydroxylation of substrates in crucial importance for neurobiology . The miss functionalities of these enzymes are related with nervous system disorders therefore revealing it mechanism will provide advanced opportunities for design of new drugs. In order to achieve this knowledge we will apply integrated combination of the most advanced spectroscopic techniques and state of the art computational methods.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"276083","fundValue":"258386.8","fundStart":"2011-05-16","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
