{"id":"97438","title":"Trans-National Access to Unique European Actinide and Radiological Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Facilities","abstractText":"Substantial investment in advance nuclear magnetic resonance facilities has been made to establish the Actinide NMR Centre of Excellence in Karlsruhe between Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and JRC-Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU).  These instruments are in nuclear licensed facilities and are being commissioned for work on highly radioactive samples.  This proposal for access to large infrastructure aims to provide European nuclear scientists access to these newly nuclearised modern analytical techniques with 100 days access made available over a two year acccess period. The user programme will be overseen by a Scientific Advisory Committee and an Expert review team that has been asssembled with a previous coordination action.  NMR has made several very high profile contributions to actinide science over the last 5 years and this proposal aims to let European scientists use NMR to test their models of the behaviour of nuclear materials from exotic actinide superconductors and oxide nuclear fuels and nuclear waste forms to separations chemistry.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269923","fundValue":"634415.14","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
