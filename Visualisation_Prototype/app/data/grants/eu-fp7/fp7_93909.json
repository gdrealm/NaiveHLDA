{"id":"93909","title":"Perfectly interfaced nanomaterials for next generation oxide electronics","abstractText":"'Oxide thin film heterostructures hold the key to a wide range of novel, and energy efficient devices of many different sorts. In the last few years, there has been a plethora of very exciting reports in the top journals on the basic science of single layer oxide films or heterostructure devices. However, the holy grail of applications is still just an event on the horizon. An innovative and emerging materials science led approach is now required to understand the factors at play limiting these highly promising materials, thus opening the door to realising their functional potential. As time progresses the interfaces are playing an ever stronger role in the functionality and multifunctionality. New kinds of interfaces, new ways to control them, and state-of-the art probing of them are all needed to understand how to control and tune them. This proposal strikes at the heart of all these issues and aims to realise the true power of oxide electronics.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247276","fundValue":"1565873","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
