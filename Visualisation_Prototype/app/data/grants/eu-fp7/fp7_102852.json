{"id":"102852","title":"Finding the True Path Beyond the Standard Model","abstractText":"'The Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics is the best description of Nature we have. Yet we know that it must be incomplete, and we need to find the correct extension, which is done by developing new mathematical models and investigating their consequences.\n\nContrary to the usual approach of constructing 'yet another model' that can only explain particular aspects, we propose to identify the decisive characteristics of entire classes of theories, and use this knowledge to systematically develop new models. These classes will be tested thoroughly concerning their internal consistency, their experimental predictions, and their implications for the cosmology, instead of checking only the few points these models have been specifically designed for.\n\nMany theories are based on similar grounds, which is why there exist ways to classify them, test their predictions in a unified way, and detect remaining possibilities for new models. These principles shall be successfully searched for, which will be achieved by the unique combination the proposed fellow�s skills and the world-leading expertise of the two scientists in charge. This knowledge is ideally complemented by the fellow�s talent in combining a profound knowledge of theory with new results from on-going experiments, maximizing synergetic effects.\n\nThis is the ultimate up to date strategy to optimize the use of the outstanding experimental activities currently going on in and funded by Europe, from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN to groundbreaking Dark Matter and neutrino experiments in Italy, France, or Germany, which will all yield results in the very near future.\n\nIn short, one has to successfully connect expertise from different sectors in particle theory, identify generic principles, and link them correctly to experimental data in order to aim at 'Finding the True Path Beyond the Standard Model'. Giving a major contribution to these efforts is the goal of the proposed research.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"297557","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
