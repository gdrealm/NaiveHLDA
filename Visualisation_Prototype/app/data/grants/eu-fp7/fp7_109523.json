{"id":"109523","title":"Biomedical Robotics and Applications","abstractText":"'The project �Biomedical Robotics and Applications (BioRA)� focuses on the staff exchange between the partners of EU and China, and on the development of new technologies and applications in the field of biomedical robotics on the macro, micro and nano scales for biological cell detection, manipulation, test and injection. It meets the objectives and requirements of the Marie Curie Action: International Research Staff Exchange Scheme (IRSES), by setting up multiple bridges between European and Chinese institutions.\nThe ultimate goal of BioRA is to establish a long-term research cooperation platform between Europe and China in the challenging field of biomedical robotics with promising applications in scientific, industrial and domestic sectors. The synergistic approach made by BioRA will keep the consortium�s leading position in the world for potential major scientific and technological breakthroughs in biomedical robotics and biomedical applications.\nThe project is divided into five inter-related workpackages: (1) Setup of knowledge base and road mapping, (2) Fundamental exploration of biomedical robotics, (3) Development of biomedical robot components and systems, (4) Dissemination and exploitation, and (5) Project management. The workpackages integrate all activities that will lead to the completion of all the project objectives within 48 months.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612641","fundValue":"445200","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
