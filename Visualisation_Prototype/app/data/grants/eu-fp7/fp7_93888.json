{"id":"93888","title":"Quantum Optics in Wavelength Scale Structures","abstractText":"In this project I will investigate the interaction between quantum light and matter in optical structures that are at or below the wavelength scale. Such devices could provide unprecedented performance in the storage of data, the switching of light and the generation of light of tailored properties. I will address this topic through the study of 2-level systems (quantum dots, N-V centres, atoms), and non-linear materials (�(2) ,�(3) ) in various nanoscale dielectric and conducting structures. This will include: &quot; quasi 1D systems such as pillar microcavities, &quot; 2D systems such as microstructured fibres and suspended waveguide photonic bandgap cavities &quot; 3D systems such as single particle assembled 3D nano-cavities I will design suitable systems using the wide suite of electromagnetic modelling softwares available in my group. This will also involve the inclusion of the allowed modes and their interaction with single two-level quantum systems and non-linear materials.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"247462","fundValue":"2500000","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
