{"id":"94667","title":"Highly efficient new generation synthetic RNA-replicon based vaccine","abstractText":"'The project seeks to create a novel, efficacious vaccine against influenza virus; a new type of synthetic vaccine readily adaptable to meet whichever influenza virus subtype may arise. A new generation of RNA-replicon technology will be employed combined with nanoparticles and innovative adjuvants for targeting of dendritic cells and efficient antigen expression. The consortium comprises two SMEs and two academic institutions each having unique and patented expertise such as replicon technology, nanoparticle technology, adjuvant chemistry, and surface modification chemistry to attach targeting moieties. As a highly interdisciplinary project, extensive exchange of knowledge between the project partners will be required in particular between product focused SMEs (nanoparticles, adjuvants) and technology excellence of academic institutions (replicon technology, surface modification chemistry).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"251420","fundValue":"2591172","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
