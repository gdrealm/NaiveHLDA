{"id":"103104","title":"Synthesis of molecular probes for cancer research based on priviliged natural products through a novel enantioselective oxidative arylation technology","abstractText":"'Enantioselective catalysis continues to be a necesarily expanding part of Organic Chemistry and Synthesis to be able to provide the enantiopure compounds that Society demands in a straightforward and sustainable way.\nThis research proposal is aimed at doing so through the development of new enantioselective oxidative arylation reactions a completely unprecedented research field. Moreover, the molecular structures and synthetic targets have been selected in close collaboration with the group of Dr. Murrell at CRUK Cambridge. This collaboration is aimed at understanding the processes of cancer generation and growth at the molecular level through development of small molecule histone methylation and acetylation modulators. To study such processes a priviliged and synthetically challenging familiy of natural products is targeted: the pyrroloindole alkaloids. Development of molecular probes inspired by these products and demonstration of the total synthesis of some members will be accomplished through the development of appropiate chemical tools. The synthesis of these compounds will enable multidisciplinar research to study the particularities of oncogenesis.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"301895","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
