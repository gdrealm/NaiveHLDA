{"id":"95365","title":"Combination Amine and Metal Cascade Catalysis","abstractText":"'During this Fellowship we wish to develop new and synthetically powerful cyclisation cascades using combinations of amine organocatalysts and transition metal catalysts. Carefully chosen combinations of these catalysts should allow ketone functionality to be activated through conversion to a transient enamine intermediate that is then poised to attack the transition metal-activated alkyne or allene functionality. This concept can be extended to new annulation methodology when enone Michael acceptors are employed. In this case carbon acids tethered to alkyne or allene functionality can undergo an initial Michael addition under iminium ion (LUMO lowering) activation using amine organocatalysts and the generated enamine intermediate is then poised to attack the transition metal-activated alkyne or allene group. Furthermore, through use of effective single enantiomer organocatalysts it is possible to render this powerful carboannulation reaction asymmetric. As the majority of pharmaceutical compounds on the market are chiral and sold in single enantiomeric form, the provision of new, synthetically useful asymmetric reactions, reaction cascades and novel catalyst combinations will benefit the synthetic community in Europe by allowing drugs and drug intermediates to be constructed rapidly whilst minimizing waste. It is envisaged that the Fellowship will lead to a detailed understanding of the mechanistic processes and origins of stereocontrol in the developed reactions through employment of physical organic chemistry and computational chemistry techniques to the reactions where relevant. This understanding will further advance the state-of-the-art in field and thus benefit those working in both academia and industry alike. The work will therefore have widespread benefits for the European Community.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255080","fundValue":"180103.2","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
