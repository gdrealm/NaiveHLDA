{"id":"92248","title":"Development of a Non-destructive Sensor to Determine Density Gradient of Ceramic Tiles During Pressing","abstractText":"'The occurence of density gradients in ceramic tiles during pressing is believed to be the main cause of defects during processing. Problems such as differential shrinkage and warpage typically arise leading to losses or down-grading of final products. Density gradients are caused by poor die design, bad practice and/or unsuitable particulate materials, with the resultant poor flow ability impacting on die filling uniformity. Currently, these faults go undetected until been fired, rendering them scrap, which is difficult to recycle and often sent to landfill. This project aims to develop an in-situ sensor that enables measurement of the density of ceramic tiles during pressing. The project is seen as making a short to medium impact by allowing early detection of faults thus reducing the extent to which value-added process steps are unknowingly applied to scrap ware. Detection of faults during pressing allows efficient recycling of waste material and use for pressing again.'","grantUrl":"http://www.ceramgroup.com/projects/novapress/index.html","grantId":"232253","fundValue":"1056097.87","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
