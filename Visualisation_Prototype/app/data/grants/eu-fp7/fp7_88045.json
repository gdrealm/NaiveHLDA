{"id":"88045","title":"A Multi-Agent Approach for the Analysis of Early Aspects","abstractText":"'Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) is a Software Engineering methodology that provides explicit abstractions for crosscutting concerns. The term crosscutting concerns (e.g., reliability, synchronization) refers to quality factors or functionalities of software that cannot be effectively modularized using existing software development techniques (e.g., object oriented (OO) approaches). This paradigm provides systematic means for identification, modularization, representation, and composition of these crosscutting concerns. The aim of this fellowship is to bring the fellowï¿½s expertise in artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-agent systems (MAS) to the host organization with a view to improving the effectiveness and scalability of analyzing crosscutting concerns in requirements.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"221016","fundValue":"178874.06","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
