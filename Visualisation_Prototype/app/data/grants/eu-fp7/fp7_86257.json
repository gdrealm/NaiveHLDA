{"id":"86257","title":"\"Security System for Maritime Infrastructures, Ports and Coastal zones\"","abstractText":"'The SECTRONIC initiative addresses observation and protection of critical maritime infrastructures; Passenger and goods transport, Energy supply, and Port infrastructures. All accessible means of observation (offshore, onshore, air, space) of those infrastructures are exchanged via an onshore control center. The end-users themselves or permitted third-parties can access a composite of infrastructure observations in real-time. The end-users will be able to protect the infrastructure by non-lethal means in the scenario of a security concerned situation. The proposed system is a 24h small area surveillance system that is designed to be used on any ship, platform, container/oil/gas terminal or harbour. The initiative is an end-users driven R&amp;D activity. The end-users represent the major market player in each of the three infrastructures: Passenger transport, Energy production, Energy transport, Commercial ports and Combined military/commercial ports. They have requested better security as they have direct relation and responsibility towards passengers &amp; infrastructure, and are actively involved in the customization, testing, calibration, and validation activates ensuring fulfillment of their aspirations of protecting their high-value maritime assets. The R&amp;D partners represents SMEs (MARSS, ACS, NURC, UNIRESEARCH), university (Chalmers University of Technology), Defense Research Institutes (FFI, NURC) and a classification society (DNV).'","grantUrl":"http://www.sectronic.eu/","grantId":"218245","fundValue":"6681157.12","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
