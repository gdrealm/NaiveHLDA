{"id":"96042","title":"Micro-textured Surfaces for Boundary Layer Control","abstractText":"'The purpose of the proposed research is to investigate the mechanics of micro-textured surfaces, often referred to as �self- cleaning coatings�, and their influence on the incompressible fluid boundary layer as it undergoes transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Our approach combines Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and experimental studies, and will provide a theoretical framework for the use of micro-textured coatings in passive boundary layer control. This has broad applications in fluid mechanics from drag reduction to heat transfer enhancement to turbulent transition control. Control of these characteristics has an important role in a broad range of technologies where fluid interactions occur such as sea and air transport, power generation, electronics cooling, and microfluidic devices. Microfluidics, in particular, has been described as an enabling technology for a broad range of interdisciplinary applications including biological and chemical processes. Surface geometries that provide properties such as laminar stability which will delay the transition to turbulence, reduce turbulent shear stress and reduce drag are of great importance for improving efficiency, hence reducing operating costs and environmental impact. The research will comprise of a detailed analysis of the effects of geometries such as arrays of micro pillars and ribs on boundary layer slip and wetting at the wall. These findings will then be used to generate effective boundary conditions which take into account the dynamics of the underlying slip surface for large scale simulations of the complete transition process. This will illustrate how coating a surface with these features can be best used to influence characteristics desired in particular flow regimes. Using the knowledge gleamed from the simulations, experiments will be performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the coatings and the validity of the boundary conditions at the wall.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254471","fundValue":"172240.8","fundStart":"2010-10-04","fundEnd":"2012-10-03","dataset":"fp7"}
