{"id":"108622","title":"Promoting Active Ageing: Developing Age-Friendly Cities","abstractText":"'Need for the research: Although the issues raised by the 'age-friendly city' movement are well-understood at the level of the World Health Organisation and European Union, awareness within relevant academic disciplines is still limited. This project will fill a major gap in the literature by providing a substantial research base for assisting the development of age-friendly cities.\nHost and researcher: The proposed fellowship is a collaboration between a world-class scientist working at the University of Manchester, UK (Prof. Chris Phillipson) and an ambitious post-doctoral researcher currently based in Belgium (Dr. Tine Buffel). The research fellow, Dr. Tine Buffel (Vrije Universiteit Brussel), is one of Belgium�s most accomplished young researchers in the field of ageing. The host, Prof. Chris Phillipson has been a key figure in the development of social gerontology, and is one of the world�s leading researchers with expertise in population ageing and urbanization.\nInterdisciplinary nature: A key objective of the fellowship includes the development of an interdisciplinary approach to studying age-friendly environments. An interdisciplinary project team and advisory board will be formed to support and develop the career progression of the fellow. Both will comprise leading international researchers working across a range of disciplines (including social geography, psychology, environmental gerontology, urban design, architecture, and epidemiology) relevant to developing age-friendly cities.\nBenefits to Europe: Promote healthy and active ageing in Europe; contribute to European excellence regarding research on population ageing; advance Europe�s competitiveness by involving older people in research and innovation; provide outreach activities which will be beneficial to the development of the European policy agenda on Active Ageing.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"330354","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
