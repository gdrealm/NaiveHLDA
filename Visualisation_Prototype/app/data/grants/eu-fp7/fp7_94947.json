{"id":"94947","title":"Origin of a cell differentiation mechanism and its evolution over 500 million years of life on land","abstractText":"'The evolution of the first rooting systems approximately 470 million years ago was a critical event in the history of life on Earth because it allowed the growth of complex multicellular eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms ï¿½ plants - on the surface of the land. Rooting systems are important because they facilitate the uptake of every chemical element in the plant body with the exception of carbon. The root systems of the\nfirst land plants (liverworts) comprised a mass of unicellular tip-growing filaments (rhizoids) that grew from the plant surface into the soil. All root systems that evolved since then similarly comprise a system of tipgrowing filamentous cells located at the interface between the plant and the soil, indicating that the differentiation of filamentous root cells has been critical for root function for the past 470 million years. This proposal aims to characterize the origin and evolution of this essential cellular differentiation process. The proposed research is in three parts:\nFirst we propose to define the mechanism that controlled the development of the first land plant root system by identifying genes that control liverwort rooting system (rhizoids) development and\ncharacterizing their regulatory interactions.\nSecond we propose to determine if the mechanism that controlled the development of the first land\nplant root system was inherited from algal ancestors.\nThird we propose to characterize the mechanism that controls filamentous root hair growth in\nArabidopsis in response to environmental factors, and determine if it is conserved among land\nplants.\nIn combination, these experiments will define the genetic mechanisms underpinning the development and evolution of one of the fundamental developmental processes in land plants.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"250284","fundValue":"2463835","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
