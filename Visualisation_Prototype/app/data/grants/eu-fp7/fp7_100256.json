{"id":"100256","title":"Sampling and Reconstruction driven by Sparsity Models with Applications in Sensor Networks and Neuroscience","abstractText":"'The problem of reconstructing or estimating partially observed or\nsampled signals is animportant one that finds application\nin many areas of signal processing and communications. Traditional\nacquisition and reconstruction approaches are heavily influences by\nclassical Shannon sampling theory which gives an exact sampling\nand interpolation formula for bandlimited signals. Recently, the\nemerging theory of sparse sampling has challenged the way\nwe think about signal acquisition and has demonstrated that, by\nusing more sophisticated signal models, it is possible to break away\nfrom the need to sample signals at the Nyquist rate.\nThe insight that\nsub-Nyquist sampling can, under some circumstances, allow perfect\nreconstruction is revolutionizing signal processing, communications\nand inverse problems.\nGiven the\nubiquity of the sampling process, the implications of these new\nresearch developments are far reaching.\n\nThis project is based on the applicant's recent work on the sampling\nof sparse continuous-time signals and aims to extend the existing theory to include more\ngeneral signal models that are closer to the physical\ncharacteristics of real data, to explore new domains where sparsity\nand sampling can be effectively used and  to provide a set\nof new fast algorithms with clear and predictable performance.\nAs\npart of this work, he will also consider timely important problems\nsuch as the localization of diffusive sources in sensor networks and\nthe analysis of neuronal signals of the brain. He will, for the\nfirst time, pose these as sparse sampling problems and in this way\nhe expects to develop technologies with a step change in\nperformance.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"277800","fundValue":"1451162","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
