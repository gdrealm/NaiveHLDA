{"id":"186667","title":"Entanglement Verification Enabling New Technologies","abstractText":"'Quantum technology promises the next revolution in information processing and communication. Over recent years, the new flourishing research primitive � Quantum Information Science � has provided a rich framework for testing the foundations of quantum theory. Entanglement theory became a thriving research discipline because it was discovered that not only does entanglement question our fundamental understanding of the universe, but it also powers the majority of quantum information tasks.\n\nQuantum optics is a natural platform for investigating and implementing new quantum information tasks. Photonic entangled states are the ideal candidate to demonstrate such proposals because they are robust against decoherence, easily manipulated, and can be shared with little loss, either through free-space or in optical fibre. To date, the vast-majority of entangled states suffer from two major shortcomings: one, the exponentially bad scaling of large entangled state generation, and two, the post-selected nature of their observation. We tackle both these problems in this proposal.\n\nPhoton production is solved through multiplexing and by using new state-of-the-art superconducting detectors gained through an international collaboration. Multiplexing is a promising technique that transforms non-deterministic events into near deterministic events. To multiplex entanglement, we need a heralded source of entangled photons. We build such a device, and temporally multiplex it to increase the probability of success using a room temperature Cesium Raman quantum memory.. With this device we will demonstrate the first experiment that faithfully teleports a single photon using a heralded entangled state. Our synchronized entanglement source will find applications in many future quantum information experiments because it will increase the number of entangled pairs that can be realised simultaneously. For this reason eVent � entanglement verification enabling new technologies � is proposed.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"629229","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
