{"id":"95630","title":"Optimal Interconnection Networks","abstractText":"'In modern society networks are increasingly more important, such as communication networks, computer networks, transportation networks, the Internet, social networks. In this project we will investigate the topology of networks in terms of its underlying model using graph theory. Our aims are to obtain new knowledge of the structure of networks which are in some sense optimal, for example, in terms of the number of nodes given restrictions on other parameters of the network such as the number of connections attached at each node, or the maximum allowed distance between any two nodes in the network.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254628","fundValue":"241289.6","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
