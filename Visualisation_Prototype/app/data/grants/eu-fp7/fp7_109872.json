{"id":"109872","title":"Multi-Gigabit European Research and Education Network and Associated Services","abstractText":"This proposal details activities that will ensure the continued enhancement and ongoing operation of the leading-edge G�ANT network, supporting a range of network and added-value services, targeted at users across the G�ANT service area.nIn the area of multi-domain network service operation, GN3plus plans to deliver fast, efficient provisioning of advanced services, develop operational support across management domains, and improve security to ensure service integrity and protect network resources. These initiatives will be complemented by the development of application services in a federated environment � such as mobile and wireless roaming � supported by safe and secure Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure.nNetworking Activities will provide management and support for all GN3plus activities through communication, promotion, international liaison and business development. Emphasis will be placed on supporting and encouraging service take-up among users by working closely with NRENs. G�ANT will increase digital inclusion through closer collaboration between NRENs, exchange of staff and specialist expertise, as well as by seeking synergies between public administrations and the GN3plus partners using their vast, shared knowledge base.nJoint Research Activities will be targeted at providing critical analyses of future network and application technologies, with a view to future deployment of emerging technologies within and outside the G�ANT community.nThe governance model aims to increase effectiveness and user influence. The GN3plus Partners' Assembly will deal with overall policy and an Executive Board will oversee its implementation. An International User Advisory Committee and External Advisory Committee will ensure users' views and senior industry and service provider expertise are channelled directly to the Assembly. Specialised Advisory Boards will ensure highly efficient decision making, and that the voice of the stakeholder community is heard.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"605243","fundValue":"85205382","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
