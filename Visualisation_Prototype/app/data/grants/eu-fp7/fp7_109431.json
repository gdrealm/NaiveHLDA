{"id":"109431","title":"Probabilistic Models in Pseudo-Euclidean Spaces","abstractText":"'Biological sequence databases are a core source of information in the life sciences\nand have nowadays grown to multiple thousand entries. Classically, a query of a sequence to such a\ndatabase requires the comparison of the query to each entry using an alignment algorithm,\nlike fasta, smith-Waterman or blast. Many realtime and high-througput experiments rely\non a quick identification of the query to decide the next steps in the experimental pipeline\nand are currently slown down by the costs of the classical retrieval systems.\nThe main objective of this proposal is to provide quick large-scale identification\nalgorithms in non-metric spaces, induced by the scoring functions for sequence-alignments.\nThereby, the proposal aims on techniques which avoid the full calculations of the scorings\nduring training and retrieval, employing different mathematical and probabilistic approximation techniques.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327791","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2014-01-02","fundEnd":"2016-04-02","dataset":"fp7"}
