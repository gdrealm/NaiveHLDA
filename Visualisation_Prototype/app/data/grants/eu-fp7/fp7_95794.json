{"id":"95794","title":"Coordination Action for the integration of Solar System Infrastructures and Science","abstractText":"Solar System Science has traditionally been undertaken within a number of separate disciplines. However, like any system its aspects are inter-related and it has been difficult to address these aspects because of the lack of the integrating technology required to span the inter-disciplinary boundaries. While advances in technology means that the intrinsic differences between disciplines (manifest in differing data formats and dependencies) are beginning to be addressed, it is necessary to coordinate our efforts in order to help break down the barriers.nnUnder the Seventh Framework Programme, the European Commission is funding three projects that are directly relevant to this issue - HELIO, EuroPlanet RI and SOTERIA. Within their own areas, each is making significant improvements to the infrastructure that supports their communities and enabling increased ability to do science.nnWithin this Coordination Action we propose to take steps to move to the next level by cooperating in a number of areas. The cooperation will be in three main areas:n1.tWe will investigate ways to improve the interoperability between data and metadata from the domains. We will also investigate the possibility of sharing some metadata resources.n2.tWe will coordinate the use of standard within the projects and reflect any changes that are required to organizations like the IVOA, IPDA, etc.n3.tWe will coordinate our dissemination activities in order to create a more coherent and comprehensive approach. As part of this activity, we will hold meetings of key players in order to lobby the case for solar system science with the decision makers and funding agencies.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"261618","fundValue":"434448","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
