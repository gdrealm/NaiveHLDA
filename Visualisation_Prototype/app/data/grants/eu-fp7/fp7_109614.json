{"id":"109614","title":"Research and Development in Coal-fired Supercritical Power Plant with Post-combustion Carbon Capture using Process Systems Engineering techniques","abstractText":"'The proposed joint exchange programme on Coal-fired Supercritical Power Plant with Post-combustion Carbon Capture using chemical absorption is to develop and maintain long term collaborations between European and Chinese universities by carrying out joint research in process model development, process analysis, operation, controller design and optimisation for reliable and optimal design, operation and control of coal-fired supercritical power plant integrated with post-combustion carbon capture through individual mobility of researchers between Europe and China.   There are 6 partners involved (three from Europe and another three from China). These partners are world leading in their respective research areas.   The project is planned to start from 1 Jan. 2014 and continue for 48 months. There will be 15 experienced researchers and 14 early stage researchers participating in the joint research programme with exchange visits of 168 man months. The resources of ï¿½352,800 will be requested from this Europe Union Marie Curie Action to support these exchange visits.  The European partners are experts at heat transfer, carbon capture plant modelling and simulation, CFD studies, process control and monitoring, whilst the Chinese partners are experts at coal-fired supercritical power plants, synthesis of solvents for carbon capture based on molecular design, molecular simulation, process control and optimisation. Mutual transfer of knowledge and skills will take place through these exchange visits.   Successful completion of the proposed joint research programme will help build long term collaborations in clean coal technologies between Europe and China. It will also publish 30 Journal papers and 50 Conference papers. Three special sessions in major international conferences in 2015, 2016 and 2017 will be organised to disseminate the research results obtained from this joint research programme.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612230","fundValue":"352800","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
