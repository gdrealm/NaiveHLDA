{"id":"98023","title":"Development and Manufacture Scoop Intake and Channel incl. ice and debris protection and acoustic absorbers","abstractText":"'B.1.1 Concept and Objectives The concept of this project is to design and build a composite prototype scoop intake, incorporating the following key aspects of design � Acoustic panelling � Electro thermal ice protection � Lightning protection (if necessary) � Erosion protection � Temperature sensing The objective of the consortium team is to effectively trade the various design requirements to produce an optimised system solution. B.1.2 Progress beyond State of Art The project will investigate the integration both structurally and electrically of electro-thermal ice protection and acoustic absorbing panelling within a composite inlet scoop structure. It is not the purpose of this project to directly combine the ice protection and noise abatement technologies within the same area of scoop structure. A fully integrated, combined solution such as that is not viable within this project under the current budget; However, GKN does view this as an appropriate objective and a potential development area for future projects. By enabling this direct integration GKN expects significant noise reduction benefits. GKN sees potential in this entire application development area for offering technology progression. Work in this area to date has been focused on engine nacelle lip liner technology and has progressed well although additional support in this area would be necessary to continue the advancement.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255742","fundValue":"498042","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
