{"id":"109674","title":"Atomic Scale Group-IV Materials for Beyond-CMOS Applications","abstractText":"I will systematically exploit the quantum properties in Group-IV Materials (GFMs) at the atomic scale, by using top-down patterning processes developed for Si technologies. Among GFMs, I will examine graphene, Si, and Ge nano-structures, since these materials are technologically important. More specifically, I will use our He-Ion-Microscope (HIM) milling techniques to fabricate nano-structures beyond the resolution limit of conventional lithography. This research will:\n\n1. Characterize Freestanding Mono-layer or thin-layer of GFMs\nI will fabricate the freestanding device structure by HIM. The high-resolution of HIM will enable me to fabricate the graphene nano-ribbon as narrow as 5-nm. I will also examine the atomic structures of the device by Transmission-Electron-Microscope (TEM), and compare it with electrical measurements. The similar devices can be made for ultra-thin Si films.\n2. In-situ formation and characterization of Si Quantum Dot (QD)\nI will characterize the Si Single-Electron-Transistor with a QD by in-situ monitoring in HIM.\n3. Characterization of SiGe Fins\nI will characterize SiGe Fin for high performance electro-absorption optical modulator applications.\n\nImpacts of the projects to EU are expected as following ways:\n1. I will contribute in the interdisciplinary research areas with my strong research background in theoretical physics, nano-electronics, and Si Photonics.\n2. The long-term research activities to QIP will be continued for secure communication and massive commutation, beyond the limit of the classical computations.\n3. I will transfer my research experience from Japan. Especially, the industrial experience in Hitachi is helpful for running the clean room managements.\n4. I will explore the innovative opportunities for sustainable electronics, in which EU communities play the important contributions towards the matured smart society.\n5. I would like to establish the various collaboration within EU and internationally.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"618116","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
