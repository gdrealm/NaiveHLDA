{"id":"106725","title":"\"Combating inequalities through innovative social practices of, and for,  young people in cities across Europe\"","abstractText":"'This project builds on research that shows the disproportionate impact of the economic crisis on young people across Europe, including excessively high rates of youth unemployment and threats to the social provision enjoyed by previous generations. This is compounded by the 'coming of age' of the descendants of recent migrant communities - who now form significant proportions of the young population in major European cities. They are Europeans in language, social habit and cultural repertoire, yet continue to face longstanding barriers as a result of membership of communities already marginalised from mainstream labour markets and wider civic life. The project brings together stakeholders from civil society experienced in practical policy-making and implementation with well-established academic researchers to:\ni) Map the changing demographic landscape of inequalities as seen in major cities in the EU today  and the specific challenges facing young people disadvantaged by ethnic origin, cultural background, neighbourhood, family and educational and economic situation;\nii) Review approaches of different levels of government to engaging with disadvantaged youth and addressing inequality concerning young people, including state approaches and 3rd sector actions for promoting economic activity and entry into the labour market and ensuring effective distribution of services and community-led initiatives to enhance economic chances and participation in civic life;\niii) Uncover innovative strategies for navigating, surviving and overcoming inequalities that have emerged, and are emerging, among young people (16-24) in deprived parts of large cities through ethnographical research with young people themselves;\niv) Examine the extent to which these strategies might be regarded as socially innovative, explore through a series of pilot projects how such strategies might be transferable across Europe and use the findings for reshaping policies at EU, national and local levels.'","grantUrl":"http://www.aston.ac.uk/","grantId":"320359","fundValue":"3042746","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
