{"id":"98525","title":"Ion beam techniques for the sub-nanometric characterisation of advanced energy conversion heterostructured materials","abstractText":"'The improvement, discovery or implementation of alternative energy sources represents one of the most dynamic and challenging trends in todayï¿½s research with connections to Materials Science, Applied Physics and Engineering, among others. In this context, current developments in high-efficiency energy conversion systems are based in the modification at the atomic level of heterostructured materials to improve the performance of devices such as solid oxide fuel (SOFC) and triple-junction solar cells (TJC). These two highly-engineered technologies demand specific analytical techniques with high spatial resolution to perform a chemical characterization capable of relating their structure and their functionality, particularly at the interfaces. In this project we will apply a novel instrumental configuration that combines surface science and surface analysis to probe materials surfaces and interfaces with unparalleled precision so that we will be able to better understand and optimise the materials we are developing. Two techniques, low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) are the best candidates to face such challenge due to their excellent surface sensitivity and depth resolution. The combined use of these ion beam techniques will provide an understanding of the surface and near surface processes in the latest generations of advanced materials. For this purpose, a deep understanding of the ion-solid interaction fundamentals is required in order to optimise the depth resolution and sensitivity of ToF-SIMS-LEIS to perform the most accurate and reliable analysis of the interfaces and nanometric domains in such heterostructured materials.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"274999","fundValue":"201049.6","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
