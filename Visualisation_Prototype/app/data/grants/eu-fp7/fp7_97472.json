{"id":"97472","title":"Alliance Permanent Access to the Records of Science in Europe Network","abstractText":"Digital preservation offers the economic and social benefits associated with the long-term preservation of information, knowledge and know-how for reuse by later generations. However, digital preservation has  a great  problem,  namely  that preservation support structures are built on projects which are short lived and fragmented. The unique feature of the APARSEN network is that it is building on the already established Alliance for Permanent Access (APA), a membership organisation of major European stakeholders in digital data and digital preservation. These stakeholders have come together to create a shared vision and framework for a sustainable digital information infrastructure providing permanent access to digitally encoded information.nnTo this self-sustaining grouping APARSEN will bring a wide range of other experts in digital preservation including academic and commercial researchers, as well as researchers in other cross-European organisations. The members of the APA and other members of the consortium already undertake research in digital preservation individually, but even here  the effort is fragmented despite smaller  groupings of these organisations working together in specific EU and national  projects. APARSEN will help to combine and integrate these programmes into a shared programme of work, unified in a common vision, thereby creating the pre-eminent Virtual Centre of Excellence in digital preservation in Europe, if not the world. The APA provides a natural basis for a longer term consolidation of digital preservation research and expertise.nnThe Joint Programme of Activity will cover:n� technical methods for preservation, access and most importantly reuse of data  holdings  over the whole lifecycle;n� legal and economic issues including costs and governance issues as well as digital rightsn� outreach within and outside the consortium to help to create a discipline of data curators with appropriate qualifications.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"269977","fundValue":"8212966","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
