{"id":"99447","title":"Examining the relationship between linguistic- and non-linguistic cognitive processes in deaf children's vocabulary development in spoken and signed vocabulary","abstractText":"'This project is an investigation into the relationship between linguistic and �non-linguistic cognitive processes, comparing the spoken and signed language vocabulary of deaf children.\nObjectives are: (1) to contribute to our knowledge of modality effects on linguistic structure; (2) to contribute to the theoretical debate on the issue of language modularity; (3) to gain insight how mediated learning experiences can inform deaf children�s organization of their signed and spoken language systems; (4) to provide a model of how language learning occurs in deaf children in a short and very structured way. To receive objectives 1 and 2, deaf children�s understanding of different form-meaning mappings in signed and spoken language will be assessed during step 1 ; stimuli include vocabulary tasks and a rating scale to measure mode of acquisition of word meanings. To receive objectives 3 and 4, a test-teach-test paradigm is used in step 2, which includes the combined use of static (i.e., vocabulary test) and dynamic (i.e., mediated learning) assessments. By acquiring training and expertise at both host universities, the applicant will be in a position to effectively disseminate his expertise on an international level in his further expertise in research and teaching within the EU. The spreading of this expertise within the European Research Area  will help establish successful co-ordination and co-operation across national borders. Furthermore, the project will make an important contribution to the development of appropriate assessment and intervention for young deaf language users. Long-term, this work will help to enable deaf graduates to pursue a degree in Higher Education and, possibly, a career in science. This has direct relevance to one of the main objectives of the People Specific Programme, which is a strong focus on the quantity and quality of its human resources and the effort to make Europe more attractive, as well as more equally accessible, to researchers.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"275946","fundValue":"245579.2","fundStart":"2011-08-08","fundEnd":"2014-08-19","dataset":"fp7"}
