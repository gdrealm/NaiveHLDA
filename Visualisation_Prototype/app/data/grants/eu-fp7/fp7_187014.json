{"id":"187014","title":"LAr RD for neutrino physics","abstractText":"'The field of neutrino physics has produced a lot of excitement in the recent years and the next generation of neutrino experiments is extremely promising to probe CP-violation for the first time (this phenomenon may hold the answer to the long lasting puzzle of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe). The worldwide agreement to use Liquid Argon (LAr) technologies for the future generation of detectors will offer unprecedented sensitivity to neutrino detection and excellent background rejection, but more R&D is required to fully understand these state-of-the-art detectors and to demonstrate the scalability to very large scales.\n\nI propose to build and develop a strong LAr programme at University of Oxford by taking leadership roles in current and future neutrino experiments, as well as building the first LAr test stand to perform R&D work and essential measurements for neutrino and dark matter experiments.\n\nI will drive some of the most important physics analyses for the MicroBooNE experiment, currently constructing a 170 tons LAr detector. MicroBooNE is a vital milestone in the worldwide LAr development programme and the results will have significant scientific impact in the community and will pave the way to the next generation of experiments, such as the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE).\n\nI also propose to lead the Oxford group to take on significant responsibilities in the future LBNE experiment, such as developing the Data Acquisition system of the detector. LBNE will produce groundbreaking results and this research will offer the European community to make great impacts.\n\nFinally, I plan to build the first LAr R&D test stand at Oxford to perform greatly needed optical property measurements and to develop a new ambitious readout system for LAr detectors that could improve them considerably and could lay the ground for new medical imaging techniques.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"631616","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
