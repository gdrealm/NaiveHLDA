{"id":"106986","title":"\"Fractal-generated fluid flows: new flow concepts, technological innovation and fundamentals\"","abstractText":"'The unprecedented requirements set by the\ndramatically evolving energy, environmental and climatic constraints\nmean that industry needs new turbulent and vortical flow concepts for\nnew flow-technology solutions. The full potential and economic impact\nof radically new industrial flow concepts can only be realised with a\nstep change (i) in the ways we generate and condition turbulent and\nvortical flows and (ii) in our understanding of turbulent flow\ndynamics and the consequent new predictive approaches.\nFractal/multiscale-generated turbulent and vortical flows are a new\nfamily of flow concepts which I have recently pioneered and which\nhold the following double promise:\n\n(1) as the basis for a raft of conceptually new technological flow\nsolutions which can widely set entirely new industrial standards: this\nproposal focuses on energy-efficient yet effective mixing devices;\nlow-power highly-enhanced heat exchangers; high-performance wings for\nUAVs, cars, wind turbines; and realistic wind-field design\ntechnologies for wind tunnel tests of tall structures such as\nsupertall skyscrapers and wind turbines.\n\n(2) As the key new family of turbulent flows which will allow\nhitherto impossible breakthroughs in our theory and modelling of fluid\nturbulence.\n\nI propose to realise this double promise by a combined\nexperimental-computational approach which will use cutting edge High\nPerformance Computing (HPC) and high-fidelity simulations based on a\nnew code which combines academic accuracy with industrial versatility\nand which is specifically designed to perform very efficient massively\nparallel computations on HPC systems. I will run these simulations in\ntandem with a complementary wide range of wind tunnel, water channel\nand other laboratory measurements in a two-way interaction between\nlaboratory and computer experiments which will ensure validations and\nbreadth of results.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"320560","fundValue":"2317265","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
