{"id":"107169","title":"Organoboron-Based Luminescent Nanomaterials via Crystallization-Driven Self-Assembly","abstractText":"'The scientific objective of this proposal is to incorporate luminescent organoboron functionality into PFS-based block copolymers. In doing so, functional nanostructures will be created by crystallization-driven self-assembly, and their potential applications in nanoscale display technology, bioimaging, and biodiagnostics will be investigated. The exceptionally talented applicant, Dr. Hudson, has extensive experience in organoboron chemistry, luminescent materials chemistry and displays from his Ph.D. in Canada. The Manners group in the UK has well-known internationally-leading expertise in polymer and materials science, block copolymers, and crystallization-driven self-assembly. Thus, the experiences of Dr. Hudson and the Manners group are fully complementary and both are essential for the proposed research to succeed. At the end of the proposed 2 year fellowship period Dr. Hudson aims to return to Canada to a faculty position at a top research-intensive University.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327540","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
