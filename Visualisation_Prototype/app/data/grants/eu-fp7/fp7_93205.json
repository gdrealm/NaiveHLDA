{"id":"93205","title":"Re-creating the physics of astrophysical jets in laboratory experiments","abstractText":"'The observation of highly collimated jets is a ubiquitous phenomenon present in different types of astrophysical objects throughout the universe. These outflows have been observed in very different spatial scales, from large-scale jets emerging from black holes at the centre of galaxies, to smaller-scale jets observed in young stars. In recent years the study of these outflows has attracted the interest of the scientific community due to the possibility of performing laboratory experiments that can reach the extreme physical conditions relevant to these astrophysical processes. It has been demonstrated that despite the spatial and temporal scales being different by 15-20 orders of magnitude, it is possible to perform experiments that can reproduce the physics of these jets in a scaled way. The aim of this project is to perform experiments that are relevant to the dynamics of astrophysical jets, particularly focused in the study of (a) the launching mechanism and the subsequent collimation of a jet by the means of magnetic fields, (b) the formation of episodic outflows and the effect on the variability of the jet, (c) the propagation and interaction of the jet with the ambient medium. The experiments will be performed on the MAGPIE generator at Imperial College London. The use of present and new diagnostic techniques will allow measuring the physical conditions of the plasma during the experiments, allowing obtaining some parameters previously uncharacterized. Recent results have demonstrated that the &quot;magnetic tower&quot; scenario of jet formation can be reproduced from such experiments, in which the plasma is confined by a helical magnetic field, forming in this way a supersonic jet (Mach number~ 5-10). The ability of performing these experiments makes them of great interest in the field of laboratory astrophysics, and their continuation will contribute to a further understanding of the physical processes driving astrophysical jets.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"249291","fundValue":"45000","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
