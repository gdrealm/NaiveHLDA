{"id":"185808","title":"Nanoengineering High-Performance Low-Cost Perovskite Solar Cells Utilising Singlet Fission Materials","abstractText":"'This project aims to combine two recent breakthroughs in solution-processed thin-film solar photovoltaics (PVs) to demonstrate a low-cost, stable PV device with an efficiency approaching conventional crystalline silicon devices. The aim will be achieved by integrating singlet fission, a process capable of pushing PV efficiencies beyond conventional limits, with recent exciting perovskite results. The researcher is uniquely suited to this ambitious project, which will engage him with world-leading techniques, collaborations, and transferrable skills and help him to achieve his goal of establishing a leading UK-based device spectroscopy research group.\n\nThe project comprises an outgoing phase in Prof. Valdimir Bulovic�s Organic & Nanostructured Electronics Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where their unrivalled expertise in the deposition and nanopatterning of materials will be applied to perovskite/singlet fission devices. This expertise will be transferred back to Prof. Sir Richard Friend�s Optoelectronics (OE) Group at Cambridge University, world-leaders in ultrafast spectroscopy. Device behaviour will be elucidated and performance optimised by studying ultrafast phenomena such as the dynamics and mechanism of charge generation. Such a partnership of high-end nanoengineering and ultrafast spectroscopy is yet to be achieved and is likely to lead to revolutionary breakthroughs.\n\nThe work will ensure that state-of-the-art expertise not currently available in the European Research Area (ERA) is transferred to the European community. This will create strong international links between the two leading groups, with enormous potential for intellectual property generation and industry involvement through OE Group spin-outs and partners and knowledge transfer from interaction with successful enterprises in the Boston area. This will increase Europe�s competitiveness in the solar energy sector and ensure its energy security and emission targets are reached.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"622630","fundValue":"294219.6","fundStart":"2014-10-13","fundEnd":"2017-10-12","dataset":"fp7"}
