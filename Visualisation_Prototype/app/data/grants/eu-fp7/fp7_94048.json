{"id":"94048","title":"Development of New and Novel Quality Control System for the Inspection of Titanium Components in Safety Critical Applications in the Aerospace Industry","abstractText":"'European SMEs in the field of none destructive testing do not have the technological capability to reliably test titanium materials, and as a result risk are losing competitiveness in this �600million global market. Titanium is important material in the manufacture of new components in many important industries, including aerospace.    An automated phased array, ultrasonic NDT method supported with eddy current technology, integrated with the manufacturing process. Currently, beam steering techniques require prior knowledge of the exact geometry and acoustic properties of the material and also require an extremely precise alignment of the probe to the component under test.  The QualiTi Consortium SMEs will develop inspection of titanium at the component manufacturing stage.  The QualiTi work programme is broken down logically into work packages and includes RTD work, management, training, dissemination and knowledge management activities. The QualiTi Consortium are suited and committed to the tasks allocated to them, are able to achieve their S&T objectives and commercialise the deliverables.    The SME proposers consider that the QualiTi system will provide sufficient competitive advantage to enable annual growth rates of at least 20% in SME sales turnover over the four years following project completion. The exploitable prototype systems developed in QualiTi will reduce world spending on inspection in the aerospace market by >10% and thus generate savings of approximately �66m worldwide per annum four year after project end. The corresponding European saving is �19m.  After outsourcing research the QualiTi SMEs will become more competitive.  All the QualiTi deliverables are patentable. The QualiTi project will deliver an integrated inspection solution, to meet the requirements of the titanium aerospace industry.  Absorption of the project results by SME consortium will be directed, ensuring benefits from the knowledge produced are maximised.'","grantUrl":"http://www.qualiti.eu","grantId":"222476","fundValue":"1471000","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
