{"id":"109934","title":"Network for Sensor Knowledge Transfer","abstractText":"'The aim of Research Exchange programme Ionophore Based Sensor Network (IBS-NETWORK) is to establish the scientific basis from which the utility and potential for IBSs can be extended in a range of new sectors. To achieve this requires the combined expertise from a number of disciplines and backgrounds, including analytical science focused on IBSs, organic synthesis, material science, microfluidics and statistics. All these disciplines exist within the partnership IBS-NETWORK. We bring together in this project a multidisciplinary team of 10 research groups from 8 institutions. These teams originate from 7 countries within and outside of Europe, all recognised leaders in their respective fields. Our partners possess complementary skills and knowledge and the necessary skills to develop new methodologies and sensing platforms. IBS-NETWORK includes researchers involved in basic research working with researchers with applied expertise. The collaborations of the partners involved in this project represent a significant audience of stakeholders from academia and industry, national and international levels, creating high potential for the take-up and use of results.\nWe expect that the research exchange between these groups will achieve the following main goals:\n� Greatly expand the utility and potential for application of IBSs in a range of new sectors with recognized potential for benefit (climate action, health, wellbeing, marine and maritime research and food security)\n� To strengthen existing and create new research collaborations between experts from a number of disciplines, techniques and equipment.\n� To provide the basis for long-term, sustainable collaborations in research with the knowledge to take forward developments in the IBS field\nThese goals will be achieved through a balanced, two-way exchange of researchers and expertise between countries inside and outside Europe.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612576","fundValue":"279300","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
