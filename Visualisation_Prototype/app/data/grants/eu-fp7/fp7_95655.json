{"id":"95655","title":"Distributed Systems Verification with MAS-based Model Checking","abstractText":"'The field of distributed systems is concerned with development of spatially distributed (software) components that cooperate to perform a common task. Multi agent systems (MAS) is a field in artificial intelligence and is concerned with comparable problems on a higher level of abstraction. Although applications in both fields are similar, there is little work on combining the approaches. The DiVerMAS project will make a key contribution to both fields of research by introducing verification of MAS based specifications to distributed systems. This will provide developers of distributes systems with an easy to use language amenable to verification against rich agent-based specifications and give MAS developers an alternative developing process using an object oriented modelling language. The research project builds upon recent developments in both fields and the expertise of the applicant and supervisor in distributed systems and verification of MAS respectively. The collaboration will connect the verification toolkit MCMAS with the modelling language Creol and establish new links within the European research communities related with these tools.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252184","fundValue":"165540.8","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","dataset":"fp7"}
