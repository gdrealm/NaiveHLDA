{"id":"88465","title":"3D contour and strain mapping for non-destructive evaluation of engineering components","abstractText":"'This proposal addresses the increasing demands of improving reliability and delectability of non-destructive evaluation of engineering components and structures in aerospace industry. Digital Holography method will be used to quantify the 3D contour of the components under investigation, while in the meantime stereo laser shearography will be employed to measure the 3D strain field. These measurements will enable the quantification of the complex 3D deformation behavior of the engineering component, which would be of crucial importance in determining the overall structural integrity of the components involved. A framework consisting of the image acquisition, deformation reconstruction, defect detection, 3D results visualization, remote network detecting and remaining life evaluation algorithm based on optical NDT techniques will be developed. A set of samples will be used to assess the viability and reliability of the developed algorithm and the corresponding optical NDT system.   The host organization, TWI, has been working closely with industrial partners across Europe to develop new NDT techniques for many years. Projects have successfully involved the whole supply chain including SMEs, RTDs and LE end users. TWIï¿½s 3500 membership base will ensure that the fellow will be exposed to a wide range of potential contributors and end users. This project will benefit end-users across a range of industries by developing novel optical NDT methods, improving probability of detection (POD), increasing sensitivity to defects and reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"221623","fundValue":"178874.06","fundStart":"2008-09-08","fundEnd":"2010-09-07","dataset":"fp7"}
