{"id":"108287","title":"Eye-hand coordination in space and time","abstractText":"'Loss of arm function can have a severe impact on a patient�s life and results in a loss of productivity. As a remedy, scientists are currently developing brain-machine interfaces, which ultimately would allow patients to control a cybernetic arm by thought, through signals recorded from the brain. Even though many basic real-life situations, such as interacting with other people and navigating traffic, require movement coordination in both space and time, surprisingly little is known about how the brain simultaneously controls both these aspects of a movement. This limitation is fueled by the difficulty of extracting signatures of spatial and temporal control from behavioral or neural signals. There is a need for a new paradigm that allows for the systematic examination of interceptive timing and positioning in isolation. In EYEHAND, I will develop and use such a paradigm for in depth investigation � using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) � of the neural basis of eye-hand coordination in space and time. This work will ultimately contribute to neurorehabilitation through improvements of brain machine interfaces and to the development of novel training tasks.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"334202","fundValue":"75000","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
