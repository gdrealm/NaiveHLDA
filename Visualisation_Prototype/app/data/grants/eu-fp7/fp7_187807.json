{"id":"187807","title":"Investigation of the Structural Stability and Integrity of Steel Foam Sandwich Panels","abstractText":"'INSIST is an experimental investigation on the structural integrity and stability of novel steel foam sandwich panels under monotonic and cyclic loading.  The response of single density and graded properties cores are studies and the differences in the observed failure modes quantified. Furthermore the project explores the response of welded end-plates in steel foam sandwich panels and testing the strength and tolerance of the connection under static load and fatigue. Also for the first time a pilot corrosion test will take place in order to observe the failure propagation in fatigue within a corrosive environment. These tests are essential and will pave the way for the use of SFSPs in structural engineering applications. Moreover, the project seeks to explore biomimetic optimized applications for steel foam sandwich panels in the offshore and marine sector that can perform more than one function, such as weight, vibration damping and even provide data for structural health monitoring purposes.\n\nThe overarching aim of this project is the training of the researcher in the field of experimental structural stability and integrity specific to novel functionally optimized components pertinent to offshore and marine engineering, at Cranfield University�s Department of Offshore, Process and Energy Engineering Structural Integrity Lab. The purpose of this fellowship will be to equip the researcher with the necessary skills to pursue independent experimental and computational research in structural integrity of offshore structures and other safety critical structures pertinent to the Energy industry which is an emerging industry in the Eastern Mediterranean and Cyprus, where the researcher�s home institution is located (Cyprus University of Technology), as well as an industry of critical importance for Europe�s Energy Security.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"623874","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2015-01-12","fundEnd":"2017-01-11","dataset":"fp7"}
