{"id":"106762","title":"The Emergence of Structure during the Epoch of Reionization","abstractText":"'Early on the Universe consisted of a near-uniform mixture of\nhydrogen, helium, dark matter and radiation.  The emergence of\nstructure from a stochastic background of fluctuations in the\nperiod between 400.000 years and 1 billion years  is the main subject\nof this proposal.  This era saw the  formation of the first autonomous sources\nof radiation, stars and black holes.  This `renaissance' of light led to the heating,\nreionization  and pollution  of the Intergalactic Medium  with metals.\n\nWe will unravel   how the hydrogen in Universe progressed from substantially neutral to highly ionized  by detailed comparison  of cosmological hydro-simulations of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) and galaxy formation    including continuum and resonant Lyman-alpha radiative  transfer with QSO absorption spectra and   LBG/ï¿½Lyman-alpha emitter surveys and other data.\nThis will help us to make the most out the wealth  of information which will be provided  by  new observational missions  and surveys which have just begun (or are just about to begin) to report results (UKIDDS, VISTA, Planck, Herschel, COS@HST, LOFAR, ALMA). In this way we expect to make  decisive contributions  to the expected transformation of  our understanding of this exciting period in the history of the Universe.\n\nMeasurements of the matter power spectrum on scales\nfrom 1Mpc to a Gpc from  Lyman-alpha forest, weak gravitational lensing,\nand galaxy survey data contain  important information of the\nnature of dark matter and the mass and number of species of\nneutrinos.  Particularly exciting is the possibility to significantly push the\nlimit  on 'how cold' dark matter is. To robustly  answer  the question, whether the free-streaming of dark matter suggested to solve the dwarf-galaxy problem  of the cold dark matter   paradigm is consistent with  Lyman-alpha forest data, is another key goal of this proposal.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"320596","fundValue":"1975120.8","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
