{"id":"192351","title":"Adding Another Dimension � Arrays of 3D Bio-Responsive Materials","abstractText":"'This proposal is focused in the areas of chemical medicine and chemical biology with the key drivers being the discovery and development of new materials that have practical functionality and application. The project will enable the fabrication of thousands of three-dimensional �smart-polymers� that will allow: (i). The precise and controlled release of drugs upon the addition of either a small molecule trigger or in response to disease, (ii). The discovery of materials that control and manipulate cells with the identification of scaffolds that provide the necessary biochemical cues for directing cell fate and drive tissue regeneration and (iii). The development of new classes of �smart-polymers� able, in real-time, to sense and report bacterial contamination. The newly discovered materials will find multiple biomedical applications in regenerative medicine and biotechnology ranging from 3D cell culture,  bone repair and niche stabilisation to bacterial sensing/removal, while offering a new paradigm in drug delivery with biomarker triggered drug release.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"340469","fundValue":"2310884","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2019-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
