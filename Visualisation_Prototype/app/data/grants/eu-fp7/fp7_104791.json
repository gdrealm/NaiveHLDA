{"id":"104791","title":"Interferometry beyond the Standard Quantum Limit using a Velocity Sensitive Sagnac Interferometer","abstractText":"'From the very first Michelson Interferometer invented over 100 years ago to today�s kilometre-scale gravitational wave detectors the sensitivity of interferometric length measurements has been improved by about 10 orders of magnitude and is now limited by the so-called Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), a manifestation of Heisenberg�s Uncertainty Principle. The SQL is comprised of the inevitable combination of sensing noise (photon shot noise) and back action noise (photon radiation pressure noise) when repeatedly measuring the position of a test mass. However, by measuring a different variable, i.e. the test mass velocity (speedmeter) instead of its position (position-meter), it is possible to evade back action noise. The momentum of a free test mass can be measured continuously to arbitrary accuracy without being limited by the SQL. Since a Sagnac interferometer is sensitive only to the time-dependent part of the arm-length difference it is automatically a speed meter and therefore brings measurements beyond the SQL into our reach.\n\nTheoretical analyses have shown that the speedmeter approach is the most promising track towards wide-band sub-SQL measurements. An experimental test of this technique is urgently required! Therefore, my three main objectives of this proposal are: 1) Realisation of an ultra-low noise, quantum radiation pressure dominated speedmeter test bed. 2) Experimental demonstration of back action noise supression in a Sagnac speedmeter. 3) Development of speedmeter based sub-SQL interferometery for future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope.\n\nBy the end of this project I will have demonstrated the sub-SQL potential of the Sagnac speedmeter configuration. A positive outcome of this project is expected to lead to the Sagnac speedmeter superseding the Michelson interferometer as state-of-the-art instrument for ultra-high sensitivity lengths measurements.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"307245","fundValue":"1399260","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
