{"id":"96668","title":"Development of nano-spheres and quantum dots for electrochemiluminescent (ECL) biomedical diagnostic sensor technologies","abstractText":"'This programme addresses how single molecules such as quantum dots or metal centres within nano-structured polyelectrolytes can be used to create efficient electrochemiluminescent (ECL) sensors multi-analyte detection, specifically for biomedical sensors with ultra-high sensitivities and selectivityï¿½s. The unique capabilities of these novel nano-materials will arise from the coupling of photonic, chemical, optical and fouling resistant properties of each component to create a sensitive and selective detection system while allowing for applications in point of care devices.\nA combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques will be utilised to elucidate the electron and/or energy transfer mechanisms, which will allow optimisation of device performance to be performed. The spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques highlight the redox reactions influencing the ECL production. Tailoring of surface properties and modification of polyelectrolytes will involve the use of several analytical techniques, including atomic force microscopy and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance analysis. These studies focus on the binding of the polyelectrolyte, which will impart desirable surface chemistries at the material-solution interface to optimise the fouling resistant properties while retaining the sensitivity and selectivity of its ECL production for applications in imaging technologies.\nThese materials will feed into product development which will incorporate sensor design, novel detection platforms and easy to use devices. The development of novel 2nd and 3rd generation materials will focus on the detection of cardiac Troponin I (TNI). The properties of these materials will uniquely enable the development of advanced diagnostic devices based on the luminescent detection of TNI at sufficiently low concentrations so as to change clinical practice.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"268236","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
