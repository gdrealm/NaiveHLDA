{"id":"96958","title":"Dynamic mechanical properties of cartilage: influence of loading conditions on properties and structure","abstractText":"'The key goals of this study are to better understand the properties that prevent articular cartilage from sustaining mechanical damage, and to determine which mechanical factors encourage cultured chondrocytes to produce structural macromolecules that enable cartilage to withstand mechanical loading.\n\nThese key goals will be achieved by:\n(i) determining the storage and loss moduli for cartilage from lower limb joints, using cyclic loading test conditions;\n(ii) determining their relationship to structure (i.e. collagen orientation), using microscopy (light and electron) and x-ray diffraction techniques;\n(iii) culturing chondrocyte cells on modified alginate gel scaffolds, under intermittent loading. The boundary conditions applied to these cultures will be varied (i.e. loading rate, peak load) in order to determine how variations in loading alter the production of structural macromolecules that enable cartilage to withstand mechanical loading.\n\nResults from (i) and (ii) above enable predictions of trends as to how alterations in loading alter properties, and the relationship of these properties to the tissue structure. These loading conditions can then be isolated using cell cultures (iii) enabling predicted trends to be confirmed/refuted.\n\nEssentially, this study aims to determine which physical loading parameters aid the maintenance healthy cartilage. This is important because alterations to loading are thought to be involved in cartilage degeneration as occurs during osteoarthritis.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252278","fundValue":"171740.8","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
