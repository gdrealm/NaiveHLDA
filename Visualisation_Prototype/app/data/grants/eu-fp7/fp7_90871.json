{"id":"90871","title":"African Migrant Women","abstractText":"'On the margins of the EU, African women migrants can be important transmitters of social cultural practices.  But in certain societies of immigration (France, Spain) these women, because of the ageing factor can be victims of some kind of discrimination.  Often their husbands can replace them for new co-spouses.  This situation creates tensions and that is, for the women, all the more constraining and painful when the women carry on a productive and reproductive activity.  this proposal, through a specific anthropological demography methodology, wants to bring into question meaningful motions of ethnicity, transnationalisation, gender and the changing context in relation to aesthetic and body concepts of African women in the settlement countries mainly in Spain and France (Europe) and in Senegal and Gambia (Africa).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"220771","fundValue":"169575.09","fundStart":"2009-04-17","fundEnd":"2011-04-16","dataset":"fp7"}
