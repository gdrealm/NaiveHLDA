{"id":"85382","title":"ACTIVE: Enabling the Knowledge Powered Enterprise","abstractText":"Europe is in transition to a knowledge economy and effective knowledge management is fundamental to successful economic activity. Still, enterprises find it hard to transform most of their essential tacit (implicit) knowledge into transferable, easily accessible, and actionable knowledge assets.<br/>ACTIVE aims to increase the productivity of knowledge workers in a pro-active, contextualised, yet easy and unobtrusive way. The aim is to convert tacit knowledge � the 'hidden intelligence' of enterprises � into actionable knowledge to support collaboration and automated problem solving. A key aspect will be the support for informal procedural knowledge � the informal collaboration and problem-solving tasks that drive much knowledge work in the enterprise.<br/>ACTIVE will integrate concepts, methods, and tools from the fields of (i) Social Software and Web 2.0, (ii) Semantic Technologies, (iii) Context Mining and Modelling, and Context Sensitive Task Management, and (iv) Knowledge Process Mining and Modelling and Pro-Active Knowledge Process Support into innovative application systems. The development will be accompanied by an analysis of key economic and organizational factors and incentive mechanisms, and strongly user-centric system development and evaluation.<br/>The key result of ACTIVE will be a breakthrough which empowers enterprises to make knowledge technology effective for a larger share of their essential knowledge, in particular both tacit knowledge and knowledge not held in formal enterprise repositories.<br/>ACTIVE will generate sustainable impact by deploying the tools and applications in three industry sectors: consulting, telecommunication and engineering. The added value of ACTIVE technology will be evaluated in economic, organizational, and user studies, and conclude with rigorous field tests. A major focus of ACTIVE will be uptake by industry beyond the immediate consortium.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"215040","fundValue":"11798011","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
