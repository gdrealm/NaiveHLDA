{"id":"100858","title":"High Efficiency Fuel Pumping","abstractText":"'The concept of this project is the TRL 6 demonstration of a high speed, light weight, large capacity variable displacement piston pump for medium and large aero-engine fuel system applications, capable of high efficiency performance at fuel flows of up to 40,000 pounds per hour and pressures up to 2200 pounds per square inch.\n\nPiston pumps currently find application on the fuel systems of small and medium engines. This project aims to build on AEC�s pedigree and inherent high reliability in this market while addressing the speed limitations of the current piston pumps. By increasing the maximum speed capability the large flow output can be achieved with a smaller displacement pump, to meet the required mass target of 50 lbs. Higher speed requires a greatly increased duty, a term used to compare the relative levels of stress and velocities of the pumping elements.\n\nThis higher duty performance will be achieved through application of modern materials, coatings, manufacturing technologies and advanced analysis methods. The pump shall be designed to retain the current high mean time before failure of 300,000 hours, with an overhaul life of 30,000 hours.\n\nThe project is split into eight work packages, with the overall aim being to design and manufacture a variety of options for the high duty pump�s internal components to be tested within a flexible demonstrator vehicle. The optimum combination will then be identified and subjected to further testing to demonstrate TRL6, resulting in a final design proposal for a large engine application.\n\nAEC has in-house pump design, manufacture and performance and environmental test capability.  However, this technology programme will require external capabilities relating to specific design and manufacturing processes and capabilities, and materials technology.  Therefore, the overall strategy is for AEC to integrate the research establishments and the SMEs� capabilities to design, make and evaluate the key component technologies.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"278228","fundValue":"1423216","fundStart":"2011-01-04","fundEnd":"2013-01-03","dataset":"fp7"}
