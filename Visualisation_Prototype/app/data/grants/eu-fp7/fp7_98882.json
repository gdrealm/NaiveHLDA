{"id":"98882","title":"Coupled fluid-solid numerical modelling for deep-water and far-offshore floating wind turbines using an adaptive finite element method","abstractText":"'The proposed research aims to numerically simulate the impact of far-offshore wind turbines placed in deep waters. Importantly, such turbines offer several advantages over existing wind farms, for example stronger and steadier winds, and reduced visual and noise impact. Therefore, placing wind turbines far offshore will be essential for increasing the share of renewable energy production in the next decade.\n\nIn current offshore wind farms, the platforms are typically fixed to the seabed and as a result, cost becomes prohibitive in waters deeper than 50 metres. This limitation is a bottleneck for the further exploitation of wind energy in Europe. Far offshore, floating designs minimise the lateral wave loads acting on the turbine and are cheaper than fixed platforms reaching the same depth. In the present study, the hull of the wind turbine consists of a floating steel cylinder attached to the seabed through moorings, while the turbine is modelled as an actuator disc. Numerical tools capable of calculating the complete response of a floating wind turbine with fully coupled hull, moorings and wind turbine are currently at an early stage of development. An efficient strategy to minimise the computational cost is also lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, cutting-edge ocean/fluids and solids computational methods will be employed. Key components are: (a) a numerical wave deep basin that uses unstructured meshing, coupled to (b) a discrete element method for the dynamics of solids with (c) finite element modelling of stresses and (d) mesh adaptivity.\n\nThe overall deliverable is an open-source code to model the two-way coupling between fluids and floating solids. The proposed tool will be capable of: (1) determining the limits of stability and resistance of the floating system to different weather conditions, (2) assessing the effect of deep-ocean currents on the hull and moorings, (3) estimating the effect of the turbine movement on the power extracted.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"272437","fundValue":"199549.6","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
