{"id":"85729","title":"Pattern Analysis, Statistical Modelling and Computational Learning 2","abstractText":"PASCAL2 builds on the FP6 PASCAL Network of Excellence that has created a distributed institute pioneering principled methods of pattern analysis, statistical modeling, and computational learning (see http://www.pascal-network.org/). While retaining some of the structuring elements and mechanisms (such as the semi-annual Themes, and the Pump-Priming and Challenges programmes) of its predecessor NoE, PASCAL2 refocuses the institute towards the emerging challenges created by the ever expanding applications of adaptive systems technology and their central role in the development of artificial cognitive systems of different scales. Learning technology is key to, for instance, making robots more versatile, effective and autonomous, and to endowing machines with advanced interaction capabilities. The PASCAL2 Joint Programme of Activities (JPA) responds to these challenges not only through the research topics it addresses but also by engaging in technology transfer through an Industrial Club to effect rapid deployment of the developed technologies into a wide variety of applications. In addition, its Harvest sub-programme provides opportunities for close collaboration between academic and industry researchers. Other noteworthy outreach activities include curriculum development, brokerage of expertise, public outreach, and liaison with relevant R&D projects. Furthermore, PASCAL2 has adopted an open membership policy allowing for active inclusion in Network activities, of researchers working at non-beneficiary institutions.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"216886","fundValue":"7782940","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
