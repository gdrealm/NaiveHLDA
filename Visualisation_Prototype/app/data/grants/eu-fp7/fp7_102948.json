{"id":"102948","title":"Synchronization in heterogeneous Networks","abstractText":"'In most realistic networked systems where synchronization is relevant, strong  synchronization may also be related to pathological activities such as epileptic seizures and  Parkinson disease in neural networks, to extinction in ecology, and social catastrophes in epidemic spreading.   Recent experiments have revealed that various levels of synchronization are needed  to avoid pathological activities and enable a system to have flexibility and robustness. Despite the growing   interest in network dynamics, the present state of knowledge cannot explain the various levels of synchronization observed in real-life complex systems.\n\nA fundamental goal of this project is the development of a theory for  emergence spontaneous of synchronization in heterogeneous networks of interacting  dynamical systems.  A core intention is to determine how the network ability to complement  various levels of stable synchronization depends on the network structural parameters  such as degree distribution and spectral properties of the graph.  These results play a vital  role towards the ultimate goal of understanding the emerging spontaneous collective motion  in complex systems.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"303180","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"2013-02-15","fundEnd":"2015-02-14","dataset":"fp7"}
