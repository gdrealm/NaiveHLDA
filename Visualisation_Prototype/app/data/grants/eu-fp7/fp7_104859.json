{"id":"104859","title":"Transversal Multilinear Harmonic Analysis","abstractText":"'This proposal consists of two intimately related programmes. The aim of Programme 1 is to make major contributions to the celebrated restriction theory for the Fourier transform and combinatorial problems of Kakeya-type using emerging multilinear techniques. The aim of Programme 2 is to develop a multilinear perspective on a much broader family of curvature-related problems in harmonic analysis, including important classes of Radon-like transforms that arise naturally in the theory of dispersive partial differential equations.\n\nThe specific objectives represent major challenges at the emerging frontiers of harmonic analysis with a variety of disciplines, including geometric analysis (encompassing heat-flow methods and convex geometry), affine geometry and algebraic topology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"307617","fundValue":"1042293","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
