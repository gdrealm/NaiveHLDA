{"id":"108244","title":"Advanced SuperConducting devices for ENhanced infrared Detection (ASCEND)","abstractText":"'This Marie Curie Fellowship proposal is aimed at developing a novel type of infrared single photon detector to meet the stringent requirements of advanced imaging, quantum communications and remote sensing applications. This will be achieved by exploiting the potential of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) when detecting infrared photons of energy below 1eV. Excellent signal-to-noise ratio and timing resolution can currently be achieved in small single pixel SNSPDs of typical area 10 x 10 square micrometres. This small area is a severe practical limitation for real applications and my proposal is targeted at addressing this central challenge. I aim to realize single pixel SNSPD having both large active area and high performance, via a parallel nanowire design, and to use them in an array configuration to cover active areas hundreds of micrometres across. This Fellowship will be a decisive step forward in my own career as an independent scientist.  This programme has multidisciplinary applications in single photon detection and is certainly of strong interest to end-users in both academia and industry.\n\nThe objectives of this plan can be summarized as follows:\n1.\tTo develop next generation single pixel SNSPDs with large active area and high quantum efficiency via optical cavity and parallel nanowire designs.\n2.\tTo integrate, for the first time, multiple detectors into a practical arrayed infrared receiver system with large active area for use in advanced imaging, communication, and remote sensing applications.\n\nThis programme will be supported by the excellent research environment provided by the host, ï¿½This programme will supported by the excellent research environment provided by the host, Professor Robert Hadfield, at the University of Glasgow, UK, with state-of-the-art facilities for single photon detector development and testing.  This programme also will benefit from the strong links between the host group and leading UK and international research groups who have a strong stake in this future technology.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"327846","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
