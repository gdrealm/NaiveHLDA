{"id":"102824","title":"Electrical Power Control � More Electric Aircraft","abstractText":"'Systems for Green Operation (SGO) WP1 will deliver a V&V Plan on how European industry can support and de-risk Airbus in their work in SGO WP4 on a comprehensive ground demonstration ahead of a flight demo. This de-risk and support will also include inputs from SGO WP2.3 on Technology Adaptation.\n\nELPOC will directly support Airbus in SGO WP4.2 Ground Demonstration.SPUK will make extensive use of technology development hardware, engineering capabilities and facilities from previous R&T projects, principally EU MOET, UK AMES.\n\nSPUK will work with Airbus throughout ELPOC�s planned 51 months duration. In its initial stages the project will have a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) addressing the Architecture Options available (power system 230VAC VF, /-270VDC � generation, conversion, useage; emulation of major electrical loads including a programmable inertia rig for engine start and icing protection technologies).\n\nSPUK will set up a basic emulation of an aircraft essential power buss, and use this as an environment to conduct a series of specific trade off studies in key power electronic control technologies � to progress the Airbus activity on top level power system optimisation for a complete aircraft. The PDR will determine a definitive list of these key electronic technologies. SPUK is proposing: Power Density (kW/kg); Efficiency; Switching Strategy; Control Strategies; Topology of Transistor/Diode Options; Forced Air Cooling (deletion of liquid circuit).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"267210","fundValue":"991020","fundStart":"2011-06-06","fundEnd":"2015-09-05","dataset":"fp7"}
