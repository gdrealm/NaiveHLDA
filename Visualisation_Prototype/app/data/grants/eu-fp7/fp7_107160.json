{"id":"107160","title":"Real-time adaptive networked control of rescue robots","abstractText":"'The network consists of 2 EU universities, 1 EU research centre, 2 Chinese universities and 1 Chinese research centre. This project aims to foster new partnerships, in particular with the research institutes in China and to reinforce the existing collaborations. The project has two aims - S&T aim and international knowledge transfer aim to create an international consortium in robotics for rescue and recovery operations. The S&T aim is to investigate the challenges in the rescue and recovery operations and design/develop a novel autonomous hybrid legged-wheeled robot with a high payload, large force and ability to adapt to uncertain environments. The knowledge transfer aim is to create a long term, sustainable and strategic partnership so as to reinforce theoretical, technical and practical skills of researchers from both EU and China in robotics. The EU partners who are good at computational intelligence, modelling, control, 3D virtual simulation, and software development will learn experimental skills in the world-class robotics research labs in China, while the Chinese partners who are good at hardware developments and mechatronics design will learn research methodologies and cultures at the EU partnersï¿½ labs. Therefore the project is expected to provide solid foundations to create long term research collaboration.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"318902","fundValue":"310800","fundStart":"2012-07-02","fundEnd":"2016-07-01","dataset":"fp7"}
