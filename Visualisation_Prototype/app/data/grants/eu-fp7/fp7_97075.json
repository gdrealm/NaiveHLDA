{"id":"97075","title":"Aquatic Technology Linked to A Novel Treatment of Invasive Species","abstractText":"'The development of a Ballast Water Treatment (BWT) system, that will efficiently target and incapacitate a full spectrum of marine organisms <50�m.\nThe introduction of invasive marine species into new environments from discharge of ships� ballast water has been identified as the 4th largest threat to the world�s oceans. The UN�s International Maritime Organisation has adopted a convention for a mandatory BWT system on both new and existing ships by 2016.\nUnlike other forms of marine pollution, such as oil spills, where ameliorative action can be taken and from which the environment will eventually recover, the impacts of invasive marine species are often irreversible. In addition, with 80% of the world�s commodities transported by sea, there is an environmental and commercial need to develop an effective solution to the dispersal of untreated ballast water.\nIn the proposed Atlantis project, we intend to research and develop a BWT system using multi-biocidal delivery technology. This will efficiently target and incapacitate a full spectrum of marine organisms <50�m.\nWe propose to develop a high surface-area substrate with multi-functional surface properties, enabling multiple biocides to be incorporated. This substrate will be designed into a filter bed that the entire volume of ballast water must pass through. Therefore, treatment of the ballast water happens as it moves through the high concentration of biocides held within the filter bed. As the biocides are held within the substrate, they can work effectively together, incapacitating the full spectrum of flora and fauna, whilst significantly reducing the amount of biocides released in the ballast system.\nThis project will be conducted by an EC based SME consortium supported by two RTD�s, who will work towards developing a market leading system that could generate sales in excess of �80 million in 5 years after the project ends and increase profits across the SME consortium.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"262612","fundValue":"1207269.6","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
