{"id":"96060","title":"Novel catalytic function in a TIM-barrel scaffold","abstractText":"'The TIM-barrel fold is the most widely found in nature, making up about 6% of the structures in the Protein Data Bank, and has been found in nature to catalyse reactions from five of the six EC classes. These facts all indicate the extraordinary capacity of the TIM-barrel as a reaction container, and suggest that it may be a versatile starting scaffold into which new catalytic capability can be engineered. In this research programme we will use directed evolution approaches, including state-of-the-art gene shuffling techniques developed in the Hollfelder lab at the University of Cambridge to tengineer novel catalytic function into a TIM-barrel scaffold.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"255500","fundValue":"174240.8","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
