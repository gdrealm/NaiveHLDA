{"id":"96961","title":"Problems in Extremal Graph Theory","abstractText":"'Graph theory is a modern branch of mathematics that has developed during the 20th century. Graphs allow us to model real life situations such as social networks, telecommunication networks or road networks. In order to fully understand which are the most relevent properties for graphs, one has to investigate how different properties of graphs interact. This is the core of extremal graph theory. One very natural question in the field is what parameters enforce the existence of a given particular subgraph. More generally, embedding problems seek sufficient condition a graph (or digraph) needs to have in order to contain a given subgraph. Roughly speaking Ramsey theory states that `complete disorder is impossible&apos;. In many cases, this means that if a structure which is arbitrarily partitioned in several pieces, a specific substructure is completely contained in one of these pieces. Within the project, we aim to solve several important problems in the above areas using probabilistic techniques such as the Regularity lemma.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253925","fundValue":"165540.8","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-02","dataset":"fp7"}
