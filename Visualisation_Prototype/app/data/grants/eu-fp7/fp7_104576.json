{"id":"104576","title":"Transient Analysis of Exotic Materials for Electromagnetics","abstractText":"'Simulating the interaction of electromagnetic interaction  plays a centrol role in the design of new, exotic materials for use in electronic, photonic, and optical systems. In order to design these systems subject to all technical and economic constraints, broad band information on their behaviour is indispensable. Moreover, modern exotic materials and the devices in which they are used can exhibit nonlinear behaviour. This leaves transient (i.e. time domain) simulation the only viable option.\n\nThe aim of this project is the development of a design methodology and the corresponding software tools for the exotic electromagnetic materials for use in photonics, transformation optics, biomedical imaging, and nano-technology.\n\nThis project is innovative because it will enable for the first time (i) the design of nonlinear exotic electromagnetic materials, (ii) the design of devices comprising both regions containing uniform and regions containing non-uniform exotic materials, (iii) the design of exotic materials of size and complexity as encountered in practical situations, and (iv) the deployment during the design process of computing infrastructure that is heterogenous and unreliable, allowing the use of more affordable hardware and leading to true scalability.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"321755","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
