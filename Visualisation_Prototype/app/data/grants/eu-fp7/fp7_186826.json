{"id":"186826","title":"Nanoscale Organisation and Dynamics of Ionic Networks at Biological Interfaces","abstractText":"'In solution, ions tend to accumulate near charged surfaces and form an electrostatic double layer. The ionic density of the double layer is generally well understood, but little is known about the lateral organization of the ions at the surface. The existence of ordered ionic networks could have dramatic consequences for interfacial processes, for example in charges and molecules transfer. In biology and soft matter, ions networks would also affect the mechanical properties of interfaces and could help re-shape the cell. Recent developments in the field of atomic force microscopy have made it possible to image single ions on surfaces and study the formation of organized networks over tens of nanometres with molecular precision. NanoOrder investigates the formation of such structures at model bio-interfaces, in solution. The aim of this interdisciplinary project is to unravel the mechanisms that allow soft bio-membranes to control complex ionic networks through their molecular organization and physical properties.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"631186","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
