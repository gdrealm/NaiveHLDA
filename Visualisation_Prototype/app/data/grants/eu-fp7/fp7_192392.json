{"id":"192392","title":"WILLIAM HARVEY INTERNATIONAL TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH ACADEMY","abstractText":"'WHRI-ACADEMY is a new fellowship programme which will maximise the career development of the next generation of translational multidisciplinary researchers geared toward therapeutic innovation across rapidly developing and integrated life sciences and health care disciplines. This is a new transnational fellowship programme which has been organised with 15 partner organisations in the EU and Third Countries.  The partner organisations have been selected on the basis of their excellence in post doctoral training and development, outstanding infrastructure, high scientific prominence and high intensity of innovation activities. The key aspects of the programme are:-\n\n� truly worldwide collaborative opportunities for fellows in both academic and industrial environments\n� partner organisations who will host the fellows both within and outside the EU thus providing mobility opportunities for fellows to and from a wide geographical area\n� a transnational inter-sectorial exchange dimension between academia and SMEs to enable academic research fellows try an SME working environment without a gap in their academic careers\n� an incoming mobility component to enable top-class Third Country fellows from emerging economies to be hosted in Europe to both enhance competition and to establish mutually-beneficial research cooperation\n� a reintegration component to counter the brain drain of European researchers to Third Countries\n\nThe focal point of the programme is the career development of the individual research fellows.  The programme is characterised by transparency and openness, granting the fellow freedom to choose the research project, host organisation and host supervisor. Guided by a personal career development plan, a one-to-one mentorship programme and reintegration opportunities, WHRI-ACADEMY provides a comprehensive programme of support for the research fellow to embark on a long-term scientific career which responds to changing market needs.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"608765","fundValue":"16222002.5","fundStart":"2014-01-02","fundEnd":"2019-01-01","dataset":"fp7"}
