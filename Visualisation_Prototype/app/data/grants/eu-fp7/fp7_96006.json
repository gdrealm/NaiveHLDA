{"id":"96006","title":"Polarisation Impairments Mitigations in Fibre Raman Effect Assisted Systems","abstractText":"'The polarisation impairments are among major factors limiting increase of transmission rates and overall capacity of next generation of optical networks. Strong demand in extended bandwidth and ultra-high bit-rates of the future communication systems for the broadcasting media and telecommunications has put into the focus of intensive research mitigation of the polarisation impairments and wideband communication solutions based on fibre Raman amplification. Broadband quasi-lossless fibre span with simultaneous spatial and spectral transparency has recently been demonstrated by the group from Aston University. Implementation of this technology in ultra-high bit-rate communication systems requires mitigation of polarisation impairments, e.g. polarisation dependent gain. All existing polarisation dependent gain mitigation schemes are rather expensive (polarisation multiplexing of pump laser diodes, application of a depolariser) or not very effective (backward pumping) in the case of low polarisation mode dispersion fibres. This project offers novel approaches based on fibre spinning to suppress polarisation impairments in high-speed long-haul communication systems with a particular focus on the transmission schemes using quasi-lossless fibre spans. The proposed numerical modelling techniques can be applied in a range of applications of Raman technologies, for instance, in Raman lasers and frequency converters, long-cavity mode-locked fibre lasers, Raman-effect based distributed sensors and others. The applicant�s skills in advanced modelling of polarisation effects and impairments and the host institution�s expertise in high-speed communications and Raman technologies are complimentary to each other. The proposed research programme will result in the development of novel vector dynamic model of fibre Raman amplifiers and lasers and experimental techniques for the design and characterisation of the new generation of high-speed high-capacity communication systems.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253297","fundValue":"238789.6","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
