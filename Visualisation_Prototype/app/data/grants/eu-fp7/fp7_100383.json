{"id":"100383","title":"A wireless network with autonomously powered and active long range acoustic nodes for total structural health monitoring of bridges","abstractText":"'Wireless sensor networks have been identified as a research priority by the European Technology Platform on Smart Systems Integration (EPoSS). Recognising this, the SME's in this Project are seeking EC funding to develop a prototype wide-area wireless sensor network with autonomous nodes containing non-destructive (NDT) sensors, for structural health monitoring (SHM) of large structures, specifically bridges and vessels in petrochemical plant. They have formed a consortium with expertise in a range of technologies needed to optimise solutions and develop this innovative new product.\nThe aim is to develop an NDT node that is autonomous and self-configuring for optimal performance, and requires no maintenance over its operating life. The nodes will be packaged for reliable operation in hazardous environments and will rely on energy harvesting to provide long-term power supply. The wireless communications will allow simple place-and-play usability. The NDT techniques to be implemented are long range ultrasonics for global monitoring of a structure, ACFM for local surface corrosion and cracks, pulse-echo ultrasonics for internal corrosion and tip diffraction ultrasonics for internal cracks. The prototype will show scalability up to very large structures.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"283283","fundValue":"1502259.27","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
