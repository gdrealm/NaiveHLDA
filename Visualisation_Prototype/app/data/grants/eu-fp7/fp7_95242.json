{"id":"95242","title":"Design of New Engineered Oxide Thin Films with Tailored Properties","abstractText":"'Development of new energy conversion technologies are a prime concern for the EU. To achieve low emissions and high efficiencies new materials advances are required. Research on new oxide materials with both high ionic and electronic conductivity (MIEC: mixed ionic and electronic conductors) is of key importance in order to achieve optimum performance in electrochemical energy conversion devices such as solid oxide fuel cells, gas sensors, oxygen membrane generators and catalytic oxidation systems. Particularly, in these applications there is a major interest in reducing the working temperatures to about 600 ï¿½C. Control over the electronic and ionic conductivity of the MIEC material, as well as the oxygen surface exchange kinetics is therefore a crucial issue. We propose to study several very promising MIEC ceramic materials, from both the Ruddlesden-Popper Ln2NiO4x (Ln = Nd, Sm, Pr) family and the layered cobaltite (GdBaCo2O5x) family. Both families of compounds have anisotropic ionic and electronic transport properties, and therefore in order to extract information about their intrinsic anisotropic properties, single crystals and epitaxial thin films will be measured. In addition we will study new engineered layered oxide thin films materials with different heterointerfaces, which very recently have attracted increasing interest due to some outstanding results which include high ionic conductivity and oxygen exchange enhancement. Once these studies have been performed we will try to design new engineered thin films by using perovskite layers and rock-salt type layers as building blocks to control nanostructures with optimized tailored properties. In addition, the study of the variation of these properties for films submitted to different stress will enable innovation that will be of interest in designing new MIEC materials with enhanced performance for different types of advanced electrochemical devices, of great importance in the changing energy economy.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"252711","fundValue":"172740.8","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-02","dataset":"fp7"}
