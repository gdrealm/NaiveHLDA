{"id":"105076","title":"Integrated Approaches to Food Allergen and Allergy Risk Management","abstractText":"'Up to 20 million European citizens suffer from food allergy. However management of both food allergy (by patients and health practitioners) and allergens (by industry) is thwarted by lack of evidence to either prevent food allergy developing or protect adequately those who are already allergic. iFAAM will develop evidence-based approaches and tools for MANAGEMENT of ALLERGENS in FOOD and integrate knowledge derived from their application and new knowledge from intervention studies into FOOD ALLERGY MANAGEMENT plans and dietary advice. The resulting holistic strategies will reduce the burden of food allergies in Europe and beyond, whilst enabling the European food industry to compete in the global market place.\nOur approach will build on e-Health concepts to allow full exploitation of complex data obtained from the work in this proposal and previous and ongoing studies, maximising sharing and linkage of data, by developing an informatics platform �Allerg-e-lab�. This will enable us to\n(1)\tExtend and integrate existing cohorts from observation and intervention studies to provide evidence as to how maternal diet and infant feeding practices (including weaning) modulate the patterns and prevalence of allergies across Europe\n(2)\tEstablish risk factors for the development of severe reactions to food and identify associated biomarkers\n(3)\tDevelop a clinically-validated tiered risk assessment and evidence-based risk management approach for food allergens for allergens in the food chain\n(4)\tDevelop clinically-relevant multi-analyte methods of analysis suited to allergen management across the food chain\n\nStakeholders will be integrated into iFAAM to deliver harmonised integrated approaches, including RISK ASSESSORS AND MANAGERS managing population risk, the FOOD INDUSTRY who manage allergens to ensure consumer safety, HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS to provide food allergy management plans and dietary advice and ALLERGIC CONSUMERS to manage individual risk.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"312147","fundValue":"12161314.56","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
