{"id":"102648","title":"A High-Throughput Approach for Chemical Reactivity Profiling and Physical Organic Chemistry","abstractText":"'This research proposal challenges current philosophy in reaction analysis in that it offers a HT approach to the generation of reaction\nparameters orders of magnitude faster than those currently used; although offering data that is as accurate and as robust (if not more so)\nthan traditional methods. The aims of this proposal are to initially undertake a systematic and quantitative evaluation of a simple test cases\ninvolving relative amino acid coupling rates before extending studies into the area of nucleophilicity in association with solvent effects but with analysis in an entirely self-consistent and self-correcting manner, Subsequently, the studies would be extended to an\nanalysis of Buchwald-Hartwig based chemistries and a series of phenols and anilines with the focus on Hammett based analysis of coupling partners. Such an approach will have many practical applications. Thus it will allow the chemistry/activity of new monomers to be determined before application in library synthesis, besides offering an understanding of the suitability of existing monomers in library based SNAr chemistries, and the global analysis of coupling reagents with all amino acid coupling partners.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"298588","fundValue":"209033.4","fundStart":"no date","fundEnd":"no date","dataset":"fp7"}
