{"id":"105758","title":"\"Integrated Thermal Energy Reduction, Recovery & Re-use in Autoclave based Composites Processing\"","abstractText":"'Our Idea is to develop an integrated, computer controlled, heat recovery, reuse & thermal energy management system centred on the autoclave with re-use of thermal energy in the post-cure ovens or autoclaves, and possibly in the clean room air filtration/cooling system. The proposed system will extract heat from the autoclave to match existing cooling rates that are specified by material manufacturers. The heat will be stored in a specially designed thermal store at the highest enthalpy possible to maximise opportunities for re-use. We aim to reduce initial energy use in the autoclave by at least 25% through reduction of the autoclave headspace and recover 50% of the energy wasted at the end of the autoclave processing stage for re-use in other energy intensive heating processes such as the post cure process. In addition, we aim to recover compressed air (with its intrinsic compression energy and heat from the autoclave) and heat from the air compressors that create the 7 to 10 bar pressure and integrate this with the system.\n\nOur proposed technology would have a major impact on end-users and the environment. In summary we could achieve energy savings of 639,000 kWhr per system p.a; equating to ï¿½66,000 in end-user increased gross profit potential per system p.a. and would reduce CO2 emissions by 318 Tonnes p.a.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"315177","fundValue":"1445786.8","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
