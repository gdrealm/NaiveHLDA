{"id":"101636","title":"Resource-Efficient Factory Of Recyclable Manufacturing composite components","abstractText":"'REFORM focuses on more resource-efficiency and cleaner manufacturing technologies for composite components to be exploited in different industrial sectors (e.g. Transport, Energy, Construction, ..). Fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are becoming very popular as their use reduces weight and allow innovative designs for energy-saving products during service-life. Nevertheless, service-life does not represent the total solution. A total life cycle view must be taken including manufacturing and end of life reuse, recyclability and/or disposal.\nThe central idea of REFORM is to focus on the manufacturing processes of FRP components considering, with an holistic view, the whole manufacturing cycle.\nThe environmental friendly process technologies for Forming, Machining (cutting & trimming), Assembly and Recycling are specifically considered, as well methods to integrate the proposed technologies into the eco-factory of the future.\nREFORM considers specific RTD and Demonstration activities capable to provide  advances towards full green economically viable manufacturing.'","grantUrl":"http://reform.eu.com/","grantId":"283336","fundValue":"7090917.05","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
