{"id":"102961","title":"Quantum secure communication for mobile networks","abstractText":"This project will realise a proof of concept quantum secure communication system for mobile networks and establish the commercial viability of this system. Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure transmission of a secret key by encoding information in single photons such that any eavesdropping can be detected. There are several commercial companies that sell quantum secure communication networks that are used by big corporations and government agencies; we aim to expand this into the consumer market and mobile communications networks. The system would allow a user to generate a secure key on their mobile phone or similar device via communication with a bank teller machine or similar facility that could then be used to secure future communications of any type of data. As the volume and variety of private and financial information that gets transmitted from smartphones increases so does the need to secure that information. This proof of concept project will establish the potential markets and commercial viability of a mobile quantum security system.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"297408","fundValue":"167508","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
