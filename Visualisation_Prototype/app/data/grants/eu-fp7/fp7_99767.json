{"id":"99767","title":"Photon and Neutron Data - Open Data Infrastructure","abstractText":"The PaN-data collaboration brings together eleven large multidisciplinary Research Infrastructures which operates hundreds of instruments used by over 30,000 scientists each year. They support fields as varied as physics, chemistry, biology, material sciences, energy technology, environmental science, medical technology and cultural heritage. Applications are numerous, for example, crystallography can reveal the structures of viruses and proteins important for the development of new drugs; neutron scattering can identify stresses within engineering components such as turbine blades, and tomography can image microscopic details of the 3D-structure of the brain. Industrial users include the pharmaceutical, petrochemical and microelectronic industries.nnPaNdata-ODI will develop, deploy and operate an Open Data Infrastructure across the participating facilities with user and data services which support the tracing of provenance of data, preservation, and scalability through parallel access. It will be instantiated through three virtual laboratories supporting powder diffraction, small angle scattering and tomography.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"283556","fundValue":"3745301","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
