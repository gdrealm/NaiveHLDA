{"id":"91171","title":"\"Public Perception of Genetically modified Animals - Science, Utility and Society\"","abstractText":"'PEGASUS aims to provide policy support regarding the development, implementation and commercialisation of GM animals, and derivative foods. The results will contribute to the FP7 KBBE by integrating existing social, (including existing public perception) environmental and economic knowledge regarding GM animals. The use of GM in farmed animals (aquatic and terrestrial) will be reviewed. A foresight exercise will be conducted to predict future developments. Two case studies  (1 aquatic, 1 terrestrial) will be applied to identify the pro�s and con�s of GM animals from the perspectives of the production chain (economics, agri-food sector) and the life sciences (human and animal health, environmental impact, animal welfare, sustainable production). Ethical and policy concerns will be refined through application of combined ethical matrix and policy workshops involving EU and non-EU stakeholders. The case studies will be used to demonstrate best practice in public engagement in the policy process. The activities will provide European policy support regarding GM animals and the foods derived from them, taking into account public perceptions, the competitiveness of EU animal production, and risk-benefit assessments linked with human and animal health, environmental impact, and sustainable production.  A final stakeholder dissemination workshop will disseminate the results to the EU policy community.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"226465","fundValue":"1170968","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","dataset":"fp7"}
