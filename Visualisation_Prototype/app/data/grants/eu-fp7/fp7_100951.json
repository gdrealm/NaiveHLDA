{"id":"100951","title":"Higher dimensional general relativity: explicit solutions and the classification and stability of black holes","abstractText":"'Higher-dimensional General Relativity (GR) is well-motivated by string theory e.g. via the gauge/gravity correspondence or scenarios that predict black hole production at the Large Hadron Collider. In this proposal it is regarded as a self-contained mathematical subject that extends conventional 4d GR. It is known that higher-dimensional GR exhibits qualitative differences from 4d GR, especially for black holes,\ne.g. there exist 'black ring' solutions describing rotating, donut-shaped black holes. It is likely that there are many other interesting solutions. This project will investigate the following topics in higher-dimensional GR: 1. Methods for obtaining explicit solutions of the Einstein equation, especially those based on algebraic classification of the Weyl tensor; 2. Classical stability of black holes; 3. Classification of black hole\nsolutions: What data is required to specify uniquely black hole solutions? What are the allowed topologies and symmetries of black holes?'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"279363","fundValue":"1337044","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","dataset":"fp7"}
