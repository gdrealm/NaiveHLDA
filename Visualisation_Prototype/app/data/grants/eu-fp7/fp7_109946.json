{"id":"109946","title":"Forging Online Education through FIRE","abstractText":"Forging Online Education through FIRE (FORGE) is a project proposal bringing the FIRE and eLearning worlds together. FORGE will align FIRE with the ongoing education revolution for mutual benefit. In particular, this project is concerned with specifying development methodologies and best practices for offering FIRE experimentation facilities to learners and to the learning community in general, related both to communications and IT but also to other disciplines including the sciences and social sciences, leading to a strong connection between the learning community and existing FIRE platforms and supporting tools. The learning community will benefit from the use of the very high performance facilities. FIRE will benefit through the addition of an ever-growing set of FIRE-specific learning materials for an increasing number of FIRE-based students, leading to increased awareness and use.nWithin the FORGE project we will:n� Study and develop new processes and approaches to online learning based on the integration of FIRE facilities and eLearning technologies.n� Inject into the higher education learning sphere the FIRE portfolio of facilities and tools.n� Introduce the learning community to the concepts of Experimentally Driven Research.n� Increase the overall accessibility and usability of FIRE facilities through the layering of how-to-use resources over the FIRE platforms.nThe FORGE project believes that it is the right time for students, especially those at higher education institutes, to become familiar with FIRE's portfolio. Most FIRE platforms and tools are already sufficiently mature to be used by end-users and thus can be introduced seamlessly to current student curricula. Moreover, by targeting students we are aiming at the next-generation future-internet facilities users who having learnt through FIRE facilities will be enthusiastic future FIRE users. By investing in students, FORGE is creating a path for FIRE's long-term sustainability.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"610889","fundValue":"2413870","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
