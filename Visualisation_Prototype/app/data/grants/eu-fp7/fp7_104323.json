{"id":"104323","title":"CONSTRUCTION OF BESPOKE EVALUATION POWER MODULES~(MATPLAN)","abstractText":"'The objective of this proposal is to develop double side cooled packaging solutions for semiconductors eliminating the use of inherently unreliable aluminium wire bonds and replacing with seamless contacting techniques to either side of the active semiconductor thereby providing a very reliable low thermal resistance,low inductance contact . The solutions developed using innovative additive laser machining and lost wax techniques will be applicable to not only todays active components but tomorrows.Theconstructional methods developed to package the active\ndevices will be inherently low cost compared to those associated with todays double side cooled structures. The double side cooled structures emanating out of this project will be extremely manufacturable and will offer the ultimate in longterm reliability required by the aerospace industry and will facilitate the use of higher temeprature devices operating at higher current densities and frequencies i.e SiC. In the event of system over currents the devices designed within the project are intended to fail short circuit . The ability for Europe to have an indigenous semiconductor supplier able to supply advanced components packaged in a unique thermal efficient, compact and reliable manner will give the EUs systems suppliers a significant competitive edge in aerospace and other advanced applications. A 10KW silicon carbide inverter based on specification supplied by the SGOs is envisaged.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"304851","fundValue":"246424","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
