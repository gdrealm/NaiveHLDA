{"id":"103390","title":"Quantitative modelling of sustainable supply chains under major disruptions","abstractText":"'The purpose of this project is to advance knowledge and management practice on supply chain approaches to managing sustainability and responding to natural disruption. Three dimensions are used in literature to categorize sustainability: social, environmental and economic. Sustainable enterprise management can be understood as a decision-making process looking to simultaneously achieve goals on these three dimensions. Among them, this project intends to present a formal methodology to measure only the environmental impact of operational decisions when natural disasters affect the defined synergy of supply chains. Our focus is on globalized supply chain networks for manufacturing of goods. These are prone to high levels of turbulence and uncertainty since the customer order fulfilment process is no longer controlled by a single integrated organization, but by a number of decentralized and independent firms collaborating together: this has contributed to enhanced risks and vulnerabilities in the supply chain. The research will use conceptualization and theoretical modelling, and a mix-method approach of combining quantitative techniques (optimization, computer simulation) with qualitative techniques (interviews/questionnaires in case studies) involving real-world organizations. This proposal is unique in that it focuses on developing a combined measure of sustainable responsive performance within a global supply chain context.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"299255","fundValue":"278807.4","fundStart":"2013-03-25","fundEnd":"2015-03-24","dataset":"fp7"}
