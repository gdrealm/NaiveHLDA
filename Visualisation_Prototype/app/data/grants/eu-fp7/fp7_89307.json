{"id":"89307","title":"Marine Ecosystem Evolution in a Changing Environment","abstractText":"'MEECE is a scientific research project which aims to use a combination of data synthesis, numerical simulation and targeted experimentation to further our knowledge of how marine ecosystems will respond to combinations of multiple climate change and anthropogenic drivers. With an emphasis on the European Marine Strategy (EMS), MEECE will improve the decision support tools to provide a structured link between management questions and the knowledge base that can help to address those questions. A strong knowledge transfer element will provide an effective means of communication between end-users and scientists.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"212085","fundValue":"8577985.11","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
