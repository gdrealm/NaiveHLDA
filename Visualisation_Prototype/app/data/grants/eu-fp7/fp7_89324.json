{"id":"89324","title":"Strategic pan-European ballistics intelligence platform for combating organised crime and terrorism","abstractText":"The threat from organised crime and terrorism can undermine the democratic and economic basis of societies through the diversion of investment into crime, money laundering and corruption by international cartels, organised gang culture and corruption. The result is often a weakening of institutions, an undermined economy and a loss of confidence in the rule of law. This project will undertake research to create and develop secure interoperable situation awareness platform for the EU to combat organised crime and terrorism.\n\nThe project will use technical (non-personal) ballistics data and crime information initially but will also demonstrate how migration to other data sources can take place. The project will automatically combine data from disparate high volume data repositories for cross correlation and automated (and semi-automated) analysis with data from different cultural/domains with multiple reference models using real-time data feeds and historical databases. Intelligence will be extracted using advanced semantic knowledge extraction and data-mining to facilitate appropriate, fast and responsible decision making and alerts. The platform will develop and demonstrate a trust management and security system, controlled access and an automated reporting tool for cost effective operations as well as providing the policing of existing information systems.\n\nThe platform will enhance mutual co-operation, security and sustainability across the EU and is supported by EUROPOL, the police and other end users as a being urgently required. The project will develop new EU standards, new Intellectual Property and commercialisation opportunities for the benefit of the EU. The work will involve the use of cutting edge science and technological methods and develop new research agendas for future work.\n\n","grantUrl":"http://odyssey-project.eu","grantId":"218237","fundValue":"3848383","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
