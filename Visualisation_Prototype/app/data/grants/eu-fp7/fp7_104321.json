{"id":"104321","title":"Marine inspired biosilica-filled hydrogels","abstractText":"'This IOF fellowship merges together two unique concepts toward a common goal, which can have significant benefit to the end users ï¿½ the patients.  It investigates the potential of a less invasive approach to surgeries through the use of injectable biosilica-filled adhesive hydrogels comprised of a sustainable biosilica phase and a marine inspired adhesive hydrogel.  The IOF fellowship is with Northwestern University and will also open up new avenues of research, with new approaches to established problems, and access to additional equipment and facilities for our group, thus adding value to the work.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"302494","fundValue":"229004.25","fundStart":"2012-07-11","fundEnd":"2015-03-13","dataset":"fp7"}
