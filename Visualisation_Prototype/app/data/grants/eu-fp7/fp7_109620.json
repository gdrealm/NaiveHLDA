{"id":"109620","title":"Organocatalytic synthesis of fluorine compounds. Development of new methodologies for the enantioselective introduction of fluorine building blocks via CH activation of sp3 carbon","abstractText":"'The Project will deal with the activation of inert Csp3-H bonds and the enantioselective addition of fluorocarbon nucleophiles to lead to the enantioselective synthesis of fluorinated compounds. The impact of the research will be highly significant to several areas. First of all, a general method for a green and enantioselective synthesis of fluorine compounds through Csp3-H activation will represent a ground-breaking advance in the field and will interest organic chemists in general from both academic and industrial backgrounds. The development of new a green procedure that avoid the use of metals, and diminishes the generation of waste will have an important impact to chemical industry. Moreover the possibility to add a fluorine block in later stages synthesis through Csp3-H activation will be an important tool in the hit to led process in pharmaceutical industry, due the possibility to enhance the metabolic properties of active compounds by simply adding a fluorine residue.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"618237","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
