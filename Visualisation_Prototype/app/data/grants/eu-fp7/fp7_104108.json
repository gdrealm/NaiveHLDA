{"id":"104108","title":"Perspectives of Conflict Transformation from the Middle East and Europe","abstractText":"'The Perspectives of Conflict Transformation from the Middle East and Europe project aims to enhance understanding and knowledge of conflict transformation through collaborative research and capacity building activities among the Universities of Coventry (CPRS), Kadir Has (KHU) in Istanbul and the Arab American University in Jenin (AAUJ). The objectives are: to identify appropriate conflict transformation strategies and methods for protracted armed conflicts; to examine the ways and which youth could contribute to peacebuilding positively; to build a network of expertise on conflict transformation in the Middle East through workshops, conferences and other activities: to provide opportunities for research on cutting-edge peacebuilding issues for postgraduate students\n\nThe project adopts a cross-cultural and community centred approach to identify the conflict transformation mechanisms used in Turkey and Palestine, and what they would mean to our understanding of conflict transformation in the West. Communities and youth are often marginalized from conflict transformation and peacebuilding processes despite the fact that their contribution is vital to ensure such processes succeed.\n\nThe four components of the project are designed to complement each other. The research will be conducted in the UK, Turkey and the Palestinian Administered Areas over a three year period by ERs and ESRs. Findings will be shared among the partners and disseminated through a series of high profile international conferences involving key actors and stakeholders and academic and policy orientated publications. The collaboration provides the opportunity for all partners to strengthen and extend their networks. The ESRs will benefit from research training through organized courses and supervision from ERs and from the opportunity to travel and work with a wider range of people in an international context.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"295036","fundValue":"159600","fundStart":"2012-06-03","fundEnd":"2015-06-02","dataset":"fp7"}
