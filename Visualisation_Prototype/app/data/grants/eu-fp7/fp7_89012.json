{"id":"89012","title":"DYNamics of Architecturally COmplex Polymers","abstractText":"'The scientific objective of DYNACOP is to obtain a fundamental understanding of the flow behaviour and the dynamics of blends of topologically complex macromolecular fluids and their role in processing and properties of blends.  These materials exhibit complex dynamics and rheology and, in many cases, show hierarchical relaxation over many different timescales.  This in turn affects the processing and properties of the final materials.  In order to rationally design appropriate materials and processes for various technological applications, a rigorous, knowledge based approach is needed. This is especially urgent in the face of current opportunities offered by tailored molecular engineering of polymers at the industrial scale, and the proposed use of these materials in nano-structured composites for smart applications in devices, electronics ad high-performance applications.  The training objective of the proposed action is to provide young post-doctoral researchers with the necessary interdisciplinary knowledge and experience in the field of soft materials properties, much needed throughout Europe, which will allow them to address some of the many scientific and technological challenges in the field.  This will first and foremost be achieved through a collaborative research program and portfolio of training courses intimately linking industry and academia. To ensure fruitful collaborations, the participating research groups will work around a limited number of model systems; exchange the samples, and apply to them the techniques and/ or theoretical approaches developed in the different laboratories. The research groups are selected in order to obtain the needed synergy, as they have different backgrounds/expertise, in physics, chemical engineering, chemistry and materials science. 6 Very high profile international visiting scientists, bringing their uniques expertise to Europe, will participate in the training and research.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"214627","fundValue":"3493688.76","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
