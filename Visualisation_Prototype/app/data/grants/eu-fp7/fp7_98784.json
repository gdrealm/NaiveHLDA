{"id":"98784","title":"CULTURAL CHANGE AND HUSBANDRY DEVELOPMENT IN EUROPE: ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FROM THE IRON AGE � ROMAN TRANSITION IN IBERIA AND BRITAIN","abstractText":"'Livestock has been one of the main productive activities in Europe since the introduction of domestic mammals around 8000BP. The study of animal remains from archaeological sites provides reliable information on eating and husbandry changes resulting from population growth and social complexification processes. The Iron Age to Roman transition represents a very interesting case study, as it is associated with a change from �close� or �regional� economies to a centralized �world socio-economic system�. Although the existing evidence for diet and livestock improvement during the Iron Age and Roman transition is intriguing, little comparative research has been possible in Europe due to the lack of detailed published data. This project will provide original work and a survey of the species and products exploited in different European areas, using Iberia as the key case study and Britain as a comparative example.  The results will provide a comprehensive picture of the husbandry strategies adopted in Iberia and Britain in the context of a demographic change occurring at a pan-European scale.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"271921","fundValue":"210092.8","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-01","dataset":"fp7"}
