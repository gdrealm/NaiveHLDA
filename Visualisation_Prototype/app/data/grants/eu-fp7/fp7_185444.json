{"id":"185444","title":"High Precision Simulation of particle collisions at the LHC","abstractText":"'The recent discovery of a Higgs-boson like resonance at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is a major landmark in the quest to understand the fundamental nature of the Universe. Precise measurements of the properties of the new boson are now mandatory and must be reflected in a similar quest for higher precision from the theory side. We aim to meet this challenge by developing a theoretical framework together with suitable high-precision tools that will guarantee the continued success of the LHC programme.\n\nThe aim of this proposal is therefore to develop and establish a new standard of theoretical precision in the description of physical observables at the LHC and other particle collider experiments, thereby leading to a more precise extraction of fundamental physics parameters, such as the couplings of the Higgs boson to other fundamental particles.   The necessary theoretical precision will be achieved by systematically including the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) corrections in the perturbative expansion in the relevant simulation tools, focusing on crucial\nexperimental benchmark processes.\n\nThe techniques and frameworks we will develop will be applicable to other processes and in particular, will be very relevant to searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, and in the further interpretation of any signals that would indicate such a discovery.\n\nTo achieve this ambitious goal, the PI will work very closely with a team of carefully chosen scientists with relevant overlapping and complementary expertise in precision calculations and event simulation: Professor Dr Thomas Gehrmann (University of Z�rich), Professor Dr Aude Gehrmann-De Ridder (ETH Z�rich) and Dr Frank Krauss (Durham University).'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"340983","fundValue":"1941144","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2019-02-28","dataset":"fp7"}
