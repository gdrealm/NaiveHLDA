{"id":"187748","title":"Prospective Memory in Mild Cognitive Impairment","abstractText":"'Population in Europe is ageing rapidly. Consequently, there is an urgent need to find ways to help the growing population of older people to live independent lives and preserve well being into old age. To address this pressing issue, PMinMCI will conduct the first systematic and innovative investigation of prospective memory in older adults at risk of Alzheimer�s disease. Prospective memory refers to remembering to do things in future (e.g., remembering to take medication or pay bills on time). Although it is a vitally important skill for one to function independently in everyday life, it has received so far little attention. The project will focus on: 1) identifying the prospective memory deficits that could serve as an early marker of cognitive decline and a predictor of dementia, 2) recognizing everyday memory problems of individuals in the transitional state between normal ageing and Alzheimer�s disease, and 3) proposing early psychological intervention aimed at reducing their anxiety and worry about memory. The expected results will allow practitioners to recognize opportunities for early intervention and help older adults in at-risk population maintain well being and independence in their everyday life as long as possible. The aims and expected outcomes of PMinMC perfectly fit the current and forthcoming research and innovation policy of the European Union. The project will also allow the Fellow to widen the scope of research conducted so far to include abnormal ageing and novel technology for conducting naturalistic studies with portable electronic (smartphone) eDiaries. It will also develop her ability to publish in top international journals, and establish a network of collaborators for future large-scale externally funded European and international research projects. Acquiring these competencies is crucial for attaining two major goals in her academic career: getting a professorship and becoming a top internationally recognized researcher.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"623230","fundValue":"231926.4","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
