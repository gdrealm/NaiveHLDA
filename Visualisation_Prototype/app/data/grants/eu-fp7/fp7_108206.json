{"id":"108206","title":"\"Risk Analysis, Ruin and  Extremes\"","abstractText":"'This project, named Risk Analysis, Ruin and  Extremes (RARE), aims at developing the theoretical side of the analysis of ruin probabilities in case of disasters or extreme shocks for insurance-like risk pools, by the introduction and analysis of new risk measures, and by (asymptotic)\nquantification of aggregated risk, central topics of interest for the prediction of financial disasters and more generally for risk management.\n\nSince specialists working on the areas of extremes and rare events are scarce and sparse, such an exchange program helps creating a needed network of knowledge, ideas and experience. We propose 12 international leading research centers from European, emergent and developed countries, to establish an initial network basis of 20 experienced researchers and 20 early stage researchers.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"318984","fundValue":"783000","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","dataset":"fp7"}
