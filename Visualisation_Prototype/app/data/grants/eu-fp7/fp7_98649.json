{"id":"98649","title":"\"Microswimmer Environments: Modelling, Control and Tailoring\"","abstractText":"'Bringing together ideas from soft-matter physics and hydrodynamics, the aim of the research activities presented in this proposal is to elucidate the effect of active microscopic swimmers (microswimmers) on the dynamics of surrounding environments at the microscale, and to explain how the environment shapes the behavior of microswimmers.\n\nBased on integrated theoretical and numerical modeling, we intend to investigate the interplay between microswimmers and their environment, considering the key effects of single and collective interactions, structured surfaces and interfaces, external biasing and local fluid properties. We hence aim at applications\nthat exploit active systems,  by controlling existing biological environments, such as  bacterial baths and biofilms, and by developing new  tailored technologies, such as swimmer-actuated microfluidic devices.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"273406","fundValue":"200549.6","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","dataset":"fp7"}
