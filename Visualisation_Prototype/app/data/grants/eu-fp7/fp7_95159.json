{"id":"95159","title":"Targeting nucleic acid structures by site-directed ligand discovery","abstractText":"Nucleic acids and nucleic acid-protein interactions play an important role in biological processes of medical importance and can be considered as attractive targets for drug design. Small molecules or peptides that interact with such targets and control their functions are of great interest. Thus there is a need for a general method for rapidly identifying such low molecular weight small molecules or peptides. The focus of this proposal is to establish a new method based on a combined fragment-based and site-directed approach that exploits the power of dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC). This method will be used as a general strategy to target functional nucleic acid structures and their protein complexes.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"253562","fundValue":"172240.8","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
