{"id":"99412","title":"Electric-VEhicle Control of individual wheel Torque for On- and Off-Road Conditions (E-VECTOORC)","abstractText":"The E-VECTOORC project brings together 11 complementary partners from industrial and research backgrounds to address the individual control of the electric motor torques of fully electric vehicles to enhance safety, comfort and fun-to-drive in both on- and off-road driving conditions. The key objectives of the proposal are:� Development and demonstration of yaw rate and sideslip angle control algorithms based on the combination of front/rear and left/right torque vectoring to improve overall vehicle dynamic performance.� Development and demonstration of novel strategies for the modulation of the torque output of the individual electric motors to enhance brake energy recuperation, Anti lock Brake function and Traction Control function. The benefits of these strategies include reductions in: i) vehicle energy consumption, ii) stopping distance, and iii) acceleration times.All developed algorithms will include failsafe strategies and controlled shutdown procedures. The overall control strategy will employ a modular control architecture to allow an easy implementation for different vehicle layouts (e.g., the number of individually controlled motors), vehicle sizes and vehicle applications (from small city cars to sports cars and SUVs).The activity will be carried out using vehicle dynamics simulations and Hardware-In-the-Loop testing of vehicle components and subsystems, which will be complemented by full scale experimental testing of the entire system using a highly versatile vehicle demonstrator that can represent drivetrain architectures with 2, 3 or 4 electric motors. Experimental testing will provide comprehensive information for quantifying the benefits of the proposed control system in both on-road and off-road driving conditions.Hence, in line with the ICT Work Programme for FEVs, the potential of electric drive architectures for improving vehicle stability control will be more fully exploited and measured through the E-VECTOORC control approach.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"284708","fundValue":"4773586","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
