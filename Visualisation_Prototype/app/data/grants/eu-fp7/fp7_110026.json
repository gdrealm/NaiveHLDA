{"id":"110026","title":"Steerable Air-Coupled Ultrasonic Technology for Flow Measurement and NDE Applications","abstractText":"'Accurate flow measurement has become increasingly important for many key industrial sectors including oil and gas, aerospace, automotive, chemical and pharmaceutical process industries, as well as various military and government operations. While ultrasonic flow measurement offer numerous advantages, there remain many challenges that need to be overcome while making ultrasonic flow measurement both accurate & reliable, especially for applications in gas medium. In order to tackle these issues, complex yet cost effective flow measurement instrumentation development is fundamental.\n\nSpecifically, this SACUT MC-IAPP project involves design, construction and testing of novel ultrasound measurement system for air-coupled ultrasonics, primarily for flow measurement but also for generic Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) applications. This will be achieved through effective knowledge transfer and collaboration between the four principal partners; Prof. Steve Dixon (University of Warwick: Lead Academic Partner and program coordinator, based in the UK), Dr. Nishal Ramadas (Elster NV/SA: Lead commercial partner, based in Belgium), Mr. Andy Whittle (PeakNDT: SME, based in the UK) and Prof. Mario Kupnik (BTU-Cottbus: Academic partner, based in Germany).\n\nProf. Steve Dixon (Program coordinator) and Prof. Mario Kupnik (the other academic partner from BTU-Cottbus) are leading experts in the ultrasound field, and their respective departments have a wide range of excellent facilities and expertise that is directly relevant for carrying out this research work successfully. Elster NV/SA, the lead commercial partner involved in this research, is a world leader in ultrasonic instrumentation for gas application, with over two decades of experience. PeakNDT Ltd., the other principal partner involved in this research, is a world leading expert in the development of electronics hardware especially for ultrasonic phased array instrument, for NDE application.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"612118","fundValue":"1467236.45","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
