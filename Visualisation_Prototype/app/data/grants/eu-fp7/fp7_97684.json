{"id":"97684","title":"\"Control, Dynamics and Stochastics\"","abstractText":"This proposal addresses the fundamental development of the analysis of control and random dynamical systems from a deterministic dynamical systems point of view. We are interested in developing three directions:\n\n1. The theory of set-valued dynamical systems as a unified framework to analyse control and random dynamical systems.\n\n2. Developing tools to analyse random dynamical systems. The first problem is to define and classify bifurcations for random dynamical systems using control-theoretic tools. A second problem is to prove ergodicity for infinite-dimensional random dynamical systems.\n\n3. Analysing and controlling systems with structure and symmetries.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"254028","fundValue":"225227.2","fundStart":"2011-01-31","fundEnd":"2013-01-30","dataset":"fp7"}
