{"id":"97787","title":"Examination of alveolar and trabecular morphology and how it relates to masticatory forces","abstractText":"'The adaptation to different diets is a major driving force in mammalian evolution. Mammals have occupied extremely diverse dietary niches that require different masticatory functions. The diversity in mammalian skull and tooth morphology reflects these different feeding adaptations, but key questions remain unanswered: How are chewing forces transferred from the teeth through the jaws? What role does the tooth morphology play in the distribution of these forces? How does the bone in the jaws adapt to different forces? And can we use these adaptations to reconstruct the feeding behaviour of extinct species?\n\nEAT will address these questions by examining the internal jaw morphology of mammal species with very different and well-known feeding adaptations in order to understand the link between bone morphology, tooth morphology and masticatory forces. It will achieve this by mechanical experiments and the use of state-of-the-art methods such as the 3D analysis of high-resolution image data and computer modelling. These methods are well-established in biomedical research, but, despite their potential, not yet widely used in comparative studies. By applying these methods, EAT will provide new insights into the functional adaptations of the masticatory apparatus and explore their application in future studies in the field of functional morphology.\n\nIn addition, EAT will strengthen the links between the host institution in the UK and collaborators in Germany and support the applicant in gaining independence and key skills for taking up a permanent position after the integration period. To assist this, the host institution will provide dedicated facilities and additional support to assist in the applicantï¿½s integration.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"268430","fundValue":"45000","fundStart":"2011-09-26","fundEnd":"2014-09-25","dataset":"fp7"}
