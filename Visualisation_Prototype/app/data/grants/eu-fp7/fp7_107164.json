{"id":"107164","title":"Engineering Graphene/Multimetal Composite with Ionic Liquid as Enhanced Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction","abstractText":"'Fuel cells are an advanced renewable electrochemical device capable of converting chemical energy to electrical energy. In the quest to make the fuel cells a competitive force, one of the major limitations is still to reduce the overpotential of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode electrode. Currently, Pt and Pt-based nanoparticles (NPs) are still indispensable, proving to be the most effective catalyst for ORR. However, the high cost of Pt catalyst, together with its limited reserves in nature, has precluded the large-scale commercialization of fuel cells. Another big issue is the poor durability of Pt NP catalyst in the cellï¿½s harsh operating alkaline or acidic environment. In this project, based on the excellent chemical and physical properties of graphene and ionic liquid, the designed synthesis of high-performance graphene/multimetal composite catalysts with very high ORR activity and durability through the introduction of IL into composite catalysts was proposed. First, new organic-phase or aqueous-phase synthesis methods for the controlled synthesis of high-quality multimetal Pt-based alloy, core/shell and dumbbell NPs or nanowires will be developed. The effect of composition, shape, core/shell structure and interface synergy of different multimetal nanomaterials on their ORR catalytic activity and stability will be studied. Then, in order to further enhance ORR performance of multimetal nanomaterials, we will engineer graphene/mutilmetal composite nanosheet with ionic liquid. The introduction of ionic liquid and graphene will have great opportunity for reducing the ORR overpotential and enhancing the ORR activity. Our final aim is to realize high-performance composite nanocatalysts with very high activity and stability for ORR that are superior in performance to all the existing materials.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"326083","fundValue":"231283.2","fundStart":"no date","fundEnd":"no date","dataset":"fp7"}
