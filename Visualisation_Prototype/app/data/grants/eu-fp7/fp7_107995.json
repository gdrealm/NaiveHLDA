{"id":"107995","title":"\"A Single Dose, Cytomegalovirus-based Vaccine to Induce Heterosubtypic Protective Immunity to Influenza A Virus\"","abstractText":"'There are 16 known avian IA virus serotypes, which are further subdivided phylogenetically into group 1 and group 2 viruses. IA 'pandemics' with the possibility for high mortality result from 'antigenic shift' following introduction of a virus with a new hemaglutinnin (HA) serotype into an immunologically na�ve population. In contrast, IA 'epidemics' are a consequence of 'antigenic drift' caused by mutation of the HA serotype already circulating within the human population. Seasonal flu vaccines induce antibodies primarily against the globular highly variable head region of HA, and target only a single serotype (homosubtypic immunity). There are currently no commercially available vaccines that are able to induce immunity against multiple IA subtypes and thereby provide heterosubtypic immunity for a pandemic IA vaccine. This CIG project will be run in parallel of a larger collaborative study that is under review at the BBSRC focused on antibody (Ab)-mediated protection. The primary aim of this CIG proposal is to investigate the role of T cell responses (and particularly �effector� T cell memory TEM responses that have immediate effector function and are enriched in lung tissue) in providing protection against pandemic flu.  To enable the role of TEM in IA protective immunity to be assessed we will compare the protective efficacy of T cell immune responses induced against IA nucleoprotein (NP) by using 2 distinct vaccine vector platforms that differ in their induction of TEM responses. This is an area of flu vaccine development that has been largely overlooked. By running alongside the larger BBSRC study, this CIG project will take advantage of the infrastructure provided by the BBSRC proposal. The strategic goal of all these studies is development of  an effective, safe, inexpensive, single dose universal vaccine against all serotypes of IA'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"334487","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
