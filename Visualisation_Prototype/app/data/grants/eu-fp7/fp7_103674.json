{"id":"103674","title":"URALLOY","abstractText":"'Uranium alloys are candidate materials for use in the nuclear and other industries. Their applications are strongly related to their chemical behaviour, particularly to the surface interaction with gases and vapours. In addition to the chemical composition, the microstructure of a material can strongly influence the physical properties. The proposed project will investigate the phase stability, oxidation, corrosion, hydrogenation behaviour, atomic structure, microstructure and the magnetic & electronic properties of selected, technologically important uranium-base alloy thin films (U-Mo, U-Zr, U-Zr-Mo). For the experimental studies, surface analysis and magnetic measurement techniques available in the Interface Analysis Centre (IAC) and other departments of the University of Bristol, UK, will be used.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"300171","fundValue":"200371.8","fundStart":"2012-04-02","fundEnd":"2014-04-01","dataset":"fp7"}
