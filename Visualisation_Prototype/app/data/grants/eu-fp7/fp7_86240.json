{"id":"86240","title":"Cognitive Systems that Self-Understand and Self-Extend","abstractText":"The challenge laid out in this call is to understand the principles according to which cognitivensystems should be built if they are to handle novelty, situations unforeseen by their designers, andnopen-ended, challenging environments with uncertainty and change. Our aim is to meet this challenge by creating a theory -- evaluated in robots -- of how a cognitive system can model its own knowledge; use this to cope with uncertainty and novelty during task execution; extend its own abilities and knowledge; and extend its own understanding of those abilities. Imagine a cognitive system that models not only the environment, but its own understanding of the environment and how this understanding changes under action. It identifies gaps in its own understanding and then plans how to fill those gaps so as to deal with novelty and uncertainty in task execution, gather information necessary to complete its tasks, and to extend its abilities and knowledge so as to perform future tasks more efficiently.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"215181","fundValue":"8846820","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","dataset":"fp7"}
