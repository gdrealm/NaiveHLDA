{"id":"103684","title":"Annotation Resource Marketplace in the Cloud","abstractText":"ANNOMARKET aims to revolutionise the text annotation market, by delivering an affordable, open market place for pay-as-you-go, cloud-based extraction resources and services, in multiple languages. This project is is driven by a commercially-dominated consortium, from 3 EU countries and with 43% of the budget assigned to SMEs.<br/>The key differentiating feature of ANNOMARKET is its open marketplace concept. In addition, the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model reduces the complexity of deployment, maintenance, customisation, and sharing of text processing resources and services, making them affordable to SMEs ï¿½ both users and resource providers. The main beneficiaries will be the SME providers of text analysis resources and services, who will be able to deploy their custom components/applications and receive revenue via the AnnoMarket  marketplace. There will be a mixture of paid-for proprietary resources and services and free open-source ones, in different languages. AnnoMarket  will also promote customisation and re-targetting to new vertical domains and languages. The open-source nature of the underlying infrastructure will foster a strong developer community and enable easy deployment on private and public cloud infrastructures. Pricing will be transparent (based on data volumes) and the business model self-sustainable.<br/>The techniques will be generic with many business applications, e.g. large-volume multi-lingual information management, business intelligence, social media monitoring, customer relations management. The project will also benefit society and ordinary citizens by enabling affordable enrichment of government data archives and health-related web content. The marketplace architecture will be refined and evaluated with early adopters from our focus group, covering these vertical domains, in five target languages.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"296322","fundValue":"2003654","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","dataset":"fp7"}
