{"id":"107663","title":"Towards Pervasive Indoor Wireless Networks","abstractText":"'In cellular networks, it is estimated that 2/3 of the calls and 90% of data services take place indoors. Smart meters are being and will be deployed across the world. Smart meters are connected with other meters and appliances wirelessly at homes. Smart buildings, e-health, assisted living applications also rely on quality in-building wireless communications. Thus pervasive wireless communications are very important.\n\nThere still remain many challenges to achieve high quality pervasive indoor wireless communications, for example, it is not well understood how various indoor wireless networks will interfere each other, how traffic models look like in smart homes/buildings, which new frequency bands can be used to meet exponential traffic growth indoors and how to make use of various wireless technologies with consideration of energy consumption, and so on.\n\nThe main objectives of the project are as follows:\n�\tTo characterise material properties (permittivity, permeability, transmission, reflection loss, etc) for new and existing building/insulation materials that are used in Europe and China for frequencies up to 65GHz\n�\tTo investigate indoor and indoor-outdoor wireless propagation channels\n�\tTo investigate how different indoor wireless networks will interfere each other and the interference to and from wireless networks in the neighbourhood\n�\tTo identify new frequency bands that can be used to meet the exponential traffic growth indoors\n�\tTo investigate traffic models for indoor networks, e.g., in smart homes/buildings\n�\tTo investigate how to reduce energy consumption of indoor wireless networks\n�\tTo explore the synergy of complementary competences at the project partners and establish and/or strengthen the long-term collaborations between them.\n\nThe methodology of this project will adopt a combination of theoretical research that will be verified by experiment and simulation. The interactions between academia and industry will also be promoted. It is expected that the project will benefit more than 15 early stage researchers. The project partners will disseminate the project results in journals, conferences and workshops organised by the project partners.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"318992","fundValue":"611100","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
