{"id":"185970","title":"Supermassive black holes under the microscope: Revealing the dusty environment of AGN on parsec scales with IR and sub-mm interferometry","abstractText":"'The evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes are intimately related. As such, it is of great interest to understand the active growth phase of these black holes and their influence on the surrounding host galaxies. I propose a project to study the outer, dusty region of mass accretion onto supermassive black holes with the objective to address the following open questions:\n\n* How is the accreting mass distributed? Do we see any dependence on the accretion state of the supermassive black holes?\n\n* Do we see a dusty wind that regulates or limits accretion on parsec scales? How does it work? Does this wind cause feedback reactions on the surrounding galaxy?\n\n* Why do dust emission features around supermassive black holes appear different than in the interstellar medium? Does the hard radiation from the black-hole environment change the dust composition?\n\nEach of these three topical units will be investigated in separate sub-projects that combine aspects of theory, modeling, and observations. More specifically I combine the latest high-angular resolution IR and sub-mm data from the frontline facilities VLTI and ALMA with models of the dust emission and of dynamical processes.\n\nAs a main goal of this application I want to transfer my expertise in interferometry to Denmark to stimulate the use of ALMA and VLTI. These observatories are of prime interest to the European astronomical community as outlined in the ASTRONET framework and infrastructure documents. Via student training, teaching, and talks, I want to increase the appeal of this technique and its usage in Denmark, with new instruments about to be commissioned.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"623804","fundValue":"230809.8","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","dataset":"fp7"}
