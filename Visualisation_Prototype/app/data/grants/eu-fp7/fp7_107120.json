{"id":"107120","title":"Memory-enhanced photonic quantum information processing","abstractText":"'The current complexity of optical quantum information processors is critically restricted by the scalability of quantum photonics. We will lessen this constraint by demonstrating a scalable platform based on an available quantum memory that achieves high time-bandwidth product and low noise. Quantum memories enable temporal multiplexing to create ideally deterministic routines from inherently probabilistic processes, such as those based on quantum measurements. We will employ this strategy to construct a unique source of quantum light from four synchronised heralded single-photon sources. We will develop an integrated memory-based quantum photonics platform with sufficient performance to achieve complex quantum information processing tasks with more than twenty photons distributed over as many modes. A second role for quantum memories uses light-matter quantum interference to effect processing of stored information. This potential unlocks novel and efficient QIP protocols and a compelling alternate architecture to chip-based processors. We will demonstrate a memory-based programmable three-port linear quantum optical network that operates on time-bins. The outcome of this project is a new memory-enhanced quantum photonics platform that will enable access to a new complexity regime for quantum information processing to explore the physics of complex quantum systems.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"331859","fundValue":"221606.4","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","dataset":"fp7"}
