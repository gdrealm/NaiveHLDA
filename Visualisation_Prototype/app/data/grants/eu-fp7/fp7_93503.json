{"id":"93503","title":"Management of Emergent Technologies for Economic Impact","abstractText":"'The ManETEi network offers a research-led training programme to create a rigorous collaborative research agenda centred on the multifaceted phenomenon of managing emergent technologies for maximum economic and societal impact. It will have advanced capacity-building and career development that will benefit the early-career and experienced researchers needed to ensure Europe becomes a leading knowledge economy driven by its unique ERA. The network has identified arguably Europe�s most important opportunity for its future management researchers, managers and policy makers. The investment by Member states, EU and industry in Bio-, Nano-, Info- and cognitive (NBIC) emerging science and technology are making jointly is the largest ever seen. This creates a need for both increased capacity and new competencies in business and management for linking advances in emerging technology with business and economic exploitation. Yet demographic studies indicate Europe�s management training and research capacity is set to decline. ManETEI brings together 7 of Europe�s leading Business Schools, the Fraunhofer ISI, an European global high technology manufacturer (Bayer GmbH) supported by a diverse group of associate partners from different industries, sectors, technologies and countries. They will provide a stimulating and active learning environment to enhance trans-national mobility, inter-institutional experience and exposure to a range of scholarly perspectives from the disciplines of management, economics and technology. It will create a platform for researchers to investigate the multifaceted phenomenon of managing the emergent technologies that promise the greatest competitiveness and growth of the European economies. The network members are highly experienced in participating in EU funded research and its implementation at all levels. They all share commitment for future research and training collaboration based on the principles created by this network.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"238382","fundValue":"3832975.92","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","dataset":"fp7"}
