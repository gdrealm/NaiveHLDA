{"id":"89740","title":"Visionary Space Systems: Orbital Dynamics at Extremes of Spacecraft Length-Scale","abstractText":"'This ground-breaking project will deliver radically new approaches to orbital dynamics at extremes of spacecraft length-scale to underpin new space-derived products and services for Europe. These include levitated geostationary orbits for large gossamer spacecraft to massively increase space telecommunications capacity, new displaced polar orbits for continuous environmental monitoring of the arctic and swarms of interacting micro-spacecraft for revolutionary new commercial and science applications. To pursue these ambitious goals, resources of order �2M are requested for 3 postdoctoral research assistants for 5 years to establish a European Research Council funded Advanced Space Concepts Laboratory. The University of Strathclyde will provide resources for a further 3 PhD students (�250k) and a custom suite of offices to host the laboratory. Through extensive European and international links, the work of the laboratory will build on the demonstrated capability of the Principal Investigator to devise and effectively transfer radical new space concepts from academia through to industry and to influence policy-making at the highest levels. Dissemination will be through an international network of collaborators (e.g. ESA, NASA, Tsinghua University) and a public outreach project to stimulate debate on visionary, large-scale space engineering ventures. The project will underpin revolutionary new space technologies and applications and will champion the role of European space engineering as a venture at the forefront of technological and social advancement.'","grantUrl":"","grantId":"227571","fundValue":"2012038","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","dataset":"fp7"}
