{"id":"109806","title":"Real-Time IoT Stream Processing and Large-scale Data Analytics for Smart City Applications","abstractText":"An increasing number of cities have started to introduce new ICT enabled services.  However, the uptake of smart city applications is hindered by various issues, such as the difficulty of integrating heterogeneous data sources and the challenge of extracting up-to-date information in real-time from large-scale dynamic data. Today the challenges are often addressed by application specific solutions, resulting in silo architectures.Bridging technology and domain boundaries, requires a scalable, adaptive and robust framework that provides:<br/>� Virtualisation hiding the heterogeneity of the numerous data and information sources<br/>� Large-scale data analytics for resource efficient event detection in multiple data streams<br/>� Semantic description frameworks and semantic analytics tools to provide machine-interpretable descriptions of data and knowledge<br/>� Easy creation of real-time smart city applications by re-usable intelligent components<br/>CityPulse will develop, build and test a framework for semantic discovery and processing of large-scale real-time IoT and relevant social data streams for reliable knowledge extraction in a real city environment.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"609035","fundValue":"3745424","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","dataset":"fp7"}
