{"id":"5C0EC0E7-EFB8-4C95-87D0-BF9493EDB039","title":"The transmission of Christian texts at Turfan","abstractText":"Between 1904-1907 the Second and Third German Turfan Expeditions discovered at the monastery site of Bulay&iuml;q in the Turfan oasis (modern Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous province, China) more than 1000 Syriac and Christian Sogdian fragments written in the Syriac script. These were brought to Berlin where they are now preserved. Many translations were made from Syriac into Sogdian (an Iranian language originating near Samarkand) as considerable Sogdian diaspora communities settled at Turfan and in China. Material translated into Sogdian included biblical texts, psalters, lectionaries as well as hagiographies and ascetical works. By contrast, the liturgical material was written exclusively in Syriac, this conservative transmission was entirely in keeping with the fact that Syriac was (and still is) the liturgical language of the Church of the East. It supplied a cohesive thread amidst the ethno-linguistic diversity of the Church of the East's dioceses.\n\nThe project investigates the transmission and translation of literature at Turfan to illustrate the mechanics of diaspora; how the 'mother church' in Mesopotamia responded to the ethno-linguistic character of its communities, yet sustained its traditional profile. To do so the project adopts two trajectories: (i) a trilingual Sogdian-Syriac-English dictionary, (ii) a reconstruction of Hudra D incorporating a critical edition of MIK III/45 and 26 fragments, accompanied by an annotated translation. MIK III/45, a 61-folio manuscript, dates from the 9th/10th centuries and is the earliest extant copy of the Hudra. The dictionary gives graphic insight into the processes of translation that took place between Semitic and Iranian languages. The reconstruction of the Hudra documents the transmission history of the principal liturgical book and sheds light on the evolution of the East Syrian liturgy about which little is known. \n\nThe project brings together the foremost language and liturgical experts on Christianity in Central Asia Prof. Nicholas Sims-Williams FBA, Dr. Erica C D Hunter, also Dr. Jonathan Loopstra and His Grace, Mar Awa, bishop of the Assyrian Church of the East (Modesto, California). Mar Awa is also a participant in the 'Forum Syriacum' held by the Pro Oriente Foundation that discusses issues pertinent to the Oriental Orthodox Churches.\n\nDissemination of results would take place in:\n(1) Workshop 'Christian Sogdian and Syriac fragments', at the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin in 2013. This would be 'in progress' for scholars.\n\n(2) Conference 'Text and Transmission: the legacy of Turfan', at the Museum f&uuml;r Asiatische Kunst, Berlin in 2014. With a specific focus on the Hudra and MIK III/45, this conference would be relevant for scholars and the public. It would be accompanied by an exhibition of material from Turfan.\n\n(3) The Christianity in Iraq XI Seminar Day in March 2015 would provide the forum for the public release of the material. This annual series, inaugurated in 2004 by Dr. Hunter, has the express aim to impart knowledge about Christianity in Iraq to academics, the public, press, policy makers as well as the Iraqi Christian communities and clergy who are active participants.\n\nThe results of the project will benefit academic and wider audiences. There is no Sogdian-Syriac-English dictionary, so its publication would open a new dimension in philology and would also serve the growing recognition of the role of 'Persian Christianity' in the T'ang dynasty. The reconstruction of Hudra D would give seminal insight into the development of the early liturgy of the East Syrian churches. The Hudra (based on 16th century manuscripts) is used daily by the East Syrian churches [Assyrian Church of the East, Ancient Church of the East, Chaldaean Catholic Church and the Syro-Malabar Church] in Syria, Iraq, Iran and India as well as large diaspora communities in Australia, America and Europe, but there is no English translation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J003425/1","grantId":"AH/J003425/1","fundValue":"531158","fundStart":"2012-09-24","fundEnd":"2015-09-23","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project is still 'in progress'; end date September 2015.\nInterim findings throw new light onto the structure and organisation of Syriac Christian liturgy in Central Asia in the medieval period.

One is to establish the transmission links between Syriac and Christian Sogdian texts, since the latter were -without exception- copied from the former. No Syriac originals of the Christian Sogdian texts have been found at Turfan. Prof. Sims-Williams is currently addressing this aspect of transmission, primarily through the construction of a Syriac-Sogdian-English dictionary. The second aim is to establish the transmission history of the Hudra, the major liturgical book of the Church of the East. MIK III/45 (dated 9C-10C) is the earliest extant exemplar. Drs. Hunter &amp;amp; Coakley are currently working on the contribution of MIK III/45 to the development of the Syriac liturgy The project develops the findings of AH/F011237/1 in that the cataloguing of the Syriac/Christian Sogdian manuscripts released a hitherto unknown, but rich repository of ecclesiastical materials of the medieval Church of the East. It provides unparalleled material for analysis of the development of the liturgies still in usage amongst modern Syriac-speaking communities (in Iraq, Iran, the Middle East and diaspora communities in Europe, north America and Australia).
