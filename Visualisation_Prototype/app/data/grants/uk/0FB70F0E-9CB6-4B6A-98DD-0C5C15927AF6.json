Obesity predisposes to type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis and some cancers leading to a significant reduction in life expectancy, especially in the young obese. Childhood obesity now affects 20-30% of children in the 5-10 years old age group. Although bad nutrition and sedentary lifestyle play a major role in this recent epidemics, severe and early onset forms of obesity both have a strong genetic basis and result from the cumulative effects of DNA variation in individuals living within an ?obesogenic? environment. In other words, genetically predisposed children are the first and most affected victims of our deleterious way of life. Identifying obesity and associated diabetes genes and risk bimarkers will provide vital information for the prevention and treatment of the condition, resulting in significant improvements in the quality of life and productivity in the UK population.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600331","grantId":"G0600331","fundValue":"1244870","fundStart":"2007-07-02","fundEnd":"2010-11-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philippe  Froguel","coPersons":["Alexandra Ida Blakemore","Andrew John Walley","David J Balding","Mark Ian McCarthy"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
