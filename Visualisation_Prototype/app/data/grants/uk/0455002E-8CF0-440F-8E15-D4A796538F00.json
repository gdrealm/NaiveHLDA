{"id":"0455002E-8CF0-440F-8E15-D4A796538F00","title":"Transforming Insecurity through Nonviolent Grassroots Networks","abstractText":"<p>The research question is ‘How can nonviolent grassroots networks transform insecurity?’ Security scholars and practitioners are often willing to engage with each other but unsure of how to go about it. The project bridges that gap.</p>\n\n<p>The research will explore these ideas in relation to three existing nonviolent grassroots networks - neighbourhood watch to prevent suicide bomb attacks in Somalia; projects to record every casualty of armed conflict in many countries in the global South; and projects to stop the street harassment of women in the global North and South.</p>\n\n<p>The research will examine of how nonviolent grassroots relate to the state, global governance and actors that use and threaten violence. It will also explore these ideas in relation to grassroots security actors which are seeking to network with each other across issue areas.</p>\n\n<p>The vision of this project is a flourishing, diversifying and synergistic ecosystem of viral networked action for nonviolent grassroots security with academics and practitioners working together. The project is first step towards identifying practices and establishing follow-on projects that can more fully realise the project’s vision. Its immediate legacy will be publications, online resources and a continuing relationship with the networks engaged with through the project.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003171/1","grantId":"ES/L003171/1","fundValue":"197875","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Eric  Herring","coPersons":["Jutta Eleonore Weldes"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
