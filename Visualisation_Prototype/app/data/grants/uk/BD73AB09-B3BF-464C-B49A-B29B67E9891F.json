{"id":"BD73AB09-B3BF-464C-B49A-B29B67E9891F","title":"Lighting up the dark side of the Universe","abstractText":"A series of striking observational and theoretical breakthroughs have resulted in a surprising view of the Universe in which most of its contents are dark: the bulk of the mass in the Universe is thought to be &quot;dark matter&quot; whilst the current dynamics of the Universe are governed by &quot;dark energy&quot;. The astronomical community is organizing itself into large international teams to carry out the next generation of galaxy survey to understand the nature of the dark universe. \n\nOur objective is to develop a new state of the art in mock galaxy catalogues to aid this effort. As surveys become larger to beat down random measurement errors, it is essential that we develop a better understanding of systematic effects, such as the relation between the galaxy and matter distributions, called galaxy bias. Such effects will limit the scientific potential of future surveys unless theoretical models are developed which allow them to be properly incorporated into the estimation of cosmological parameters. \n\nAstronomy is arguably the highest profile Chilean scientific activity on the international stage. By allowing the leading Chilean researchers access to expertise in galaxy formation modelling and a national level supercomputer, this project will lay the foundations for the scientific exploitation of major new surveys, including the European Space Agency's Euclid mission and new collaborations with Europe. We will also train young Chilean researchers. The outputs of the project will include mock galaxy catalogues which will be released to the wider astronomical community through a relational database.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M007995/1","grantId":"ST/M007995/1","fundValue":"159345","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Carlton  Baugh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
