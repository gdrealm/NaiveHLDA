Climate change has the potential to affect the UK water system in a number of ways: through changes in the water available for abstraction and storage, especially through altered drought frequency and intensity, changes in demand and changing risk of infrastructure failure.This project aims to develop a set of analysis tools and data on climate change and future demand that will enable users to identify packages of options that results in heightened reslience of the UK water system to these uncertain future drivers. The multi-criteria approach to be developed will also allow alternative adaptation options to be assessed against other criteria, such as environmental sustatinability, energy costs and public acceptability.The focus of the study is South and East England, an area that is already experiencing water system stress, and likely to be subject to additional stresses in the future due to climate change and demographic changes.The methods and results of this research will enable the UK to better plan for adaptation of the water system to climate change, and will help identify the polciy and regulatory changes that would be needed for adaptation to take place.The project has been designed in collaboration with stakeholders from government (DEFRA, EA, OFWAT, GLA), the water industry (UKWIR, Water UK and a number of water companies) and NGOs with an interest in water. These same stakeholders will be involved throughout the project as project partners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G061181/1","grantId":"EP/G061181/1","fundValue":"82106","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Southern Water and Atkins have used our findings to inform the company's Water Resources Management Plan 2015-40.

The future is inherently uncertain because of climate, socio-economic and regulatory changes. Our research involved the integration of a cascade of uncertainty on water resource planning including: climate uncertainty, climate post-processing uncertainty, hydrological uncertainty, water resource model uncertainty and demand uncertainty. The research was applied to a water resource zone in Sussex in collaboration with Southern Water and Atkins. We found that post-processing uncertainty is the dominant uncertainty until the 2030s, but by the 2050s demand and socio-economic uncertainty becomes the dominant uncertainty. Despite the large climate post-processing uncertainty, the main hotspots of water deficits remains similar across the climate products and are driven by network bottlenecks and the continually high dependence of the system on water sources around the Hardham area. The research also indicates that inter-regional transfers might not be as reliable as assumed. The findings and research methods need to be digested, embraced and adjusted by water regulators (e.g., the Environment Agency and Ofwat) and other stakeholders (water companies, consultancies, etc.). These types of methods need to be applied more widely (e.g., in other sectors) to assess their wider utility for long-term planning under deep uncertainty. Environment,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
