Given thenon-stationary nature of many signals many models have been proposedattempting to capture time-varying features. Although the idea ofestimating time-varying computational models is not a new one, recently published research reports indicate a marked tendency to focus on parameters estimated with high temporal resolution (instantaneous parameters). The results obtained with this research could be applied in the development of :Text to speech systems producing high quality speech.Low bit rate speech coding.Knowledge-based speech recognition.Speech compression for multimedia systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F059353/1","grantId":"EP/F059353/1","fundValue":"18645","fundStart":"2008-09-26","fundEnd":"2008-12-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  McLaughlin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
