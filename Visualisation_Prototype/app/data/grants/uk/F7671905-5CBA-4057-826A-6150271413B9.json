Migration is one factor that may have a significant influence upon death rates in deprived areas. </p>\n\n<p>This project will use two different methodological approaches to analyse migration in deprived areas of Britain. In the first, complex neighbourhood migration categorisations, based on 2001 census data, will be defined. </p>\n\n<p>These categorisations will describe the degree of population turnover in areas, how mobility changes the population composition of areas and how area 'connections', movements to and from areas with different levels of deprivation, link areas. The analysis will compare deprived neighbourhoods and local authorities to assess if differences in their death rates and migration characteristics are linked. </p>\n\n<p>The second part of the project will focus on long-term patterns of migration in two deprived local authority areas with contrasting patterns of mortality and migration. In these case study areas individual life time residential histories and historical population data will be used to explore whether past mobility can illuminate current mortality geography. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I016740/1","grantId":"ES/I016740/1","fundValue":"80188","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helena  Tunstall","coPersons":["Ruth  Lupton","Kate Elizabeth Pickett"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
