{"id":"6B10074A-4F87-4A66-A1BD-E6C97BC71A03","title":"Modelling of Ultrasonic Response from Rough Defects","abstractText":"This proposal seeks funding for a three year research programme into the back-scattering of ultrasound from rough surfaces, with specific application to the Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) of rough cracks. This addresses an important industrial goal: to be able to predict with confidence the reflection of ultrasound from a rough defect, at any chosen angle and frequency, which could then be used to make the case for a desired plan for inspection. The research will extend knowledge in two complementary areas: the creation of an envelope approach to predict the minimum back-scatter to be expected with confidence from a statistical description of the roughness, and the development of Finite Element modelling procedures to guarantee accurate, but efficient, modelling of the scattering from detailed representations of specific rough defects. The work will be undertaken jointly by a mathematical and an engineering team, both at Imperial College. The proposal is being submitted within the UK Research Centre in NDE (RCNDE) to the targeted research programme, the funding for which is earmarked by EPSRC for industrially driven research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I018948/1","grantId":"EP/I018948/1","fundValue":"292750","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  At completion of the project we have prepared a package of modelling tools and a final report for the industrial partners. This provides the basis for the partners to deploy the findings for their own industrial use. Additionally, direct support has been provided to two of the partners to get the tools into use in their offices/laboratories. The new tools will be particularly useful for the qualification of inspections of safety-critical components in new-build electricity generating plant.

This is important for safety-critical components, eg in aerospace and power generation. The roughness causes a reduction of the ultrasonic reflectivity from the defects, and this has led to the use of very conservative factors of safety. Our work enables these safety factors to be reduced substantially while also improving the confidence of the inspections. Direct use in industry by the industrial partners, in collaboration with us to achieve this. Use by other industry via public domain disseminations.
