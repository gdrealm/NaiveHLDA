Friends and family provide much of the care needed. Having a caring role may compromise well-being, quality of life, and finances. The annual economic cost of supporting people with dementia is estimated at &pound;26.3 billion, with almost half being attributed to the care provided by 'informal carers'. Without informal carers government costs would be increased greatly. Maintaining carer quality of life and finding a way of measuring it are important not only for the carers and those cared for, but also for society. Having an accurate and meaningful way of measuring carer quality of life is needed in three distinct areas. \n1. Individual carer assessment: to identify carers most at need. \n2. Development and evaluation of services.\n3. Policy making: to inform decision making concerning government spending.\nThere are numerous quality of life questionnaires with many used in dementia carer assessment. However, some are too general and do not pick up subtle changes in carer quality of life, others are too long and some have unreliable ways of working out scores. Some questionnaires (e.g.EQ-5D) have been used by organisations such as NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) to make recommendations on how money is spent by working out the 'value' the general population put on different health related quality of life situations (health states). The EQ-5D may be useful to value 'health states' but less useful in valuing 'carer states' since these go beyond health. Furthermore the 'value' the general population put on health/carer states may be different to the 'value' carers put on these states. \nTherefore, the aims of this study, undertaken in two workstreams, are to:\n-develop a quality of life questionnaire for carers of people with dementia (Carer-QoL) for use as described above in points 1-3, \n-test how justifiable the underlying rules used by NICE are in 'valuing' benefits to carers,\n-estimate peliminary 'values' for Carer-QoL. \nWorkstream 1: developing the new questionnaire (3 phases) \nTo capture the 'carer' experience the questionnaire items will be obtained directly from carers (phase 1 and 2 with 72 carers). The questionnaire scoring will be worked out in phase 3 in which 400 carers will be asked to complete the new questionnaire items and to complete the EQ-5D. The Carer-QoL will be created from the longer list of questions (without losing score accuracy and range) using an approved method called Rasch analysis. \nWorkstream 2: valuation and calibration (3 studies)\nIn study one, 1,000 people (general population, carers of people with dementia and other carers) will value different EQ-5D health states. These health states will include their own (real) as well as states previously reported by other carers (hypothetical) in national surveys. Values for real and hypothetical health states will be compared across each group. In the second study the scores from the EQ-5D and the Carer-QoL, collected in Workstream 1, will be jointly analysed to calibrate the Carer-QoL against EQ-5D scores. In the third study carer profiles will be generated using responses collected using the Carer-QoL in Workstream 1. Another 1,000 people (general population and carers) will be asked to select which carer profile they prefer from pairs of carer profiles presented in a web-based survey. From this it will be possible to place a value on the Carer-QoL scores from both a carer and a general population view point. \nBeneficiaries from the research outcomes include: carers, people being cared for, service providers, policy makers and other researchers. This research will inform the debate on the value of health and quality of life and could contribute new empirical evidence bearing on the issue of perspective in determining that value. This will benefit decision-making bodies such as NICE as well as those submitting evidence on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M025179/1","grantId":"MR/M025179/1","fundValue":"569633","fundStart":"2015-09-07","fundEnd":"2018-09-06","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Penny  Wright","coPersons":["Linda  Clare","Carol  Brayne","Janet Rachel  Oyebode","Paul  Kind","Alan  Tennant","Zoe Susannah Hoare","Hareth  Al-Janabi"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
