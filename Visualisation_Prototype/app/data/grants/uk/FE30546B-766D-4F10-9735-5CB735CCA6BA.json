In particular, the research will focus on the importance of the behaviour of bystanders in determining whether violence is prevented, condoned or escalated.</p>\n\n<p>Using a combination of methodologies (a 'mapping' of interactions in the night-time economy space; a series of group interviews with different groups of participants in the night-time economy; an analysis of CCTV footage of violent and non-violent episodes in the night-time economy) the research will focus on the way bystander behaviour is implicated in the trajectory of violence.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the research will be to see if a focus on the behaviour of bystanders can lead to the development of new intervention strategies for reducing violence in the night-time economy</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1098","grantId":"RES-000-23-1098","fundValue":"129044","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Levine","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
