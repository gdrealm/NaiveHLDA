This research is important for people who have an intellectual disability (ID) because these personal attributes are likely to be as important as their social environment in determining their health and well-being. With research providing a more refined conceptualization of the consequences of living with an ID it is becoming increasingly important that this new knowledge - characterising atypical behavioural and cognitive and emotional differences and disturbances - challenges us to think differently about health care and wellbeing. While the recognition of differences has in the past been considered to have been detrimental to the interests of people with an ID, it is the time to begin discussing the possibility that a recognition of difference may be necessary in order to positively improve the health and wellbeing of people with an ID. In some areas this debate has already begun in arenas set apart from the official government policy. While the stated aim of government policy is the social inclusion and mainstream participation of people with ID as full citizens, it is also recognised in residential settings that people with Prader-Willi Syndrome (for instance) because of an abnormal satiety response to food intake leading to severe obesity cannot have unrestricted access to food, or the opportunity procure it. People with Fragile-X syndrome show a marked propensity to social anxiety and if they are to be supported to participate in mainstream society special measures are likely to be required. Similarly evidence is emerging in the case of people with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome that increasing age brings with it a greater risk of incapacitating anxiety. The effects of specific genotypes on developmental phenotypes may be manifest from early child and remain throughout life or may only emerge at specific times in development. Specific, sometimes superficially similar behaviours, are appear early in life in those, for example, with Smith Magenis, Cornelia de Lange and Angleman Syndromes. In contrast, psychotic illness associated with behavioural change develops in the later teens and early twenties of those with a particular genetic sub-type of Prader Willi Syndrome, and improvements in the life-expectancy of people with Down?s syndrome has led to the recognition that there is a marked age-related increase in the prevalence of dementia of the Alzheimer-type later in life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900035","grantId":"G0900035","fundValue":"48526","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"MARCUS  REDLEY","coPersons":["Chris  Oliver","Felicia A Huppert","Anthony  Holland"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
