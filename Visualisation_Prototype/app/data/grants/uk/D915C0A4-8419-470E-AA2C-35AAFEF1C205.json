{"id":"D915C0A4-8419-470E-AA2C-35AAFEF1C205","title":"Moon, Mars and Meteorites","abstractText":"Our previous events have quite a substantial impact factor, as shown by the number of visitors we attract. This is further supported by the repeated invitations to attend new large scale events (Jodrell Bank Christmas Lectures) as well as those we have previously attended (BBC Stargazing Live and Live from Jodrell Bank). Our core aim is to inspire attendees to investigate science further than their current level of knowledge, what ever that may be, with the activities and information we have created and collated. We hope to do this by providing unique accounts of experiences from the research we carry out as well as from the scientific field. It is also important that everyone is able to access the science we are conveying. For that purpose, our activities are expressed through a variety of learning types (i.e. tactile, eureka based or problem based learning). We hope to inspire teenagers to continue studying science subjects to A-Level and beyond through large-scale events, talks and activities for secondary schools. Taking part in events such as Jodrell Bank's Girls' Night Out (Under The Stars), which is specifically aimed at women and teenage girls, enables us to share our enthusiasm for the subject in an informal setting and to interact with groups that are underrepresented in the physical sciences, making the subject, and science in general, more accessible and relevant to them.\nThe impact of public engagement may also be assessed in terms of unique selling points. One of our unique selling points is that we offer the opportunity for the audience to join in discussions about cutting edge science and the theory behind it, face to face with the scientists carrying out the research. The activities and talks that we provide relate both directly to the work carried out by the research group, as well as to general principles surrounding the field of planetary science. Another unique selling point is that we allow visitors the chance to examine thin sections of meteorites under microscopes. It is quite common for us to be the only group attending large events with access to such activities. This translates into the ability to effectively show and explain phenomenon such as Calcium Aluminium Inclusions (CAIs) and chondrules. Finally, and arguably our most important unique selling point, is how we structure the logistics relating to the activities that we run at events. Our aim is to have all the activities as stand-alone packs that can be run individually or combined, in order to reduce the planning time required for events. This modular approach makes our displays very versatile, which is an important consideration given the range of the themes of events that we attend. The STFC Small Awards scheme would, in part, be used to fund enhancement of this modular activities concept. \nIt is clear that people are enthusiastic about planetary science and we anticipate that we have not yet reached our maximum sphere of influence. As such, we are looking to expand the number of events we attend. Based on previous numbers and forecast expansion, it is expected that we will boost our impact by increasing the number of large scale events we attend (subject to when they are run). We estimate that this will expand our audience by up to 10,000 every year. We will also aim to increase the number of school events we run by expanding our availability and our advertising.\nIn summary, we have a strong, proven track record of engaging with members of the public of all ages through activities relating to our research and the wider field of Planetary Science. Our aim is to reach a wider audience than just the subject specialists of 'academia'. We want to share our enthusiasm for Planetary Science with a wider audience. We aim to inspire and inform the younger generations, enlighten the older generations and generally make the subject of space and the solar system more interesting, accessible and fun to people of all ages and from all backgrounds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L00531X/1","grantId":"ST/L00531X/1","fundValue":"5776","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Materials produced have already been used at several large public engagement events, including events as part of Manchester Science festival Education,Other ","person":"Sarah Anne Crowther","coPersons":["Karen Julia Theis","Katherine Helen Joy","Mark  Nottingham","Torsten  Henkel"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" We are in the process of developing the materials for improving our participation in large Public Engagement activities, as detailed in the original proposal.
