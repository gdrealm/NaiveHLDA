This has been brought about by a need for arrays of smaller wave energy devices to utilise the less-energetic wave resource off the coast of China. For a lower energy resource, control of arrays is even more important in order to optimise performance and to improve survivability. As the focus is on future deployment of arrays in China, the step-change is only possible with the expertise in wave climate, off-grid connection of devices and power systems in China; hence this contribution is provided by project partners in China.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M020231/1","grantId":"EP/M020231/1","fundValue":"87569","fundStart":"2014-10-06","fundEnd":"2015-10-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Shek","coPersons":["Aristides  Kiprakis"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
