{"id":"AA5A49CE-B0E5-48D1-9AF0-D2519CB6B6DC","title":"Efficient and Reliable Wireless Communication Algorithms for Active Flow Control and Skin Friction Drag Reduction","abstractText":"As an important part of the aircraft nervous system , advanced wireless sensor/actuator network technologies will be used to realise active flow control and efficient reduction of skin friction drag during flight. Based on a good understanding of real system constraints and technical requirements on wireless communications, this research project aims to develop feasible medium access control (MAC) and routing algorithms with performance guarantees in transmission delay (single-hop and multi-hop), throughput and energy efficiency. We will use cross-layer approaches in algorithm design and performance evaluation under different radio channel conditions, network topologies and sizes, traffic patterns and communication scenarios. New algorithms can guarantee timely delivery of sufficient sensed data over multi-hop wireless paths and, therefore, can be used to support both distributed and centralised control approaches. They will provide the central controller a comprehensive realtime picture of the flow field for making accurate flow control decisions in time. Besides mathematical analysis and computer simulations, we will build a flexible sensor network testbed to fully evaluate the new algorithms and investigate some important implementation issues, such as interference, reliability, scalability and device failure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F004532/1","grantId":"EP/F004532/1","fundValue":"178068","fundStart":"2008-02-18","fundEnd":"2009-03-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Yang  Yang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
