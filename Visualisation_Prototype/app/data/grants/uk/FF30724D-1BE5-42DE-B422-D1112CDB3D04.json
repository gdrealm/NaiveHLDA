{"id":"FF30724D-1BE5-42DE-B422-D1112CDB3D04","title":"NETWORK: Semantics of Quantum Computation","abstractText":"Quantum computation (more generally, quantum information processing)has become established as an exciting interdisciplinary research fieldat the intersection of physics, computer science and mathematics. Computing devices based on the laws of quantum physics have the potential to hugely increase our capabilities in both algorithmics and cryptography. The former concerns the design of efficient techniques for solving computational problems; it is possible that quantum computers will enable the solution of previously intractable problems. The latter is important for secure electronic communication; by harnessing quantum effects it is possible to devise absolutely secure cryptosystems, unbreakable even by quantum computers. Theoretical computer scientists have recently found several new and exciting ways to applytheir distinctive techniques to quantum computing; the emphasis is different from previous work on cryptography and algorithm design. Thisactivity includes the design and study of quantum programminglanguages, to support the development of reliable software for quantum computers; the development ofquantum logics to support verification of quantum programs; semanticstudies of the foundations of quantum mechanics; semantics-basedanalysis of information flow in quantum protocols; formalspecification and verification of quantum cryptographic systems. A substantial portion of this research is taking place in the UK. Thepurpose of this network is to build on the existing activity to establish a cohesive community that candevelop into a UK-led international research community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E00623X/1","grantId":"EP/E00623X/1","fundValue":"55238","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This network grant supported fundamental research in quantum information and quantum computation.

","person":"Simon John Gay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":" This network grant helped to consolidate and enlarge the UK research community in the field of semantics-based approaches to quantum information and quantum computation. The grant did not provide direct funding for research, but it enabled members of the network to travel in order to carry out collaborative research and to present the results of research at conferences. In addition, the network organised annual workshops. The publications reported are a small selection of publications whose production and/or presentation were assisted by the grant. The book &quot;Semantic Techniques in Quantum Computation&quot; was produced as a specific goal of the network, with chapters contributed by network members and collaborators. The community has continued to develop and the UK is still the international leader in this field. A follow-on network, Structures at the Interface of Physics and Computer Science (EP/I03596X/1) has enlarged the scope of the field to include foundations of quantum mechanics, bringing in several physicists.
