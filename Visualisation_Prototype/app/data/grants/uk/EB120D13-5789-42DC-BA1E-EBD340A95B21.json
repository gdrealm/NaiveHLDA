{"id":"EB120D13-5789-42DC-BA1E-EBD340A95B21","title":"Understanding Focal Points in Bargaining Situations: An Experimental Investigation","abstractText":"<p>The main objective of this research project is to understand how people negotiate and what aspects of the situation they use as an aid to reach an agreement. </p>\n\n<p>Any aspect of a bargaining situation that helps bargainers to coordinate their expectations and behaviour so as to reach an agreement is called a 'focal point'. The purpose of this research is to extend our knowledge about focal points in bargaining situations. There are two sub-projects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>In some bargaining situations, such as the division of land, allocation of mineral deposits or oil fields, or the division of an inheritance, there may be no division of the valuable resource that equates money earnings and there may be no equitable outcome. What aspects, if any, become focal in such situations? </li>\n\n <li>In many bargaining situations negotiators are not sure about how much others stand to gain from any given agreement. How does the absence of such information influence the focality of various divisions of the resource?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Real bargaining situations are complex and it is difficult to find 'clean' data that allows one to isolate the role of particular factors on the observed bargaining behaviour. We shall therefore use lab experiments. This allows us to isolate the role played by a variable of interest while controlling for the influence of other potential factors. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3322","grantId":"RES-000-22-3322","fundValue":"62266","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anders  Poulsen","coPersons":["Robert  Sugden"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" Many important economic and social situations involve bargaining between two or more parties, such as negotiations between a buyer and a seller, and between Israel and Palestine. An important question is which, if any, agreement will be reached, and who gets how much of the surplus. In this project we consider to what extent the reached agreements are efficient (surplus maximizing), equitable (equating the gains of the bargainers), and the extent to which purely contextual aspects (such as past agreements) influence which agreement is reached. \n\n We find that that whenever it is possible to satisfy both efficiency and equity, then such agreements are strongly focal. When there is a conflict between equality and efficiency, bargainers tend to go for efficiency. That is, they sacrifice some equality for the sake of efficiency. Futhermore, when there is a conflict about which efficient but unequal agreement to agree on, bargainers are able and willing to let contextual aspects influence who gets the lion's share. All in all, the results suggest that when people face a bargaining situation, there is a hierachy of focal selection principles: Efficiency, followed by equity, followed by contextual principles used as a symmetry breaker. Setting up bargaining rules, and controlling information available to bargainers, so as to influence which agreement is reached. Understanding the agreements negotiators tend to reach in a given bargaining situation.
