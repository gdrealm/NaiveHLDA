However, the manufacture of Portland cement is a highly energy intensive process that involves heating high volumes of raw materials to around 1450C. In addition to the CO2 generated from burning fossil fuels to reach these temperatures, the basic raw material is calcium carbonate (limestone, CaCO3), and this decomposes during processing releasing more CO2. As a result, the manufacture of Portland cement is responsible for ~5% of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Research at Imperial College has developed a new cementitious binder system based on magnesium oxide (MgO), combined with other mineral additives. This novel binder was developed under the EPSRC funded project GR/T26887/01 - 'Waste minimisation through sustainable magnesium oxide cement products'. Unlike Portland cement, this binder does not require high temperature processing, and it is manufactured by a process that has minimal CO2 emissions. It sets and hardens by absorbing atmospheric CO2 and therefore offers the unique potential to develop a range of 'carbon negative' construction products (e.g. blocks, tiles) for use in a wide range of applications. The negative CO2 footprint of these construction products is based on the combination of two technologies; 1) an innovative, low-CO2 MgO production process which can use any mineral, waste stream, or industrial by-product that contains more than 10% Mg, and 2) the actual cement composition which accelerates the absorption of CO2 from the environment within the manufactured construction products. A European patent has been filed on the formulation and the method of manufacture of the new MgO-based binder. This follow-on fund will add significant value to the project and will accelerate the commercialisation of the novel MgO-based binders for use in sustainable construction products. The funding will act complementary to an EPSRC Industrial Case Award project with Laing O'Rourke, and will be used to further optimise the binder, model the novel MgO production process and complete an economic evaluation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G005885/1","grantId":"EP/G005885/1","fundValue":"98155","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Cheeseman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
