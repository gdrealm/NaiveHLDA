{"id":"A7D14D60-4EF6-43D9-96D9-F3C3DED6FC96","title":"Thinking With 'Pierre Bourdieu in Algeria: Testimonies in Uprooting","abstractText":"<p>Bourdieu was in Algeria in the 1950s and 1960s – at the same time as Fanon and Derrida. He kept the hundreds of photographs he took in this period for nearly fifty years in a shoe box. In collaboration with Franz Schulteis from the Bourdieu Institute and Camera Austria in Grasz, with whom Bourdieu put together the exhibition ‘Pierre Bourdieu in Algeria: Testimonies in Uprooting’ just before his death, Goldsmiths College (Methods Lab, Sociology Department) will host the exhibition. Three interlinked seminars will be organised, together with UCL (Azzedine Haddour) and&nbsp;UEL (Derek Robbins). </p> \n<p>The series emphasises the need to re-visit the influence of Algeria, as a colony and a postcolony, on the formation of social theory. The neglect of colonial contexts upon theoretical traditions that continue to impress huge influence upon contemporary theory is indicative of the ways in which histories of social and political thought have eclipsed particular landscapes. Working with the exhibition will enable the team to operate a ‘live sociology’ that premises pedagogic engagement, at a time when visual sociology is becoming an expanding area of research, and questions of war, pacification and migration, as well as the role of the intellectual in relation to these events, are pertinent.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4344","grantId":"RES-451-25-4344","fundValue":"11848","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nirmal  Puwar","coPersons":["Derek  Robbins","Les  Back","Azzedine  Haddour"],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
