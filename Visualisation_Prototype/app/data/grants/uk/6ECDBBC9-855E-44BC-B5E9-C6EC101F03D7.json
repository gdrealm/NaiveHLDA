As this parasite causes an estimated US$3.2 billion loss in the livestock industry/annum and control is restricted to limited drug classes, the animal health industry has an active interest in methodological developments in identifying novel flukicides. Towards this end, our sharing of this output with Pharma has led to current licensing negotiations. We are currently in commercial discussions with the animal health sector to identify how best to proceed with our developed technology. Licensing and fee for service negotiations are currently ongoing between Pharma and our commercialisation department. We are also applying the technology developed during this research project to a EU/FP7 grant (submitted Feb 6, 2012) focused on identifying novel anthelmintic compounds. Together, both of these exploitation routes are expected to improve animal and human health. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
