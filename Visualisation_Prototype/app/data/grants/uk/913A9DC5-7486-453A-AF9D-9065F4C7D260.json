Grant ST/G000921/1 runs from October 2008 - September 2010, but at the current rate of spend the travel and subsistence funds are likely to be exhausted by around the end of 2009. In this proposal we therefore seek supplementary PATT funding for the period January 2010 - September 2010, to provide sufficient travel and subsistence resources to support our PATT observing runs up to September 2010 when our PATT Linked Grant is formally renewed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H008527/1","grantId":"ST/H008527/1","fundValue":"20200","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  As noted this grant funded trips to telescopes, not research itself.
