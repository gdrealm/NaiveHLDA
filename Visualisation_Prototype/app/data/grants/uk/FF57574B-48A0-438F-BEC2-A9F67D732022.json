It is made by cells in the centre of the brain and flows out over the surface, draining into the blood. The CSF protects the delicate brain tissues in a number of ways. It acts as a shock absorber physically protecting the brain within the skull; it carries vitamins and hormones needed to keep the brain healthy; it acts as a waste removal system carrying away toxins from brain tissue as it drains into the blood. As we get older, less CSF is made and it takes longer to flow around the brain, so removal of toxins like amyloid-beta present in Alzheimer's disease is slowed down. There are also less of the CSF proteins that carry thyroid hormone and Vitamin A around the brain. In this study we will be examining whether any other proteins are changed in CSF with ageing and whether the changes are to do with genes. This will help us understand why brain functions decline with age. We will study more closely what happens to amyloid-beta in old CSF and how it enters the brain. For this we will use a genetically altered mouse model that does not make the CSF protein (transthyretin) known to protect the brain from amyloid damage. The transgenic mouse will be compared with normal mice, and both populations of mice will be studied when they are young, middle-aged and old. This work will help us understand the 'normal' changes to CSF that accompany old age, whether these are risk factors for late life diseases and whether replacing particular proteins may help prevent this.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D01381X/1","grantId":"BB/D01381X/1","fundValue":"426773","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Preston","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
