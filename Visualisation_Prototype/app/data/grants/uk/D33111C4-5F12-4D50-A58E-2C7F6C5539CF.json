The afterlife of specimens between art and science since the eighteenth century","abstractText":"Context of the research\\n\\nPrepared specimens appear in many guises: as stained and fixed tissue slices, as monstrous or typical organs preserved in formaldehyde and kept in glass jars not unlike pickled food, or as skilfully arranged stuffed animals. They may be found in cabinets of curiosities, in the laboratories of histologists, in anatomy theatres or in natural history collections, but nowadays equally in art galleries and the shop windows of fashionable boutiques. This project is concerned with such kinds of preserved natural objects, in particular with anatomical wet preparations and taxidermy since the eighteenth century. It will consider the hybrid status of these objects between nature and representation, art and science.\\nResearch on the material culture of science has been a thriving field in the history and anthropology of science for the past two decades. Recently scientific objects and images have also become of interest for historians of art and visual culture. The network will take these issues further by considering scientific objects with regards to their aesthetics and to their cultural significance. It will also consider the role artists played since the beginning of the twentieth century in calling attention to the aesthetics and politics of natural history museums and their objects.\\nThe network is a collaboration with several museum and collections, in particular The UCL Grant Museum for Zoology and medical collections; The Hunterian Museum, London; and The Museum of Natural History.\\n\\nAims and objectives\\n\\nThe research network takes a cross-disciplinary approach and aims to advance the exchange between zoologists, taxidermists, anatomical preparators, conservators, curators and scholars from various disciplines of the humanities as well as with artists. It will further the understanding of the transformation prepared specimens undergo from living organism to didactic object, collectible item or artwork, and of the processes these things are involved in as they are displayed and handled, conserved, re-arranged, or exposed to new audiences. These discussions shall lead to an interdisciplinary agenda in the understanding of scientific objects. The objective is to creatively think about ways of how to exhibit prepared specimens, in particularly sensitive materials, which means to address the ethical issues involved in the display of human remains. The research network aims to extend beyond the life of the grant and one of the agendas is to outline a proper exhibition on the topic.\\n\\nPotential applications and benefits\\n\\nThe network will, for the first time, provide a multidisciplinary approach to prepared specimens, their history and material idiosyncrasies.\\nBeneficiaries will be in particular:\\n- Historians of science will benefit from the broadening of the perspective towards the aesthetic and cultural dimension of prepared specimens.\\n- Art or cultural historians as well as artists will benefit from the engagement with prepared specimens as these objects challenge traditional notions of representation. The project will open a new field of art historical research and artistic practices, it will thus enrich these disciplines in general.\\n- Museums, museologists and curators will benefit from the discussion of the ethical implications of the display of human remains and of new forms of exhibiting scientific objects.\\n- Independent conservators or taxidermists are among the potential non-academic beneficiaries of the project. The question of how to deal with ephemeral organic substances is not limited to the field of scientific objects: Artists have been increasingly working with organic materials, and the preservation of art works that (were meant to) decay has become one of the most pressing questions also for museums, private galleries and the art market at large.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I001808/1","grantId":"AH/I001808/1","fundValue":"33744","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The Research Network 'The Culture of Preservation' was very momentous, as it coincided with a period during which many museums, and in particular University Collections, were rethinking their practice of collecting and display. Medical collections with preserved specimens had become obsolete as teaching tools, while there were at the same time ethical as well as historical and conservational concerns about their potential disposal. \nThe collaborations initiated by the network, and the discussions held at the various events, contributed to this discussion, and had, for example, an impact on the reconsideration of these collections at UCL, and renewed attempts to use them in teaching beyond the disciplines for which they were initially collected.

Foregrounding the aesthetics of specimens and their madeness, helps to critique the suggestion that they are simply nature displaying itself. \n\n- Specimen are more than objects to be looked at, especially before they were displayed in modern museums, they used to be handled, taken out of their jars. And They continue to be handled by conservators and curators.\n\n- Preserved specimens have always prompted emotional reactions, from curiosity and wonder, via disgust, affection to empathy or mourning. This makes their display and potential disposal a sensitive issue.\n\n- Artists and artistic interventions into natural history, medical or ethnographic museums have contributed considerably to the rethinking and updating of these institutions.\n\n- The 2004 Human Tissue Act, itself a reaction to changed sensibilities regarding the preservation and collection of organic materials deriving from human bodies, changed the status of preserved specimens, and probably unwittingly, produced the pseudo religious category of 'human remains'. The outcomes of our research might have an impact on curators in relevant museums and for University Collections. Our events, provided a model of how collections of preserved animal and human body can be made interesting and relevant for audiences beyond specialists.
