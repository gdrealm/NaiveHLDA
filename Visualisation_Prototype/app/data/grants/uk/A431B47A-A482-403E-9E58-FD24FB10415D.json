On Goldman Sachs projections China will be the worldâ€™s largest economy by 2050, and Russia its sixth largest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The project will seek to examine the following propositions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>that these two BRIC countries are becoming increasingly unequal</li>\n\n <li>that within them, political power and economic advantage are increasingly closely associated</li>\n\n <li>that their political systems have increasingly been employed to ensure that no effective challenge can be mounted to that combination of government position and economic advantage</li>\n\n <li>that set against a broader comparative perspective, an increasingly unequal society in which government is effectively immune from conventional challenge is likely to become increasingly regressive, or unstable, or both.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Evidence will be drawn from official statistics, interviews with policy specialists and government officials, two dozen focus groups, and an analysis of the composition of the management boards of the largest companies in both countries. A final part of the analysis will employ crossnational evidence to test a series of hypotheses relating to the association between inequality and political instability on a more broadly comparative basis.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J012688/1","grantId":"ES/J012688/1","fundValue":"456812","fundStart":"2012-08-26","fundEnd":"2016-08-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Leonard White","coPersons":["Neil Mallory Munro","Jane  Duckett","Ian  McAllister"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
