Yet there is surprisingly little evidence on the causal impact of this intervention.</p>\n\n<p>This project will provide the most comprehensive causal analysis of the effects of free childcare provision on maternal employment and child development using UK data.&nbsp; The project team will look at different instances of variation in the availability of free childcare for pre-school children in England. In particular, they will study:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the provision of free part-time childcare to the most disadvantaged children which characterised the UK policies of the 1990s</li>\n\n <li>the provision of universal entitlement to free part-time childcare introduced in the early 2000s</li>\n\n <li>date-of-birth discontinuities in entitlement to part-time pre-school care and full-time school education. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project will consider a wide range of outcomes including maternal employment, hours of work, working patterns, search behaviour and participation in further education, and - for the child - measures of educational attainment at various ages and socio-emotional development. Results will relate to different time-periods, policy settings and groups of families and therefore will inform on the effectiveness of various policy parameters.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K003232/1","grantId":"ES/K003232/1","fundValue":"145042","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Birgitta  Rabe","coPersons":["Emilia  Del Bono","Claire Louise Crawford","Mike  Brewer"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
