We have developed a hybrid experimental and theoretical approach to rapidly generate three dimensional models of large macromolecular complexes. We propose to develop new experimental techniques using lasers and mass spectrometry to (1) enable the application of these hybrid structural approaches to additional complexes that are incompatible with the our current methodology and (2) generate additional data that will significantly improve the quality of the resulting three dimensional models. The development of these experiments will significantly improve our ability to characterize the structures of macromolecular complexes. Moreover since complexes serve critical functions in vivo such knowlesge will ultimately affect human health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G024723/2","grantId":"BB/G024723/2","fundValue":"122964","fundStart":"2009-11-15","fundEnd":"2011-05-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Carol V Robinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
