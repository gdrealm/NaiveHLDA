The use of UCL tanks for the experiments proposed will ensure that a confidence level is achieved on the capability of UCL's tanks, towing rail and instrumentation and in future researchers will understand the limits of ability of the tank for trimaran research. 2) The experiments carried out will ensure a new data base of information that will be compiled and formulated into a data set being built at UCL for trimaran vessels and their design.3) It will allow UK and USA cooperation in ship design to be maintained and will develop strong relationships that would allow greater US and UK university cooperation which could include staff and student exchange.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G033846/1","grantId":"EP/G033846/1","fundValue":"16280","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alistair Russell GREIG","coPersons":["Richard William Bucknall","Kevin Robert  Drake"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
