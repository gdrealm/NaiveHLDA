The currents and mixing on the NW European continental shelf are dominated by the tide interacting with the sea bed, with density stratification occurring during summer months across ~80% of the region. Significant levels of biological primary production occur in these regions. However, the exchange of nutrients and carbon across these critical interfaces of stratified fluid is poorly understood and so is poorly represented in numerical models.\nThis project aims to compile the world's largest observational data base of shelf sea pycnocline turbulence and hydrographic measurements and to exploit state-of-the-art computer modelling and new observational technology to investigate, quantify, and parameterise the physical mechanisms and processes responsible for the fluxes across this critical interface. In particular we will develop improved understanding of pycnocline turbulence and mixing promoted by shear instability. We will test the hypothesis that these mechanisms, or interaction between mechanisms, drives pycnocline shear to levels which exceed a critical threshold beyond which there is a catastrophic loss of stability resulting in episodic mixing. Parameterisations for this mixing will be developed and tested.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L003325/1","grantId":"NE/L003325/1","fundValue":"420970","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Jeff  Polton","coPersons":["Maria  Luneva","Matthew Robert Palmer","Jason  Holt"],"organisation":"National Oceanography Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
