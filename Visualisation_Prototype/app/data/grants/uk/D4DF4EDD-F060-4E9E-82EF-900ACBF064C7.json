{"id":"D4DF4EDD-F060-4E9E-82EF-900ACBF064C7","title":"Social capital and the southern christian leadership conference","abstractText":"During the segregation era, racism largely limited blacks to their own communal resources by denying access to mainstream resources. This study examines the workings of Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Its goalsâ€”racial equality and integration-required the development of &quot;bridging&quot; social capital between black and white communities. But its operational strength lay in what might be termed &quot;bonding&quot; social capital (links inside the black community). SCLC's funding patterns reveal active social networks of donors and its &quot;Citizenship Education Program&quot; (a campaign to boost black political activism) illustrates how communal ties provide political leverage even for disadvantaged minorities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119155/1","grantId":"119155/1","fundValue":"171662","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-22","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Ling","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
