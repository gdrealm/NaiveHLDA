These inevitably have a critically important external dimension whereby they come into conflict with other countries working to exactly the same dynamic.&nbsp;Yet, even though all countries pursue multiple forms of ‘development diplomacy’ in arenas such as finance, trade and the environment, there presently exists no satisfactory study of the extent of the capacity of a country (or group of countries) to pursue such diplomacy effectively in a world order characterised by unequal power. This project focuses on the English-speaking countries of the Caribbean and examines the complex range of diplomatic pressures they currently face as they seek to negotiate the external dimensions of their preferred strategies of development.&nbsp;The study will illuminate the scope for state agency available to smaller, weaker states amidst the severe inequalities of opportunity, power and resource they confront.&nbsp;In so doing, it will bring the concept of inequality fully back into the study of international relations.&nbsp;The methodology to be used to carry out this research involves the analysis of primary and secondary material, supported by ‘off the record’ interviews in the field.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1796","grantId":"RES-000-22-1796","fundValue":"61340","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Payne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
