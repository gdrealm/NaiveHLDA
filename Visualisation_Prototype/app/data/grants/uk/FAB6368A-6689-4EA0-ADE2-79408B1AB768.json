{"id":"FAB6368A-6689-4EA0-ADE2-79408B1AB768","title":"Nonvolatile atom transistors and low-power logic systems","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to design and demonstrate novel non-volatile and extremely low-power logic systems by hybridizing the newly developed three-terminal metal oxide device, Atom Transistor and nano-electro-mechanical (NEM) systems for future beyond von Neumann computing. The hybrid systems are investigated theoretically and experimentally using world-leading nanotechnologies of the NIMS team in Japan and the Southampton team in the UK. The operation of the systems is studied both on the device and circuit levels by using a multi-scale hybrid modelling. Basic circuits such as inverters and power management systems are designed utilizing the unique characteristics of the Atom Transistors and NEM switches. The duality of volatile and non-volatile operations of the Atom Transistors enables to design a new type of non-volatile logic systems which is similar to neurons in the brain. A novel bistable sleep transistor is also designed based on the recently developed suspended-gate silicon nanodot memory (SGSNM) technology for advanced power management architectures. Prototyping the systems is carried out jointly by transferring samples as well as technologies between the two teams, and electrical testing the circuits is conducted using state-of-the-art characterization tools at Southampton Nanofabrication Centre. The first demonstration of the revolutionary non-volatile logic systems towards information technology in the next generation will provide opportunities to companies for further development and commercialisation in both Japan and the UK. This will thereafter contribute to further enhance the existing economic relations between the two countries as well as strengthening their economies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J000469/1","grantId":"EP/J000469/1","fundValue":"90573","fundStart":"2011-06-20","fundEnd":"2014-09-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"HIROSHI  MIZUTA","coPersons":["YOSHISHIGE  TSUCHIYA","Harold Meng Chong","Zakaria  Moktadir"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
