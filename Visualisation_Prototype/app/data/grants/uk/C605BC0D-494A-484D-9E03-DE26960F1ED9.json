We propose an adventurous combination of high-level DNA nanostructure design with state-of-the-art synthetic methodology to create designer materials that can be functionalized with nanometre precision and, through the reversibility of hybridisation and secondary structure formation, are responsive to external stimuli. We will synthesize chemically modified nucleosides bearing designer groups for electronics, biomolecule attachment and polymer-DNA hybrid material formation. Using the exquisite architectural control provided by DNA self-assembly, we will create nanostructures that incorporate these building blocks at programmable positions. We will focus on proof-of-concept experiments in areas covering molecular electronics, responsive materials and high-density sensor arrays.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I016651/1","grantId":"EP/I016651/1","fundValue":"201893","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Eugen  Stulz","coPersons":["Andrew Jonathan Turberfield"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" The project was concerned with the realisation of new DNA-based nano-structures with applications in hybrid materials, electronics and diagnostics. We have successfully expanded our previous research in the field of DNA-templated synthesis to obtain information-rich oligomeric molecules incorporating building blocks based on both natural amino acid analogues and non-biological functional groups. The DNA templated coupling reaction is based on Wittig chemistry, using amino acid building blocks attached to DNA adapters. Sequential chain transfer reactions have enabled us to obtain long oligomers which were previously inaccessible using similar DNA templated synthesis approaches. We also have also explored the routes to polymer-based DNA hybrid materials and to new electronic materials; however, given the short time frame of the project not all strands are complete. Pilot projects in progress include the formation of responsive hybrid materials based on a combination of thermo-responsive polymers attached to DNA nano structures and the creation of novel electronic wires based on the direct linking of porphyrins along a track laid out on DNA origami tiles. Initial experiments have demonstrated the successful attachment of polymers to DNA tetrahedra, and we have designed and synthesized novel porphyrin-based building blocks suitable for the creation of DNA-templated networks of molecular wires. The findings have been published in high-ranking peer review chemistry journals (Chemical Communications, Journal of the American Chemical Society). See 'Exploitation routes' To achieve their full potential impact, the ideas contained in this proposal will require research and development well beyond the scope of this proposal. In the stages of this initial project the principal beneficiary will be the academic community - particularly in the field of molecular nanotechnology, also in synthetic biology. The successful exploitation of an intelligent molecular templating system would lead to industrial interest, particularly in the sectors covering electronics and smart materials (optoelectronic components, electronic wires). Commercial adoption and development has the potential to contribute to the UK economy and to public health and standard of living, for example through innovations in drug development, manufacture and delivery, and in the development of novel prototyping and manufacturing techniques.
