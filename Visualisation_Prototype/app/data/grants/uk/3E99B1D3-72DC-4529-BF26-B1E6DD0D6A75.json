(NK) immune cells. This discovery could one day help scientists boost the body?s production of these frontline tumour-killing cells, creating new ways to treat cancer and other diseases including those caused by viral or parasite infections. NK cells ? a type of white blood cell - are a major component of the human body s innate, quick-response immune system. They provide a fast frontline defence against tumours, viruses and bacterial infections, by scanning the human body for cells that are cancerous or infected with a virus or a bacterial pathogen and killing them. \nNK cells - along with all other types of blood cell, both white and red - are continuously generated from blood stem cells in the bone marrow over the course of a person?s lifetime. We would like to progress to a drug treatment for cancer patients which reacts with the protein expressed by their E4bp4 gene, causing their bodies to produce a higher number of NK cells than normal, to increase the chances of successfully destroying tumours. If increased numbers of the patient?s own blood stem cells could be coerced into differentiating into NK cells, via drug treatment, we would be able to bolster the body?s cancer-fighting force. This research proposal seeks to map out the genetic pathway controlled by the E4bp4 ?master gene?. If we know the components required to produce NK cells we may be able to use drugs to act selectively on one of those components to increase NK cell numbers and hence their disease fighting capability in sufferers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901737","grantId":"G0901737","fundValue":"508397","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Hugh  Brady","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
