Although verbal memory has been researched extensively, memory for visuo-spatial information has received relatively little attention. This project aims to clarify how visuo-spatial memory function differs between individuals with and without dyslexia and the implications for memory accuracy. The research builds on pilot work which has suggested that that dyslexic and non-dyslexic individuals differ on memory for spatial information, particularly when the task also implicates distinctly visual processes. A series of 5 studies will employ variations on a well-established measure of memory for spatial locations, systematically varying presentation and recall conditions. Introduction of distracting material or concurrent tasks will highlight whether dyslexics have particular difficulties during encoding of information (perception and organisation), maintenance (storage) or recall (retrieving and reporting information in the required form). The instruction to employ specific recall strategies (visualising information in different ways, or recalling it in differing orders) will enable a comparison of dyslexic and non-dyslexic participantsâ€™ abilities to draw on distinctly visual and spatial processes.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2815","grantId":"RES-000-22-2815","fundValue":"80556","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison M Bacon","coPersons":["Fabrice Benoit Parmentier"],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
