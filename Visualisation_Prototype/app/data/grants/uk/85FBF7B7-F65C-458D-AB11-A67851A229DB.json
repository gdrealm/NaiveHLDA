Without any treatment options available, RP is severely debilitating to a patient population with many productive years of life ahead. Stem cells are recognised as offering unique therapeutic potential to treat diseases of the retina. ReNeuron owns exclusive commercialisation rights to a patented human retinal progenitor cell (hRPC) technology which offers a ground-breaking therapeutic opportunity for patients with RP to arrest on-going degeneration and regenerate sight. ReNeuron proposes to translate this opportunity through a milestone-driven and cost-effective preclinical efficacy, toxicology and safety development plan, leading to regulatory approval for a Phase I/II clinical trial in RP. ReNeuron’s hRPCs can be manufactured at scale and differentiate into photoreceptors leading to vision improvement in preclinical rodent models of degenerate retina.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_13038","grantId":"MC_PC_13038","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Alexander Vugler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
