{"id":"A5CD1FDA-31B6-4943-A038-AB02389B3156","title":"Short-term Visitors to Oxford Astrophysics","abstractText":"Research at Oxford spans a wide range of astronomy and astrophysics, from the largest scales in the Universe to observational work on stars and the interstellar medium. Almost all our research programmes are carried out in collaboration with scientists at other institutes, both in the UK and around the world. Hosting visitors from around the world allows us to do our research much more effectively, because even in the age of email and the internet there is no substitute for meeting face-to-face. It also ensures that our research is visible to the world and helps to promote science done in Oxford and the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E001564/1","grantId":"PP/E001564/1","fundValue":"38220","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Edward Jones","coPersons":["Steven  Rawlings","Katherine  Blundell"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
