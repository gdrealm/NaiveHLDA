This is especially true of bacteria that often have to live in inhospitable and fluctuating environments. An active yet still poorly understood area of research is how bacteria sense environmental change and the mechanisms they deploy to respond to such changes. This proposal focuses on these questions in the soil-living organism Streptomyces coelicolor, which is an ideal model for two reasons. First, its genome sequence shows the organism is well armed with genes that encode proteins likely to be involved in responding to environmental stresses but the mode of action of these have yet to be described. Second, the genus Streptomyces is the source of a multitude of commercially important antibiotics, anticancer agents and immunosuppressants, the production of which are likely linked to the organism's ability to respond to environmental changes and so by understanding the underlying mechanisms we may be able to affect the production of such therapeutic molecules. Our proposal focuses on one specific group of stress sensors which are in fact complexes of two proteins: One is a sigma factor that directs the main cellular enzyme responsible for the production of specific RNA molecules (RNA polymerase) to produce proteins which allow the cell to respond to environmental change; the other is an anti-sigma factor that binds to the sigma factor and blocks its ability to bind RNA polymerase. It is the anti-sigma factor's job to sense the environmental stress. It is known that this sensing mechanism involves the disabling of the anti-sigma factor, which releases the sigma factor to coordinate the cellular response to the stress. Although it has been over 15 years since we first described the presence of what is now recognised as a widespread group of ExtraCytoplasmic Function (ECF) sigma factors (Streptomyces alone has over 50 of them encoded in its genome), we still know surprisingly little about how anti-sigma factors bind ECF sigma factors or how environmental stresses disable them. We have recently uncovered the mechanism by which Streptomyces responds to a particular form of oxidative stress (the main causative agent of ageing) known as disulfide stress. Disulfides are covalent bonds formed between the sulfur atoms of two cysteine amino acids, which are ordinarily found in proteins that get secreted from cells (e.g. hormones such as insulin) to help stabilise them in the harsh extracellular environment. Such bonds however are toxic for proteins inside the crowded environment of the cell cytoplasm where they can cause the inactivation of enzymes and the aggregation of proteins. Streptomyces responds to the appearance of intracellular disulfide bonds by inactivating a specific anti-sigma factor (RsrA), which releases its sigma factor, sigma R, to mount an anti-oxidative response. We have determined the three dimensional structure of RsrA in its resting state, i.e. before it binds sigma factor. Comparison to related protein complexes reveals that RsrA engages in a new form of molecular recognition in which the protein essentially turns itself inside-out to bind sigma R. We have also determined the structure of the deactivated form of RsrA in which an internal disulfide blocks the ability of the protein to turn inside-out. This proposal aims to capitalise on these novel observations. We will investigate how RsrA turns inside-out to bind its sigma factor. We rationalise that this mechanism could be the basis for other forms of environmental stress sensing by this large group of cellular regulators. We will therefore uncover the activation signals for a select few anti-sigma factor/sigma factor pairings, which have yet to be studied, and compare them to the RsrA/sigma R complex. Our goal is to determine if the mechanism we have discovered represents a new paradigm in environmental stress sensing in microbes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I008691/2","grantId":"BB/I008691/2","fundValue":"354273","fundStart":"2012-04-16","fundEnd":"2014-10-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Kleanthous","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" We have discovered how a family or transcription regulators respond to redox stress. This is the group of proteins known as ZAS proteins. We have worked on the archetypal ZAS from Streptomyces coelicolor, RsrA and its cognate transcription factor SigR. In the event of oxidative stress SigR activates the expression of ~100 genes in this organism, including many anti-oxidants, and regulates the development of the organism and production of antibiotics.\n\nOur original objective was to solve the structure of the RsrA-SigR complex, or a homologue from another organism. We have tried unsuccessfully to achieve this. We have conducted 1000s of xtallization trials of the S. coelicolor and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex without obtaining diffraction quality crystals. We have also triply labelled the complex (2H, 1N, 13C) in order to determine the solution structure of this 35 kDa complex by NMR. However, while we managed to assign ~20-25% of the resonances for the complex many could not be assigned and/or were missing entirely from the spectrum. Critically, NOESY spectra for the complex were very poor. We used instruments in York, Oxford and Birmingham for these experiments. After 2 years we have had to abandon this approach. \n\nWe have nevertheless solved two NMR structures for RsrA, in its Zn-bound and oxidised states, the first for any ZAS regulator. These proteins are abundant in bacterial genomes. We are currently using cross-linking and HD exchange to map out contact sites in the complex which will be used as restraints to generate a docked complex structure.\n\nWe have also successfully determined the mechanism of oxidation of RsrA, using a combination of biophysical measurements including stopped-flow fluorescence. This work has definitively shown that this class of redox regulator only uses one molecule of zinc and that expulsion of the zinc is concomitant with formation of the trigger disulfide bond and dissociation of the RsrA-SigR complex. \n\nThis work is currently being prepared for publication. Our work on the oxidation mechanism of RsrA and its solution structure (+/- oxidation) will allow many other homologues in other bacteria to be modelled. These proteins regulate many different biological pathways in bacteria. for example, the equivalent system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is essential for pathogenicity in mice. Knowing how the complex responds to redox stress may provide a route for novel antimicrobials directed against TB. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
