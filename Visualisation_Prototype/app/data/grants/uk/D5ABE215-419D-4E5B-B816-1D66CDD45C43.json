{"id":"D5ABE215-419D-4E5B-B816-1D66CDD45C43","title":"Testing Academia and Industry Conference 2007","abstractText":"This proposal is a request for funding as partial support for holding the an International Workshop on Software Testing in the UK called Testing Academia &amp; Industrial Conference - Practice And Research Techniques (TAIC PART 2007).The workshop will combine industrial and academic participation to strengthen and develop UK leadership in the area of software testing. This event builds upon previous smaller workshops on testing held in the UK. Although it remains a workshop in character, the event's title includes the word `conference' to allowfor future growth. These events have steadily built a strong community of researchers and industrialists and the time is now ripe for this event to mature into a large more ambitious event. Funding is sought from EPSRC to support the event. This funding will be used tosupport the costs of the meeting. As a sign of their serious commitment to this venture, several of the industrial partners have already offered to support the event with a modest (but useful) level of sponsorship.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F012535/1","grantId":"EP/F012535/1","fundValue":"27531","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2007-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Harman","coPersons":["Philip Stephen McMinn"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
