{"id":"44140E4A-FEDB-4DBE-8A06-8042F4D6A790","title":"Oxidative ability of the mid-atlantic lower troposphere","abstractText":"The work described in this proposal seeks to undertake an integrated programme of research to investigate the linkages between tropical chemistry and the oxidative chemistry of the marine boundary layer. The influence of OVOC species on the oxidative chemistry of the marine boundary layer is poorly understood and yet could be an important mediator in climate related processes. Targetted field deployments at the UK SOLAS observatory in the Cape Verde islands will be used to investigate the linkages between peroxy radical and oVOC chemistry. Understanding the radical chemistry that controls ozone formation and the complex interactions and ratios of ozone precursors will improve the understanding of marine boundary layer oxidation chemistry and the way that is will adapt in future climate scenarios.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E011357/1","grantId":"NE/E011357/1","fundValue":"96246","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Steven Monks","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
