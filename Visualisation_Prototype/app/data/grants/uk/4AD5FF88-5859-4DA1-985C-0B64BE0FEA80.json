Thus, the improvement of our understanding and the modelling of how urban geometry can modify the natural ventilation of cities has become a crucial issue for the sustainable development of the United Kingdom (UK). According to DEFRA, the cost from the impacts of air pollution in the UK can be estimated to be between &pound; 9-19 billion every year, this is comparable to the economic cost of obesity (over &pound; 10 billion). \n\nCities can be viewed as a complex collection of structures of different scales (buildings of different size, large factories etc.). Research in the field of regional planning has shown that large urban areas have important fractal characteristics and there is evidence that non-fractal, but expanding, cities have also a tendency towards fractality. This project aims to create the foundations for a long-term research approach involving the development of environmental models able to quantify the relation between the fractal geometry of urban forms and their environmental performance. Large amounts of research have contributed towards the modelling and description of the fractal spatial characteristics of cities; however there is no evidence of how the reported fractal geometry can be related to flow characteristics and ventilation rates.\n\nThis project will experimentally quantify the relationship between a multi-scale group of obstacles, which could be a generic group of buildings, and the flow structure developed within and over a large group of obstacles. It is expected that the results obtained from this project will facilitate innovative approaches to tackling the current scientific and applied challenges involved in the modelling of urban flows, but will also provide results generic enough to trigger the development of similar approaches in the wider context of environmental fluid mechanics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L026457/1","grantId":"EP/L026457/1","fundValue":"100466","fundStart":"2014-08-15","fundEnd":"2016-08-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Wernher  Brevis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
