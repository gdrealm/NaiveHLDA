The material multi-functionality will exploit the team's new findings regarding internal resistance governance, and several key properties have been identified, which will require further investigation. These primarily focus (amongst many other things) on cost of raw materials &amp; production; efficacy in a broad range of environmental /operating conditions; optimal structural porosity characteristics for moisture control and concomitant ion conductivity; modularity of stack design for plug &amp; play systems. These explorations can only benefit the society if implemented in practical applications, which can demonstrate their value to the public; e.g. the EcoBot platform, urine utilisation and intelligent toilets, as well as MFC domestic battery chargers. Such multidisciplinary work can progress at an accelerated pace if appropriate collaboration with world leaders is established, which is at the core of this programme of work. The Fellowship pioneering work on MFC-powered robots and devices paved the way to scale-up, by introducing the 'miniaturisation &amp; multiplication' approach - an area that the UK maintains the lead. This forms the basis for the new direction research in materials and manufacturing. It is an area, which has so far received very little attention, yet it is directly on the critical path towards realising impact, which can be achieved through the commercialisation of the more mature aspects of the work. It is therefore both timely and at the forefront of the MFC research, thereby strengthening the UK lead in this pioneering area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L002132/1","grantId":"EP/L002132/1","fundValue":"247108","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The scientific findings from this research have been implemented in practical applications, not just for proof-of-concept purposes, but also for bringing the microbial fuel cell technology closer to market and the society. The work from the New Directions grant that has stemmed from the Career Acceleration Fellowship has been the main reason for the further funding from the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and also for the acceleration of the career and the establishment of the new Centre of Excellence (B-BiC).
