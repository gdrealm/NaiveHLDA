The research will focus on elective total hip replacements and revascularisations and examine equality of access in those procedures. In determining the effects of market-oriented reform on access to these practices, the study will take account of geographical variations in need, supply and other factors that influence use of care, changes in demographics and changes in geographical boundaries The study will track variations in use by the populations of over 8,000 small areas (electoral wards) in England over the decade, compiling a dataset that analyses utilisation by area and also tracks variations in socio-economic status, GP fund-holding penetration and hospital competition for each area over time.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-166-25-0055-A","grantId":"RES-166-25-0055-A","fundValue":"36325","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings on competition in the NHS were presented at workshops attended by senior UK academics working in the field and senior policy makers from the Department of Health. As far as I know senior people in the policy making community are now aware that past pro-competition reforms of the NHS in fact had no measurable impact on healthcare inequality, despite dire warnings of such impacts at the time. However, it is not possible to say what actual impact these findings had on subsequent naitonal policy on competition in the NHS.

I have developed methods for using small area level administrative data to analyse the effects of competition and other policy interventions on socioeconomic inequality in health care. I continue to use these methods in my own programme of research, now funded by the NIHR. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
