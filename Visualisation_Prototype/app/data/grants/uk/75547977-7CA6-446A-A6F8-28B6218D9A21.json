{"id":"75547977-7CA6-446A-A6F8-28B6218D9A21","title":"Bio-renewable Formulation Information and Knowledge Management System","abstractText":"The project will build a demonstration information and knowledge management system (IKMS) to facilitate innovation with\nnew and replacement chemical materials from renewable biomass in formulated products. The IKMS will enable functional\ningredients from simple transformations of feedstocks to be identified more quickly and recommend the best feedstocks for\na particular function. If successful, it will repair a disconnection in the supply chain for exploitation of bio-based and\nrenewable materials as functional ingredients in formulated products, creating significant business benefit to the commercial partners and, following dissemination and further development, to the UK bio-based materials sector and\nformulated products businesses as a whole. The demonstrator will focus on a search for bio-surfactant innovations, and will\nbe innovative in itself by both integrating several IT tools for the first time in a radical approach to formulated product design\nand by being the first of its kind to be applied across a chemical using industry supply chain.\nThe ambition of the system is that it will collate and manage existing data with new data recovered from the experimental\nmeasurements and use this to update the models applied by the search tools. An automated data-driven modelling tool will\nbe developed and integrated into the system for this purpose. As data is added and as models are improved, the\nperformance of the selection algorithms will improve along with the chances that the selected ingredient and formulation\ncandidates will meet downstream commercialisation criteria. It is important to note that modelling methods used here are\nquite different but complementary to those to be developed under the TSB funded ICT project 101508, which are physicsbased\nrather than data-driven, and will provide powerful capability for fast selection of novel chemistries against a subset of\nfilter criteria and provide mechanistic insights to sharpen these filters for better precision and better experimental assay\ndesign.\nTo achieve its objectives, the project will extend the 101508 information model and add a repository to store formulation\ninformation (composition and assembly) and property data (experimental and computed) to complement the feedstock and\ntransformation repositories. The information model and repository will need to be chemically intelligent, use readily\nextensible RDF and triple store technologies, and incorporate semantic search capabilities to facilitate integration.\nModelling tools will be adapted and implemented using modern machine learning methods to find the mathematical\nrelationships between ingredient structure and properties, and between formulation composition and assembly with\napplication performance. The models will be built on data created during the project and added to the 101508 model\nrepository. The 101508 tools for enumerating ingredient options (from feedstocks and chemical transformation processes)\nwill be extended to enumerating formulations (from ingredients and assembly processes). The enumeration tools will be\ncoupled to a global many-objective search tool using diversity or chemical structure/formulation composition/assembly -\nproperty models for efficient exploration of the combinatorial ingredient/formulation space.\nWe will also develop tools to help maintain and grow the IKMS with minimal overhead to future projects. These include\nsemantic search and semi-automated extraction of appropriate data from literature and other available resources, and for\nontological integration and semi-autonomous building of ontologies where these do not exist.\nIn order to demonstrate how this system will work in practice, novel bio-surfactants identified in 101508 will be made and\ntheir properties measured, a selected sub-set formulated and evaluated and the data and derived models used to drive\nanother cycle of bio-surfactant selection and formulation optimisation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L50578X/1","grantId":"EP/L50578X/1","fundValue":"178116","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert David Stevens","coPersons":["Goran  Nenadic"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
