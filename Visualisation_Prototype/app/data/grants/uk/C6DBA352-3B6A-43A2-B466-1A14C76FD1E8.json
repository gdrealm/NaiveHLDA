Teachers will develop a local network of KS2 science co-ordinators and teachers, and will share resources, ideas, good practice and contacts. They will also have a range of new ideas to help them in the teaching of space science in future years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K005774/1","grantId":"ST/K005774/1","fundValue":"5265","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Amy  Oxley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Wyvil Primary School","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
