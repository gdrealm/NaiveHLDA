{"id":"2C4A6691-7940-4397-8BE1-15B4A64DCD6A","title":"Literary and historical commentary on Thucydides books 6 and 7","abstractText":"My project was to write and complete a historical and literary commentary of Thucydides books 6 and 7. ('Books' mean sub-sections of the whole work, the surviving part of which is divided into eight 'books'). Thucydides lived in the second half of fifth century BC and perhaps into the fourth. Books 6 and 7 of his History describe the ambitious but catastrophic Athenian invasion of Sicily, in 415-413 BC. They are acknowledged to be a high point of ancient Greek literature and are full of poetic resonances. But they also raise historical problems, which go to the root of Thucydides credibility. That was my project, and I completed it by the end of 2006, in 725 pages of 1.5 spacing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E505201/1","grantId":"AH/E505201/1","fundValue":"23125","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Hornblower","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
