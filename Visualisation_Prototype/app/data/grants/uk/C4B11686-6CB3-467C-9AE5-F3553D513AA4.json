However, to fully exploit the opportunities heralded by access to this vast amount of information, a much greater understanding of the mechanisms that induce genetic alteration is required.\nThis proposal seeks to bring expertise in fundamental aspects of genetic variability together with clinical scientists concerned with investigating the impact of variation as a cause or contributor to human diseases. The objective is to maintain and expand a highly productive network at Leicester for the sharing of techniques, equipments and concepts unified by the study of the human genome. This Cooperative seeks to significantly enhance the speed of translation of fundamental discoveries of DNA variability and its inherent instability, into the development of novel strategies for targeted approaches to understanding the mechanisms leading to ill-health in humans.\nThe COGG is embedded within the Institute of Genetics at Leicester, which has invested in developing and maintaining a high quality website to illustrate and inform interested parties regarding the breadth of genetics-based activities and research ongoing at Leicester. Furthermore, individual COGG members will continue to speak regularly to a very broad range of public engagement in science events. The COGG will be further highlighted by the recent Queen?s Anniversary Award. The COGG members have strong links with educational establishments across the region and regularly provide talks and support seminars to sixth form students.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9806740","grantId":"G9806740","fundValue":"719571","fundStart":"1999-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alec John Jeffreys","coPersons":["Mark Alexander Jobling","Paul Richard Burton","Richard Charles Trembath","Nicola  Royle","Nilesh Jayantilal Samani","Yuri E Dubrova"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
