{"id":"F7F553E2-2159-4E46-989E-261D2A5AB169","title":"Corruption in (Non-)Criminal Commercial Enterprise: Law, Theory and Practice","abstractText":"This proposal reflects the AHRC's Research Networking Scheme's Highlight Notice for 'cross-disciplinary research networks exploring emerging areas of cross-cultural enquiry'. More specifically, this proposal is located within the RCUK's Global Uncertainties Programme (now the Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research) and particularly addresses the 'transnational organised crime' theme of the Highlight Notice. \n\nWe propose an innovative and original collaborative research network that will bring together academics, practitioners and policymakers with expertise in the areas of organised crime and corruption, and the interdependencies between these, in the context of criminal and non-criminal enterprise in domestic and international commerce in OECD countries. The Network will integrate the law and criminology research expertise of the coordinators with that of other arts and humanities disciplines (e.g. philosophy, film studies, political science/studies, economics and business) and the sciences (e.g. computational science, the information and communications technology field) and will engage with academic and non-academic participants from several jurisdictions to ensure the cross-fertilisation of knowledge and cross-cultural, comparative insights. \n\nThe substantive focus of the proposal is on (1) the social and criminal organisation of corrupt relations, practices and processes within criminal and non-criminal commercial enterprises that operate both domestically and transnationally across OECD countries, and on (2) law, theory and practice on how we can understand, predict/detect and act against/intervene with such phenomena. The proposal brings together two often discrete research areas, those of 'organised crime' and 'corruption' and is organised around three complementary streams: \n\n- Stream I: Identifying and understanding corrupt activities within/by non-criminal commercial enterprise (i.e. corruption within/by legitimate businesses per se); \n- Stream II: identifying and understanding corrupt activities within/by criminal commercial enterprise (i.e. corruption within/by formally legitimate businesses that are controlled by organised crime groups, and also corruption by/within entirely criminal entities, like drug cartels); and,\n- Stream III: Identifying and understanding corrupt activities at the intersections of criminal and non-criminal commercial enterprises. \n\nIt is anticipated that the research network will have notable scientific and social impact, advancing theoretical, conceptual and methodological insights into corruption in (non-)criminal commercial enterprise and having practical use for state (e.g. law enforcement agencies) and non-state (e.g. business compliance) responses. For instance, the network will result in evidence-led and practice-relevant research, informed by the needs and experiences of policymakers and practitioners, in the areas of organised crime and corruption - these are key challenges in establishing security and protecting business interests in the UK but also in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice as envisaged by the European Union.\n\nIt moves beyond the traditional academic focus on discrete causes and responses, and makes new connections between economics insights, criminology, philosophy and law. It will also facilitate ideas for the development of ICT tools which may minimise corruption, informed by criminological research, cultural studies and economics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N002180/1","grantId":"AH/N002180/1","fundValue":"33324","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Liz  Campbell","coPersons":["Nicholas James Lord"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
