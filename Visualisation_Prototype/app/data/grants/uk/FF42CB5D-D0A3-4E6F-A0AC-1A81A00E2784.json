Two professionals have reported a direct impact of the research on their practice. (1) MELANIE FRANKLIN, MALVERN TRAINING Following the first practitioner workshop, Melanie Franklin has been able to validate storytelling as a communication tool and help an international law firm improve external communication. Specifically, she developed a seven-stage storytelling process to structure her clients’ engagement with the story that they seek to tell. Melanie explained in a telephone interview in September 2012 that her work helped the client organisation develop and maintain its customer base. She has since used the same process with other clients. (2) DARRYL WARDEN, BT SOUTH TYNESIDE Following preliminary reports, Darryl Warden explained how the research has enabled him to understand and express the value of storytelling in managing organisational change. The association of story with a continuing journey towards a better future has had a two-fold benefit for his professional practice. Firstly, talking about an improved future state that the organisation is creating in terms of story allows a conversation among organisational actors about what is happening in the organisation in a more constructive way. Rather than getting unsettled about difficulties, his fellow employees accepted that, metaphorically speaking, most journeys have bumpy stretches and that their current difficulties can and will be overcome. Secondly, when Darryl was asked to talk about the change story of his organisation to a different one, he was able to focus on organisational actors’ experiences with change and to present it in such a way that engaged his audience. During a follow-up interview in September 2012, Darryl explained that he has received positive feedback from the organisation in question, of which the PI has a copy.

It can be used at strategic, operational and interpersonal level. Managers may refer to the past in the form of ‘Well, remember…’ stories or the future in the form of ‘Imagine if…’ stories to shape their subordinates’ cognition and behaviour.\n\n\n\n2. Purposive storytelling offers significant opportunities to improve communication, but also contains significant risks. There is a risk of cynical reactions among the audience if storytelling is not relevant to them, if it is not supported by managers’ actions and the wider teller-audience relationship.\n\n\n\n3. Few interviewees demonstrated awareness of managers’ storytelling. Others reported mixed perceptions ranging from scepticism (‘a story is told to butter you up for bad news’) to wholehearted approval (‘my manager is perceived as odd because he doesn’t do storytelling’). The wider context in which storytelling takes place, particularly the teller-audience relationship, mediates how storytelling is received.\n\n\n\n4. The research found no significant difference in communication between managers employing storytelling purposively and those who do not. The reason may be that most managers tell stories intuitively. However, some managers were regarded as ‘real storytellers’ by their subordinates, implying a talent for storytelling. \n\n\n\n5. Storytelling is a means for everyday communication in management practice. Specific purposive uses include shaping organisational actors’ sensemaking of organisational realities, building and maintaining professional relationships, and developing staff. \n\n\n\n6. For manager interviewees, storytelling emerges naturally out of interaction with others. They tailor their storytelling to specific situations in their practice rather than following a prescribed formula. Among expert interviewees there is wider variety of practice, including building repertoires of stories and practising them. \n\n\n\n7. The research has identified key factors determining the effectiveness of purposive storytelling, which include the teller-audience relationship, timing, context, performance and audience’s ‘baggage’. The research has had a direct impact on management and professional practice. Following engagement with the research, practitioners have reported the development of a storytelling process to enhance organisational communication and they have highlighted the value of notions of storytelling in dealing with complex organisational change. \n\n\n\nMoreover, the research provides a much needed critical voice in the otherwise overly optimistic literature on storytelling in management practice. Consequently, management practitioners and consultants will be able to make more informed decisions about whether storytelling will be the right tool for resolving their specific organisational issue. The research offers empirical understanding of how storytelling is used by managers in their daily practice and of how it is received by employees. The findings provide scholars of organisation and communication with a sound foundation for further theorising, for instance in relation to:\n\n\n\n1. the purposes of storytelling identified above;\n\n2. the benefits and potential risks of using purposive storytelling;\n\n3. the effects of talent on a storytelling performance, and \n\n4. the intricacies of the teller-audience relationship more generally.\n\n\n\nGiven the early interest in studying storytelling in management practice, theoretical advances are crucial to provide new insights into effective management practice and develop the field of interest further.
