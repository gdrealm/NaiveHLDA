{"id":"8D6FBCD7-4865-4ADB-9D3B-B931A3B0204C","title":"The endocrinology of the upper gastrointestinal tract","abstractText":"Diseases of the upper digestive tract include cancer of the stomach, and peptic ulcer. Worldwide, stomach cancer accounts for about 500,000 deaths each year. Drugs that reduced stomach acid cost the health service in this country about #500M per year. We propose to study a hormone, gastrin, that is known to control acid production and the ability of the stomach to produce acid. Recent work suggests that there is a complex mixture of different forms of gastrin that have different actions; some of these substances may also regulate processes that determine the development of stomach cancer. We propose experiments to define the relevant mechanisms. We will work with cells obtained from the stomach of normal human subjects, and with experimental mice in which some of the genes for proteins known to be involved in these processes have been mutated. We want to understand more about how the cells of the stomach are enabled to produce acid, how the stomach protects itself from acid and how it responds to a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori (which in some people may cause stomach cancer, or ulcers in the duodenum). Using, in part, information derived from the human genome sequence, we have recently found several previously unsuspected genes that are implicated in these processes, and that we propose to study in more detail. This information should help in understanding the best way for clinicians to manage individual patients who are at risk of developing these diseases. The results will be published in the normal scientific way; important discoveries will be disseminated through press releases. In the past, the applicants have been asked from time to time to provide expert information to the media, and they will continue to do this drawing on their own recent research experience.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G8714277","grantId":"G8714277","fundValue":"3566780","fundStart":"1988-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham John Dockray","coPersons":["Alastair  Watson","Rod  Dimaline"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
