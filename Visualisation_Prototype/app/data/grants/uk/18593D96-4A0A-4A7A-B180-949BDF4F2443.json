{"id":"18593D96-4A0A-4A7A-B180-949BDF4F2443","title":"Computational modelling of cell movement and chemotaxis","abstractText":"Cell movement is important in health and in disease. In health, white blood cells must migrate out of blood vessels and through tissues to where they are needed. Conversely, if cells move when they should not, it can cause great harm - the most obvious example is metastasis, when a cancer spreads from a tumour to distant parts of the body. Despite this cell movement is poorly understood. We propose to build a computer model that accurately mimics cell movement, and to use it to sort, test and validate different theories of how cells move. We also propose to train a mathematics expert so he can cross over into the biology field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802579","grantId":"G0802579","fundValue":"93716","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Insall","coPersons":["John  MacKenzie","Steven D Webb"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
