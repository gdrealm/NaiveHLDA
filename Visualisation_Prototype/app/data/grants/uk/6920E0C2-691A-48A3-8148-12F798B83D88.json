The hypothesis is that changes to these conversion points are critical to systemic sustainability and adaptability. But very few attempts have been made to consider how integrating or rebalancing (using less or more of) particular conversion points could make significant improvements to sustainability and adaptability of the system overall. This needs to be researched in the context of the user and the environment. The outcome of the current single utility approach is that power, water, transport etc are integrated at the point of use to create services demanded by end users. Services that help to shape sustainable behaviour are critical to the development of the infrastructure itself. The project will make use of existing research, such as that for energy use in the home, in order to ground our understanding of utility services needs. A fundamentally important aspect of national infrastructure is its technological context. Older infrastructure was built with a mechanical focus during a Taylorist machine paradigm. The global information (and network) age is upon us, with diverse opportunities in nanotechnology, hydrogen, battery storage, etc. In particular the ability to transmit information about utility operation and demand using telecommunications has been applied successfully to improve individual utility efficiency. The project will identify the latest relevant technologies and upcoming inventions and trends so that it frames proposals for change to the national utilities infrastructure in the current/future technological paradigm. \nOur methodology to deliver this research this is to\n1. Create a map of current conversion points and so identify the critical parts of the national infrastructure, volumes, network structures, institution types, regulators, and so on. \n2. Create a base-line agent based model to demonstrate the sustainability and adaptability of the current national utilities infrastructure, focusing on efficiency losses and resilience issues at conversion points. A system as large as the national infrastructure cannot be readily experimented upon and so modeling is one of few appropriate methods which have a successful track record adding insights not discernable by other methods since they are better at reflecting real world systems. The model will incorporate environmental factors, such as diminishing fossil fuels, services focus and adoption of appropriate technology, and so combine existing research. All aspects of the model will be guided by the expert knowledge of the team.\n3. Run a workshop bringing together representatives from all utilities, including regulators, policy makers, major and minor firms, scientists and technologists, allowing expert opinions to be debated. The key outcome is a prioritized list of future scenarios which are service focused and in the context of technological possibilities. \n4. The base-line model will be developed to include the future scenarios. The most favourable scenario (or two) which generates the greatest improvement in efficiency and resilience of the system, will be further developed to create a convincing quantified case for transforming utility conversion points. There will be an analysis over time of the changes to efficiencies as a result of the transformations, which will enable a business case to be developed and incorporate changes needed to existing legislation, regulation and policy. \n5. A second workshop will review the results of futures model, allowing stakeholders to verify and challenge the results, and to plan for changes using the demonstrable recommendations for improvement to sustainability and adaptability. \nThis project is complementary to other projects awarded funding in the Assets Sandpit, aligning with a services, integrated, technological and simplified view of national infrastructure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J005649/1","grantId":"EP/J005649/1","fundValue":"309728","fundStart":"2011-09-12","fundEnd":"2013-09-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used to elevate the value of an agent based modelling approach to understanding that utility systems are complex systems of systems with multiple interdependencies and opportunities for improvements in resource-efficiency and system outcomes (e.g. reduced CO2) Energy,Environment,Transport,Other Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Liz Emma Varga","coPersons":["Joby  Boxall","Phil  Blythe","Fatih  Camci","Colin Anthony Taylor"],"organisation":"Cranfield University","findingsText":" 1. The creation of a way to systemically represent all the components of an infrastructure system that can cope with multiple resources (input and output); technologies (and related efficiencies and material use); and policies (constraining and enabling different conversions), all at multiple scales.\n2. The importance of storage technologies in infrastructure systems is a significant area for development and has immense potential for the exploitation of renewable energy.\n3. That the end to end utilities infrastructure system should be driven by 'demand for services from infrastructure' rather than the supply of infrastructure products. \n4. Regulators and policy makers should realise that continued adoption of household level technologies makes outcomes systemically worse and that the energy mix needs to change to have significant impact on costs, carbon emissions, ability to satisfy demand and resource (over)use. This will help increase the effectiveness of regulation and policy for utility providers.\n5. The value of meso level solution such as district heating creates a spatial focus for the production and delivery of some utilities. \n6. 'Smart' solutions which can automate user preferences and can learn from user behaviours have the potential to improve utility planning and resource efficiency, improving economic performance at all scales as well as improving quality of life.
