This can be done without harming the patient in any way. These technologies allow us to monitor treatment and guide therapies to where they are most needed. The 3D imaging techniques such as X-ray CT and MRI have only been around for 30 years yet in that time they have transformed healthcare. In recent years there have been significant advances in extending imaging methods, in particular optical techniques, to investigate the function of living cells that make up the human body and the interactions between the molecules that govern the functions of these cells. The level of detail provided by these images covers 6 orders of magnitude, often in 3D. This has created a challenge to find ways to understand how to relate relevant information across this wide range of spatial scale. This is required in order to better understand the function and interactions of the body?s organs, and their constituent cells, together with the molecular interactions that control their function in health and disease. Many of these imaging technologies also provide time varying information so that dynamic processes can be observed and measured. While these ?movies? provide invaluable information on dynamic and time changing processes that are so important in understanding normal metabolic function and disease, their analysis provides particularly difficult computational and mathematical challenges. This programme will bring together some of the world?s leading physical scientists, mathematicians, life scientists and clinicians to exploit these opportunities to establish research programmes to better understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease and ultimately to devise and test new therapies that result from this better understanding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0502254","grantId":"G0502254","fundValue":"326254","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Hawkes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
