{"id":"6B343AEE-8E7F-4CE5-BDB8-23FAC58E9C19","title":"Nanoenabled Peptide Pills - Unlocking the Potential of Therapeutic Peptides","abstractText":"The poor bioavailability of peptides, nature's own 'drugs', limits their therapeutic application. The molecular envelope technology (MET) delivery platform allows their use as nano-enabled 'Peptide Pills'. The multi-disciplinary 'Peptide Pill' consortium, comprising drug delivery scientists, neuroscientists, physicists, chemical engineers and clinicians, will develop the pain peptide pill METDoloron. It is estimated that 20% of European adults suffer from chronic pain, which is often inadequately controlled by opioids. Additionally opioids can sometimes cause life threatening side effects. METDoloron avoids these problems by targeting a different receptor to currently used opioids, using an endogenous peptide derivative\nand is therefore expected to have a significant impact on the large (US$ 50 billion), fragmented, and growing global market for pain therapeutics. The project partners will confirm METDoloron pharmacology, investigate nanoparticle transport mechanisms, establish scale-up and manufacturing processes, and confirm product (GLP) safety thus creating know-how in biophotonics, pain therapy, flow reactor design and nanoparticle processing techniques. First in man clinical trials will commence on conclusion of this project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K502339/1","grantId":"EP/K502339/1","fundValue":"95419","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The work carried out in EP/K502339/1 has supported a TSB project lead by Nanomerics Ltd for the development of a novel nanoparticle drug delivery system for enhancing the uptake of peptides into the brain.

The launch of METDoloron, a new pain therapeutic with a better safety profile, should contribute to the UK's economic competitiveness, as royalties will flow to Nanomerics. \n\n\n\nWith respect to quality of life improvements METDoloron is expected to provide improved pain therapy, with fewer deleterious Healthcare,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
