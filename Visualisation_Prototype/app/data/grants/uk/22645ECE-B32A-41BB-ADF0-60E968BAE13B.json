{"id":"22645ECE-B32A-41BB-ADF0-60E968BAE13B","title":"The UK Herschel Outreach Programme","abstractText":"The Herschel Space Observatory is due to be launched in April 2009. The aim of this application is to maximise the educational and public outreach (EPO) opportunities afforded by this launch. The coincidence of the launch date (and the crucial science demonstration phase) with the International Year of Astronomy (IYA) provides us with a unique opportunity to publicise STFC-funded science and technology, as the public will already be exposed to a great deal of astronomy through various channels. The outreach programme we propose has several elements; - Herschel Outreach Officer - a dedicated single-point of contact for UK. Herschel EPO activities. - Herschel show - via a professional science communications company. - Herschel exhibitions - fixed and travelling exhibits. - Website development - with full interactive and educational content, linked to the national curriculum. - Popular talks by Herschel science team members. - Media training for Herschel team members. - Herschel portable art installation - developed by contracted artist, with content based on an interpretation of artwork produced by schools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H000453/1","grantId":"ST/H000453/1","fundValue":"85000","fundStart":"2009-08-26","fundEnd":"2012-02-25","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Hargrave","coPersons":["Haley Louise Gomez","Matt  Griffin","Paul  Roche"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
