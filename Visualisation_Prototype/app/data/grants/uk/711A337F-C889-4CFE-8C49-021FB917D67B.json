{"id":"711A337F-C889-4CFE-8C49-021FB917D67B","title":"Small items of research equipment at the University of Strathclyde","abstractText":"The focus of research in universities such as Strathclyde is increasingly aligned with meeting the needs of society in key areas such as energy, health, manufacturing, the environment, and advanced science and engineering. In addition to helping produce innovative solutions to major challenges in these areas, universities are charged with developing the skills and experiences of early career researchers (ECRs), from PhD students to new academic and research staff, to ensure that our future research leaders have the knowledge and abilities to contribute as effectively as possible to the well-being of our society and its citizens. \n\nIn meeting these obligations, it is essential, especially in science and engineering, that the equipment base available to our ECRs is appropriate to the task and is of the highest quality. The availability of large and often expensive instrument facilities is crucial to ensuring that research in UK universities is world leading. To complement these advanced experimental facilities, improvements in the number and quality of small items of equipment can have a major impact on productivity, and the quality and quantity of research outputs. In addition, it can help to promote the early impact of research outputs in industry and society. \n\nThe University of Strathclyde has identified where additional small equipment resource would have a major benefit to ECRs working on projects in a range of topics under the general themes of energy, healthcare technologies, manufacturing, environmental sustainability, information and communication technologies (ICT), physical science and engineering. The equipment will enhance the training of PhD students in topics of national importance, extend the scope of the research achievements of our Research staff, and accelerate the progress of new Academic staff and their ability to become future research leaders of the highest quality. The items of equipment that we have identified will improve our capabilities and make significant contributions to research outputs in a range of projects. \n\nFor example, in Manufacturing, research into techniques in nano materials and analysis associated with two areas of healthcare, will be transformed by removing delays in accessing equipment and extending the range of operations that can be conducted by ECRs. This will bring benefits to the modelling, development, manufacture and application of nano-structured materials, for carbon capture, environmental remediation, and sustainable chemical feedstocks, and provide enhanced capability in medical device and prosthetics manufacture, and in the development of micro-fluidic and lab-on-a-chip techniques for small scale specialist bio and medical materials manufacture. \n\nIn Environmental Engineering, the new items of equipment will extend research on crucial aspects of environmental monitoring and control, including ground aperture sealing for carbon capture and nuclear waste disposal, rock and soil permeability monitoring and control, and the development of new land/water remediation techniques for cleansing of organic species. \n\nIn Engineering Asset Management, the proposed equipment will open new opportunities for the ECRs researching combustion and emission diagnostics and efficiency improvements in gas turbine engines and power generating equipment. Benefits in this theme will also be realised for ECRs developing imaging technologies for the food and drink, and pharmaceuticals industries. These are just some examples of the areas of research that will benefit from the enhanced equipment resource at Strathclyde. Similar benefits and advances will be achieved in the fields of Energy, ICT, Lasers and HealthCare Technologies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031260/1","grantId":"EP/K031260/1","fundValue":"499288","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Littlejohn","coPersons":["Walter  Johnstone","Rein  Ulijn"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
