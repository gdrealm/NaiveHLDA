{"id":"F24B30EC-C143-4E2F-B9EF-FD3356CB97BA","title":"A Rolling Grant in Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics","abstractText":"Many astrophysical phenomena involve the complex interaction between magnetic fields, rotation and fluid flows. We intend to undertake a systematic and integrated programme of research to investigate this complex interaction in a wide variety of astrophysical objects. We shall utilise a combination of analytical and numerical techniques (including the application of cutting edge numerical algorithms optimised for use on massively parallel machines) to gain an understanding of such phenomena. Our unifying philosophy is to investigate the underlying fundamental physical interactions in these astrophysical fluids and to use expertise gained in one area in order to make progress on different objects that have the same underlying physical structures. The physical phenomena that we address are (1) The generation of magnetic fields in the Sun, including the formation of the well-known eleven year sunspot cycle. (2) The structure of sunspots and the link with the magnetic fields in the solar corona. (3) The form of convection and the generation of magnetic fields in planets. (4) The decay of magnetic fields in neutron stars (5) The dynamics of rapidly-rotating stars.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E001092/1","grantId":"PP/E001092/1","fundValue":"2556760","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David  Hughes","coPersons":["Rainer  Hollerbach","Alastair  Rucklidge","Christopher Andrew Jones","Steve  Tobias"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
