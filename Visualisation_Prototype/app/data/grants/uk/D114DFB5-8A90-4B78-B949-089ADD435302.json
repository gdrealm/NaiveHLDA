The principal advantage of the frequency conversion approach introduced here is that the wavelength to be generated is not fixed at the wafer growth stage, but is instead determined by lithography in the post-growth processing. As such it is feasible to conceive of several devices, each with modest tunability, monolithically integrated on a single semiconductor chip. This research builds on key technologies where we already have an extensive track record in semiconductor nonlinear optics, semiconductor ring lasers and III-V integration technologies. The minaturisation of infrared optical sources, in comparison to large and expensive desktop systems, will be enabled by fabricating the frequency conversion element within a high finesse semiconductor ring laser cavity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E009972/1","grantId":"EP/E009972/1","fundValue":"411124","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Hutchings","coPersons":["Marc  Sorel","A.
