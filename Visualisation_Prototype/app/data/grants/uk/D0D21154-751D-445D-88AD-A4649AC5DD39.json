The most important question is of course, why is the superconducting transition temperature so high and how might it be raised even further? A strongly linked question to this is, what is the nature of the normal (non-superconducting) state of these materials and how does this evolve as the number density of conduction electrons is varied by chemical doping? Clearly, a complete understanding of the former requires knowledge of the latter. Until recently our main experimental probes of the normal state were macroscopic transport measurements (electrical resistivity, Hall effect etc.) and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The recent discovery that quantum oscillations can also be observed in some cuprate superconductors at very high magnetic field (&gt; 40 Tesla) has made a very big impact on the subject. Most importantly, it reveals that the true nature of the Fermi surface of the slightly doped cuprates is significantly different to that suggested previously by ARPES measurements. The main features of the quantum oscillation technique are first that the measurements probe the electronic structure right at the Fermi level with much higher energy and momentum resolution than ARPES, and second that they probe the bulk of the sample and so are not influenced by surface defects or reconstructions. A second related technique for investigating the Fermi surface is angle dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR). This has recently proven a very successful technique particularly for investigating more heavily doped HTSC and has revealed in great detail the full three-dimensional Fermi surface topology on one particular cuprate family. Such three-dimensional information is currently inaccessible to ARPES. ADMR has an additional advantage over conventional quantum oscillation techniques in that it can also reveal the temperature and momentum dependence of the transport scattering rate, a key parameter that largely determines the evolution of the anomalous transport properties of HTSC across the phase diagram.Both the quantum oscillations and ADMR have now become powerful techniques in the study of HTSC because of the recent development of facilities which are able to produce very high magnetic fields (up to 100 Tesla) and recent improvements in the signal-to-noise ratios at these facilities. The goal of this proposal is to make best use of these timely developments and to study quantum oscillations and ADMR in a variety of different HTSC materials at very high magnetic fields. In so doing we aim to gain a deeper understanding of how the normal state electronic structure of high temperature cuprate superconductors evolves as a function of the electron density. We will also attempt to couple our Fermi surface studies to measurements of their resistivity and Hall effect in the limiting low temperature (high magnetic field) regime.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F038836/1","grantId":"EP/F038836/1","fundValue":"549450","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The impact thus far is entirely academic.

There were several notable breakthroughs. The discovery of quantum oscillations in the resistivity and magnetisation two different classes of cuprate high temperature superconductors (YBa2Cu4O8 and Tl2Ba2CuO8) has shown both these materials can be understood to be generalised Fermi liquids at zero temperature and that the quasiparticles can perform coherent motion over the whole Fermi surface. This picture differs radically from some theoretical models and so gives a strong guide for improved theoretical understanding of the origin of superconductivity in these materials.\n\nHigh magnetic field measurement of the cuprate superconductor (La/Sr)2CuO4 revealed evidence for highly anomalous quantum critical behaviour.\n\nMeasurements of quantum oscillations and magnetic penetration depth of iron-based superconductors (LaFePO, BaFe2(As1-xPx)2) have given precise measurements of the Fermi surface and the superconducting energy gap. These results are being used to test theoretical models unconventional superconductivity in these materials. This research is a study of the fundamental Physics high temperature superconductors. Its direct use is by scientists focussed on understanding the origin of superconductivity in these materials. In due course this knowledge will be used to design new better materials for a wide range of applications in the electrical power / electronic sectors. This research has been very widely cited by fellow workers in the field. As of June 2013 (18 months after the end of the grant), the 23 published articles have been cited 922 times with 7 articles having more than 50 citations.
