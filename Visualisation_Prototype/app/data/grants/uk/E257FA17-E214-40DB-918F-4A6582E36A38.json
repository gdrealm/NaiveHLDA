{"id":"E257FA17-E214-40DB-918F-4A6582E36A38","title":"Dealing with in vivo multi-electrode array data","abstractText":"Our main aim of the research is to develop the first user-friendly software package to deal with in vivo multi-electrode array (MEA) data, as an essential tool and stage towards understanding how an odour is coded by the olfactory bulb(OB), how an image is coded by the visual systems, and finally how multi-regions in the nervous systems work coherently. We expect our adventures will provide a complete answer to some fundamental questions related to the information processing in the OB, and shed new lights onto the related issues in the brain in general. Use of the MEA techniques to detect signals coded by populations of neurons will be important not only for elucidating mechanisms of brain function, and for alleviating medical problems such as paralysis. Since this sort of work may also guide development of intelligent machines it is being used to provide data for computer simulations of brain activity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E005802/1","grantId":"BB/E005802/1","fundValue":"81991","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jianfeng  Feng","coPersons":["Keith  Kendrick"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
