Much of this data is held in public databases and accessible via the Internet to researchers across the world. The content of these databases does partially overlap. Due to the variation of experimental details and conditions, and sometimes simply due to human error during the handling of this data, it is now quite common to find some inconsistencies between these databases. For a researcher making use of these databases it poses the question of which of the data sources to trust and how to determine who is right and who is wrong. As part of this project we propose to use so-called argumentation technology to deal with this problem. Just as humans present arguments in favour and against a particular statement and how a discussion can move forward and backward between two people, computers can carry out similar reasoning if they are provided with the underlying knowledge to do so. In this project, we therefore propose to develop a tool that can use data from such public databases and domain expert knowledge to argue over the inconsistencies within and between these biomedical databases. The output of our tool will show the biologists what statements are supported by which databases and how they relate to each other. This will allow the biologists to come to an informed decision with respect to which data he or she can have most confidence in. The proposed work is focusing on a specific set of such databases which hold gene-expression data, i.e. data that captures which genes are active in which parts of an animal or human.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G024162/1","grantId":"BB/G024162/1","fundValue":"121750","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Albert  Burger","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
