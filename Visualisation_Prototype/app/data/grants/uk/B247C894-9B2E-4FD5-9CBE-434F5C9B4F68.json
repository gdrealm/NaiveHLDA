The instrument package is a joint development between Oxford and the Open University. This proposal is for funding until 31/3/2009, a period which covers the instrument Preliminary Design Review, and manufacture of the Structural Thermal Model instrument package. Oxford's role in the project is to develop the deployable meteorological boom sub-system and to integrate and test the sensors on this boom. This will involve verifying our facility's suitability to meet planetary protection regulations, design of the boom, actuator and wiring and extensive testing of the system in our vacuum facilities. Oxford are also fabricating two of the sensor types: the temperature sensors and the wind sensors which will be tested and calibrated in Oxford's Martian wind tunnel.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G000980/1","grantId":"ST/G000980/1","fundValue":"280676","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Calcutt","coPersons":["Neil Edward Bowles"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
