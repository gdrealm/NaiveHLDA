{"id":"DC09F19E-1917-428A-AB91-391BF0BB342C","title":"Reducing uncertainty in flood prediction: the representation of vegetation in hydraulic models","abstractText":"The summer 2007 flooding in England was the country's largest peacetime emergency since\nWorld War II, with 13 deaths, over 55,000 homes &amp; businesses flooded &amp; an associated\ninsurance cost of over &pound;3 billion. Prior to 2007 floods, the UK had experienced a number\nof significant flood events over the recent past which have included amongst others; 1)\nthe Easter 1998 floods of Northampton &amp; surrounding towns in the Midlands when 4,200\nhomes were flooded in a 1:50 year event &amp;; 2) the winter 2005 floods of Carlisle, a 1:200\nyear event, when 3 people lost their lives &amp; 1,800 properties were flooded. Following the\n2007 floods the Government commissioned the Pitt Review to discover the lessons that\nneeded to be learnt to manage future flood risk. The key observation reported within the\nPitt Review relevant to this application is that practices which were undertaken to manage\nthe river corridor; namely dredging, debris removal &amp; notably vegetation clearance, were no\nlonger being performed as frequently, in order to maintain the ecological diversity of the river\nfollowing the Water Framework Directive. This has substantially reduced the capacity of the \nriver channel &amp; has thus increased the potential of flooding. This is set within the context\nof the risk of flooding within the UK increasing into the future, with climate change models\n(UKCIP09) predicting that winters will be ~25% wetter, with an increase in extreme rainfall\nevents.\n \nFlood defences in the UK are managed by the Environment Agency. In order to manage\nthese resources we require knowledge of the capacity of river channels &amp; associated\nfloodplains. Aquatic vegetation is present in many UK rivers &amp; this reduces the capacity of\nthe channel that causes a reduction in flow velocity, which in turn produces higher water\nlevels per unit discharge, thus increasing the risk of flooding. Therefore, there is a need\nto develop our understanding of how vegetation partitions discharge between changes\nin velocity &amp; depth &amp; ow, in turn, this impacts upon the discharge carrying capacity of a\nchannel, namely conveyance, to better manage flood prediction &amp; prevention within the UK.\nThis proposal argues that we can now measure topography to a high resolution &amp; precision\n&amp; incorporate it into flood models explicitly. This is not the case for vegetation, &amp; there\nremains a lack of understanding of how to represent the influence of vegetation on fluvial\nsystem function. Indeed, the vast majority of uncertainty in flood model predictions stem from\nthe influence of vegetation on conveyance. In order to move away from an empirical based\napproach to the parameterisation of vegetation resistance, a new understanding of the\nflow &amp; turbulence production is necessary to be able to re-formulated a dynamic vegetation\nroughness treatment for flood models &amp; thus reduce the uncertainty in flood predictions. This\nwill be achieved by undertaking high resolution experiments in the laboratory in conjunction\nwith the development of a new three dimensional model that is capable of predicting both\nthe flow &amp; the plant movement. The model will be validated using the experimental data\n&amp; then the two data sets will be combined to enable a new formulation of the drag caused\nby the vegetation. This new understanding of the influence of vegetation of drag will be\nincorporated into an industry standard flood prediction model. An existing flood example\nwill be used to develop &amp; test the model as this will allow us to; 1) assess how well this new\nmodeling approach improves model predictions &amp;; 2) disentangle parameterization &amp; data\nerror in flood models &amp; enable us to assess what uncertainty needs to be addressed next\ngeneration of predictive flood models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K005200/1","grantId":"NE/K005200/1","fundValue":"56151","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Impact from this work is at an infancy in providing new parameter models for flood prediction to the Environment Agency.
