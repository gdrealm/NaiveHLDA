{"id":"DF7CE856-7478-4BC0-84F9-C8A3D6706E73","title":"International Carotid Stenting Study","abstractText":"We aim to find out if carotid stenting, a new treatment for narrowing of the carotid artery in the neck, prevents subsequent stroke, as well as conventional surgery.\n\nSurgery involves a cut in the neck to remove the narrowing, often under a general anaesthetic. This can occasionally cause stroke, heart attack or injury to nerves in the neck. In carotid stenting, a small wire mesh, known as a stent, is threaded up the artery to the narrowing through a small tube inserted in the groin under local anaesthetic. The stent is opened up inside the carotid artery to dilate the narrowing. This avoids a cut in the neck and general anaesthesia, but there is still a risk of stroke during stenting and we do not know how well it prevents stroke in the long term.\n\nWe are therefore comparing the two treatments in 1,500 patients, who have already had a small stroke caused by carotid narrowing. Half will be treated by surgery and half by stenting. They will then be seen for several years to record how many have another stroke or develop recurrence of narrowing. The results will help patients, doctors and the NHS choose between the two treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300411","grantId":"G0300411","fundValue":"1582660","fundStart":"2005-12-31","fundEnd":"2011-12-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin M  Brown","coPersons":["Andrew  Clifton","A  Bradbury","Jonathan  Beard","Alistair James Mcguire","Peter  Gaines","Graham  Venables","Martin  Bland"],"organisation":"Institute of Neurology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
