{"id":"8FC15F35-B603-4167-BBE4-9126AEE8F815","title":"Decentralised off-grid electricity generation in developing countries: Business models for off-grid electricity supply","abstractText":"As 80% of about 1.6 billion people who lacked access to electricity in the world in 2005 reside in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and given the importance of energy in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of the countries and thereby general welfare of the population, this proposal aims at developing innovative solutions to the problem through an interdisciplinary research involving UK and South Asian (Indian) universities, NGOs, government agencies, financing institutions, and other stakeholders. We propose to take a systematic view of the problem by considering the local resource availability, appropriate technology choices, institutional arrangements, and financing options and to demonstrate cost-effective and viable options through a demonstration project in a selected area of South Asia. We would also analyse the scaling-up and mainstreaming of the off-grid business delivery models and recommend enabling conditions for a wider implementation of such solutions. This research proposal is based on the premise that the solution strategy has to promote innovative solutions as opposed to prescribing standard templates for adoption and that each rural area will have to search for its own solutions a) By focusing on the creation of opportunities for higher income generation in monetary terms. Unless money flow increases to the poor, commercial energies stand little chance of competing with traditional energies. b) by developing local energy markets taking into account the specificities of local energy situation resources, needs, capacities, strengths and constraints and adopting appropriate supply mechanisms and organizational structures to cater to the local needs. c) by selective and judicious use of market interventions to make energy supply affordable but ensuring financial viability of energy supply. Unless the supply is financially viable, it cannot be sustained. d) by ensuring local community participation in the decision-making and policy implementation process.Deriving from the above premise, this research will focus on hybrid, multi-functional technological platforms using innovative participatory delivery mechanisms (such as franchisees, licensees, co-operatives or other local enterprise models) and alternative funding options (e.g. micro-finance, capital grants, subsidies, fee-based systems). Two main research questions are as follows:(1) Are there cost-effective, secure and reliable local off-grid electricity supply solutions that can meet the present and future needs and are socially acceptable, institutionally viable and environmentally desirable?(2) Do these local solutions have the scaling-up and replication potentials and can these solutions be brought to the mainstream for wider electricity access in the developing world?We are proposing an inter-disciplinary work programme spanning over a period of five years that will be conducted by a Consortium led by the University of Dundee. The work is organised around two main themes (Theme 1: local level solutions, Theme 2: Replicable generic models) and each theme revolves around two work packages (WP) as described below, with a total of 5 packages. At each work package level, we shall pay specific attention to capacity building, cross-referencing and cross-learning, dissemination of the research outcomes and policy translation of academic research. These four cross-cutting elements run across the entire programme.We are specifically focusing on South Asia where the largest concentration of people without energy access can be found. The diversity of local conditions found in the South Asian region provides a rich comparative base for analysing decentralised off-grid electricity supply provisions. The consortium partners have excellent research and project track records in this area and our serious inter-disciplinary research programme aims to provide lasting solutions to the energy and development problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G063826/1","grantId":"EP/G063826/1","fundValue":"1533300","fundStart":"2009-10-20","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Subhes Chandra Bhattacharyya","coPersons":["Paul  Cook","Tariq  Muneer","Khalid Mahmud Nadvi"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" The main findings so far of this ongoing project are:\n\na) Off-grid solutions are often regarded as temporary solutions until the grid is extended and often face policy bias or isolation in the minds of the users. \n\n\n\nb) off-grid systems are ensuring a transition to low carbon energies in developing countries but such systems succeed only when they are carefully designed, productive use of energy is promoted and local communities participate in the process.\n\n\n\nc) Electrification needs to be implemented with complimentary infrastructure. An autonomous and effective implementing agency is needed to ensure that plans are delivered. \n\n\n\nd) While some private partners are participating in some off-grid supply activities, it is the general experience that the donor-assistance or state-support has been the catalyst for off-grid solutions. Better results have been achieved where the entire programme is well co-ordinated with adequate support services and clear assignment of responsibilities.\n\n\n\ne) A critical evaluation of existing approaches to off-grid electrification in India revealed that successful decentralised interventions are critically contingent upon certain key determinants such as choice of technology, scale of the project, type of policy support, role of community, economic linkages and type of investment. Over-emphasis on the technical dimension of the problem without adequate attention to other critical factors has limited the success of off-grid/ decentralised systems. \n\n\n\nf) To create a successful business, it is important to consider technology choice, energy demand, financing, tariff, socio-economic benefits and service delivery issues.But the local solutions need to consider the local specificities and context to obtain a sustainable outcome.\n\n\n\ng) In order for the businesses to develop, a conducive environment is required through a proper institutional arrangment that offers transparent rules of the game. As the off-grid systems may ultimately be embedded in a grid connected system, the transition and future outlook as well as associated investment protection issues need to be developed before hand. The project outputs will have non-academic uses in policy, regulation, finance and businesses. Already, the project partners are working with policy makers in South Asia and collaborating with them. The micro-grid operators' association in India has established a close link with the project. Major institutional stakeholders including the World Bank, German Development Agency, and others have participated in the project workshops and the message is getting spread. The present work has will be put to use through a demonstration component. In addition, the work is producing knowledge content that is being disseminated through the project website, policy briefs, working papers, journal articles and a book. The research has generated interest amongst other donors and stakeholders and wider collaboration/ synergies are being developed. Further, the project has practical application in rural areas directly not only in South Asia but in Sub-Saharan Africa as well. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
