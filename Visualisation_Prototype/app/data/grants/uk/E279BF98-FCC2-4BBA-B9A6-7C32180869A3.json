{"id":"E279BF98-FCC2-4BBA-B9A6-7C32180869A3","title":"Grassroots Rural Protest and Political Activity in Britain","abstractText":"This research examines participation in rural protests and campaigns in Britain, including demonstrations around hunting, farming, housing development and other issues. It examines the background of participants, their motivations and experiences and their attitudes towards different strategies and tactics, as well as the role of pressure and protest groups. In particular it explores the significance of rural identity and attachment to specific rural communities in influencing the mobilization of grassroots participants. The research involves interviews with national rural group leaders and observers and case studies in four localities: Exmoor and North Devon, Cheshire, Suffolk and Powys. A survey of Countryside Alliance members in these areas will be accompanied by interviews and focus groups to explore participantsâ€™ experiences and the views of the wider community towards rural protests. The research seeks to contribute to academic knowledge of political mobilization, pressure group strategies, social movement formation and development, and the role of place in political participation, as well as to public understanding of contemporary rural politics in Britain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1317","grantId":"RES-000-23-1317","fundValue":"178563","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael John Woods","coPersons":["Jon  Anderson"],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
