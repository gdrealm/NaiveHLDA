In order to develop a deeper understanding of the organisational models required to support these strategies, case studies will be conducted of four American biotechnology firms that have been particularly effective in leveraging relationships with university labs.

Speakers at this event included CEO's and CSO's of leading UK biotechnology firms including Astex Pharmaceuticals, ReNeuron, Summit, and Vernalis, the CEO of MRC Technology, and a partner at SR One, the venture capital arm of GlaxoSmithKline. Other participants included managers from big pharma firms, senior officials from government departments involved in science and innovation policy, charities, public funding bodies, and universities. The discussions at this event were written down in a brief (Marston 2012) for use by stakeholders in their efforts to enhance support for science-based innovation in the UK biotechnology sector. Also, findings of this project have been published in an article in Nature Biotechnology, which has been featured across different Internet blogs and business school publications with a focus on the life sciences sector.

The scientific impact of this project has been achieved as a result of invitations to present the project findings at international conferences, publications in scholarly journals, and invited research seminars at leading American and European academic institutions.\n\nFindings and outputs\nThe scientific impact of the project has been to increase our scholarly understanding of business development strategies for science-intensive firms and the dynamics shaping organisational life at these firms. First, we developed organisational blueprints based on case study data that provide insights into optimal commercialisation strategies for two types of science-based firms, namely &quot;platform&quot;- and &quot;product&quot;- firms. In addition, our qualitative research on hierarchical work relationships in knowledge-intensive organisations resulted in a typology describing four types of relationships based on the levels of different types of trust in these relationships. The insights we developed through our qualitative research have led to a greater appreciation of the trade-offs managers face in designing the organisational architecture, routines, and culture at such firms. Second, we provided assessments of various strategies used by knowledge-intensive firms to engage academic communities in commercial R&amp;D based on the analysis of a large dataset we constructed on R&amp;D activities by 190 UK- and 173 US- biotechnology firms. For example, using this database, we were able to measure the impact on R&amp;D performance of decisions about whether or not to disclose R&amp;D findings in scientific publications and about whether or not to forge formal or informal collaborations with academic scientists. One important finding from these measurements was that firms typically enjoyed a 5% rise in overall R&amp;amp;D productivity measured by the number of new products under development following a decision to disclose research results in a scientific publication. Moreover, we found that decisions to publish led to an even higher rise of 9% in R&amp;D productivity measured by the number of novel, radically innovative products under development. Summary of Economic impacts\nFirst, economic and societal impact has been achieved through a major outreach event that I organised with NESTA around the findings of the project, bringing together key stakeholders in the UK life sciences sector from industry, academia, charities, and policy making. Second, impact has been achieved through a publication (Jong, 2011) in a leading international journal read by (industry) practitioners in the biotechnology industry. The outreach event and the publication have provided stakeholders in the life sciences sector with organisational blueprints and guidance in optimising R&amp;D strategies.\n\nFindings and outputs\nThe findings of this project offer new insights into optimal business strategies for firms in science-intensive industries such as the life sciences industry and blueprints managers of these firms may use in organising R&amp;D collaborations, in particular those that engage academic communities.\n\nWho these findings impact\nThose who were involved in the dissemination of the new insights developed in this project by participating in the outreach event co-organised with NESTA came from big pharma, the biotechnology industry, government departments, venture capital firms, charities funding R&amp;D in the life sciences, academia, and technology transfer organisations.\n\nPotential future impacts\nThere are two additional papers based on data gathered in the context of the project that will be disseminated in 2013. One publication will capitalise on the dataset of US biotechnology firms we built and extend insights we developed in the context of our UK dataset. Another, publication will inform UK stakeholders about our Asian case studies in a practitioner journal and will offer new insights into the opportunities and challenges that are represented by recent, major investments southeast Asian governments have been making in the life sciences. We also expect outputs that have already been produced to continue having an impact. Having been featured in business school publications and blogs with an orientation to the life sciences sector, we expect the Nature Biotechnology article to advance managerial practice in life sciences R&amp;D. Moreover, the positive feedback we received from key stakeholders in the UK life sciences sector who participated in the practitioner event that was co-organised with NESTA in 2012 indicates that the project's outcomes that were discussed during this event will advance the science-based R&amp;D activities these stakeholders are involved in.
