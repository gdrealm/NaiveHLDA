Current estimates are that the mouth, and the gut, each contain upwards of 1,000 different (non-overlapping) bacterial species. These bacteria are called the microbiota. Now, this finding is surprising, because we normally associate bacteria with disease. The fact that we contain so many bacteria is beginning to colour how we think about human diseases that currently have no apparent causation. There is emerging evidence that major human diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and even some forms of cancer, may be a response to members of the microbiota. \nA disease which is known to be a direct response to members of the microbiota (in this case the bacteria present on the gingivae (gums)) is the most common chronic inflammatory and destructive disease of humans - periodontitis. One of the mysteries of periodontitis is whether this disease is due to a small number of specific bacteria or is a general response to all of the bacteria living on the gums. It is very difficult to test which bacteria are involved in periodontitis because: (i) there are so many different types of bacteria involved and (ii) 50% or more of the bacteria present on the gums cannot be cultivated in the laboratory, and therefore, cannot be studied. Thus, using conventional means, it is virtually impossible to decide if periodontitis is due to the actions of selected bacteria or is a general response to all the bacteria on the gums. This also creates difficulties in terms of trying to improve anti-bacterial treatments for periodontitis.\nHowever, within the last few years, methods have been developed to allow the study of all the bacteria associated with diseased gums. This methodology is known as functional genomics, and allows the DNA from all of the bacteria on the gums to be used to produce all the proteins that such bacteria make, under controlled conditions. Thus bacteria that cannot be grown in the lab can be directly examined using this methodology. Using a fairly simple screening system it is possible to determine which of these proteins are stimulating the immune system and, therefore, likely to be causing disease. Thus we can identify both the bacteria and the bacterial proteins responsible for causing periodontitis. This information should allow much better treatments of this very common human disease to be developed. In addition, as periodontitis is now recognised to be a potential causative factor in serious systemic conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes the information obtained in this study could impinge on our understanding of these conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J010685/1","grantId":"MR/J010685/1","fundValue":"145074","fundStart":"2012-07-02","fundEnd":"2013-10-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian  Henderson","coPersons":["Nikolaos  Donos","Luigi  Nibali","John Maxim Ward"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
