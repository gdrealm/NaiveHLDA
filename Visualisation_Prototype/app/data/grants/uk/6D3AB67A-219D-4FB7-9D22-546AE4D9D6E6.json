In particular, the list of List of World Heritage in danger in accordance with Article 11 of the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage mainly focuses on sites threaten by armed conflicts (e.g., Medieval monuments in Kosovo), or uncontrolled development (e.g., Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, and the Dresden Elbe valley, recently delisted from the UNESCO World Heritage).\nNew space technology based on radar interferometry (InSAR) is now capable to monitor, since 1992 and with mm precision, surface deformation for reflective targets named persistent scatterers, which consistently return stable signals to the radar satellites.\nLed by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, and in collaboration with NERC British Geological Survey, Geological and Mining Institute of Spain, University of Milano-Bicocca and Cyprus University of Technology, the project PROTHEGO will make an innovative contribution towards the analysis of geohazards in areas of cultural heritage in Europe.\nThe project will apply novel InSAR techniques to monitor monuments and sites that are potentially unstable due to landslides, sinkholes, settlement, subsidence, active tectonics as well as structural deformation, all of which could be effected of climate change and human interaction.\nTo magnify the impact of the project, the approach will be implemented in more than 450 sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List in geographical Europe.\nAfter the remote sensing investigation, detailed geological interpretation, hazard analysis, local-scale monitoring, advanced modelling and field surveying for the most critical sites will be carried out to discover cause and extent of the observed motions.\nActive engagement of stakeholders from both academic and heritage conservation sectors will be undertaken via establishment of the Steering Committee and Demonstration Site Stakeholders.\nPROTHEGO will enhance Cultural Heritage management at National level, reinforcing institutional support and governance through knowledge and innovation, identifying, assessing and monitoring risks, strengthening disaster preparedness at heritage properties in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N504361/1","grantId":"AH/N504361/1","fundValue":"156168","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Francesca  Cigna","coPersons":[],"organisation":"NERC British Geological Survey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
