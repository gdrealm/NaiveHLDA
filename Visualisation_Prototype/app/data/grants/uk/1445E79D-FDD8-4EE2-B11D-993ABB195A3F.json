We will study some of the radionuclides which are particularly important because they are potentially present in relatively large quantities, are environmentally mobile, and are readily taken up by living organisms. The main radionuclides we are going to study are:\n\nCarbon-14, which occurs in nature, but was produced back in the 1960s and 60s through nuclear weapons testing, and is also present in nuclear wastes; and \n\nUranium (together with its decay product radium) which is present in nature, and also in some nuclear wastes.\n\nWe will use four areas of the UK which contain elevated levels of these radionuclides as our study sites. These are South Terras (an old uranium mine in Cornwall), the Needle's Eye (a uranium mineral vein in SW Scotland), the Esk Estuary in NW England, and offshore sediments in the NE Irish Sea. At these last two sites, the sediments contain elevated levels of radioactivity from authorised Sellafield discharges, mainly in the 1970s. \n\nAs well as studying how radioactivity occurs in, and moves through, the soils, waters, plants and (in the offshore sediments) animals, we want to understand the environmental and biological processes which control this movement. To do this, we will do a series of laboratory experiments, looking at the way soil/sediment conditions influence the radionuclide concentrations in solution, the form of the radionuclides in the solution, the way radionuclides are taken up into plants and animals, and the way they are distributed in plant tissues. \n\nWe will use the results from our field and laboratory studies to develop and test mathematical models of radionuclide transport and transfer processes. These are important because they allow us to predict behaviour, rather than having to make measurements. These predictive models can be used in assessing environmental impacts, cleaning up contaminated land and predicting the long term impact of radioactive waste disposals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L000202/1","grantId":"NE/L000202/1","fundValue":"415465","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Gordon Thomas Cook","coPersons":["Sheng  Xu","Gillian  MacKinnon"],"organisation":"Scottish Universities Env Research Cen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
