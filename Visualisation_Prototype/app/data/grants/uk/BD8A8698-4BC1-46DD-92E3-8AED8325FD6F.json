As our conceptualisation of travel behaviour has changed, so new challenges for measurement and modelling have been presented, and likewise, as new conceptual; measurement and modelling capabilities have been developed within the social sciences and elsewhere, they have made possible the operationalisation of richer theoretical and conceptual understandings of travel behaviour.To date, however, these interactions have been episodic and fragmented and have drawn on a relatively limited range of social science inputs.</p>\n\n<p>The objective of this research is to bring together communities of social science and transport researchers to consider these challenges in a more holistic manner, to take stock of the current array of conceptual and methodological approaches available, anticipate likely future directions of development for the field and thereby to actively stimulate creative interaction between the social sciences and those working in key application areas such as transport.</p>\n\n<p>The research will proceed through a series of meetings and workshops, bringing together leading experts from transport and the social sciences, and through commissioned review papers and linked to a range of dissemination and follow up activities.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J007447/1","grantId":"ES/J007447/1","fundValue":"18439","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John William Polak","coPersons":["Aruna  Sivakumar","R  Batley"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
