Resilience can enable an understanding of how health and well-being can be maintained in the face of adversity and challenge. \n\nWe wish to generate new knowledge for research, policy and practice on resilience and healthy ageing across the life span. To achieve this we will to form a network partnership between different academic disciplines and organisations. Our aim is to unite people and consolidate existing evidence and opinion so that we can develop a plan for future research. \n\nThe network will enable discussion of all the different factors that might impact on resilience from early to advanced older age. These include the places people live, the support they receive, biological and psychological characteristics. We will address problems regarding definitions of resilience, and how it might be examined and promoted. \n\nThe network will develop scientific and universal bulletins of the key issues. Through consultation meetings we will discuss the meaning, application and potential usefulness of the science in future research, healthy ageing policies and practice. This will ensure our work is universally understood and of maximum benefit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900033","grantId":"G0900033","fundValue":"49723","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gillian  Windle","coPersons":["Vanessa  Burholt","Martin William Orrell","Kate Mary Bennett","Cherie Frances McCracken","Jane  Noyes","Gopalakrishnan  Netuveli","Robert Thomas Woods","Jo  Rycroft-Malone","Amanda  Sacker"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
