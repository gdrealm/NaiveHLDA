One protein called alpha-crystallin, surveys other proteins inside the lens checking for faults. As we get old, these tend to build up. Our aim is to use X-ray crystallography to image the molecular structure of this protein to find out how it works. Proteins are linear chains that fold into complex patterns that unravel with time. Unfolded crystallins left unattended will clog together and scatter light. For most of our life alpha-crystallin recognizes when things are wrong, soaking up damaged proteins. But with age so much protein has changed and there is no fresh alpha-crystallin left. We aim to work out the sorts of changes that cause crystallins to unfold, and the faults alpha-crystallin recognizes. Changes to crystallin genes cause childhood cataracts. We aim to assess the impact these changes make to lens proteins by laboratory experiments and by simulating crystallin unfolding using computers. We want to know what the protein looks like when things start to go wrong, in case it can be reversed. This will contribute towards the discovery of drugs that delay cataract for a few years, reducing the need for surgery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G8303198","grantId":"G8303198","fundValue":"3293740","fundStart":"1983-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Slingsby","coPersons":["Bonnie Ann Wallace","Helen  Saibil"],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
