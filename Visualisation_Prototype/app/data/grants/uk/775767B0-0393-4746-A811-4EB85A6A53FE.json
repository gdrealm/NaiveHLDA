As these members work in individual Universities or departments without the events and activities proposed under this grant they have no opportunities to meet and share common issues and best practice. The activities proposed include regular updates via an e-bulletin, three annual events where the group can meet and one event where the end users of the research&nbsp;- businesses and third sector organisations - so that new partnerships can be established.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H044639/1","grantId":"ES/H044639/1","fundValue":"4181","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Siobhan  Jordan","coPersons":["Elizabeth  Rattray","Anne Sofie Laegran"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
