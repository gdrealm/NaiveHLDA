So every network like the internet gives rise to a graph. Moreover, many timetable scheduling problems can be modelled as graph colouring problems. Unfortunately, graph colouring problems are usually very hard in the sense that it is unlikely that there exists an efficient algorithm for solving them. So one tries to find natural conditions which guarantee the existence of good colourings. This has turned into an important area which has received much attention. However, many fundamental questions remain unsolved. The aim of the project is to solve several of these, based on a new notion of robustly decomposable graphs which we have developed recently. This method will also apply to long-standing problems on decompositions of graphs into Hamilton cycles. These problems in turn have applications to the famous Travelling Salesman Problem.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J008087/1","grantId":"EP/J008087/1","fundValue":"192447","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Graph theory underpins much of the digital economy.

Here graphs consist of vertices, some of which are connected by edges. Graphs can be used to model a large variety of structures. In particular, the research within the project has applications to graph colouring, scheduling and the travelling salesman problem. The methods developed by us within the graph have paved the way for the solution of long-standing open problems. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
