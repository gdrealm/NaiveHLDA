By analogy, membranes separate parts of living cells, and transporters control which substances move across. Knowing what each transporter does is important, as this will increase our understanding of the processes separated by the membrane, and allow us to manipulate the transport. Mitochondria are like rooms in which energy is generated and where many delicate chemical reactions take place (for instance for making vitamins or metal cofactors). The mitochondrial membranes contain many transporters, to supply the furnaces with fuel and to provide raw materials for chemical reactions. Energy, products and waste then need to be exported. We are interested in a special type of transporter, the ABC transporters of the mitochondria (ATMs). This is because ATMs export vital, but yet unidentified materials out from the mitochondria to the rest of the cell, catalyzing key biological reactions. ABC stands for ATP binding cassette, which is a feature of the transporter protein that defines the group it belongs to. The ATMs are present in all organisms, and defects lead to disease in humans and low yield in plants. The aim of this research proposal is to find out what is exactly the substance transported by these mitochondrial transporters. Earlier studies of ATMs have used yeast, because this is a simple organism to use as an experimental 'model'. These studies revealed that damage to the ATM transport system disrupts the production of small iron-sulphur structures outside the mitochondria. These iron-sulphur structures are essential for cell metabolism, growth and survival. Recently, our group and collaborators have found another chemical process that requires ATM, which is the synthesis of molybdenum-organic compounds. This was discovered in plants, because yeast does not have this compound (but humans do). So now we have two processes that are dependent on ATMs, and we can better speculate what could be transported. One of the possibilities is a small sulphur compound, which is part of the iron-sulphur structures as well as the molybdenum compound. It is also possible that the transporter can carry quite different precursor molecules for each of the metal structures. This is a hypothesis that we can test relatively easily, especially with the technical progress made recently to study pure preparations of ABC transporters. This also allows us to look at the ATM transporters that are damaged in different ways, and find out why they do not work properly. Again, plants have been very useful for this, because several plant lines with a damaged ATM3 transporter were found. In the end, we will learn how the transporter works and what it can transport, while increasing our understanding of the processes in the cell depending on it and their significance for human health and plant growth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H00288X/1","grantId":"BB/H00288X/1","fundValue":"283105","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The main paper describing our findings was recently (August 2014) published as a Paper of the Week in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. This means that the editorial board members and associate editors of JBC determined that our paper was in the top 2 percent of manuscripts they will review in a year in significance and overall importance. About 50 to 100 papers are selected from the more than 6,600 we publish each year. We anticipate that our findings will be used by others.

Previous studies suggested that a compound containing sulphur (but not iron) in an unknown chemical form is exported from the mitochondria into the cytosol and that glutathione (GSH) plays a role in the export process. Therefore, the aim of this study is to characterize the substrate specificity of the plant AtATM3 and its orthologue yeast ScAtm1.\n\n\n\n We are currently characterizing sulphur and thio Biotechnology - there is a growing interest in expressing Fe-S proteins in eukaryotes, for example hydrogenase in yeast, or nitrogenase in crop plants. A knowledge of proteins required for the assembly of Fe-S cofactors on these proteins, including ATMs, is therefore critical. Crop improvement - the biosynthesis of two plant hormones, ABA and auxin, depends on the function of ATM3 (Bernard et al 2009; Teschner et al 2010). These hormones are important for seed germination and shoot growth, respe Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
