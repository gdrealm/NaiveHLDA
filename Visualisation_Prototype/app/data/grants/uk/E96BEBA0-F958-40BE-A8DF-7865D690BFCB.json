As social scientists, we turn to theatre because it embodied quality offers space in which to encourage audiences to think about their world differently, to temporarily suspend judgment, and to extend the terrain of political discussion on the ethics of care in productive ways. We work with the awareness that because labour migration from the global south to the global north is a transnational issue, we must reconfigure the scale at which discussions of justice, care and need take place.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000594/2","grantId":"ES/K000594/2","fundValue":"33652","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Designed to maximise the public impact of social science research on Canada's Live-In Caregiver Program, our KE activities have produced significant outcomes. We carried out five weeks of research in the Philippines, which culminated in fifteen critically acclaimed and sold-out performances of our testimonial play (entitled Nanay) at the Philippine Educational Theater Association. Each and every performance of Nanay was followed by an extended and facilitated public forum in which audience members were encouraged to explore and debate the political and ethical dilemmas raised by temporary labour migration, the ethics of global care, and family separation. Performances in Manila were attended by migrant workers, the family members of domestic workers in Canada, migrant advocacy groups, university representatitves, general public, local government officials, students, and a broad spectrum of non-governmental organisations. Our research in Manila has been documented through interviews with audience members, the family members of domestic workers, participating artists, as well as through audience questionnaires and recorded post-performance talkbacks. We have disseminated this research in leading academic journals, invited talks and public forums in Canada, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom.

This research has used testimonial theatre to reconfigure the scale at which deliberations of justice, care and need take place. We have looked to theatre to translate and disseminate social science research in order to prompt and push audiences to think about the world differently and to extend the terrain of political discussion in productive ways. The performances of our testimonial play have contributed to an important transnational public sphere in which multiple ‘user’ communities have come together to witness, explore and debate the politics and ethics of temporary labour migration. Performances of Nanay in Manila were attended by faculty and students from Ateno de Manila, University of Sto. Thomas, University of the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon University, Polytechnic University, Miriam College, and the University of the East. Performances were also attended by the staff of ECPAT Philippines (a children’s NGO), MAPUA Instititue of Technology, the director of the Eastern University, the PETA-Metropolitan Teen Theatre League, the Quezon City Office of the Vice Mayor, as well as representatives of various NGOs: Batis Center for Women, Philippine Migrant Rights Watch, Scalabrini Migration Center, Migrant Forum in Asia, National Council of Churches, KPD, and Migrante International. Further, performances and post-performance talkbacks were attended by former and current migrant workers, and the family members of domestic workers in Canada. This research has several future impacts to report. Firstly, this work has stimulated significant conversations on the effects of labour migration and family separation between migrant domestic workers in Canada and their family members in the Philippines. Secondly, as noted previously, we have shared our testimonial script with Migrante International, who are using it to develop script readings in migrant-sending communities in Manila. We will be assessing their work to explore how migrants often do not fully communicate their challenges to their relatives in the Philippines, and working with the script at a community-level allows us to communicate experiences under Canada’s Live-In Caregiver Program in an intimate way to prospective migrants. Thirdly, we will document a second reading of the play organised by Hazel Venzon within the Filipino community in Whitehorse, Canada. This will be conducted at Nakai Theatre, who are exploring the possibility of a full theatrical production of Nanay during their Pivot Festival in January 2016. Knowing little about the history of Filipino migration to Canada before joining the production, the experience of Nanay has led Venzon to create a series of artistic works within the Filipino community in Whitehorse (where she now lives) in which she has used theatre to create novel forms of multicultural interaction. Her work will serve to examine the growing and understudied migration of Filipinos to and multiculturalism in the Canadian North.
