It is a world in which threats to the security of states and citizens – from political violence, organised crime and armed conflict – cross territorial boundaries, and draw into question some established academic and practical understandings of the nature and scale of security threats. It is also a world in which military and police power in general, and coercive force in particular, is delivered not only by sovereign states acting alone or in coalition, but also by a burgeoning market in security and military services, by groups acting within civil society, and by emergent trans-national networks and bureaucracies. It is a world where traditional security distinctions are collapsing.</p> \n<p>This seminar series will examine the breakdown of these distinctions in four such areas: first, the blurring of lines between war and crime; second, the consequent overlap between military and policing; third, the change in the provision of security from the state as main provider to the use of private companies; and finally, the movement away from the state as the main security provider and towards the use of sub-national or trans-national groups to provide or create security.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4250","grantId":"RES-451-25-4250","fundValue":"10514","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Percy","coPersons":["Ian  Loader"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
