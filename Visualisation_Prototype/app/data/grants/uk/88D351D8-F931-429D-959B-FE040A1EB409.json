It will be undertaken by the Centre for Floods, Communities and Resilience and the Centre for Transport &amp; Society at UWE, Bristol in partnership with Network Rail, South Gloucestershire Council and Somerset Council. The primary objective is to assess the potential for catchment source control to reduce flooding impacts to the railway assets and therefore increase the resilience of the network. In order to explore the benefits of this approach an ecosystem services approach will be used to assess these services which will be contextualised in relation to a component of the study which assesses the direct and indirect costs of network disruption. The potential of a payment for ecosystem services market to fund the catchment intervention will be explored.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M008274/1","grantId":"NE/M008274/1","fundValue":"40274","fundStart":"2014-10-31","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Nevil Wyndham Quinn","coPersons":["Mark  Everard","Michael Wilbur Horswell","Graham Peter  Parkhurst","Lindsey Jo  McEwen","John  Parkin"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
