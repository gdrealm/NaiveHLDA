Debate about the role and function of hillforts is at the centre of Iron Age research in Britain. However, the history of academic interests over the last 100 years has led to the lack of a uniform level of regional knowledge, which has seriously distorted understanding of hillforts and of the period. In particular, there has been a paucity of excavation and research of hillforts in southeast Wales. Glamorgan has been the subject of a survey by the RCAHMW (1976), but it is one thing to be able to locate hillforts and describe their morphology, yet quite another to fix their construction, development and occupation through time. Too few have been excavated to support a credible picture or chronology for the region (only 23 of 130 sites have received any investigation through excavation). Therefore, there is a pressing need to challenge the weak chronological framework and the received wisdom of a dearth of material culture from hillforts in southeast Wales. Caerau hillfort therefore provides an opportunity to explore these issues through co-produced research with the community. Caerau hillfort is one of the largest multivallate hillforts in South Wales, but before Phase 1 it had never been subject to archaeological investigation. This research will therefore further contextualise the character of activity within the interior of the hillfort. Unfortunately, investigation of the site is challenging since the whole area is a focus for a range of anti-social behaviour including burning events, graffiti and vandalism. The CAER Heritage Project's research objective is to help the people of Caerau and Ely to connect with this site's fascinating the past and make it relevant to the present, engendering the heritage of the district with greater value for contemporary communities in relation to identity and aspirational opportunity.\n\nBuilding on existing partnerships and trust, local community members, schools and academic researchers will work together to provide a cutting edge interpretation of the site which will not only enhance research knowledge but will also inform an innovative experimental heritage reconstruction of Iron Age Life at St Fagans National History Museum just over a mile away - providing a remarkable project legacy. As in phase 1 of the project, community participants will be involved in co-production of research activities and interpretations with university academics - creating educational opportunities, learning skills, building confidence, confronting stigmas and challenging the aspirational poverty which blights so many families within these communities. The project constitutes a journey which will see community participants and researchers 'deconstructing' a decommissioned reconstructed Iron-Age village at St Fagans National Museum of Wales - then taking the skills and team spirit forged in that process to explore an authentic and un-researched Iron-Age archaeological site at the heart of their communities - then finally they will use the knowledge and skills that they have uncovered to inform and undertake the construction of a new experimental reconstruction of an Iron Age settlement at St Fagans. Through these initiatives Digging Caerau will forge a much closer relationship between the Caerau and Ely communities and the National Museum and University on their doorstep. This will be further cemented by the expansion of the heritage trail proposed by the HEART of Cardiff Follow Up funding bid.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007726/1","grantId":"AH/K007726/1","fundValue":"71778","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  To date, the project has involved a myriad of non-HE partners (primary and secondary schools, community groups, youth workers, community development workers, local residents, the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff Story Museum, Glamorgan Archives, Cardiff Council etc.) alongside academics, undergraduates and postgraduates from a range of disciplines at Cardiff (history, archaeology, social sciences). A range of key strategies have been employed by CAER to ensure meaningful co-production and mutual benefit between the wide range of academic, heritage sector and community partners involved. These include: community consultation and involvement in funding bids; the embedding of an academic member of staff (Oliver Davis) within ACE; the development of a close partnership with local secondary schools; the establishment of community-based adult learners courses; the creation of partnerships with a local youth centre and the National Museum of Wales to involve young people facing exclusion in creating a heritage themed art; community outreach opportunities for university students working closely alongside community participants. The wide ranging nature of the project's impacts, partnerships and the embedding of academics and a professional artist within a community context resulted in multifarious, often 'organically' nurtured forms of engagement and co-production. This included the embedding of research co-production within the curricula of participating secondary schools with pupils undertaking geophysical surveys, archaeological excavation, creating museum exhibitions, performances and artwork, heritage trails and participating in a Timeteam programme and two seasons of community excavations. The involvement of professional artist, Paul Evans, in all stages of the project proved a particularly successful strategy. Paul designed and facilitated creative forms of engagement with local heritage themes including large eco-graffiti art installations, puppet shows, heritage trail design and the creation of an Iron-Age themed mural with both local pupils in mainstream secondary education and young people excluded from school. Furthermore, the embedding of research within a series of free accredited adult-education courses in practical archaeology, in association with Cardiff Centre for Lifelong Learning, proved successful in engaging long term unemployed males in co-production - with clear benefits in terms of progression and confidence building for a number of individuals.\n\nCAER established innovative and ongoing social and professional partnerships thereby creating a new 'community of practice' (Hart et al, 2012). A crucial ingredient in this creation has been the equal value placed on the contributions and 'knowledge bases' of all partners, whether trained professional or community volunteers. From the outset, community members, secondary schools and community development agencies were integrated in the project's development. This included the establishment of a 'Friends of Caerau' community group which continues to meet bi-monthly and organises litter picks, trail clearances and heritage events. It also included the establishment of a special and ongoing partnership with the management team at two local secondary schools, Glyn Derw and Michaelston Community College, who embedded aspects of local heritage into the curriculum. Moreover, CAER has grown from relatively humble beginnings in 2011 to become one of the key community projects of partner organisation ACE. ACE is a community based organisation which aims to support the social, economic and environmental regeneration of Ely and Caerau. ACE staff worked with the university staff, every step of the way, to plan the development of CAER; providing access to a network of local community groups enabling the involvement of local residents in project activities. ACE facilitated further funding grant successes (e.g. HLF All Our Stories) and ensured that CAER was integrated into, and continues to benefit from, 'Timeplace' (Ely and Caerau's timebank). ACE have therefore brought incredible assets to the project, most notably the trust and networks that they had built up over years with local people and community groups, but also a deep knowledge of the area and an insightful understanding of the challenges faced by these communities. Over time, the academic team and ACE staff developed a mutual respect for each other, more akin to friendship than partnership. These co-production strategies, partnerships and the involvement and commitment of ACE and the community groups have therefore ensured the Project's future beyond existing funding streams and is enabling activities to continue 'on the ground' while further funding grants are secured.

Despite being one of the largest hillforts in south Wales, Caerau had never been subject to archaeological investigation and there was no evidence for the date of the monument nor for the nature of the occupation. The second phase (AHK007726/1) of the project, known as 'Digging Caerau' completed the characterisation of activity within the interior of the hillfort. As in phase 1, the CAER Heritage Project's research objective was to work with the people of Caerau and Ely to take 'ownership' for the site by making it relevant to the present community; to provide a heritage asset for the locality and the region; and to use the excavations and related activities to provide educational and aspirational opportunities for the local community through the co-production of research knowledge.\n\nBuilding on existing partnerships and trust, local community members, schools and academic researchers worked together to provide an interpretation of the site which has not only enhanced research knowledge but has also informed an innovative experimental heritage reconstruction of Iron Age Life at St Fagans National History Museum just over a mile away, providing a remarkable project legacy. Community participants have been involved in co-production of research activities and interpretations with university academics, creating educational opportunities, learning skills, building confidence and confronting the negative stereotypes which blight these communities. The project constitutes a journey which has seen community participants and researchers 'deconstructing' a decommissioned Iron-Age replica village at St Fagans National Museum of Wales, then taking the skills and team spirit forged in that process to explore an authentic and under-researched Iron-Age and Medieval archaeological site at the heart of their communities, then finally using the knowledge and skills that they have uncovered to inform and undertake the construction of a new experimental reconstruction of an Iron Age settlement at St Fagans National History Museum. Through these initiatives Digging Caerau has forged a much closer relationship between the Caerau and Ely communities and the National Museum and University on their doorstep. This has been further cemented by the expansion of a series of heritage trails linking Caerau Hillfort to St Fagans National History Museum as part of the HEART of Cardiff project AH/K007629/1.\n\nIn archaeological terms, the project's research findings have included significant new archaeological evidence revealing human occupation at Caerau from the Neolithic through to the Medieval period. Findings include the discovery of five Iron-Age roundhouses, well-preserved animal bones, a large pottery assemblage and a range of other artifacts which have significantly improved understanding of Iron-Age settlement in South Wales. All of these findings have included local community members and pupils as active research participants at every stage including excavation, geophysical surveying, post-excavation analysis as well as creative artistic and historical research initiatives as evidenced through a wide range of outputs. The project also has a significant social sciences dimension with work being undertaken on co-production and co-evaluation strategies and on interactions between community participants and heritage professionals. From the outset the CAER Heritage Project's key objectives have been to use history and archaeology to develop educational opportunities and to challenge stigmas and marginalisation associated within the local communities. After all, the presence of a large multivallate hillfort in this area suggests that in prehistory Caerau and Ely were actually once the power centre in the Cardiff region. The project therefore aims to celebrate this remarkable past and to realise the potential of the significant yet underutilised heritage assets within these communities. The CAER Heritage Project is committed to producing research that involves participants actively in the co-production of knowledge and which values the contributions of all participants and partners. To date the project has involved a myriad of non-HE partners (primary and secondary schools, community groups, youth workers, community development workers, local residents, the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff Story Museum, Glamorgan Archives, Cardiff Council etc) alongside academics, undergraduates and postgraduates from a range of disciplines at Cardiff (history, archaeology, social sciences). The co-production strategies employed by the project in relation to community and heritage assets have significant transferability and have been recently recognised in a national award bestowed by the NCCPE. \n\nWe therefore believe the CAER Project's co-production strategies and the emphasis which it places on the value of community assets in relation to heritage are truly innovative and provide an exemplary model for other community based archaeology and history projects. The wide ranging nature of the project's impacts, partnerships and the embedding of academics and a professional artist within a community context have resulted in multifarious, often 'organically' nurtured forms of innovation, co-production and engagement. These have included:\no The embedding of research within the curricula of participating secondary schools with pupils producing museum exhibitions, performances and artwork, heritage trails school projects and even participating in a Timeteam programme.\no The involvement of a professional artist, Paul Evans, in all stages of the project thereby facilitating creative forms of engagement with local heritage themes including large eco-graffiti art installations, puppet shows, heritage trail design and the creation of an Iron-Age themed mural with local young people excluded from school. \no The embedding of research within a series of accredited practical archaeology courses, in association with Cardiff Centre for Lifelong Learning, which have proved particularly successful in engaging long term unemployed males and which have had clear benefits in terms of progression and confidence building for a number of individuals.\no The involvement of postgraduate and undergraduate students in a wide range of engagement initiatives including excavation, museum exhibitions and the development of schools outreach workshops.
