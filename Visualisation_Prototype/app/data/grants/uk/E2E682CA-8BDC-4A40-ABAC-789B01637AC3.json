{"id":"E2E682CA-8BDC-4A40-ABAC-789B01637AC3","title":"Mixed Modes and Measurement Error","abstractText":"<p>Increasing pressures of falling response rates and rising costs of survey operations have led many to explore the potential benefits of combining different modes of survey data collection, such as face-to-interviewing, telephone interviewing, postal surveys and web surveys. The drawback of using more than one mode is that the data may not be comparable if people give different answers depending on the mode of data collection. There is a need for practical advice to inform decisions about when and how to mix modes.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this study is to increase understanding about the causes and consequences of mixing modes in order to improve survey research quality. Existing information will be drawn together to create a framework. The framework will be used to assess how the mode of collection is likely to affect survey questions, highlight gaps in knowledge, and provide the basis for the development of a set of principles for designing questions that can be used across modes. Where there are knowledge gaps they will be filled by analysing existing data wherever possible, otherwise new data will be collected. Qualitative interviewing techniques will be used to uncover why different modes have the effect they do.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E024270/1","grantId":"ES/E024270/1","fundValue":"256182","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gerry  Nicolaas","coPersons":["Peter  Lynn","Annette Elisabeth Jackle"],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
