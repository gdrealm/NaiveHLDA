Lipids exhibit diverse biological effect via their interacting receptors. Proteins that contain a lipid binding domain can, upon binding of their lipid ligand, undergo a conformational change, which leads to interaction with new partners or translocation to another subcellular compartment. Such multicomponent complexes are transient, or dynamic under specific conditions, and difficult to investigate. Conventional biochemical methods to study lipid-protein interactions often require large amounts of material and are carried out on a 'one-at-a-time' basis. Thus, in this proposal we plan to develop a high throughput platform to capture in real time a picture of the spatial and temporal 'global' lipid-protein interaction network using a combination of cross-linking, lipid pull-down, and proteomics technologies. The identified interactions will then be examined for their effect on protein function and cellular activities using a quantitative proteomics approach. The class of lipids will be focused on in this study are oxysterols. Oxysterols are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol and their imbalance is implicated in atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases. We will use the developed novel approach to identify oxysterol receptors and reveal their involvement in protein complexe assembly and disassembly. The results will potentially aid in the elucidation of biological process, the understanding of the importance of oxysterols in the healthy state and how their imbalance may be the cause of disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H001018/1","grantId":"BB/H001018/1","fundValue":"291674","fundStart":"2010-01-04","fundEnd":"2013-07-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Yuqin  Wang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":" We have successfully developed a biotinylated-oxysterol probe, which contains a tag but retains the physiological properties of the parent oxysterol, such as activation LXRs and inhibiting the gene expression of squalene synthase. This probe can be used to study oxysterol-protein interactions. The oxysterol-probe is made by linking biotin hydrazide to 24-ketocholesterol. We optimised the derivatisation and purification methods. We are able to achieve HPLC grade biotinylated-oxysterol in good yield.\nBy combination of affinity pull-down and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified candidate novel oxysterol binding proteins, including inhibitor of NF?B kinase (IKK). In quantitative proteomics analysis we found that M-CSF was induced by 24S,25-epoxycholesterol. M-CSF is a NF?B target gene and further study showed that this effect could be inhibited by Bay 11-7082, a IKK specific inhibitor. Together these results suggest that oxysterol activate NF?B pathway by direct interaction with IKK. Oxysterols is an emerging class of molecules which play important role in neuron development and survial and immunity. Thus the oxysterol probe can be used by other researchers from academia or pharmaceutical companies to explore the mechanisms of oxysterol activities.
