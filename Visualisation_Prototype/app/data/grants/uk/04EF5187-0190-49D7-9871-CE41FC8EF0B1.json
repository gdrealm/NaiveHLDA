It also constitutes a great challenge to current cancer therapies. To respond to low oxygen levels, the cell activates a series of proteins that control genes. These proteins, called transcription factors, are responsible for increasing or decreasing the levels of other proteins within the cell. Two such important proteins that are also activated by low oxygen levels are called NF-kappaB (standing Nuclear Factor kappaB) and HIF-1 (standing for Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1). Incorrect function of these proteins leads to many human diseases and as such these proteins have been the focus of a lot of interest by pharmaceutical companies with the goal of developing drugs that would inhibit them. However, at present it is not known what would happen if one of these proteins was inhibited independently of each other. I plan to investigate the role of these proteins in determining how cells respond to low levels of oxygen and consequently what happens in tumours, stroke or cardiac arrest. I will determine if these proteins work together or oppose each other in the cell. This study will help determine if it is better to inhibit only one of the proteins or both at the same time to improve the therapeutic benefit of the current inhibitors. Also new proteins will be identified that could represent new targets for already established therapies or entirely new therapies to be used when low oxygen levels are present.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601098","grantId":"G0601098","fundValue":"340724","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sonia  Rocha","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
