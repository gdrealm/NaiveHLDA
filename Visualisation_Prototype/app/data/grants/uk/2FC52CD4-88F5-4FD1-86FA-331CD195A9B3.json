This study will improve understanding of factors associated with increased risk of ‘higher impact’ outcomes in the GMC’s Fitness to Practise procedures for dealing with concerns about doctors. ‘Higher impact’ outcomes are those with more serious implications for the doctor concerned. Specific objectives are:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>a) to ascertain whether doctors trained in other countries and/or from ethnic minority backgrounds have a greater likelihood than other doctors of receiving ‘higher impact’ decisions;</p>\n\n<p>b) to assess the&nbsp;role of other&nbsp;factors relating to work setting or professional experience in influencing these decisions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The study will involve quantitative analysis of anonymised data held by the GMC about all cases entering its Fitness to Practise process in 2005 and 2006. Multivariate analysis will be used to determine whether ethnicity or place of qualification is independently associated with decision outcomes. The findings will provide a more refined and robust understanding than was previously available of the relationship between ethnicity, place of qualification and outcomes for doctors going through the GMC’s regulatory procedures.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F039670/1","grantId":"ES/F039670/1","fundValue":"67605","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte  Humphrey","coPersons":["Aneez  Esmail","Martin C Gulliford","Debbie A Cohen"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
