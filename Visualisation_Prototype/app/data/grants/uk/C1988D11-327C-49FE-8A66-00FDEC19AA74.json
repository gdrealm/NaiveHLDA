{"id":"C1988D11-327C-49FE-8A66-00FDEC19AA74","title":"'Unity through Diversity': Non-Sectarian Social Movements and the Politics of Community in Belfast","abstractText":"Belfast, the capital city of Northern Ireland, is historically known as a violently divided city because it hosts a deep conflict conducted between UK unionists and Irish nationalists over the legitimacy of the wider state. The divided city is most clearly seen in the deeply embedded strength of residential segregation and separate schooling that represents separate and competing concepts of communal affiliation. Institutional structures designed to deal with violent conflict between nationalists and unionists have increasingly been based on recognising and accommodating the distinct national and cultural identities and needs of the two 'communities'. Yet, while it is easy to assume that political mobilisation coheres with ethnic community in the divided city, Belfast has a long and rich history of non-sectarian groups mobilising to advance alternative politics and contrasting visions of communal belonging which embrace diverse identities and political goals. Examples of these non-sectarian movements include Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender groupings, punks, feminists, socialists, environmentalists, anti-nuclear groups and anti-global capitalist movements. \n\nThis project seeks to bring to wide attention the history and narratives of these non-sectarian movements by examining the extent these groups forge plural communities that purposely supersede ethnic identity. By illuminating the contingent and multiple ways in which the political community is imagined, challenged and constituted, the project aims to address a crucial gap in research on community in divided societies. In particular, the project looks at how non-sectarian movements have potentially fostered community identity through ritualistic performance, especially street protests, theatre and art, and the carnivalesque. Alongside this, the project examines how groups which do not historically belong to specific residential spaces, or are effectively excluded from key symbolic public spaces, creatively utilise space to create communal belonging and identity. Furthermore, the project will aim to bring new depth to our understanding of why individuals choose to opt out of traditional ethnic communities by joining non-sectarian movements in the divided city. It will also explore how diverse non-sectarian movements have created networks and strong relationships of support between each other.\n\nIt is expected that this project will have a high academic and public policy impact. It will appeal to academics who wish to examine the complex character of communal mobilisation in divided cities, and it is hoped that it will initiate similar research on alternative modes of community in similar violently divided cities as well as comparative work. The research will also be of great benefit to public policy makers, especially in Belfast and across Northern Ireland, which are responsible for institutionally supporting and funding community development as part of peacebuilding strategies. The project will not only bring together non-sectarian social movement representatives and public policy makers to debate the meaning and salience of community in the context of a divided city; it will further contribute to an important deliberation over how community should be defined for the purposes of institutional classification and support and which communities should merit such support.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J012289/1","grantId":"AH/J012289/1","fundValue":"19096","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2012-11-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Nagle","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
