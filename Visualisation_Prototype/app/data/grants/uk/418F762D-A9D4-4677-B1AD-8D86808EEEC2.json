Most of these persons are too impoverished to afford antiretroviral drug treatment (ART), which, in any case, does not cure HIV-1 disease, has many side effects, and must be taken for a lifetime to be fully effective. It is obvious that more user-friendly, less costly, and short-term rather than lifelong treatments are needed. Although viral eradication from the infected host must remain the ultimate goal, enabling the host to co-exist with the virus may be a more realistic immediate goal. Thus we feel it is time to move some of our scientific knowledge from the bench to the bedside. We and others have clearly shown that a few HIV-1+ people can survive for many years without drug intervention, and that these people do not lose the HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses which are important in controlling viral growth. Such long-term non-progressors (LTNP) have low viral loads and low transmission potential. If we could turn chronic progressors into long-term non-progressors we would reduce the economic and clinical burden of ART and have a profound effect on the future pandemic. We propose to enrol 30 HIV-1+ volunteers who have been on ART for some time, with low viral loads, and with CD4 T-cell counts which have risen to 400 or more. We have already shown that such individuals do not make effective immune responses to HIV-1, although immune responses to other bugs (such as CMV) may be restored. If such people stop taking ART viral loads rebound and CD4 T-cell counts rapidly drop. We will divide the treatment groups into 3 arms in an immune based therapy trial as follows: Arm 1. DNA vaccine containing many ‘pieces’ of HIV-1; followed by a cocktail of safe immunomodulatory drugs to help the vaccine responses survive; followed by two boosts with DNA vaccine. Arm 2. DNA vaccine (as in arm 1) given three times without immunomodulatory drugs. Arm 3. The cocktail of immunomodulatory drugs alone. ill compare HIV-1-specific immune responses between different arms and to those observed in LTNPs. In the future we may feel able to stop ART and compare viral rebounds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501957","grantId":"G0501957","fundValue":"925735","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2010-10-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frances M Gotch","coPersons":["Nesrina  Imami"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
