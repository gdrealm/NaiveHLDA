Currently, engine testing, requiring measurements of thousands of spatio-temporal parameter values, uses wired sensors connected via a cabling harness to remote condition-monitoring units. Such data acquisition requires many kilometers of wiring, involves long and expensive setup and instrumentation times and hinders efficient time-to-market. We aim to mitigate the challenges of deploying wireless sensors for data gathering in the harsh, dynamic and inaccessible environment of gas turbines involving high-speed rotations, rapid airflows, high temperatures and large amplitude vibrations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G002681/1","grantId":"TS/G002681/1","fundValue":"67758","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Andrew Glover","coPersons":["Robert  Atkinson"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
