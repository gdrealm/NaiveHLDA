Although the mineral phase and the (wet) protein have very different properties - the mineral is stiff and brittle, while the protein is much softer and tougher - the composite combines the optimal properties of both components: the stiffness and the toughness. This unusual combination of material properties provides both rigidity and resistance against fracture, and an in-depth understanding of the underlying interfacial structures and properties would clearly help in the design of better composite materials.\nThe project will investigate at the atomic scale the interaction of the collagen protein with the phosphate mineral, which as the major constituent of natural bone tissue is an important component of various classes of composite bio-materials for bio-medical applications - hence an important issue in current bio-materials and life sciences research as well as being relevant to tissue engineering and medical implant technologies. The project will concentrate particularly on the molecular interaction of the collagen with surface features of the phosphate material and the templating role of the collagen in the apatite nucleation and growth process. \nThe outcome of the project will thus be a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the role of the protein and mineral phases in determining the properties of the composite bone material.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700869","grantId":"G0700869","fundValue":"343427","fundStart":"2008-09-29","fundEnd":"2012-03-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nora Henriette De Leeuw","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
