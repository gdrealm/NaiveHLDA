At present, the best chance of cure comes from removal of the initial tumour before it has had a chance to spread elsewhere in the body. Once it has spread, the disease is incurable for most patients. Currently used anti-cancer drugs work primarily by stopping or slowing cancer growth, but their effects are usually only temporary and so the benefits are small. However, cancer growth is only one part of the disease process, and a well-tolerated drug which prevents cancer from spreading has the potential to reduce an enormous amount suffering and death. At present, no such drugs are in routine use. \n\nMRCK and ROCKII are molecules that are important in the process by which cancer moves from one part of the body to another, so a drug which stops these molecules from working may stop cancer spreading.\n\nThe proposed research aims to make a drug that will do this. The approach that will be taken involves first discovering chemicals which block MRCK and ROCKII activity and then changing these chemicals to make them safe and suitable for use in humans. An important part of this process is to ensure that the chemicals do not block other molecules that are required for the body's normal functions, as this might lead to unacceptable side effects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J005126/1","grantId":"MR/J005126/1","fundValue":"935962","fundStart":"2012-01-02","fundEnd":"2014-07-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Francis Olson","coPersons":["Martin  Drysdale"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
