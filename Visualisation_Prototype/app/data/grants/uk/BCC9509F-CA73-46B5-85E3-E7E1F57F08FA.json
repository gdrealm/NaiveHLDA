{"id":"BCC9509F-CA73-46B5-85E3-E7E1F57F08FA","title":"Towards excited state dynamics in nucleosides","abstractText":"The objective of this proposal is to study ultrafast UV-laser-induced dynamics in the DNA bases adenine and guanine as a stepping stone towards the nucleosides adenosine and guanosine. Funding will enable the PI to implement laser desorption into his laboratory so that these nucleosides can be brought into vacuum without decomposition and hence their ultrafast photochemistry studied in the gas-phase for the first time. Complementary high level calculations will provide critical guidance to interpreting the experimental results whilst posing new challenges to theoreticians as these studies will explore the complex interplay between multiple reaction paths and the ways these paths are coupled with one another with increasing molecular complexity. The PI, CoI and RCoI are ideally placed to undertake this exciting and ambitious research, which will begin to bridge the gap between the photochemistry of the DNA bases and that of nucleosides, and ultimately help elucidate the 'molecular mechanisms of the photostability of life'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J007153/1","grantId":"EP/J007153/1","fundValue":"46374","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used by academics studying the fundamental photochemistry of heteroaromatic building blocks in nature.

Our high-level results have shown the nature of electronic states that are populated by UV excitation of fundamental heteroaromatic chromophores, how the energy is redistributed to vibrations via non-adiabatic conical intersections, and how certain vibrations dominate and control the observed photochemistry. A large number of workers are investigating the photochemistry in fundamental natural chromophores. They are interested in the mechanism by which these molecules redistribute the absorbed energy to an environmental background, enabling tremendous photostability. Other workers have devised and applied new experimental techniques to further understand these and other (related) systems to those studied by us. Other researchers have also applied similar computational protocols to related systems following on from our work. Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
