{"id":"45EBBDD2-288A-464E-95FB-A803142FBEFC","title":"Characterising Epithelial Cell Movements during Anterior Patterning","abstractText":"During embryonic development, the head-tail axis is properly oriented by the migration of a special group of cells called the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE). If these cells fail to migrate, the embryo develops abnormally and generally aborts. The AVE moves within a sheet of cells called the Visceral Endoderm (VE). Work from my group indicates that AVE migration is regulated by the surrounding VE cells changing their shapes in a coordinated manner. Our work has implicated a specific molecular pathway called the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway in AVE migration.\n\nUsing a novel imaging technology that provides images of living samples at extremely high quality, this project will characterise in detail the movement of all the cells of the VE, to provide the contexts in which to understand AVE migration. It will also characterise the dynamics of the molecular motors that drive the cell shape changes that regulate AVE migration. To better understand the influence of PCP signaling on AVE migration, we will disrupt it in various way, to determine what effect this has on AVE migration. We will examine various mutants that are known to show a failure of AVE migration to see if they also show a perturbation of PCP molecules. Finally, we will examine mutants of major PCP genes for AVE migration defects. \n\nSheets of cells like the VE are generically called epithelia and play an important part in many developmental processes. In adults, epithelia give rise to the majority of cancers, and the spreading of such tumors is the major cause of mortality in patients. PCP signaling is important in many contexts, such as during the formation of the heart and spinal cord. Disruption of PCP can lead to congenital heart defects or condition such as spina bifida, where portions of the spinal cord are exposed through the skin on the back of the body. A better understanding of both epithelia and PCP signaling will contribute to the development of treatments for pathological conditions arising from their perturbation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J00989X/1","grantId":"BB/J00989X/1","fundValue":"509733","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This research project is ongoing so the primary findings of the research arising from this grant are just starting to be published (in 2014).

Our ongoing research is also clarifying how cells migrate during the formation of the embryo.\n\nIn terms of techniques, we have developed ways of imaging mouse embryos using a new advanced type of microscope. The approaches we have developed for imaging mouse embryos by light sheet microscopy can be used by others to image their samples.
