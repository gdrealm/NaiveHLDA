{"id":"F4ED9C93-F449-4B64-AF0F-E5927AA984AF","title":"EPSRC Access to Materials Research Equipment - 3D ESEM","abstractText":"Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is a key technique underpinning a wide range of research in Materials Science as well as being heavily exploited in branches of Physics, Chemistry and Biological Sciences. Recent advances in SEM technology have included the integration of several complementary techniques into a single instrument providing enormous flexibility and a high degree of automation. Recent advances include operation in gaseous and liquid specimen environments (ESEM) brought about by improved vacuum control and detector technology. However, further novel in situ analysis of a greater range of materials, particularly extendable using non-vacuum conditions, represents the future synergistic direction of SEM led research. This proposal addresses the specific criteria for Specialised Scanning Electron Microscopy with relevance to Focussed Ion Beam techniques within the call. A total of 20% of spare capacity, equivalent to one working day a week, will be made available to external users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F019882/1","grantId":"EP/F019882/1","fundValue":"165012","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The outcomes of this project in extending 3D imaging techniques will be useful to the investigation of a wide range of materials systems.

Many projects were conducted ranging from routine characterisation of materials, preparation of site specific cross-sections for transmission electron microscopy, dynamic of swelling in clays under environmental imaging conditions, manipulation of carbon nano-pipes in partial vacuum and detection of carbon nano-particles in cross-sections of cells at cryo-genic temperature. However, the major achievement of the programme was the translation of techniques developed for physical sciences to solve problems in biological materials. The extension of the 3D imaging, FIB-SEM tomography, techniques to relatively large volumes of organic materials has opened new avenues for research in cell and tissue organisation. The outcomes of this project in extending 3D imaging techniques will be useful to the investigation of a wide range of materials systems.
