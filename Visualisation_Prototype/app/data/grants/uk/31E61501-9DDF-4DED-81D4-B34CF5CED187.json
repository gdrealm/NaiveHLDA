{"id":"31E61501-9DDF-4DED-81D4-B34CF5CED187","title":"Target validation and lead identification for the development of disease modifying drugs in osteoarthritis (OA)","abstractText":"Osteoarthritis affects approximately 60% of over 65 year olds causing pain, joint stiffness and poor mobility which often reduce independence and quality of life in sufferers. It is caused by gradual degradation of cartilage and bone within the affected joints. The most common joints affected are the knee and hip and a significant proportion of knee replacements are due to osteoarthritis. The current treatments are pain killers, anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids which do not prevent or slow the progression of the disease, have side effects and at best only relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis. An effective ?disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug? would target a detrimental protein present in the osteoarthritic joint but not the normal joint. Our research has identified such a protein, an enzyme which promotes cartilage degradation. Drugs designed to stop this enzyme will prevent further joint damage. In this project, the first stages of design and testing a drug to block this enzyme will be completed. \nThe impact of a drug treatment for osteoarthritis in patients would be reduced symptoms, improved quality of life, and reduced need for joint replacement surgery. This would mean reduced costs for patient care for the NHS and healthcare providers. The development of an effective drug for osteoarthritis would have a large commercial value to the pharmaceutical industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000767","grantId":"G1000767","fundValue":"840118","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Drew  Rowan","coPersons":["Emma Jane Blain","Jennifer Mary Milner"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
