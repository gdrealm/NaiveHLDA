{"id":"B2D261BF-A526-4146-BEA3-BBAEC2443846","title":"Towards the affordable workhome: A community-based initiative with home-based workers in social housing","abstractText":"This interdisciplinary project used innovative Open Space, Participatory Design and Community Journalism methodologies to achieve a high level of engagement with a previously hidden and disconnected community.\n\nFour community-based events were held, at which participants engaged with each other and with a research team consisting of architects, a sociologist of home-based work and a community journalist, to explore the issues that stand in the way of residents of home-based work engaging in home-based work. The Housing Trust partner reversed their policy towards home-based work at the outset of the project, from prohibition to support and encouragement. This provided a secure base from which to run the project. Legitimising existing, and supporting prospective, home-based working social residents, the project contributed to the development of social and economic connectivity and a sense of community amongst a previously illicit workforce. This project has an ongoing legacy in the form of a lively and productive monthly Enterprise Club, an Emerging Enterprise pilot project for home-based workers run by the Housing Trust and a dedicated page for home-based work on the Housing Trust's website.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I507566/1","grantId":"AH/I507566/1","fundValue":"36105","fundStart":"2010-12-06","fundEnd":"2011-10-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Frances  Holliss","coPersons":["Paul  Egglestone","Carol  Wolkowitz","Colin Sidney Davies"],"organisation":"London Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
