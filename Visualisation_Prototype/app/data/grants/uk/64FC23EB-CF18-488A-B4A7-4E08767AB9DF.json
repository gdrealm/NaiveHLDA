{"id":"64FC23EB-CF18-488A-B4A7-4E08767AB9DF","title":"TP103A pilot patient preference RCT of admission to a women s crisis house compared with psychiatric hospital admission","abstractText":"A small number of women?s crisis houses have opened around the UK. They aim to offer a service which is more acceptable, less coercive and less stigmatising than psychiatric hospital admission for women. However, there has been little research examining whether these services really do lead to better outcomes for women in terms of their symptoms, quality of life, needs or satisfaction. We therefore propose to evaluate women s crisis houses, comparing them with psychiatric inpatient wards. There are two phases to this proposal. In phase one we will explore with women and staff from women s crisis houses and psychiatric wards in the same catchment areas, suitable points in their admissions for recruitment and randomisation. We will discuss what they consider to be the most important outcome measures e.g. quality of life or symptoms. We will also use published literature about research in mental health crises to help us to identify the best and most acceptable ways of inviting people to take part in research at such times. \n\nIn phase two we will use a study design known as a patient preference randomised controlled trial (RCT). With this type of design, women are first asked whether they have a strong preference for a particular type of service: if they do, they will receive the service they prefer. Women who do not have a preference will have a 50:50 chance of being admitted to either a crisis house or a psychiatric inpatient ward ? this process is called randomisation. This design has been chosen because we expect many women to prefer women?s crisis houses. A more traditional study using randomisation would not allow for such preferences: many women might therefore be unwilling to take part. \n\nIn this pilot study, we will test the outcome and cost measures, which will include questionnaires asking about quality of life, symptoms, satisfaction with the services, needs and contact with services. We will also explore the number of women s services nationally that could participate in a future larger study.\n\nIf this initial trial suggests that a patient preference RCT is a good method for evaluating crisis houses, we plan to conduct a larger national study including several more women?s crisis houses: this should give a clear answer as to whether this type of service is effective.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401241","grantId":"G0401241","fundValue":"266218","fundStart":"2005-09-19","fundEnd":"2008-05-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Louise  Howard","coPersons":["Penny  Cutting","Sarah  Byford","Graham  Thornicroft","Morven  Leese","Jonathan  Bindman","Anne  Boocock","Sonia  Johnson"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
