{"id":"31D622AD-35D5-44A5-AF76-2D0C564911FB","title":"Experiencing HIV treatment in the context of uncertainty: A qualitative study","abstractText":"<p>This is a qualitative prospective study that aims to capture the lived experience of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in the post conflict societies of Serbia and Montenegro. Specifically the study will explore how individuals manage living with their illness in a context of unstable delivery of HIV treatment and what effect ongoing uncertainty and anxiety can have on individualsâ€™ perceptions of their quality of life. It will examine the strategies that people use to cope with such uncertainty, and in particular will focus on the role that hope plays. The study will follow twenty PLWHA over a year. Participants will be interviewed three times and asked to keep a diary, either written, audio or e-based, over the twelve months. The findings of the study will contribute to informing advocacy in relation to HIV treatment need and experience, as well as advancing current understandings of the impact of innovative technologies on illness management in transitional settings and qualitative methods to capture narratives over time.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1689","grantId":"RES-000-22-1689","fundValue":"44585","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tim  Rhodes","coPersons":["Judith Maureen Green","Mark David Davis"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
