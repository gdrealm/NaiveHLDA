{"id":"ED1FC737-59E6-4DB3-A47C-271A33FD9652","title":"CAPSEED - A new seed conditioning process for arable and horticultural crops.","abstractText":"Cold atmospheric plasmas (CAPs) have been shown to have disinfectant properties in human and animal health systems,\nproviding surface and sub-surface activity while leaving healthy tissue undamaged. Very recently, CAPs have been shown\nto reduce certain plant diseases, and to modify seed and seedling behaviour, altering seed coat properties and water\nuptake, resulting in improved seedling vigour and, in some cases, improved crop yield. Many horticultural crops are\nadversely affected by seed-borne diseases which are difficult to control with standard fungicidal products. In broad-acre\narable crops, while seed-borne diseases can usually be effectively controlled, there are many establishment problems,\nprimarily associated with lack of moisture, which result in either crop loss, or more usually sub-optimal plant populations,\npoor growth and lower final yields. This feasibility study will focus on understanding how CAPs could be used to condition\nseed and overcome some of these problems. Contrasting seed types and problems will be addressed, to include a) control\nof seed-borne disease in small seeded vegetables (celery, onion, lettuce) b) promotion of germination and vigour in large\nseeded (maize) and small seeded (oilseed rape) field crops, and evaluation of crop performance. The feasibility study will\ninform the potential for a novel, easy to use, non-chemical technique for improving crop performance, and create a\ncommercial opportunity for the development of safe and effective plasma generating units.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N004760/1","grantId":"BB/N004760/1","fundValue":"124036","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Elizabeth Thomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"National Inst of Agricultural Botany","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
