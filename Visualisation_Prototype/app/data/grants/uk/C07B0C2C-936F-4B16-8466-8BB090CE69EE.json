Previous experiments have examined the interplay between task- and stimulus-related influences on awareness at a particular point in time. However, most real-life tasks are extended in time, so performance at these tasks is only poorly predicted by performance at a fixed point in time.</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to investigate the interplay between task- and stimulus-related influences on awareness across time in order to acquire a better understanding of the processing limitations faced in everyday attentionally demanding tasks. Awareness will be probed by measuring both subjective reports and scalp-recorded voltage fluctuations that reflect the extent of processing at different temporally defined stages from sensory analysis up to awareness.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1667","grantId":"RES-000-22-1667","fundValue":"47124","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  As outlined in the previous section, the award supported the development of a paradigm which played a key role in the success of a subsequent research programme funded 2009-2012 by the ESRC to examine the &quot;local bias in attention&quot; of a remote people. \nIndeed, the paradigm provided the methodological foundation for the finding that urbanisation decreases attentional engagement (Linnell et al, 2013, JEPHPP). \nThis finding was written up as an ESRC case study and generated considerable media interest and public engagement.

The new knowledge generated should help us better to understand, and to remediate, certain forms of dyslexia.\n\nNEW PARAGRAPH\nWe have also advanced our understanding of the effects of load (here extraneous mental load and stimulus perceptual complexity) on the engagement of spatial attention and the avoidance of distraction from neighbouring stimuli (Caparos and Linnell, 2009 Visual Cognition, 2010 JEPHPP; Linnell and Caparos, 2011 JEPHPP, 2013 Frontiers). Our new understanding challenges 'load' theory, the dominant theory of spatial selection, in suggesting that mental resources are involved in, and indeed required for, focusing perceptual resources on target objects.\n\nNEW PARAGRAPH\nIn the process of achieving the above, we refined the dominant paradigm used in studying spatial selective attention (the flanker paradigm) and developed powerful new analyses for it. The refined paradigm played a key role in the success of a separate research programme funded by the ESRC to examine the &quot;local bias in attention&quot; of a remote people. Indeed, it provided the methodological foundation for our claim that urbanisation decreases attentional engagement (Linnell et al, 2013, JEPHPP). Following on from the previous section outlining key findings, we envisage our research contributing to developments in the understanding and remediation of certain forms of dyslexia. Eventually, these developments could result in changing educational practice in schools.\n\nNEW PARAGRAPH \nMore generally, our research is relevant to a much wider range of real-life behaviours, many of which are characterised by periods of engagement punctuated by disengagement and reorienting. The relationship between engagement and disengagement/reorienting may define different attentional styles that are characteristic of different groups/individuals (e.g., urbanised versus remote, Linnell et al, 2013, JEPHPP; autism spectrum disorder versus typically developing controls).
