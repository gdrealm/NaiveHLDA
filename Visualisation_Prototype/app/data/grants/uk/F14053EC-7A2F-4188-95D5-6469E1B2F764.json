Some of this work comes under the heading of Gypsy Roma Traveller History Month. Cultural historians and scholars of historical representation, however, recognise that much of what we know in the twenty-first century of these communities in the past is contingent on fragments, the texts that survived in archives. These texts include (but are not limited to) scholarship, official reports, literature, popular fiction, newspaper articles, art, and photography. Much of what remains was written or made by people who were not Gypsies, Roma/Romani, or Irish Travellers. As well as uncovering the history of these communities, then, academics study the context in which those texts were written, who wrote them and why. For instance, one way of finding out about these communities is to examine court records. But does research that uses this source in order to reconstruct the past unavoidably reinforce prejudices about criminality? The proposed review examines how researchers in the arts and humanities have encountered, articulated and overcome these issues in their work.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, representations of these communities proliferated, and amateur and professional scholarship simultaneously turned to them. That scholarship was necessarily framed by the discourses of its period, whether they concern folklore, race and extinction, migrancy, or morality. It is on research into these communities in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that this review therefore concentrates. It is only since various academic disciplines, but in particular the humanities, began routinely to examine their relations of power with their objects of study, and not to take their expert objectivity for granted, that research into Gypsies, Roma/Romani and Irish Travellers considered the ways in which knowledge about these communities in the past is constructed (rather than being transparent, or merely waiting to be uncovered). In other words, how do we know what we know about this subject? The review begins with two key hypotheses. The first is that research into attitudes towards and historical constructions and representations of these groups has been influenced by research in to other marginalised groups, including the representation of Jews in Europe, and the use of methodologies or critical practices developed as part of what is loosely termed 'postcolonial studies'. This term refers to a deconstruction of the power relations and complex identity constructions that are a result of imperialism. The second hypothesis is that very few studies in this area are constrained by traditional disciplinary boundaries, most having met the ethical, political, and textual challenges of researching these communities in the past by engaging with sources and techniques from similar, yet separate, modes of study. For instance, historians and geographers draw on each other's work, as well as on practices from literary studies. \n\nThere are three main elements to the project: a desk-based collection of research into historical attitudes towards and constructions and representations of Gypsies, Roma/Romani and Irish Travellers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Britain; analysis of this research using defined research questions and consultation with an expert panel; and a one-day workshop exploring the impact of historical/cultural representations on the experiences of these communities, helping to point the way towards future historical research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011606/1","grantId":"AH/J011606/1","fundValue":"22874","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The discussion paper and podcast associated with this project have been downloaded by people outside academia and discussed on social media (Twitter).

There exists in contemporary British culture a lack of understanding about the diverse histories of these groups. \n2. The concept of an ‘authentic Gypsy’ of the past persists, meaning that experiences failing to match this visible stereotype are neglected. \n3. These groups are usually considered in collective isolation rather than as part of mainstream British history. \n4. The definition of terms like ‘Gypsy’ is an ongoing process and scholarship contributes to both the undermining and reinscription of the stereotypes they connote. \n5. Romani and Roma history in Europe amounts to more than victimhood and there is still considerable work to do to retrieve it. \n6. Nevertheless, the history of persecution of these groups informs contemporary identities; these persecutions have not yet been fully recognised as part of broader histories. \n7. Written and oral histories and autobiographies are co-opted into narratives about nation, modernity and ethnicity, and are used to perpetuate exoticism and prejudice. \n8. Policy and legislation are based on knowledge about these groups that is open to critique and question. Potential areas for further research in the humanities are: \n1) Analysis of terms used in Britain for and by the different groups making up these communities; \n2) Comparative work on formation of stereotypes in Britain, Europe and America. \n3) Cracking the monolith of the image of the ‘Gypsy’ by examining similarities and differences in the ways that groups were figured. For example: \n - the Irish and Irish Travellers; \n - European ‘Gypsies’ coming to Britain and British Romanies/Gypsies; \n - Scottish Travellers and Romanies/Gypsies; \n - Welsh Kale and English Romanichals; \n - Romanies/Gypsies and others engaged in the same trades; \n - ‘Strangers’ and regular visitors; \n - Jews and Romanies/Gypsies. \n3) Assimilations and displacements. \n4) Migrations to America and forced migrations to slave and penal colonies. \n5) The inclusion of these groups in mainstream histories (such as medical or military). \n6) The role of these communities in the history of British religion. \n7) Analyses of oral histories and autobiography. \nThis work should: \na) Be aware of debates in the Social Sciences to understand the discursive frames in which its secondary material is caught. \nb) Be of the highest scholarly standards to do justice to the people whose histories and representations are studied. \nc) Move beyond looking at the ways in which the figure of the Romani/Gypsy has been used to play out non-Romani /Gypsy fantasies and anxieties.
