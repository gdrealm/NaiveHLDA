Some, such as Huntingtons disease, are entirely genetic, whilst many others like cancer, coronary heart disease, or Alzheimer?s disease have a large genetic component. The main premise of gene therapy is that these and many other conditions could be treated by correcting the faulty genes behind many such diseases. Unfortunately, whilst there is a widespread belief that gene therapy will cure many diseases eventually, it has proved very difficult to apply in practice. One of the biggest problems has been in getting the target tissue to take up the genes (which are large molecules and do not enter easily into cells or nuclei) safely without harming or affecting other tissues or causing incidental side effects elsewhere. This project aims to use ultrasound scanning and microbubbles for this purpose. Microbubbles are small gas-filled bubbles that are widely used to improve ultrasound studies in patients. While ultrasound and microbubbles are very safe, the acoustic effects produced by scanning can improve delivery of genes by transiently producing small pores in cell membranes, allowing DNA to enter. This is very exciting, because it would help improve delivery of genes to the appropriate organ using a relatively simple method as most organs can be scanned with ultrasound easily. This project will evaluate and develop this approach in cells and tissues in culture and animal models, so that it may be developed for patient use.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0100120","grantId":"G0100120","fundValue":"475008","fundStart":"2002-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Joseph V HajnalMartin  Blomley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
