This project will reliably determine whether measurement of a new risk factor (factor XIIa) will help doctors to do this. Since we have already shown that it is possible to alter factor XIIa levels we might then be able to develop drugs to treat patients with abnormal levels in order to reduce their risk of stroke and heart disease. The same process of identifying a risk factor and then altering the level was the basis of the development the treatments that we now have for high blood pressure and high cholesterol.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601325","grantId":"G0601325","fundValue":"345737","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter M  Rothwell","coPersons":["Annette I Burgess"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
