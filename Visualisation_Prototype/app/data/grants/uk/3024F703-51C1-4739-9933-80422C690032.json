A new type of optical based analsyer which will be able to differentiate between healthy fruit, and fruit with internal disorders such as rot or latent infection, will be developed. The proposed instrument will be easily integrated into existing packaging line systems and aims to provide early detection of infected or spoiled fruit, such that this fruit can be marketed early or discarded to prevent the spread of further infection. Overall, this type of quality control with result in a new method of crop management, increasing production efficiency and yields, and therefore benefiting the UK and worldwide markets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M005445/1","grantId":"BB/M005445/1","fundValue":"140422","fundStart":"2014-08-31","fundEnd":"2017-08-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Xiangming  Xu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"East Malling Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
