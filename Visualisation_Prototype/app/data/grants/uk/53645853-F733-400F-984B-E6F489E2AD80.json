Though historically less explored than iron, zinc has become the centre of recent attention because of its involvement in about 3000 human proteins. Zinc biochemistry is now a major frontier in the biosciences, poised for ample opportunities and breakthrough discoveries. There is hardly any cellular process that does not depend on zinc in some way. Zinc has unparalleled significance in protein structure, enzymatic catalysis, and cellular regulation. The planned experiments address regulatory functions of zinc(II) as inter- and intracellular messengers. Zinc inhibits enzymes at unprecedented, minute concentrations - a new paradigm for the biological functions of metal ions. \nWe have identified protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), proteins critically involved in controlling cellular functions, as targets of zinc(II) ions. We suspect a new way of cellular control in which zinc(II) ions regulate these thoroughly investigated enzymes. We plan to investigate whether zinc(II) ions are general inhibitors of PTPs or control only a subset of them. We will achieved this goal by a combination of structural methods to identify the zinc-binding site on PTP, bioinformatics approaches to search for analogous binding sites, kinetic analyses of isolated PTPs to determine the strength and type of inhibition, and last but not least investigations in cultured human cells to examine physiological significance. \nProtein phosphorylations and zinc concentrations are both exquisitely controlled. Perturbation of this control is a major cause for diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and impaired wound healing. Accordingly, PTPs are coveted targets for drug design. Our investigations demonstrate that zinc(II) ions bind more tightly to some PTPs than any experimental drug and hence suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions. One approach is to control the cellular zinc status as it turns out to be important for proper functioning of hormones, such as insulin. It is well known that zinc deficiency or perturbations of zinc metabolism caused by genetic or environmental factors impair growth and development and cause disease, but the molecular mechanisms are virtually unknown. Our observations provide a testable hypothesis for this long-standing issue with the potential of defining a major pathway that determines healthy ageing and the balance between health and disease. The results forthcoming from our work will demonstrate that zinc is not just a permanent cofactor of proteins but participates dynamically in cellular metabolism. They are expected to bring about an integration of the two research fields of zinc biology and biological phosphorylations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K001442/1","grantId":"BB/K001442/1","fundValue":"347029","fundStart":"2013-02-04","fundEnd":"2016-05-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Wolfgang  Maret","coPersons":["Maria Rosaria Conte","Christer  Hogstrand"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
