The rapid change from ice ages to warmer periods associated with the melting of ice and rapid rise of sea level are especially dynamic periods. Their relevance is particularly significant given possible future scenarios that include melting of the south polar or Greenland ice caps. This project aims to study the most intense deglaciation of the last several million years in order to identify the links between changes at the opposing polar regions. Recent research has suggested that change in the north and south is linked and our project will shed further light on this model that may increase our understanding of the global linking of climate change processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G015945/1","grantId":"NE/G015945/1","fundValue":"78485","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Kemp","coPersons":["Eelco Johan Rohling"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
