Like genetic studies in mice, the chicken may also provide important evolutionary data on vital genes and how they influence such things as disease resistance and health. Identifying these qualities is only possible when the full extent of genetic differences between animals is available. We are now entering the genetic era of livestock research, made possible by the recent publication of the genome sequence of the Chicken, and the resource of over 3 million genetic variations for the chicken genome in the publicly available Beijing Genomics Institute database. However, the data generated for these genetics variants is from only three animals - a 'typical' layer chicken, a 'typical' broiler chicken and a Chinese Silkie chicken. Although this is a very valuable tool, little is known about the level of genetic variation within and between different breeds of chicken, particularly those used in scientific research and by commercial breeders. The Institute for Animal Health (IAH) is pre-eminent in Europe in its ability to develop approaches to understand host-pathogen relationships in farm animals. The inbred chicken lines housed at IAH are a vital BBSRC-resource used by research centres throughout the EU. The 10 different chicken lines have been selectively bred and vast amounts of data collected over the past 30 years and are unique genetic resources that provide the ability to understand the genetic basis for important traits. As most of these chicken lines are of layer origin they will only contain variations that are specific that line. Our aim is to screen two panels of over 6000 variations and determine a set of variants to be used for comparative studies in each of the inbred lines. Using these genetic markers we will then be able to map traits unique by analysis of genetic crosses of the relevant lines. The tools and resources that will result from the work proposed in this application can be used to fill this knowledge gap, making the identification of genes for important traits a feasible goal. The accessibility of resources for a set of genetic variations for each of the inbred chicken lines will provide genetic tools that will support advances in poultry genomics and enable delivery of results through scientific research to the consumer. Comparisons of these inbred chicken lines may also be very important in answering immunological questions, including some topics of particular importance for human health, such as avian influenza. Furthermore, accessibility of high density maps for genetic variation in the chicken genome will provide enormous opportunities to understand and exploit the genetic control of complex traits to the benefit of poultry flocks, the UK poultry industry, the consumer and the environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F015917/1","grantId":"BB/F015917/1","fundValue":"98263","fundStart":"2008-05-12","fundEnd":"2009-11-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Kaiser","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Pirbright Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
