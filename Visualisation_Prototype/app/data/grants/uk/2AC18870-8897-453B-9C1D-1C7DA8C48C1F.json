{"id":"2AC18870-8897-453B-9C1D-1C7DA8C48C1F","title":"MRC/DH Centre for Environment and Health","abstractText":"There are major public and public health concerns about the effects that the environment may be having on our health. Chronic exposure to potentially toxic substances in the environment is a fact of modern life. Chemicals and other physical agents in the environment are thought to contribute, in part, to the occurrence of various childhood and chronic diseases including reproductive effects (such as low birth weight, still birth and occurrence of congenital anomalies), chest and heart problems, and several cancers. A new approach is needed which combines epidemiological studies of large groups of people with toxicological studies if we are to understand the mechanisms by which pollutants in the environment affect health. The proposed Centre, to be held jointly between Imperial College (lead institution) and King?s College London, adopts such an integrated and multidisciplinary approach. It involves leading scientists in environmental, respiratory and air pollution epidemiology, toxicology, exposure modelling, biostatistics and research on biomarkers present in blood or urine (which may indicate levels of exposure to specific polluatants and possible early biological effects). We will integrate information from both individuals and areas where people live to look at the relations between environmental exposures and health. We will combine the use of advanced geographical information systems (GIS) and statistical modelling techniques, with experimental data, analysis of biomarkers, mechanistic studies and analyses of large population cohorts. Our aims encompass both research and training. Research in the Centre and its application will include a) methods development, involving spatial and statistical modelling and environmental toxicology and mechanisms; b) investigation of priority questions in environment and health, through two integrated research themes: health effects of sources and emissions of environmental contaminants, including mixtures of chemicals from contaminated land, major industrial sources, agriculture and the water supply, and combined effects of different pollutants; and air pollution and health, including short-, medium- and long-term effects of air pollution, pollutant mixtures, and allergens on both heart and lung problems; c) improving the science base underlying the translation of this research into environmental health policy. The training programme will support an extensive programme of short courses, Masters courses, 3- and 4-year PhD studentships, and mentoring of junior and senior researchers, with the aim of fostering the next generation of researchers and research leaders in environmental health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801056","grantId":"G0801056","fundValue":"3160710","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Elliott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
