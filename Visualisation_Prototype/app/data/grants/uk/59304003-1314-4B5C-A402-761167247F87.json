The research evaluates the impact of these reforms on the public's perceptions of the police and on public-police contact, using data from the British Crime Surveys (BCS) conducted between 1982 and 2003. The BCS records the opinions and victimisation risks of a representative sample of the population in England and Wales, including details about crimes that respondents might have experienced.</p> \n<p>More specifically, the study explores:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>public perceptions of the effectiveness of police and local safety interventions, such as police advice to victims, call responses times and the presence of neighbourhood watch schemes; </li>\n <li>the relationship between victims and non-victims' perceptions of crime, safety and policing; </li>\n <li>the link between changes in the perception and the experience of crime, and reforms to the operations and the organisation of police forces in individual Police Force Areas; </li>\n <li>and patterns of crime reporting, in particular changes in the type or severity of incidents reported to the police.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D002079/1","grantId":"ES/D002079/1","fundValue":"68807","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2007-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andreas  Cebulla","coPersons":["Michael  Stephens"],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
