This is particularly important in relation to the extensive continuing work with collaborators from other continents, where productive research is greatly helped up by a personal visit. Over the past three years a large fraction of the Group's papers have been based on collaborations with visitors funded through the short-term visitors programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D001692/1","grantId":"PP/D001692/1","fundValue":"9494","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The visits funded through this grant directly resulted in ten publications, and indirectly contributed to a number of others either through stimulating thinking about those topics or, later, leading to research proposals.

These included visitors working on the interactions between active galaxies and the intergalactic medium (and so on one of the mechanisms believed to head gas and prevent excessive structure formation in the Universe), on the use of the AMiBA telescope to study the microwave background radiation (and so on methods of extracting small radio signals from radio-frequency data, and on combining multi-wavelength datasets to obtain cosmological measurements), on the smallest known galaxies (which were discovered through work in Bristol, and which have implications for galaxy formation and evolution), on populations of galaxies in general (and so on the mechanisms of galaxy assembly), and on cosmology using microwave background data. A number of publications resulted directly from this work, or were based on data gained through proposals written on the basis of the visits. All of the different research areas could be further advanced by further investigation - and a number continue to be worked on by Group members and their subsequent visitors, students, and postdoctoral research assistants.
