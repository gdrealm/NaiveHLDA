Although the increased incidence in recent years has been greater in people over the age of 60, melanoma occurs in a significant proportion in very young adults. Although the majority of melanoma patients, thankfully are cured by their surgery, until very recently indeed, the treatment for melanoma which has spread to other organs has been terrible. The progress in the last 6 years has been that even advanced melanoma has been successfully treated (apparently for the long term) with treatments that work by activating immune responses in the patient: effectively encouraging the patient's own immune system to reject their cancer. Although these long term responses have been ground breaking much needs to be done to capitalise on the progress. There is a need , to predict who will respond, to find drugs for the non-responders and especially to identify patients early in their disease who require, and will benefit from immunotherapy to prevent progression (so-called adjuvant treatment). In order to meet these needs, a better understanding of what determines how patients' immune systems interact with the tumour cells is needed.\n Existing research has shown that in some patients, their immune cells invade the tumour and may actually destroy it. However, it is clear that the tumour cells often then sense that attack and are able to turn off those immune responses. We have preliminary evidence that a number of factors can modulate this process: that a harmful sort of inflammation in the whole body and in the tumour may promote the progression of the tumour and appears to be associated with a suppression of immune responses. Many inflamed tumours have ulceration of the skin surface seen by the pathologist down the microscope, which is associated with poorer survival. This ulceration is more common in smokers and less common in people with higher levels of vitamin D in their blood. In this application we seek funding to better understand ulceration, the role of inflammation, smoking and vitamin D in survival and the interaction between tumour cells and the immune system. The project is designed to do this using a form of genetics, which is the expertise of the group. We are recruiting to a study in Leeds, in which patients give blood samples and allow us to take samples from their tumours and their lymph glands stored in NHS laboratories. We will use laboratory techniques to look at how the genes in those tumours, blood samples and lymph glands are expressed. We will then use computer based tests (bioinformatics) to estimate the activity of different parts of the immune system in those data. In so doing we will be able to study how inflammation, ulceration, smoking, vitamin D, and different tumour types associate with different patterns of immune activity.\n If we can thereby identify what allows some patients to mount an immune response, how the cancers turn off that immune response and what factors affect these processes, then we argue that we will be able to both develop low toxicity treatments which can be used in early disease and to identify patients who will benefit from those treatments. We will understand if there is evidence that harmful inflammation such as that associated with smoking and obesity suppresses immune responses to cancer and reduces survival and the effects of vitamin D. We will therefore be able to better advise patients at diagnosis about factors which may be important to their prognosis and if inflammation does play a role in suppressing immune responses to melanoma then we will explore common drug therapies such as aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as adjuvant therapies. \n In the final period of the project we will use what we have learned to devise tests (predictive biomarkers) to target drug treatments to those who will benefit most.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M019012/1","grantId":"MR/M019012/1","fundValue":"953389","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2020-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Julia  Newton Bishop","coPersons":["David Timothy Bishop","Kenneth  MacLennan","Maria  Marples"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
