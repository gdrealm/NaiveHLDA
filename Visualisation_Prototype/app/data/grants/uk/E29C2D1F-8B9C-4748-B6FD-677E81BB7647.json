A naturally occurring chemical, an amino acid called D-serine, helps activate this receptor and therefore can control the way we think. However, not much is known about how D-serine levels of the brain are controlled. One molecule, called DAO, is responsible for metabolising (breaking down) D-serine, and we have found large amounts of DAO made in parts of the mouse brain (the frontal cortex and hippocampus) which are involved in thinking and memory. So, we wonder if a decrease in DAO levels in the brain increases concentrations of D-serine, which in turn leads to the activation of the NMDA receptor. Before we can test this hypothesis, however, we need to find a way of decreasing DAO levels in the mouse brain. We will develop a new technique called RNA-interference (RNAi) to decrease DAO in the hippocamus and whole brain. This approach uses molecules called small interferring RNAs (siRNAs) which interfere with the machinery in brain cells that manufacture DAO from the blue-prints or 'genes'which are kept in the DNA of each cell. Although this method is beginning to be widely used to study other genes, not a lot is known about its safety or how well the approach can decrease the levels of brain molecules. We will therefore inject different types of siRNAs into the mouse brain to see how well they decrease DAO levels, and will also check whether these molecules are poisonous or toxic to brain cells by using other established methods. We will then repeat the study on small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) which are another type of molecule that produces RNAi. In later work we will use the safest and most powerful RNAi approach to decrease DAO levels in the brain and see if D-serine concentrations and NMDA receptor activation is increased. Overall, the study will provide information on the usefullness of the RNAi approach to study molecules important to different brain functions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D017912/1","grantId":"BB/D017912/1","fundValue":"215499","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have only been used within the scientific research community, particularly neuroscience.

The objectives outlined for Year 2 in our original application have been achieved. Thus, delivery of shRNA constructs with lentiviral vectors has proved to be an effective strategy for safe, long-term reduction of mouse DAO gene expression in the cerebellum and hippocampus. The preparation of this molecular tool is relatively inexpensive and simple compared to transgenic programs. It can be applied to any gene, with neuroanatomical precision and will reduce the number of animals required for molecular investigations. This system also has therapeutic implications. The sequence of DAO which initiates degradation of DAO mRNA, was identified by this project. Attenuating the activity of DAO will help understand the pathophysiological contribution of this gene to disorders such as schizophrenia, autism and athero-lateral sclerosis (ALS). Viral-mediated delivery of genetic material to the human brain has already been trialled and so, theoretically, our preparations of Lentivirus-containing DAO RNAi are ready for injection into the brain.
