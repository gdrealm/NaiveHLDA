This is on the grounds that music is an excellent exemplification of the interaction of science and technology with the broader culture; it also has the benefit of being the focus for passionate concern and enthusiasm amongst many of the Museum's potential visitors. Equally, recent years have seen extensive work in relevant academic fields, and this has the potential to suggest new narratives for museum displays. \n\nAn initial research project with our partners, the Royal College of Music, has established that the subject territory is indeed very fertile. It also showed that our relevant collections are rich and complementary; the RCM's is a strong conservatoire collection of musical instruments, whereas the Science Museum's collections represent sound recording and reproduction, the science of acoustics and music technology. At this stage of the project (perhaps three years ahead of any display opening), we wish to work intensively with relevant scholars, musicians and other colleagues to explore the relevance of the new field of 'sound studies', a rich new academic field, alongside musicology and history of technology to develop exhibition ideas around how the history of music relates to industrial modernity. The idea is that the exhibition can express some of the fresh thinking in sound studies and other relevant fields, thus helping the museum to a deeply satisfying exhibition at the same time as giving this scholarship a welcome and lively public presence. \n\n2015 will be the 80th anniversary of a highly unusual exhibition at the Science Museum, on the theme of noise abatement. Here the concern was with the harm caused by the noise of industrial modernity, the importance of quiet, and the technological means available to ameliorate the din of the modern age. This string of three research workshops will not only celebrate this anniversary, but take it as the stimulus for our investigation, concentrating on music in modernity, probing how scientists, technologists and musicians have been stimulated by, and have responded to, the noise of modernity. As a test bed for and microcosm of the proposed exhibition, the workshops will be accompanied by public events: concerts, performances and talks. \n\nThis workshop series is the latest stage in a multi-strand programme devoted to music and technology that has already included two music commissions / concerts with Icebreaker, the contemporary music group ('Apollo' in 2009 and 'Kraftwerk Uncovered' in 2014); 'Oramics to Electronica', a small temporary exhibition on the history of Electronic music (2011+); and the essay collection 'Material Culture and Electronic Sound' (Weium and Boon 2013).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M008061/1","grantId":"AH/M008061/1","fundValue":"31492","fundStart":"2015-01-19","fundEnd":"2015-07-18","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Aleksander Javier Kolkowski","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Science Museum Group","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
