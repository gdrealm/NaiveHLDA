{"id":"0AAB1AA1-FDEC-45C1-B9F9-BCB8493F9C7D","title":"Integration of complex spatial and temporal elements of episodic memory in adults with Asperger s syndrome","abstractText":"People from the autistic spectrum (with autism or AS) are often thought of as having prodigious memories. But although they can often memorise large quantities of factual information, their ability to use this information in everyday life can be limited. Laboratory studies of memory show that they are less likely to engage in the kind of mental time-travel that most people use when recalling personally experienced events. Instead, they tend to remember such events as timeless facts rather than mentally re-living them. We speculate that this contrast between good memory for facts and poor memory for the self-related aspects of events is because such individuals find it hard to pull together all the parts of a complex event in memory. We also speculate that they have problems in ordering remembered events in time. Both these abilities are needed to engage in the kind of mental time-travel described above. So, when asked to remember a trip to the zoo, people with autism may well recall the zoo and the animals they saw, but not be able accurately to state whether the visit took place before or after a particular shopping trip, or to recall the fact that they had bumped into a former next-door neighbour during the visit. We propose nine studies to test our speculations. By improving our knowledge of the way people with AS remember things, our research will help relatives, educators and carers to plan better treatment and educational programmes. If our speculations are borne out, they may also help in the design of more precise investigations into the ways in which the brains of people with AS work. In the longer term, this will help in the identification of genetic markers and may help in the development of drug treatments for the condition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401413","grantId":"G0401413","fundValue":"191372","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dermot M Bowler","coPersons":["John MacDonald Gardiner"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
