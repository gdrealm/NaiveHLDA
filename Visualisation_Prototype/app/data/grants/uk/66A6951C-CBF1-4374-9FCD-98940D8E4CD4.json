Yet it is rarely used in the dissemination of research in the social sciences. This project aims to break fresh ground by exploring ways in which drama can be used to disseminate findings arising from the Home School Knowledge Exchange project, which was funded under the ESRC Teaching and Learning Research Programme.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the project will look at issues which arise when the two worlds of home and school are brought closer together, and how children and their families can be supported through difficult times such as primary/secondary transfer. These issues often have a strong emotional content –&nbsp; such as children’s and parents’ fears about bullying in secondary school, or children's feelings of both pride and embarassment when aspects of their home lives are brought into school. The project team will work in collaboration with a Cardiff-based theatre group – Theatr Iolo – to develop activities such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Drama workshops involving teachers, parents and children as active participants;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Live drama performances for audiences at national conferences and events;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Drama-based products such as scripts and DVDs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The impact of these activities on participants and audiences will be evaluated using a range of different methods.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-139-25-0256","grantId":"RES-139-25-0256","fundValue":"31069","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Hughes","coPersons":["Wan Ching  Yee"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
