The probabilistic approach is appropriate since specific trajectories are unpredictable in &quot;chaotic&quot; systems.\n\nResearch in ergodic theory has tended to focus on situations where the underlying measure is a probability measure. However, over the last twenty years or so, the study of infinite measure systems -- infinite ergodic theory -- has emerged as a significant area of research with connections to several areas of mathematics (from number theory to mathematical physics) and numerous noteworthy applications. \n\nThe proposal is to hold a week-long workshop on infinite ergodic theory at the University of Surrey during May 2012. This will build on recent unexpected breakthroughs in infinite ergodic theory by researchers at the University of Surrey, coupled with the presence of Professor Jon Aaronson who is the undisputed world-leader in the area and who is the recipient of a Leverhulme Visiting Professorship to spend 6 months at Surrey during 2011-2012.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J02130X/1","grantId":"EP/J02130X/1","fundValue":"14554","fundStart":"2012-05-28","fundEnd":"2012-08-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Melbourne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":" Ergodic theory is the analysis of probabilistic or statistical aspects of deterministic systems.
