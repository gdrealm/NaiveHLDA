Both normal and disturbed activity are closely related to the fine architectural detail of the tissue that makes up the heart. Thus, the electrical signals that initiate contraction must first travel along every single of the millions of muscle cells in the heart, before each individual cell will shorten at its prescribed timing. Similarly, the forces produced by individual cells interact with, and are transmitted through, cell chains often referred to as muscle fibres. These muscle fibres are ordered in complex three-dimensional (3D) arrangements, joined together by non-muscle 'connective' tissue. This assembly is fundamental to healthy cardiac function, allowing the muscle not only to shorten, but also to thicken, in order to push blood out of the cardiac chambers and into the arteries that supply all organs of the body. A precise understanding of detailed cardiac tissue architecture would be of great importance for diagnosis of cardiac diseases, prediction of their progression, identification of useful treatment approaches, and even for doctors' teaching and training (the heart is one of the organs where 'learning by mistake' is not a viable option!). This clinical relevance is contrasted by the fact that, traditionally at least, establishing the architecture of any tissue meant 'slicing it up'. The study of cadaver organs, while historically fundamental in establishing anatomical insight, is equally not helpful to determine the properties of the beating heart. Recent improvements in non-invasive techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), allow increasingly detailed insight into structure and function of internal organs. Even though these recordings are not yet sufficiently detailed to reliably identify fibre orientation in a patient's heart, the technology is moving in that general direction, and it is important that we start now to develop the tools required to handle the vast amount of data that doctors will be able to extract. This represents a major challenge, as it requires a combination of skills and expertise not usually present in a single lab or clinic. These include: advanced MRI techniques to explore the fine-structure of heart muscle while beating; automated image analysis and alignment of data from multiple sources; creation of computationally usable three-dimensional (3D) data sets and characterisation of their changes over the cardiac cycle (3D+Time); comprehensive validation of these techniques by comparison to the current gold-standard of histology for the whole organ; 3D+T visualisation and user-interaction; application of all of the above to an individual within a time-frame that makes 'clinical sense' (hours, not months). This project undertakes to develop exactly these technologies by combining the expertise of leading teams in cardiac MRI (Cardiovascular Medicine at the John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford), bio-medical studies (Oxford University Department of Physiology, Anatomy &amp; Genetics), and image analysis and computational modelling (Oxford University Department of Engineering Science). These teams will jointly implement and validate the whole range of tools required to efficiently reconstruct individual beating hearts from entirely non-invasive imaging techniques, based on proof-of-principle work in small rodents, but taking care that all algorithms are scalable to be adapted, in future, to human heart sizes. The longer-term vision is that after a clinically-indicated cardiac MRI, doctors will be able to look at a 3D+T representation of the patient's heart, zoom-in on any relevant detail (a coronary vessel blockage or a damaged part of tissue), assess treatment options, and predict outcomes for the specific individual before the patient even enters the operating theatre. Much of this vision is still far ahead. Nonetheless, this proposal will make an important step towards this goal.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I012117/1","grantId":"BB/I012117/1","fundValue":"898443","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jurgen E.
