{"id":"CCE4103D-E3E0-4830-B648-B0346B284FEA","title":"Geophysical Modelling of Geomagnetically Induced Currents in the UK","abstractText":"Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) occur during large geomagnetic storm events, typically triggered when a coronal mass ejection from the Sun encounters the Earth's magnetic field. These GICs flow through the conductive crust of the Earth and take 'easy' low resistance paths, such as those through the grounded elements of the UK power grid. Currents flowing directly through the high-voltage network, may cause damage to electrical equipment including transformers. Monitoring of changes in the geomagnetic field, in concert with detailed modelling of the power network and the conductivity of crustal rocks, allows predictions to be made of GICs at particular locations. These predictions are of great interest to power grid operators, as asset owners, and Government, which is concerned that critical infrastructures are resilient to the impacts of natural hazard events. BGS has had several projects looking at various aspects of this problem. We propose to join together three separate threads of research to produce a single model which takes magnetic field data from BGS (and other) observatories, a representative conductivity model of the UK, and the physical configuration of the National Grid as inputs, and outputs a prediction of GICs at transformer sites nationwide. \n\nWe want to investigate how well our understanding of the geophysics matches with measurements of these GICs made at transformer sites. We wish to investigate what might happen if an extreme geomagnetic storm were to occur, including the maximum size of currents induced in the electrical grid. This information would be extremely useful to operators of power, communication, and oil/gas networks, for example.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J004693/1","grantId":"NE/J004693/1","fundValue":"59336","fundStart":"2011-10-03","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  These findings have been used in industry and government. National Grid UK have now included our findings into their risk modelling and have contracted BGS to supply real-time data about magnetic field activity and expected GIC in the high-voltage network. Government has benefited from expert advice before the 2012 Olympics on the likelihood of and response to a major geomagnetic storm.

We found that even with the largest expected geomagnetic storm in a 200 year period there would be unlikely to be large-scale damage to the system. Other countries are now using the techniques and software developed under this grant for risk assessment of their own systems. We have supplied software and advice to Austria, Ireland and Spain.
