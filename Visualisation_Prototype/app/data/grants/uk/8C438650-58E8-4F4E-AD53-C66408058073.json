There is evidence that a fat found in fish oil and some plant oils, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), reduces deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD), and omega-3 PUFA are widely advertised and marketed as bioactives in food and health supplements. The food industry can only make accurate health claims about a product if they are based on good scientific understanding of its actions, but the reasons why omega-3 PUFA are beneficial are not defined. This project will address the urgent need for a better understanding of precisely how omega-3 PUFA protect arteries against the detrimental processes that damage vascular health. Many types of CVD begin when the layer of cells lining the arteries (endothelial cells; ECs) start to function abnormally. This causes white blood cells (monocytes) to enter the artery wall and turn into macrophages, which take up huge quantities of fat and eventually form fatty deposits in the artery wall. Thus, ECs and monocytes play crucial roles in determining the overall health of blood vessels and in CVD development. Fats from foods we consume are carried in the blood in microscopic particles known as chylomicron remnants (CMR). We have shown that fats from food can dramatically alter the functions of ECs, monocytes and macrophages during their transport in CMR and that this increases their ability to release factors which cause inflammation of the vessel wall, and their fat uptake, thus promoting the initiation of vascular damage. The overall aim of this project is to investigate the new idea that omega-3 PUFA protect against vascular dysfunction by modifying the interactions of CMR with these cell types, focusing particularly on ECs and monocytes since their impaired behaviour and interaction occurs earliest in the disease process. We hypothesise that omega-3 PUFA carried in CMR: reduce detrimental events inside the cells which promote the expression and release of molecules that cause inflammation and endothelial dysfunction; and activate protective intracellular events to increase the expression and release of molecules that limit these processes. To test these hypotheses we will use omega-3 PUFA from fish and vegetarian sources and human ECs and monocytes. We have established a method for making artificial CMRs that mimic exactly the effects of those that circulate in the blood stream. This enables us to incorporate omega-3 PUFA into the particles at different concentrations and to examine their specific effects on cultured human cells in comparison to other fats. To link these studies in our model systems with what happens in humans, we will also use CMR obtained from the blood of healthy volunteers given meals containing omega-3 PUFA or other fats. Alongside these studies we will use new techniques that allow us to examine in precise detail an enormous number of genes so that we can discover exactly which genes are altered by omega-3 PUFA, and how these differ from those changed by damaging fats. Current advice from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition to the general public is to increase the consumption of omega-3 PUFA, and as a result there is now considerable and growing interest from the food industry, and they are already being incorporated into common foodstuffs (eg. infant foods and margarines), and are promoted as health food supplements in capsule form. It is therefore essential for health professionals and the food industry, that the reasons why omega-3 PUFA help to preserve vascular health are properly understood. Our studies will provide comprehensive scientific information about how omega-3 PUFA protect against impaired vascular health when they are carried in CMR. Our mechanistic study will provide further support for, and underpin the endeavours of the food industry to develop healthy foods and accurately promote their health benefits.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I005862/1","grantId":"BB/I005862/1","fundValue":"536410","fundStart":"2011-01-10","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline  Wheeler-Jones","coPersons":["Gary Russell Coulton","Kathleen  Botham","Charlotte  Lawson"],"organisation":"Royal Veterinary College","findingsText":" We have developed and optimised physiologically relevant in vitro models to measure vascular health claims of dietary fatty acids and of other bioactives/nutraceuticals in the diet.
