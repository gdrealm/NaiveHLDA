The methodological approach involved a combination of behavioral testing with neurologically healthy and with brain-damaged participants with acquired spelling disorders. It also included a set of treatment studies designed to better understand the conditions (deficit type, treatment technique) under which treating one-language would also benefit the untreated language. This project had a number of specific goals. Several of them have been fully reached or even exceeded. Some have not yet been fully reached due to difficulties beyond our control with data collection (see above section).\n \n1. Goal 1 (exceeded) was to create a rigorous and theoretically motivated Welsh-English bilingual dysgraphia assessment battery. This objective has been reached. In addition, we realized early on in the project that it was difficult to assess spelling in isolation. We have thus developed new tests to assess spoken word production and reading. We are in the process of creating a website to make these assessments more widely available (they are currently available on request to other researchers and speech and language therapists).\n2. Goal 2 (exceeded) was to collect some initial normative data from 40 control (older) participants. This has been achieved for all newly developed tests. In addition, we tested an extra set of 60 bilinguals and monolinguals of different ages to broaden the usability of the materials to different research questions. This had led to publishable data. The main findings are that performance is much more variable than expected, but that language skills are highly resistant to the effects of aging. Overall, bilingual participants performed slightly less well than monolingual participants and often did better in English than in Welsh, despite most being native Welsh speakers. There is clear evidence that the two languages of bilingual speakers influence each other, which had never been demonstrated for spelling abilities. \n3. Goal 3 (reached) was to examine the relative impact of brain damage on each language in bilingual Welsh-English bilingual participants with brain damage. This had led to a very rich set of data that we have started to disseminate. Most noteworthy, we have observed that the patterns of deficits are qualitatively highly similar in the two languages affected, although the severity of the deficits varies for reasons that are not yet entirely clear and that vary between participants. This will form the basis of follow-up studies. \n4. Goal 4 (partly reached and still in progress). We have developed new treatment materials and carried out a number of treatment studies, though not as many as initially planned yet (see above section for explanation). The data analysed so far support our predictions that treating one language CAN lead to improvement to the untreated language but NOT in all conditions. In particular, treatment to processing components thought to be shared across languages (e.g., graphemic buffer) leads to better generalization that treatment of more language specific components (e.g., orthographic lexicon).\n \nIn summary, despite some unexpected challenges with data collection the project has generated a large amount of new resources and data that bring new light to the cognitive processes involved in bilingual language production and which should inform the clinical treatment of bilingual brain-damaged patients. We have started disseminating the results in conferences and through some preliminary publications, mostly targeting academic users at this stage. We will broaden the dissemination audience in the next few months as part of our planned impact activities. The new testing materials (and norming data) and treatment materials will be of use to speech and language therapists for use with clinical populations. They could also be adapted for language assessment in Welsh and English within the education sector. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
