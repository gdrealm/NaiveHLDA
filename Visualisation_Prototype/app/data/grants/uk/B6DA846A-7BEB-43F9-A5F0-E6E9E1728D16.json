Foremost among these challenges is the attrition problem: the fact that subjects are lost from the surveys every time the sample is remeasured. The research will address the attrition problem in two linked ways: by testing whether it is possible to reduce the level of non-cooperation in the field, and by examining the characteristics of non-responders with a view to improving our ability to predict attrition and hence, in the future, to introduce measures to prevent it. We tackle the first problem by exploiting the strength of randomised experiments to test hypotheses about non-cooperation. There is some evidence that subjects decline to continue to participate in longitudinal surveys not because of a deep-seated antipathy to surveys but for situational or circumstantial reasons. We test two ways of increasing cooperation: by using a leaflet that addresses known concerns, and by increasing the numbers of refusals that are reissued by allocating them to a different, and usually a more experienced interviewer. Our approach to the second research question - whether it is possible to learn more about the kinds of subjects that are lost from the survey - is based on sophisticated statistical modelling, supplemented by the collection of data from the interviewers and from the respondents after fieldwork is over.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E024319/1","grantId":"ES/E024319/1","fundValue":"210284","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Plewis","coPersons":["Rebecca Louise Taylor","Lisa  Calderwood"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
