{"id":"FD59EA3C-6BA7-4BC9-AA09-924FE7C8CC09","title":"Global Citizenship and Marginalisation","abstractText":"<p>This study seeks to explore implications of citizen marginalisation, particularly in developing countries, for current debates about global citizenship. It will be set in Peru, where the research will engage young people living in conditions of marginality in the growing slums that surround the city of Lima. Interviews and participatory group discussions will be conducted to explore the ways in which these young people experience and understand citizenship in both its national and global dimensions, and the ways in which such views have been shaped through education policies as well as through participants' gender, ethnic and family background.</p>\n\n<p>The focus of the study stems from concerns with how debates about global citizenship tend to use the national citizenship of developed countries as a model and starting point to promote a global dimension for citizenship. Such views tend to focus on symbolic aspects of citizenship, leaving out its material dimension and the consequent unequal forms of citizenship that exist within 'global citizenship'. The study thus seeks to contribute to current debates on global citizenship and education by linking a political economy of citizenship to the imagined aspects of national and global communities. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G009872/1","grantId":"ES/G009872/1","fundValue":"62796","fundStart":"2008-10-15","fundEnd":"2010-04-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Balarin","coPersons":["Hugh  Lauder"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
