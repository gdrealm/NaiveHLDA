This proposal is for funding for us to be able to travel to these telescopes to make observations which help us understand the properties, origin and evolution of stars and galaxies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G001057/1","grantId":"ST/G001057/1","fundValue":"27918","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Kirpal  Nandra","coPersons":["David  Clements","Stephen John Warren","Subhanjoy  Mohanty","Michael  Rowan-Robinson","Andrew Howard Jaffe","Yvonne  Unruh"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
