{"id":"A69380C8-5DD7-44A5-8D2F-4834ED58CF89","title":"ESPRIT with Pervasive Sensing (Programme Grant)","abstractText":"Elite athletes walk a fine line between performance success and failure. Although regarded by the public as examples of ultimate fitness, in reality they often exhibit vital signs bordering on clinical pathology. Their physiological parameters challenge our notions of what we consider clinically normal, for, as individuals, athletes represent a unique model of human stress adaptation and often, sadly, mal-adaptation. Understanding this human variance may assist ultimately in understanding aspects of well being in the population at large, in the work place and during healthy exercise, as well as when undergoing lifestyle changes to overcome disease, age-related changes and chronic stress.To maximise the potential of GB athletes and support the quest for gold at future World Championships, Summer and Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, the UK's sports governing bodies and the UK sports governing bodies and research councils have identified the opportunity for engineering and physical science disciplines to support and interact with the sports community during training. Not only will this secure competitive advantage for UK athletes, it will also, of more general application, contribute understanding of the biology of athletic performance to gain insights which will improve the health and wellbeing of the population at large.The vision of ESPRIT is to position UK at the forefront of pervasive sensing in elite sports and promote its wider application in public life-long health, wellbeing and healthcare, whilst also addressing the EPSRC's key criteria for UK science and engineering research. The proposed programme represents a unique synergy of leading UK research in body sensor networks (BSN), biosensor design, sports performance monitoring and equipment design. The provision of ubiquitous and pervasive monitoring of physical, physiological, and biochemical parameters in any environment and without activity restriction and behaviour modification is the primary motivation of BSN research. This has become a reality with the recent advances in sensor design, MEMS integration, and ultra-low power micro-processor and wireless technologies.

The results have been exploited for elite sport training and London Olympics; its clinical results have been exploited in a range of acute/chronic conditions (e.g. orthopedics, diabetes, trauma, minimally invasive surgery). The consortium has also exploited many of the results commercially involving partnership with established companies as well as university spin-offs.
