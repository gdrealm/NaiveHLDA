{"id":"BF38B62E-EBC6-4534-BB0F-EBDABBBB6036","title":"Developing platforms for the production of diterpenoids (TSB application reference 43970-304155)","abstractText":"Plants produce a wide range of diterpenoids, many of which are used commercially such as a paclitaxel, employed in the treatment of cancers, and steviol glyclosides which are used as zero-calorie natural sweeteners. Many other useful diterpenoids cannot yet be commercially exploited due to their limited availability and/or high production costs. Using synthetic biology it is now possible to engineer organisms such as yeast so that they are able to convert simple sugars to high-value chemicals. This project will develop yeast, algae and higher plant species as &quot;chassis organisms&quot; which can be used for the scalable production of diterpenoids. Our project will focus in particular on compounds which could be used in the treatment of cancers, or used in skin products such as sunscreens to protect skin against harmful UV light. These biological production systems will also be useful in producing many other diterpenoids that are found in nature.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M018210/1","grantId":"BB/M018210/1","fundValue":"2397570","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2020-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Alexander Graham","coPersons":["Margaret Caroline Smith"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
