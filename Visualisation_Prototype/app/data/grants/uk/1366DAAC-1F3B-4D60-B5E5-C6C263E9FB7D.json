In the case of rare inherited immunodeficiencies diseases (Baby in the Bubble syndrome), they can be cured by delivering a correct copy of the faulty DNA using an engineered virus (gene therapy). This project is to be carried out by scientists in the MRC/UCL Medical Molecular Virology Centre at UCL. They will develop a safer and more efficient method to produce engineered viruses for clinical gene therapy trials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501446","grantId":"G0501446","fundValue":"323831","fundStart":"2007-01-04","fundEnd":"2010-01-03","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mary  Collins","coPersons":["Yasuhiro  Takeuchi"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
