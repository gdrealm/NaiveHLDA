The molecules that would be suitable for such applications must exhibit bistability, which may be defined as a property of a molecular system that allows it to exist in two different electronic states over a certain range of external perturbation. A typical example of a molecular species that exhibits such a molecular bistability are spin crossover compounds. Spin crossover compounds that will exhibit a large thermal hysteresis around room temperature need to be developed for practical applications. Although many attempts have been made to produce a suitable compound in previous studies, so far the production of spin-crossover compounds with such a wide hysteresis is still a challenging issue.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C530179/1","grantId":"EP/C530179/1","fundValue":"203611","fundStart":"2006-02-15","fundEnd":"2009-08-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dermot  O'Hare","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
