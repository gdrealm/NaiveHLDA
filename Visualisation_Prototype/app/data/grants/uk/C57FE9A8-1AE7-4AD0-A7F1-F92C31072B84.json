There is evidence that sub-clinical zinc deficiency may be important with respect to aging, immune function and neonatal health. Zinc can also be toxic if over accumulated. Therefore organisms, including humans require efficient mechanisms to take up zinc from their diet or extracellular environment. Thus, precise regulatory mechanisms are also required to control this uptake to maintain adequate zinc status while preventing its over accumulation. Despite the importance of zinc, we still lack understanding of the molecular basis for zinc homeostasis within in cells and tissues. Zinc homeostasis in mammals is primarily regulated through the control of zinc absorption in the intestine and the loss of zinc from the body through secretion into the intestine. Movement of zinc into and out of cells is mediated by zinc transporter proteins, one of which is called SLC30A5. There are at least two forms of this zinc transporter (SLC30A5a and SLC30A5b) which differ slightly in the amino acids that make them up. Both forms maybe important for zinc uptake from the diet when situated at the membrane of the intestinal cell across which nutrient absorption occurs. However under certain conditions SLC30A5 maybe located within the cell. It is therefore a possibility that the different forms of SLC30A5 may demonstrate a zinc induced movement to avoid zinc toxicity by reducing the amount of zinc entering the cell. This project will investigate how the two different forms of SLC30A5 move within the cell, between the absorptive membrane and other compartments within the cell, in response to changes in zinc availability. To achieve these aims, the two different forms of SLC30A5 will be expressed with the addition of a fluorescent tag in a cell line model of the human intestine. Understanding how SLC30A5 responds to changes in the amount of zinc in the diet will give insight into the mechanisms through which zinc balance is maintained.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D01669X/2","grantId":"BB/D01669X/2","fundValue":"296333","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ruth Alison Valentine","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
