Normally our immune system is perfectly capable of suppressing the growth of these organisms. However, under conditions where the immune system is weakened, for instance during chemotheraphy, organ transplants or HIV infection, these microbes are able to establish lethal infections that are not uniformly/well treatable with currently available drugs - there is a significant unmet medical need. This proposal aims to give us an understanding of enzymes that are important for building the cell wall - a structure that protects these microbes from their environment. This work will ultimately lead to the identification of opportunities for the discovery of novel anti-fungal drugs by the pharmaceutical industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900138","grantId":"G0900138","fundValue":"2219960","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Daan  Van Aalten","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
