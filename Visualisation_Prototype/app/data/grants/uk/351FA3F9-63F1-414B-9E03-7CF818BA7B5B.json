Over the millennia bacteria have evolved sophisticated strategies to introduce three-dimensionality to the biofilm. The architecturally complex structure is generated biologically using a combination of proteins and large sugar molecules that function in the environment outside the cell. One protein that is needed for biofilm formation by a bacterium called Bacillus subtilis is BslA. This protein can self-assemble into an elastic film and forms a hydrophobic &quot;raincoat&quot; over the cells in the biofilm protecting them from external insults. In this application we will exploit nature by using the inherent self-assembly and hydrophobic properties of BslA within a wide range of applications of high industrial significance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M013774/1","grantId":"BB/M013774/1","fundValue":"187166","fundStart":"2015-02-28","fundEnd":"2016-02-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Cait  MacPhee","coPersons":["Nicola  Stanley-Wall"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
