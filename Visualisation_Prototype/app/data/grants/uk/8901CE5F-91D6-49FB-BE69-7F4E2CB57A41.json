Risks of surgery need to be weighed against risk reduction benefits. Pilot research suggests that some women previously treated for breast cancer do not attempt to balance risks and benefits, but opt for RRM because they feel high levels of distress over the possibility of recurrence. Surgeons often assent to these requests for RRM. This study examines:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>whether women’s preferences for surgery represent well-made decisions or not </li>\n\n <li>the clinical and ethical considerations that inform surgeons’ responses to these requests.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thirty qualitative interviews, linked to interviews with their responsible clinicians, will be conducted with women who have experienced cancer or have high familial risk of cancer. Women over the age of 16 will be recruited from breast cancer and clinical genetics centres. Analyses will focus on speech content, but interpretations will also note inconsistencies within interviews and with linked interviews to provide insights into unspoken views and motivations.</p>\n\n<p>Findings will be presented in the light of contemporary thought in bioethics and decision-making. In return, the conclusions that we reach will help shape literatures in bioethics and decision-making.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J008184/1","grantId":"ES/J008184/1","fundValue":"170393","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Lloyd Brown","coPersons":["Peter  Salmon","Christopher  Holcombe","Lynn  Greenhalgh","Helen Claire  Beesley","Demian  Whiting"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" Project is ongoing and data analysis is incomplete. Early indications suggest that patient decision-making for risk-reducing mastectomy follows a different path to that predicted by existing models and indicate a new model of decision-making. Further data analysis are anticipated to secure and further develop this model. This will have substantive implications as to how patients and clinicians might undergo shared decision-making in the future. These findings will be published and presented to conferences and we expect to produce draft guidelines as to how this aspect of medical decision-making can be approached by clinicians.
