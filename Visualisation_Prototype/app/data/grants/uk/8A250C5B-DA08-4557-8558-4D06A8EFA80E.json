There is very little medical research conducted in Mauritania, in the north western part of sub-Saharan Africa, but the information we have indicates that malaria is a problem throughout the south of the country where most of the population live - most of the north of the country is Saharan desert. However, the disease could probably be effectively controlled and possibly even eliminated in the long-term with appropriate efforts. In countries immediately to the south, particularly in The Gambia and Senegal, recent scale up of interventions has coincided with a significant decline in malaria. Although control in Mauritania may have lagged behind it is in a situation with only a short season of mosquito transmission where the parasites might be eliminated given the right approach. The investigating team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the National Institute of Public Health Research in Mauritania are planning to use state of the art genomics and cell culture methods along with collaborators at Harvard University and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in the UK as well as in neighbouring Senegal, to understand the parasite populations and how they adapt to antimalarial drugs and invade red cells in a population where most people have little immunity to the infection. This understanding may help target interventions to particular parts of Mauritania and also help in the design of a vaccine that could induce immunity against the stage of the parasite that invades red cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100123","grantId":"G1100123","fundValue":"497071","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Conway","coPersons":["Hampate  Ba","Manoj  Duraisingh"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
