Hodell to participate in IODP Expedition 339 (Mediterranean Outflow). There were two main objectives: (1) overseeing the drilling of the Shackleton site (SHACK-04) on the SW Iberian Margin; and (2) conducting high-resolution stable isotope analyses of pore water during Expedition 339 using a Picarro water isotope analyzer from Hodellâ€™s laboratory. Both objectives were successfully met.\n\n(1) Shackleton Site\n\nExpedition 339 sailed from Ponta Delgada (Azores) at 0800 h UTC on 22 November 2011 and the Shackleton site (U1385) was the first site on the schedule. Five holes were cored at Site U1385 using the advanced piston corer (APC) system to a maximum depth of ~155.9 mbsf. A total of 67 cores were recovered representing 621.8 m of sediment with a nominal recovery of 103.2% (&amp;gt;100% due to post-recovery core expansion). \n\nSplit cores from all holes were analyzed post-cruise by core scanning X-ray fluorescence (XRF) at Cambridge and the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) to obtain semi-quantitative element data at 1-cm spatial resolution. These data permit accurate hole-to-hole correlation and construction of a verifiably complete spliced stratigraphic section, containing no notable gaps or disturbed intervals to 166.5 mcd. Correlation of variations in Natural Gamma Radiation (NGR) to the oxygen isotope stack suggests Site U1385 contains a continuous record from the Holocene to 1.42 Ma (Marine Isotope Stage 46) with average sedimentation rates of ~ 10 cm kyr-1. We sampled the core working halves of Holes U1385D and E at Cambridge and took 16,512 samples at 1-cm spacing from the Holes D&amp;amp;E composite section. \n\nWe are producing a low-resolution (20-cm) benthic oxygen isotope record to test the preliminary stage designations and provide Expedition 339 scientists with an oxygen isotope stratigraphy. Very strong precession power in elemental XRF and colour reflectance signals promises to be a powerful tool for developing an orbitally-tuned chronology. The Site U1385 record will serve as a marine reference section of Pleistocene climate variability, and will significantly improve the precision with which marine climate records can be correlated to polar ice cores and European terrestrial sequences.\n\n(2) Interstitial Water Measurements\n\nDuring Expedition 339, oxygen and hydrogen isotopes measurements of interstitial water were made for the first time aboard the JOIDES Resolution by cavity ringdown laser spectroscopy (CRDS). The equipment consisted of an L1102-i Picarro water isotope analyzer, which was shipped from Cambidge to the JOIDES Resolution via College Station and installed during the port call in Ponta Delgada. Interstitial fluids were collected at 6 sites during Expedition 339 both by traditional squeezing using a hydraulic press and using Rhizon samplers (Rhizosphere Research Products).\n\nThe interstitial fluids collected during Expedition 339 display widely varying concentrations of elements and isotope ratios, and differ significantly from those of the overlying seawater. Prior to Expedition 339, the pore water chemistry from the Gulf of Cadiz was known mainly through the sampling of fluids from the sea floor or shallow subsurface. Fluids from mud volcanoes have provided a window into sediment-water reactions occurring at depth. During Expedition 339, interstitial waters were recovered to a maximum depth of 750 mbsf at Site U1389. These pore water samples bridge the gap between observations made at or near the seafloor and subsurface water-rock interactions occurring at great depth. \n\nThe negative correlation between d18O and dD in the deep sections of Sites U1389 and U1390 in the Gulf of Cadiz is a telltale indicator of clay mineral dehydration reactions. Clay mineral dehydration occurs at great depth (several km) and begins at temperatures exceeding ~60oC. The transition of smectite to illite, in particular, has been identified as an important process for fluid formation in deeply buried sediment of the Gulf of Cadiz. However, given the geothermal gradients measured during Expedition 339 were always less than 40 oC km-1, none of the holes penetrated deep enough to directly intersect the zone of clay mineral transformation. The fluids must have a deeper, high temperature origin and migrate toward the surface along deep-penetrating faults during times of episodic tectonic activity. Along the transport pathway, fluids interact with surrounding sediments through dissolution and diagenetic reactions. \n\nThe interstitial water chemistry of Expedition 339 sites is complex, reflecting a large number of diagenetic and metamorphic processes that are occurring in an accretionary prism setting on a convergent margin that may be undergoing active subduction. Postcruise research will apply other element and isotope systems to elucidate the diagenetic reactions that have modified fluid composition at Expedition 339 sites. The cores recovered during Expedition 339 will provide sediment archives for analysis by other scientists. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
