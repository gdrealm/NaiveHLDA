Seminar and workshop to exploit research on design of high speed railways\nA one day high-speed railways engagement day with industry was held at the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), London on the 15th Feb 2011.\n\n2. Communication of lessons on planning for new housing\nReview of previous research was undertaken to distil the most recent evidence for the benefit of practitioners to draw out evidence, lessons and pointers for practice. A Workshop (March 2011) involving planning and housing practitioners was subsequently held.\n\n3. Formation of user group for future RF systems through workshops\nWe organised two workshops towards the formation of a user group for future RF Systems engineering. The workshops were targeted for interested parties of UK/International industry and academy\n\n4. HWU Crucible\nSupport for HWU's Crucible programme (an innovative training scheme for HWU early career academic staff together with equivalent employees in industry and external research institutes). The Crucible focuses on building capacity and understanding of Research Collaboration and Interdisciplinarity, Research Innovation and Impact and Research into Policy and Outreach.\n\n 5. 360ART - training of gallery staff to use website application ShoogleIt\nThe aim of 360 ART was to transfer ShoogleIt and associated know-how to the UK artistic and craft communities. Small independent galleries, artists, and auction venues were particular targets. This three-month project provided direct training to gallery staff to use ShoogleIt to produce interactive content on-site. \n\n6. Increasing the Impact of a Freight Decarbonisation Model on Public Policy-making and Industry Behaviour.\nBuilding on EPSRC funded research, the PIA project had four major objectives:\n(i) To update, refine and adapt models to meet the needs of relevant government bodies, mainly DfT, DECC, DEFRA and CCC.\n(ii) To convert the model into a micro-level decision support tool for companies decarbonising their freight transport operations\n(iii) To assess opportunities for applying the model in other contexts, such as local government and public utilities\n(iv) To publicise the model, its capabilities and applications to wider industrial and government audiences\n\n7. Development of real time 3D image processing software\nA challenge for users of previous EPSRC-funded activity is that algorithms were computationally and memory demanding. To enable impact, the software needed to be modified so that it could be run on a common desktop computer and executed efficiently. To achieve this goal, we divided the task in two steps: 1) Porting digital refocusing code from Matlab to GPU code, and 2) Porting super-resolution code from Matlab to GPU code.
