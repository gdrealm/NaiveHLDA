They are now the fastest growing sector of new medicines. Their rapid clearance from the body led to them being linked to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a means by which to prolong the protein's circulation time in the body and reduce its toxicity. This approach has been very successful. However, these current PEG technologies are severely limited and are only available to patients in resource rich countries. There is therefore an urgent need for innovative and cost-effective biotechnology that makes PEGylated proteins more widely available for patients with infectious diseases in resource poor countries. We describe a novel biotechnology that solves this problem, and illustrate its application to IFN-a2 for treating Hepatitis C infection, and to an anti-CD4 antibody fragment that prevents the cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D003636/1","grantId":"BB/D003636/1","fundValue":"280932","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen James Brocchini","coPersons":["Mire  Zloh","Sunil  Shaunak","Graham Walter Taylor"],"organisation":"School of Pharmacy","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
