{"id":"3E5CD423-25EC-43CA-BED7-513590073CD5","title":"Mechansims for the propagation of epigenetic states: Role of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling by SMARCAD1","abstractText":"The genetic material in each cell is packaged and organized by an extremely complex, heterogeneous structure, called chromatin. The basic building block of this structure is called the nucleosome, a molecular protein spool around which DNA winds in almost two turns. Nucleosomes are modified and interact with other proteins to create chromatin structures that shut down genes or allow access to the machinery that read out the information from genes. We will study how nucleosome remodelling and modification enzymes interact to assemble a specific chromatin structure to shut down genes and to stabilise the genome. This research has implications for our understanding of normal development, but also for cancer and fertility.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701175","grantId":"G0701175","fundValue":"355419","fundStart":"2008-08-13","fundEnd":"2011-08-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick  Varga-Weisz","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Babraham Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
