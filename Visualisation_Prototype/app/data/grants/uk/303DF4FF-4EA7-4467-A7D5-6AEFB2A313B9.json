{"id":"303DF4FF-4EA7-4467-A7D5-6AEFB2A313B9","title":"Medical microwave imaging using novel near-field focusing plates","abstractText":"Novel medical imaging devices are proposed leading to early detection of small size breast tumours. The proposed devices are based on microwave technology and are therefore non-ionising, low-cost and more acceptable to the women being examined, eliminating the need for breast compression (as in X-ray mammography). The devices will be researched and developed in Loughborough University and in collaboration with the University Hospitals Leicester. Initial tests will be carried out on representative breast phantoms in the lab following rigorous computer simulations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802609","grantId":"G0802609","fundValue":"96262","fundStart":"2009-11-23","fundEnd":"2010-11-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexandros  Feresidis","coPersons":["Alastair George Gale"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
