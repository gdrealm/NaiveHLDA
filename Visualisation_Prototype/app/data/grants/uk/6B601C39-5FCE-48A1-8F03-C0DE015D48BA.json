The growing suspicion that it allows undesirable non-citizens to undermine the State's ability to deport has led to rapid and far-reaching legislative changes. These concerns are the contemporary face of older discourses regarding the nature of belonging and citizenship, which have long presented foreign men and migrant families as particularly problematic.</p>\n\n<p>This research considers the experiences and legislative treatment of non-citizen, 'deportable' men in relationships with British/European women. Using a combination of documentary analysis and qualitative fieldwork with deportable men, their partners and practitioners in the field, the project pushes the boundaries of knowledge in a number of critical areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>migrant men's negotiations of deportability in the context of having family ties</li>\n\n <li>the impact of immigration rules on family members who are not subject to migration control</li>\n\n <li>changing official constructs of the family and 'genuine' relationships in immigration contexts</li>\n\n <li>the use of gendered rhetoric in migration management. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition to its conceptual contributions, the project will generate empirical data urgently needed to inform policy discourses on family migration, citizenship and deportation.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009370/1","grantId":"ES/K009370/1","fundValue":"218644","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Melanie Bethan Elaine  Griffiths","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
