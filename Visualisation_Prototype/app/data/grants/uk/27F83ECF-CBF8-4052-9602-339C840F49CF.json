To reach this degree of control, we follow several routes. We will manipulate individual atoms in free space using an array of optical tweezers, and couple these atoms to nano-structured cavities, like photonic crystals. Furthermore, we will explore single-photon quantum memories, using either electromagnetically induced transparency to store a photon in an atomic ensemble, or a single atom coupled to an optical cavity to realise an atom-photon quantum interface.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E023568/1","grantId":"EP/E023568/1","fundValue":"618041","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Axel  Kuhn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
