This project falls within the general theme of complex polyketide synthesis and focuses on the total synthesis of the brasilinolides, which are a novel family of potent immunosuppressive and antifungal 32-membered macrolides with unprecedented structural and stereochemical complexity. The planned synthesis of the brasilinolides draws on and extends contemporary methods of acyclic stereocontrol to efficiently set up the required stereochemistry, with particular emphasis on the use of new methodology recently developed in the Cambridge group. Our approach aims to incorporate maximum flexibility in terms of segment coupling, enabling the synthesis of other stereoisomers if necessary as well as novel analogues, and relies on a versatile combination of reagent and substrate-based control. Altogether, the pronounced biological activities of the brasilinolides, along with their lack of acute toxicity, makes further evaluation as new immunotherapeutic and/or antifungal agents of interest, with potential applications inter alia to autoimmune diseases and in counteracting tissue rejection in organ transplantation. These considerations, along with the significant intellectual challenge and high quality training provided by tackling such complex molecule synthesis, make the brasilinolides an attractive and platform for developing new methodology and strategies, which is also expected to become an exciting arena for further chemical and biological studies. Significantly, this project will build on the considerable expertise that we have developed over the years on the stereocontrolled synthesis of bioactive natural products and their analogues.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F025734/1","grantId":"EP/F025734/1","fundValue":"435374","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research results have facilitated ongoing projects in my group and other groups based on the published outcomes.

Significantly, this project builds on the considerable expertise that we have developed over the years on the stereocontrolled synthesis of bioactive natural products and their analogues. As a sideline to the main project, contributions to the synthesis and structure determination of some other important bioactive polyketides were achieved. To date, this project has resulted in 10 publications in peer-reviewed journals. the findings are relevant to other work on the stereo controlled construction of biologically important polyketides Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
