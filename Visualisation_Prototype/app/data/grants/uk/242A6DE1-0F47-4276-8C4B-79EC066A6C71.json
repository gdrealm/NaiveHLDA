Open problems remain inthe understanding of this process, for example, (i) prediction of the ribbon thickness as a function of the physical parameters, (ii) the process stability and (iii) the surface texture. Planar-flow spin casting is an industrially important process. Successful resolution and/or further clarification of these open problemswill have considerable impact in the commercial and academic material science community.The proposed visit to Cornell will concentrate on the prediction of ribbon thickness as a function of the physical parameters. The ribbon thickness is determined by the coupled thermal and fluid-flow problem. Such a coupled problem requires a combined theoretical and experimental approach. The main objective is to develop a collaboration with the theoretical and experimental experts in Cornell on this issue.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G014094/1","grantId":"EP/G014094/1","fundValue":"18664","fundStart":"2008-10-06","fundEnd":"2009-01-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Warren Robert Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
