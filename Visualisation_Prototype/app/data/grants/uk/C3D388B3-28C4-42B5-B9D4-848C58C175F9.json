{"id":"C3D388B3-28C4-42B5-B9D4-848C58C175F9","title":"Bach's Unaccompanied Instrumental Music","abstractText":"J.S.Bach's unaccompanied sonatas and Partitas for Violin, the Cello suites, the works for Lute, and the Flute Suite are the foundations repertory of their respective instruments, yet there is very little literature for students that comes to grips with crucial issues of style and composition type which are vital for performers to understand. My aim has been to produce a book that addresses this need. My main finding is that pieces with dance titles are not in reality dance movements, but generally have some dance characteristics applied to a none dance structure. This is a new approach that opens up a fresh field of analytical interpretation, and will also be vital interpretative key for performers. This project will result in a book, two conference papers, and two articles.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111730/1","grantId":"111730/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The book is stocked and recommended by most university music departments and conservatoires.
