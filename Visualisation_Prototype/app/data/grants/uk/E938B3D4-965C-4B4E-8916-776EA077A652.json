It tells us that there are 12 fundamental particles and their anti-particles: the 6 quarks, the electron and its heavier cousins the muon and tau as well as their three associated neutrinos. These particles interact with each other via the exchange of the force-carrying bosons: the photon of the electromagnetic interaction; the W and Z particles of the weak interaction that are responsible for radioactive decay; and the gluons of the strong interaction that bind the quarks into the protons and neutrons that compose atomic nuclei.\n\nThe last piece of the puzzle, the Higgs boson that gives all particles their bare mass, was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva. Despite this amazing success we know that the SM jigsaw is incomplete as there remain some holes in our knowledge of the Universe. For example, how do we explain gravity, the dominance of matter over anti-matter and how do we account for all of the Dark Matter that we believe exists in the Universe but has so far evaded our detection? The experiments being performed at the LHC are probing the SM at an unprecedented level of energy and precision, trying to test every corner of it to look for signs of where it breaks down. We are searching for something unexpected that may be the first signs of a new theory that gives a more complete picture of the Universe.\n\nThe LHCb experiment at CERN has recently made some very interesting measurements in the decays of B mesons (particles composed of an anti-bottom (b) quark and a down (d) quark), something that it was designed to do with high precision. The decays of interest are rare, happening only once for every 10^8 B mesons produced, but is is precisely because they are rare that makes them sensitive to potential new physics effects that could appear in the quantum mechanical process that controls the decay. Viewed together, these measurements have hinted that non-SM physics could be playing a role, which has generated significant interest and excitement in the particle physics community, giving rise to different predictions for the source of these effects. However, it is also possible that these anomalies are due to some property of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the part of the SM that explains how the gluons and quarks interact. In particular, B meson decay amplitudes may be modified by unknown effects from resonances of a charm and anti-charm quark (charmonium) that can interfere with the signal process, perhaps mimicking some signs of new physics.\n\nGiven the complicated nature of QCD, it is important that we try to approach and constrain the problem from many directions. The proposed research will use the data recorded (and soon to be recorded) by LHCb to perform new measurements to understand these new and intriguing anomalies by disentangling the complicated effects of QCD and potential new physics. The LHCb experiment is best placed to perform these studies owing to the efficient triggering system that it uses to select the B decays of interest and the excellent particle identification that is used to suppress backgrounds. In collaboration with particle theorists, we will be able to expand our understanding of these B meson decays and, depending upon what we find, can set the direction for the next programme of measurements that should be made during future data taking periods of the LHC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M004058/1","grantId":"ST/M004058/1","fundValue":"237149","fundStart":"2015-08-24","fundEnd":"2018-08-23","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Greig  Cowan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
