We would like to understand the mechanisms by which viruses cause diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis chicken pox as well as damaging the unborn fetus. We will do this by studying viruses isolated from patients and by looking at how the patients respond to viral infection. We hope that this will allow us to develop better vaccines or therapies to combat viral disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900950","grantId":"G0900950","fundValue":"2778090","fundStart":"2010-01-24","fundEnd":"2015-10-23","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mary  Collins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
