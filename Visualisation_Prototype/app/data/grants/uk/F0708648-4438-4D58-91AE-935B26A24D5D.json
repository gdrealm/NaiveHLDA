The core membership (Professors Brown, Furber and Woods) will oversee the operation of the network, whose 'day-to-day' activities will be organised by the four 'theme champions' identified in the case for support. Significant effort has already been invested in the development of the philosophy of the network: see 'chronology' in the case for support. While the aim of the network is to be as all-inclusive as possible, we assume that there will be some turnover of members; we also assume that the investigators and theme chairs will remain constant throughout the lifetime of the network. The initial college (see annex A) provides a significant proportion of the UK microelectronic design effort - we are certainly starting from a basis of critical mass.The network will operate alongside the Devices Network (see figure 2 in the Case for Support), and the UKDF'06 meeting will provide a suitable event (with an established attendance) at which to report interim progress. The four sub-groups will come together at the closing stages of the grant, to prepare the strategic deliverable.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D054028/1","grantId":"EP/D054028/1","fundValue":"61989","fundStart":"2006-04-03","fundEnd":"2007-11-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software) ","person":"Andrew David Brown","coPersons":["Stephen  Furber","Roger  Woods"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" The network grant funding this activity was entitled &amp;quot;Developing a Common Vision for UK Research in Microelectronic Design&amp;quot;. Jointly held by the Universities of Southampton, Manchester and Queens Belfast, the PIs organised a series of meetings and community events aimed at bringing together and unifying many of the diverse threads that make up Microlectronic Design in the UK today. The booklet described here was widely circulated (two print runs, 3000 copies all in all) to academia and industry. One of the more tangible outcomes of the process was the EPSRC decision to allot &amp;quot;signposted&amp;quot; resources for the four Grand Challenges described in the booklet; these enjoyed a success hit rate around twice the average for EPSRC grants at the time. It provides a consensus - inasmuch as such a thing is possible - on some of the major research challenges facing the community. It is one of the two foundation activities (the other being a network grant in microelectronics) of the eFutures and eFuturesXD programs (see http://www.efutures.ac.uk) Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
