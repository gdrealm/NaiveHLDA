Moreover, infectious diseases such as Chagas disease and rheumatic heart disease, known causes of HF, are still frequent in this population. Strategies are required to reduce risk and predict the future burden of this disease.\nThe working group focuses on the development and implementation of algorithms for validation and application of medical decision routines using genetic information and electronic medical record systems in order to help the clinical management of heart failure patients. \nThe Brazilian group is already performing data collection and development of an integrated biobank merging demographical, clinical and genetic information. The British group will establish collaborative arrangement in cardiovascular genetics and the development and application of computational tools and quantitative methods and models for the Brazilian heart failure population with expected results leading to biomarker discovery for aetiology, treatment response and integration analysis of genomics, metabolomics and proteomics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M026175/1","grantId":"MR/M026175/1","fundValue":"21315","fundStart":"2015-01-05","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Dudbridge","coPersons":["Juan P  Casas"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
