{"id":"01871809-44E0-4A6B-A9CF-B1E9046B53A4","title":"Crowd- and Community-fuelled Archaeological Research","abstractText":"This project will not only use 'crowd-sourcing' methods to enable academics and other archaeological communities to co-produce innovative open datasets, but it will also pioneer a novel approach to co-designing and crowd-funding follow-up research. Archaeology has long been successful in piquing the interest of professional practitioners, volunteer societies and the wider public. These different archaeological enthusiasts do sometimes collaborate over archaeological fieldwork, interact via museum exhibitions or interact over other engagement activities, but beyond the edge of the excavation trench or the gallery case, they rarely cooperate on developing archaeological knowledge or on designing new research agendas. This project explores this untapped potential in three promising areas: transcription of archaeological archives, low-cost 3D object modelling and 'follow-up' research. We want to deepen existing links between two major London research institutions, the British Museum (BM) and University College London (UCL), and several well-established communities associated with (a) the UK's Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) and (b) some of archaeology's most famous archival and object collections from Flinders Petrie, Kathleen Kenyon and colleagues' early excavations in the eastern Mediterranean. These two strands capitalise on considerable expertise, heritage assets and interest within London itself, but each also offers wider national or international reach, opening up opportunities to explore how best to blend the respective research inputs of pre-existing online communities of interest, and a further 'crowd' of potential contributors worldwide. Together, we will crowd-source the transcription of hard copy archives and pioneer the construction of large numbers of 3D artefact models from ordinary photographs. The existing communities, new contributors and traditional academics brought together by these efforts will collectively also design attractive follow-up projects that might, over the longer term, be financed via individually small but collectively important online donations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L007657/1","grantId":"AH/L007657/1","fundValue":"314201","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our results have been widely used in teaching and discussion at several different institutions (especially for teaching computational or spatial methods in archaeology). They have been cited and discussed on the main forum of the Greek worldwide diaspora communities, in Greek national newspapers and local magazines, and have played a role in arguments to sustain ferry services and tourism initiatives by the Greek state to the island of Antikythera.

It was also one of the first to apply spatial statistical and GIS methods at such a detailed scale. The results documented a history of sharp demographic highs and lows beginning at least 5,000 years ago, and including unusually revealing episodes of human exploitation involving Neolithic hunters, Minoan colonists from Crete during the Bronze Age, a Hellenistic pirate community, a set of Late Roman villages and both Medieval and recent recolonisations. This roller-coaster history is also an excellent model for the experience of and challenges facing small island communities more generally. The data is published in open formats and is therefore available for re-use at the following archive: (http://dx.doi.org/10.5284/1024569). The artefact and settlement data is especially well-placed to allow statistical comparison with other survey datasets in the Mediterranean and worldwide.
