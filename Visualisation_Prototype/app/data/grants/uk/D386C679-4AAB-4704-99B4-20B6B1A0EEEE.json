{"id":"D386C679-4AAB-4704-99B4-20B6B1A0EEEE","title":"The role of N-cadherin in neural stem cells","abstractText":"Like all tissues, the brain grows from a small population of stem cells - cells with the ability to divide indefinitely and generate all the cell types in a given tissue. To do this, stem cells first divide symmetrically, increasing their numbers, and then asymmetrically to generate a daughter cell that goes on to form a brain cell and also a new stem cell. Over the past few years, molecular cues involved in the control of these stem cell divisions have been identified in invertebrate model systems, especially Drosophila and C. elegans. Despite this, the mechanisms controlling symmetric and asymmetric divisions, and the switch between them, remain poorly understood in the vertebrate brain. They are, however, an important cause of neurodevelopmental diseases such as microcephaly that result from an inadequate expansion of the neural stem cell pool. A number of different studies suggest the hypothesis that the molecules that stick cells together - cadherins - found in special structures called adherens junctions (AJ) play a major role. The aim of this project is to test this hypothesis, so identifying novel mechanisms in the development of the mammalian brain and potentially suggesting strategies for the manipulation of neural stem cells so as to promote repair.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L00402X/1","grantId":"BB/L00402X/1","fundValue":"123803","fundStart":"2013-07-15","fundEnd":"2014-10-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Charles  Ffrench-Constant","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
