Polynomial equations in more than one variable lead to algebraic geometry, and when the equations have rational coefficients, one naturally acquires representationsof Galois groups as symmetries of spaces (with any number of dimensions),in which the coordinates of points are not ordinary numbers, but belong tonumber systems derived from modular arithmetic.Complex numbers were introduced in order to be able to solve all quadraticequations, but are also often the natural kind of numbers to use for calculusand geometry. A modular form is a kind of very symmetric function of complexvariables. Galois representations give rise to L-functions, a different type offunctions of a complex variable. L-functions generalise the Riemann zetafunction, famous for its application to the distribution of prime numbers, andfor the unsolved Riemann hypothesis.There are deep connections, mostly conjectural, between modular forms,Galois representations and values of L-functions. Such theoretical phenomenacan sometimes have down-to-earth arithmetical consequences, for examplethe proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I propose to study some congruences between modular forms which, through the associated Galois representations, have implications for values of L-functions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G026378/1","grantId":"EP/G026378/1","fundValue":"7055","fundStart":"2009-01-12","fundEnd":"2009-04-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Dummigan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
