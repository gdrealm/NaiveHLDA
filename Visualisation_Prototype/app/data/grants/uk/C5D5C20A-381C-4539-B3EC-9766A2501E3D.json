Good predictions of ocean wave period are extremely important for the design of sea-going and offshore structures and to ensure the safety of operations at sea (e.g. shipping, fisheries, cable laying, offshore oil exploration). Retrieving wave period information from satellite altimeters is a pioneering technique developed a few years ago by the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton for the Topex altimeter. Here, we join forces with the French operational weather forecasting agency, Meteo-France, to determine whether this information can help improve ocean weather forecasting. Meteo-France is currenlty the world-leader in combining wind and wave information from satellites with numerical models to improve operational forecasts. In order to reach this goal, new wave period algorithms for Jason 1 and ENVISAT RA2 altimeters will be developed. The project will also assess the validity of the altimeter and model wave period results in different environmental conditions based on new triple collocations between altimeters, model output and moored buoys, using buoys and altimeter data not already used for the development of the empirical algorithms or for assimilation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D007356/1","grantId":"NE/D007356/1","fundValue":"44696","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Meric  Srokosz","coPersons":[],"organisation":"National Oceanography Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
