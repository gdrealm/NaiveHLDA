It developed through the grounded presence of researchers, strong relations built with oral history participants, and the use of multiple media, including photography, film, theatre and writing. \n\n\n\nThe project was designed in a response to a call for proposals issued by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council – led Research Councils Connected Communities Programme – in collaboration with the Royal Society of Arts’ Citizen Power Peterborough programme. The location of the research in the city of Peterborough, England, was thus determined by the call.\n\n\n\nCritical of hegemonic discourses regarding immigration, citizenship and belonging that often construct international migrants and religious minorities as outsiders, the project raises questions about the appropriation of space in the name of the local and apparently ‘indigenous’. Peterborough as a place is constantly in flux, and is made up of streets and neighbourhoods with their own shifting identities. The most major change in living memory was the arrival of Londoners and others from outside the city in the 1970s as the city’s New Towns were constructed. They, like the many thousands of residents who were born abroad, maintain various kinds of connections with places elsewhere, some more intensely than others. It is the realisation that having trans-spatial connections is in itself something that both international migrants have in common both with internal migrants and people who have never lived away from the city that lies at the heart of the project's findings.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, while home to significant engineering, publishing and financial services sectors Peterborough retains its rural connections, particularly to the agriculture and food production economy of the Fens region. It is not only a mainly working-class city, but also a rural one and a regional hub for food-sector workers. Cognizant of the historic importance of agency-working and the agrarian and food economies in the livelihoods of people in the city, the project thus links integration – including debates over housing and the use of public space – with capitalist employment relations that require workers who can be available at short notice and for undefined periods of work: often international migrants.\n\n\n\nPlaces for All? is about transformation as well as investigation. Through working with grass roots community organisations such as the Peterborough Racial Equality Council, the Green Backyard, The Gladstone Park Recreation and Community Centre, Cromwell Road Mosque, St Paul’s Church and Peterborough United Football Club, it brings into encounter the stories of people with a range of ethno-national backgrounds, including white English people. An important part of the project’s story is the enabling of new relations, of mutual regard and respect. In collaboration with local worker-artists, it challenged the unspoken assumption of some regional and national stakeholders that art was something that needed to be ‘done to’ the city, instead drawing attention to creative contributions being made by Peterborough residents themselves, including working-class people of all backgrounds. The films, photographs, stories and research papers found on the Places for All? website are suggestive of the potential for shared authority and co-production in multi-media oral history research. For example, films made with people who are or have recently ceased being street homeless, and with young people in sheltered housing, suggest ways of understanding cities that value multiple perspectives, including from residents for whom home is the road, or a hostel. The examples of holding a photographic/ life story exhibition at a car boot sale, or of rehearsing a play (based on oral history testimony) in a mosque and then performing it at the local football ground, a community growing project, a church and a mainly south Asian heritage community centre, can be used to push back against received wisdom that working-class people do not engage with the arts or are inevitably divided along ethno-national lines. This in turn be a resource for building greater mutual respect alongside a critical awareness of the kinds of employment relations and housing market dynamics that exacerbate exclusion and inequality.
