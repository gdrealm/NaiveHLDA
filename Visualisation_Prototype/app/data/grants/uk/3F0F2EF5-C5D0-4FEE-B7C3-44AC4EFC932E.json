In particular a large proportion of medicines contain this structural element. We propose to investigate the use of a straight chain molecule containing two nitrogen atoms, which upon cyclisation onto itself will give two different sorts of ring compounds, each containing a different one of the two nitrogen atoms. We aim to find conditions which control this cyclisation so we can make either cyclic form at will. We have already invented an efficient way of preparing the straight chain molecules containing two nitrogen atoms and we want to use these unique structures to make a large variety of unique ring compounds. These novel ring compounds can be made even more diverse by starting with more complex starting materials which we use to make the straight chain compounds from. In particular we want to investigate the addition of carbon containing groups to the reaction that prepares the straight chain molecules. The preparation of a large selection, an array, of ring compounds will be developed in industry by techniques that are efficient in time and resources, to give promising drug candidates for medicine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F068344/2","grantId":"EP/F068344/2","fundValue":"317719","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  They have been used by us to develop the reaction further.
