The project is not gender specific, but the examples chosen, eg across the life sciences/engineering interface, will appeal to females.The film titles are (1) The Paddleworm Robot: Adventures in Biomimetics, (2) Butterfly light: Adventures in Photonics and telecommunications, (3) The Chaos Treasure Hunt: Adventures in Chaos Theory and Folded rocks, (4) A Girl's New Legs: Adventures in Tissue Replacement (5) Help for Diabetes: Adventures in Biochemistry (6) Unlimited Scope: The Adventure Continues.The films focus on the work of professors and their students drawn from the fields of mechanical engineering, biochemistry, chemical engineering, mathematics and physics. They include interaction with surgeons and school children. The examples portray some of the challenges facing science and engineering and the contributions that research in these areas will make to society. Films (4), (5) and (6) all feature women as principal participants.A professional and highly-talented production team has been identified. Preliminary filming has been undertaken and a pilot film produced. Funding is required to translate this resource into high quality films for distribution to schools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D50726X/1","grantId":"EP/D50726X/1","fundValue":"176479","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Cliff  Burrows","coPersons":["Mark Jeremy  Brosnan","Giles  Hunt","Adrian  Bowyer"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
