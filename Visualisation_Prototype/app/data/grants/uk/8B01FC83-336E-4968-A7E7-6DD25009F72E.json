In particular, the project tries to answer the following questions:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Which risk factors enter into the pricing kernels?<br />These risk factors are not only associated with past option returns but, more importantly, can predict future option returns. Natural candidates include the real interest rate and the volatility of the market;<br /><br /></li> \n <li>How much risk premium is required by each risk factor?<br />The risk premium compensates the holder of the option for undertaking the risks; and <br /><br /></li> \n <li>What functional form do the pricing kernels take?<br />Over ten years of market prices for bond options traded in London are to be used to calculate option returns, which will be the inputs in the generalised method of moment (GMM).</li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1951","grantId":"RES-000-22-1951","fundValue":"46160","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Xiaoquan  Liu","coPersons":["Jerry  Coakley"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
