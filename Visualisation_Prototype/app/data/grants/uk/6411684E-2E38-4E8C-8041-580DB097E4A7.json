They have provided data that have been extensively used to improve understanding of patterns of sexual behaviour in Britain and helped to guide policy to improve sexual health education and health services. A third Natsal study is planned for 2010 to provide up to date measures of sexual attitudes and lifestyles and also extend its scope. Once again, participants will be randomly selected from across Britain and invited to take part. This will ensure that the survey represents views and lifestyles from all regions and from all walks of life. We aim to interview 15,000 men and women aged 16-74. Laptop computers will be used to allow participants to record personal information in privacy. New elements will be introduced to the survey: the upper age limit will be higher than in previous Natsal surveys at 74 years; the sample of younger adults will be increased so that we have a better understanding of those most likely to engage in risk-behaviours. A random sample of participants aged 16-44 will be asked to provide a urine sample to be tested anonymously for sexually transmitted infections to understand the prevalence of infection in the population. Some participants of all ages will be asked to provide a saliva sample to measure hormone levels. A small number of participants will be asked to undertake more detailed qualitative interviews to understand some aspects of high?risk behaviour in greater detail. We will analyse the data to provide comparisons over time in sexual attitudes and lifestyles, and to understand better the relationship between sexual lifestyle and sexual health, and between other aspects of health and quality of sexual relationships. We will use the findings to help to guide policy on services and interventions to improve sexual health in Britain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701757","grantId":"G0701757","fundValue":"5178370","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne Mandall Johnson","coPersons":["Wendy Georgina Macdowall","Frederick  Wu","Kaye  Wellings","Andrew  Copas","Catherine  Mercer","Catherine A Ison","Pam  Sonnenberg"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
