Only two antibiotics can be used to treat C. difficile and resistance has developed towards them both. However, bacteria have viral enemies, or bacteriophages which specifically target them. All bacteria have bacteriophages and they have been engaged in an arms race for as long as they have existed. Bacteriophages represent a natural, specific and extensive resource of novel antimicrobial agents. They could be either used directly as therapeutic agents, or products derived from their genomes (e.g. lysins which degrade bacterial walls) could be harnessed to lyse them (Fischetti, 2004). Bacteriophages are used extensively to control other bacterial pathogens, they are used widely in Eastern Block countries, and in USA last year the FDA recently released approval to use them in hot dogs to control Listeria.\n\nWhilst other bacterial pathogens have well characterised bacteriophages, those which infect C. difficile are very poorly known. This is in part due to the difficulties in working with the appropriately named C. difficile. To understand how bacteriophages could be used to control C. difficile first a comprehensive collection of them has to be isolated and characterised and an appropriate selection of them sequenced to characterise what components of their genomes could be exploited to control C. difficile. \n\nA different set of bacteriophages integrate into the genomes of C. difficile and alter their virulence. Whilst hiding in the bacterial genomes, they can encode a range of toxins which increase their ability to proliferate in the gut and hospital environment. An understanding of the way in which bacteriophage achieve this can be related to hospital practices and may result in strategies to minimise the spread of virulence factors. \n\nI will provide the first comparative study of the bacteriophages that are associated with patients who have C. difficile associated diarrhoea and compare them to those who have C. difficile but not diarrhoea. I will characterise both the lytic phages and those that reside in the C. difficile genomes. I will establish if diarrhoea free patients have a more effective natural bacteriophage population than those who have diarrhoea. Sequence information will allow me to characterise how bacteriophages kill C. difficile. It will also allow tests to be developed that can see how environmental stimuli can trigger toxin release in the ?hidden? bacteriophages.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700855","grantId":"G0700855","fundValue":"334485","fundStart":"2008-03-03","fundEnd":"2011-07-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martha Rebecca Jane Clokie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
