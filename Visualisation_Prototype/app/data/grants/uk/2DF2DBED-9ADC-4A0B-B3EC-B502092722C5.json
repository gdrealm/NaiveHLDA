{"id":"2DF2DBED-9ADC-4A0B-B3EC-B502092722C5","title":"East Asian influence on modern architecture in Europe, 1918-1939","abstractText":"This project will investigate East Asian influence on modern architecture in Europe between the two world wars (1918-39) - the most critical period of the modern movement's formation - on the premise of mutual influence between East and west. Complementing better-know studies on American architecture, it will explore how European architects encountered the East (China, Korea and Japan) and how their discoveries were translated into buildings. It will reveal hidden depths in modern architecture, and show how different cultures met, transforming cultural production beyond a merely architectural arena.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119293/1","grantId":"119293/1","fundValue":"88387","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"P  Blundell Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
