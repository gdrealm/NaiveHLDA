{"id":"E517A6E3-9850-4973-8009-52BC1B5AF155","title":"Descriptive Complexity with Algebraic Operators","abstractText":"The study of computational complexity is concerned with understanding what makes certain computational tasks inherently difficult to solve. In this context, problems that can be solved by means of algorithms that take a number of steps bounded by a polynomial are considered to be feasible, or efficiently solvable. A long standing research concern in the field of descriptive complexity has been to give a complete classification of those problems that are feasible. Such a complete classification would take the form of a formal language (or a logic) in which one could define all the feasible problems, but no others. It has been known for some time that languages based on induction and counting are not sufficient for this purpose and it has recently been discovered that adding certain operators based on linear algebra can extend the power of such languages. Our research aims at building on this breakthrough by understanding the power of these extended languages. To do this we will develop new methods to analyse the expressive power and use this to determine whether or not the newly defined languages do capture the power of feasible computation.We will also investigate whether these languages capture feasible computation in interesting special cases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H026835/1","grantId":"EP/H026835/1","fundValue":"424833","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research is recently completed and the impacts preliminary.

Giving a logical characterisation\nof this class of problems is a long-standing open problem. The\nresearch aimed at understanding why the best attempts at such a\ncharacterization so far, based on logics of induction, counting, and\nalgebraic operators fall short of this goal. The main findings are:\n\n - linear programming problems are expressible in logic with induction\n and counting and, as a consequence, maximum matching problems in\n graphs are also definable. This was an unexpected outcome as the\n contrary had been conjectured.\n\n - a characterisation of the definable problems in terms of\n recognisability by symmetric circuits. This leads to the\n identification of a symmetry barier in descriptive complexity.\n\n - the formulation of techniques (based on algebraic pebble games) for\n analysing the expressive power of logics with induction and\n linear-algebraic operators.\n\n - a polyonimial-time test, more powerful than those previously known,\n for distinguishing graphs that are not isomorphic.
