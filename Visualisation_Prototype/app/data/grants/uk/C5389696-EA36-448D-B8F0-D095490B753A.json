Instead dissident IRAs vow to maintain an armed campaign against Britain’s sovereign claim to Northern Ireland and have killed British soldiers, police officers and civilians in recent years. These groups have small political organisations with which they are associated.</p>\n\n<p>The assumption across the political spectrum is that, whereas Sinn Fein enjoyed significant electoral backing when linked to the now vanished Provisional IRA, contemporary violent republican ultras and their political associates are utterly bereft of sympathy.</p>\n\n<p>This project assesses the strategies, tactics and membership of dissident republican organisations. It assesses whether there are any demographic, structural, ideological, religious or party trends indicating republican dissident sympathies.The project draws upon interviews with a minimum of 90 members of dissident republican organisations.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00039X/1","grantId":"ES/K00039X/1","fundValue":"269969","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The project does not finish until 31/12/14 so impacts cannot yet be determined Government, Democracy and Justice Societal","person":"Jonathan  Tonge","coPersons":["James White  McAuley","Thomas William Hennessey","Kevin  Bean"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" The project has involved interviews with 90+ dissident republicans from different organisations or independents.
