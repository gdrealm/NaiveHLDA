{"id":"5034DA66-087C-4569-9E14-B80A89071356","title":"Workshop on Hybrid and Predictive Control for Nonlinear Industrial Applications","abstractText":"The aim of this proposal is to expand a sequence of nonlinear control workshops that were held at Strathclyde into a more international event and one which provides an opportunity for research students to both learn and contribute. It is envisaged that very new developments in nonlinear predictive control, control of hybrid systems and distributed control systems will be covered. Problems in the implementation of advanced control and signal processing methods will be considered and their use in embedded systems for applications such as wind turbine control and for networked systems control will be discussed. The level of the presentations will be suitable for research students and there will be demonstrations of hardware and software tools for both real time control and for control systems design.This is the fourth workshop on the subject of Nonlinear Control for Real Applications. During 2004, 2006 and 2007, the Centre hosted workshops on nonlinear control, which attracted between 39-58 delegates each time. With the increased international reputation of the workshop, the proposal for 2009 is to attract more international speakers and delegates, which will enable a better perspective to be obtained in the world wide advances in nonlinear systems both in theory and applications. It will also introduce new and challenging topics in nonlinear control and applications. The education value of the event has been proved through the tutorial nature of the previous events, which will be kept this time and extended to emerging techniques. The research students will also have an opportunity to present their work at the workshop.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G027323/1","grantId":"EP/G027323/1","fundValue":"10912","fundStart":"2008-12-15","fundEnd":"2009-06-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Hong  Yue","coPersons":["Michael John Grimble"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
