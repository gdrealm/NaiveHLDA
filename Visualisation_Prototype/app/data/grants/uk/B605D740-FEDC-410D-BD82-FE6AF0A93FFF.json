These cells have proteins on their surfaces, which allow them to detect cells that are infected or cancerous. This programme of research will examine these proteins in detail. We will find out how they differ between different people as this may help to understand why some people are susceptible to certain diseases. We also determine what the proteins are interacting with, in other words, their target molecules. This will help to understand how an infected or cancerous cell is recognised by the immune system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901682","grantId":"G0901682","fundValue":"1495130","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Trowsdale","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
