Surprisingly, given Bryars's high international standing, this will constitute the first monograph on his work. The aim of the research will be to achieve new knowledge and understanding not only of Bryars's own work, but also of the growth and development of British experimental music since the mid-1960s and of his role within it.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E510817/1","grantId":"AH/E510817/1","fundValue":"8817","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2007-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Bob  Gilmore","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Falmouth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
