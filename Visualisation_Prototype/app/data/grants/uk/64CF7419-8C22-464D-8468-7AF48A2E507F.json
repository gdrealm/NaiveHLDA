The fast speed of changes and the complexity of development in major Chinese cities pose a great challenge to urban researchers in China. This proposed International Centre Partnership will bring together researchers from three leading urban research organisations: the Urban Big Data Centre at University of Glasgow, the Applied Quantitative Methods Network at University of Sheffield, and the Institute of Urban and Environmental Studies at CASS. It will conduct collaborative and comparative research on three important and interrelated urban development issues of migration, segregation and inequality, and will make significant contributions in research findings, new methods, theoretical development and policy impact.\n\nThis partnership will fulfil the core aim of the Newton Fund, trough the development of close scientific and innovative research collaboration and promoting the economic development and welfare of Chinese people, especially the 250 million migrant workers living in cities and towns. \n\nIn order to achieve the above aim and project objectives, our partnership activities will include research training through workshops, summer school and international symposium with people mobility in both directions in every year; a series of collaborative and innovative pilot research projects; and several important knowledge exchange and impact events and activities to influence future research agenda and government policy development.\n\nThe partnership include a total of 27, from University of Glasgow, University of Sheffield, and Institute of Urban and Environmental Studies of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. It will involve a large number of other researchers, early careers and PhD students from these institutions and beyond, and government officials, policy makers, and civil society representatives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N007603/1","grantId":"ES/N007603/1","fundValue":"130968","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2018-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ya Ping  Wang","coPersons":["Gwilym Benjamin Pryce","Yu  Chen","Piyushimita (Vonu)  Thakuriah"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
