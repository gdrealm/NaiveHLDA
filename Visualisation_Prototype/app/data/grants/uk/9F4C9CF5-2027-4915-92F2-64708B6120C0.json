{"id":"9F4C9CF5-2027-4915-92F2-64708B6120C0","title":"SAKS: Skills and Knowledge Builder for Sustainable Communities","abstractText":"<p>The research focuses on the generic skills and knowledge which people and organisations need in order to help build sustainable communities. The Egan Review: Skills for Sustainable Communities (ODPM, 2004) identified significant gaps and shortages in some generic skills, such as leadership, communication, project management, and partnership working, and knowledge amongst built environment professionals and decision makers in local government, who play a key role in creating sustainable communities.</p>\n\n<p>The research responds to these issues by investigating and developing a set of online skills assessment and learning materials to help people working in built environment and community-related professions in local government improve their generic skills and knowledge, and enable them to work together effectively to build better places. It will explore the extent and nature of the generic skills and knowledge gaps amongst this target group today, how they interact to share knowledge and skills across professions, what learning resources and materials they would find most useful, and how they can track their progress in an online learning environment. It will also consider ways in which these resources might be extended to a wider group of organisations, communities and individuals.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E023800/1","grantId":"ES/E023800/1","fundValue":"76272","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ann Elizabeth Hockey","coPersons":["Ian  Frame"],"organisation":"Anglia Ruskin University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
