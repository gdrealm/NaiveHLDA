{"id":"E1B8D62D-16B9-4A94-AC80-A8AEF495C83A","title":"Monetary Donations following Humanitarian Disasters","abstractText":"<p>Individuals are often asked to donate money to different disaster relief causes. The aim of this research is to assess psychological factors which lead to people donating money generously to victims of some disasters (eg Tsunami) but not others (eg Dafur). It is envisaged that the work will make a significant theoretical contribution, but that it will also have applied value: the insights generated might help charities to target their relief appeals more effectively.</p>\n\n<p>It is hypothesised that ‘willingness to donate’ is influenced by factors such as whether the disaster is natural or man-made; whether victims are blamed for their situation or not; whether they are perceived to make an effort to help themselves; and how ‘resilient’ to pain victims are perceived to be. Whether victims are perceived to be ingroup or outgroup members and perceived ‘one-ness’ with the victims are also proposed to play a role.</p>\n\n<p>Three experiments will be conducted to assess these issues in a systematic, controlled fashion. Participants will be presented with different disaster scenarios which will vary along the dimensions of the independent variables listed above. The effect of variations in the independent variables on the main dependent variable ‘willingness to donate’ will be observed.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E001920/1","grantId":"ES/E001920/1","fundValue":"78242","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Hanna  Zagefka","coPersons":["Rupert  Brown"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
