{"id":"A1BC4307-84EB-4940-A157-58DFAB88B0D2","title":"Masculine identities in flux: cultural representations of fatherhood in France and the UK","abstractText":"The research examines discussions and images of fatherhood in 'new' men's lifestyle magazines and in women's magazines in France and the UK. It relates cultural representations of fatherhood to an emerging public space defined largely by public discourse and by social movements (notably fathers' rights groups). Institutions and cultural values help to explain differences between the two countries. The research feeds into and completes an existing comparative Franco-British project on fathers negotiating a better balance between work and family.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112904/1","grantId":"112904/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Milner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
