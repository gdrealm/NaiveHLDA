The body controls angiogenesis by maintaining a precise balance of growth and inhibitory factors in healthy tissues. When this balance is disturbed, a wide range of diseases can arise including cancer, psoriasis, age-related blindness, diabetic ulcers, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and many others. The list of diseases that have angiogenesis as an underlying mechanism grows longer every year. It is therefore important that the factors that control the angiogenic process are well understood. When angiogenic growth factors are produced in excess of angiogenesis inhibitors, the balance is tipped in favour of blood vessel growth. When inhibitors are present in excess of stimulators, angiogenesis is stopped. The normal, healthy body maintains a perfect balance of angiogenesis modulators. We have identified a novel protein, called FKBPL, that occurs naturally in the body, and has potent anti-angiogenic activity. We know this because when we add FKBPL to growing tumours it prevents their growth by stopping angiogenesis within the tumour, starving it of oxygen and nutrients. We now need to understand the precise actions of this protein in the body during blood vessel development, allowing us to understand its role in the diseases outlined above. We will therefore study the normal role of FKBPL during blood vessel development in two angiogenesis models. We will do this using a molecular technique to prevent expression of this protein and then assess the effects on blood vessel development. This will tell us how critical FKBPL is in controlling this process. We also aim to study how FKBPL is switched on and off to control blood vessel development. This is also important since if the protein is not properly regulated it will cause an imbalance in angiogenesis which may lead to disease. We also aim to understand what happens within the endothelial cells, the cells that form the inner lining of all blood vessels. We know that too much of the protein stops the cells from moving so that they cannot form new blood vessels, but we need to know how the cells signal to regulate this process. Increasing and decreasing the levels of FKBPL in endothelial cells and looking at the signalling events that take place will be important. In summary, we believe that a more detailed investigation of the role of the FKBPL protein in the normal processes involved in angiogenesis will help our understanding of a wide range of diseases that are associated with disrupted or imbalanced angiogenesis. This could have a profound effect on how we develop new treatments for a wide range of common diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I006958/1","grantId":"BB/I006958/1","fundValue":"456720","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  A peptide based therapeutic, modelled on the anti-angiogenic domain about to enter phase I/II cancer clinical trial.

This is important as effects of some angiogenic proteins are dosage dependent. Here we evaluated the regulation of FKBPL secretion under angiogenic stimuli as well as the effect of FKBPL ablation in angiogenesis using mice and zebrafish models.\nApproach and Results: FKBPL was secreted maximally by human microvascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts and this was specifically downregulated by pro-angiogenic hypoxic signals, but not by the angiogenic cytokines, VEGF or IL8. FKBPLâ€™s critical role in angiogenesis was supported by our inability to generate a Fkbpl knockout mouse, with embryonic lethality occurring prior to E8.5. However, whilst Fkbpl heterozygotic embryos showed some vasculature irregularities, the mice developed normally. In murine angiogenesis models including the ex vivo aortic ring assay, in vivo sponge assay, and tumour growth assay, Fkbpl+/- mice exhibited increased sprouting, enhanced vessel recruitment and faster tumour growth, respectively, supporting the anti-angiogenic function of FKBPL. In zebrafish, zFkbpl expression correlated with endothelial marker zFli1; its knockdown using morpholinos disrupted the vasculature and the phenotype was rescued with hFKBPL. Interestingly, this vessel disruption was ineffective when zcd44 was knocked-down supporting the dependency of zFkbpl on zCd44 in zebrafish.\nIn addition, we established that FKBPL+/- mice are obese, reinforcing the role of FKBPL and angiogenesis in this condition\nConclusions: FKBPL is an important regulator of angiogenesis, having an essential role in murine and zebrafish blood vessel development. Mouse models of angiogenesis, demonstrated a pro-angiogenic phenotype in Fkbpl heterozygotes. FKBPL may be associated with a host of cnditions linked to aberrant angiogenesis - obesity and cancer were examined here. We established that FKBPL has a clear role in development angiogenesis with important implications for a host of conditions associated with pathological angiogenesis. We demonstrated a key obesity phenotype in FKBPL deficient mice- linked with excessive angiogenesis, this has implications for a host of obesity-related diseases associated with this protein. We have developed a therapeutic peptide ALM201 which can reverse this obesity phenotype in our FKBPL deficient and indeed wild-type mice, suggesting that ALM201 may have other therapeutic applications in addition to being an anti-tumour drug.
