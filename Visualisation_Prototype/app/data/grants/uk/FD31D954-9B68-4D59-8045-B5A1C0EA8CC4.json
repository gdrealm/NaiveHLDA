{"id":"FD31D954-9B68-4D59-8045-B5A1C0EA8CC4","title":"Industrialisation of precision cavity beam position monitors","abstractText":"The project is a response to the increasing demand for precision position diagnostics from modern accelerator facilities both inside and outside the high energy physics, e.g. free electron lasers and lepton colliders. An essential goal of this project is to equip the UK manufacturing industry with the knowledge and technologies required for series production of beam position systems. This would result in an improved competitiveness of the hi-tech UK products and position the UK industry to be well prepared bidders providing instrumentation for potential future national, European and international small and large scale projects. The use of technology will also benefit other disciplines such as biological and medical sciences, chemistry and security through improved technologies and higher quality beams.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L00013X/1","grantId":"ST/L00013X/1","fundValue":"262156","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  In case of success, our designs will be used commercially and become a standard diagnostic in future electron linear accelerators and free electron lasers.

These devices require tight machining tolerances and complicated manufacturing processes. Our aim is to develop simple and robust designs that can later be commercialised and used in future linear accelerators and free electron lasers. Our designs may become commercial products used in facilities worldwide. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
