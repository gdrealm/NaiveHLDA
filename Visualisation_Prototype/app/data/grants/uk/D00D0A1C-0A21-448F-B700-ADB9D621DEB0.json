{"id":"D00D0A1C-0A21-448F-B700-ADB9D621DEB0","title":"Glastonbury Abbey: Archaeology, Legend and Public Engagement","abstractText":"This project follows-on from 'The Glastonbury Abbey Archaeological Archive Project' (University of Reading/ Glastonbury Abbey, 2009-13). AHRC funding enabled the full analysis of previously unpublished excavations at this site of international historical importance. Glastonbury Abbey was renowned in the middle ages as the reputed burial place of the legendary King Arthur and the site of the earliest Christian church in Britain, believed to have been founded by Joseph of Arimathea in the first century. It became a major pilgrimage centre and was the second richest monastery in England at the Dissolution. Today, Glastonbury Abbey is a heritage centre and museum that draws a large range of visitors including tourists, educational groups and spiritual seekers of diverse beliefs.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1979, 36 seasons of excavations took place at the Abbey but the results were never published. Critical study of the archive of antiquarian excavations and the archaeological collections has unlocked new evidence for the scale and significance of the Anglo-Saxon monastery and the medieval Abbey. The outputs of the original research project are aimed at the academic audience, including a monograph in press with the Society of Antiquaries and an online database archived with the Archaeology Data Service. The Follow-on project will make the results of the research available to new audiences, including visitors to Glastonbury Abbey (numbering approximately 100,000 per annum), the local community of Glastonbury and the wider public. \n\nPartnership between the University of Reading and the Trustees of Glastonbury Abbey will enable the charity to improve the quality of site interpretation and education offered to visitors. Interpretation of the ruins and museum collections will be informed by new academic research and presented in more creative and accessible formats including digital reconstructions. The approach is particularly novel in using archaeological evidence to explore the local legends of King Arthur and Joseph of Arimathea. These stories have been connected with Glastonbury for nearly a thousand years: they have both popular appeal and spiritual value to groups including the Church of England, the Catholic Church and the New Age 'Community of Avalon'.\n\nVisitor experience will be enriched by the development of digital reconstructions and an interactive map that will enhance understanding of spatial layout, chronological development and archaeological evidence. The reconstructions will present challenging evidence in an accessible way that will appeal particularly to younger visitors, through iPad tours delivered by a Living History team, and family packs and trails. For the first time, an official guidebook will present a summary of the most recent research on Glastonbury, available in 5 languages to meet the needs of international visitors. There will be greater variety of visitor experience and new opportunities to engage with evidence at different levels of detail in a layered approach to interpretation. A launch event will inform the local community; social media and a popular magazine article will inform the remote public of new research findings. \n\nThe educational value of school visits will be enhanced by improving the quality of learning resources and introducing a critical perspective to evidence. Teachers will benefit from the development of accessible resources and lesson plans for the study of Glastonbury Abbey that map directly on to the new curricula for Key Stages 1-3.\n\nThe project will deliver sustainable resources that will continue to enrich the experience of visitors to Glastonbury Abbey beyond the life of the project. Knowledge Transfer workshops will enhance the effectiveness of the resources and the quality of their implementation. Workshops with educational and spiritual stakeholders will inform future development at Glastonbury Abbey, including a planned HLF bid for a new museum and learning centre.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N002865/1","grantId":"AH/N002865/1","fundValue":"79409","fundStart":"2015-10-02","fundEnd":"2016-10-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Roberta  Gilchrist","coPersons":["Rhianedd  Smith"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
