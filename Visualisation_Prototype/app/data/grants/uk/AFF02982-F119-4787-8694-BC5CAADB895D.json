{"id":"AFF02982-F119-4787-8694-BC5CAADB895D","title":"New directions for UK autism research","abstractText":"Scientists believe they are making great strides towards understanding autism. This is partly because there has been a dramatic expansion of autism research in the past decade in the UK and abroad (Dawson, 2013). The most comprehensive review of UK autism research ever undertaken recently found that almost &pound;21 million was invested in autism research between 2007 and 2011 by UK government and non-government organisations, spread across 106 different projects (Pellicano et al., 2013). The Economic and Social Research Council made more funding awards than any other organization, while the Medical Research Council awarded more money for autism research than any other funder. \n\nThese developments are to be hugely welcomed. With 1 in every 100 UK people on the autism spectrum, it is vital that we develop our understanding of autism. Greater knowledge of the nature of the condition and its potential impact is clearly of significant social import. The same comprehensive review has also shown, however, that autistics, parents, clinicians and service providers are concerned that the research profile in the UK has largely prioritised basic science, especially biological science, potentially at the expense of other fundamental, but more applied areas, of research, including public services for autistic people, evidence-based treatments for autism and its related symptoms and the social and ethical challenges posed by some of the more recent scientific advances.\n\nThis proposed seminar series will bring together some of the world's most celebrated autism scientists with leading experts and practitioners drawn from these other fields in an effort to develop a new research agenda in each area of concern. They will seek to build new networks of inter-disciplinary researchers capable of pursuing this new agenda in the decades to come. \n\nThe seminars will be participatory in nature and begin by posing key provocations or questions that should both stimulate immediate discussion and asist scholars in developing more detailed research questions for the future, in collaboration with community members. \n\nThe seminars on public services would begin with questions including: What are the socioeconomic, ethnic and gender disparities in access to services? How can we improve post-diagnostic support for parents of children with autism and autistic adults? What are the best ways to get autistic adults into work and keep them there? \n\nThe seminars on evidence-based treatments, interventions and educations would begin with: What do we mean by 'evidence' when referring to autism interventions? How do we measure the effectiveness of education programmes in schools who follow 'eclectic' programmes? What 'outcome measures' should we use in interventions and who gets to make these decisions?\n\nThe seminars on autism and society would begin with: Should we be aiming for &quot;inclusion&quot; of autistic people in society and, if so, how do we achieve it? What place should the autism community have in shaping the research agenda? How do we know if, when and how we should intervene with autistic children, young people and adults? How should we best promote awareness (and acceptance) of autism?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M00225X/1","grantId":"ES/M00225X/1","fundValue":"30231","fundStart":"2014-11-03","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth  Pellicano","coPersons":["Sue  Fletcher-Watson","Susan  Leekam","Damian Elgin Milton","Anthony Richard Charman","Jeremy  Parr","Peter  Beresford"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
