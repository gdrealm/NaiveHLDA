{"id":"66F29EC3-3C41-422D-BC74-C5383AB6FD1D","title":"Development of an objective method for diagnosing dead regions in the cochlea","abstractText":"Hearing loss is often associated with a loss of inner or outer hair cells in the cochlea. A person who has lost inner hair cells in a certain part of the cochlea cannot convert certain sound waves into electrical signals and perceive them in the brain. This person is thus hearing-impaired for sounds of that particular pitch. Parts of the cochlea with damaged inner hair cells are called dead regions and are usually associated with severe hearing loss. Currently, there are two methods for diagnosing dead regions. Both methods require a patient to listen to various sounds and to indicate whether they can hear them. \nProviding a hearing-impaired child at a young age with an appropriately fitted hearing aid or with an appropriate cochlear implant is crucial for the language and overall development of a child. However, with the current methods, which require responses from the patient, it is not possible to accurately diagnose infants with dead regions and therefore it is not possible to provide young children with optimal rehabilitation.\nThis study aims to develop an objective method for diagnosing dead regions. An objective method for diagnosis implies that the patient does not need to actively indicate whether (s)he hears a difference between sounds. Such an objective method for diagnosis is essential for testing infants. An electrophysiological method called the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) could provide the basis for such an objective test. The ASSR measures brain activity that shows accurately whether a patient can perceive a particular sound. This brain activity can be measured using three electrodes positioned on the head of a patient. The brain activity is specific to the pitch of a sounds and it thus reflects the sounds perceived by the brain. It is hypothesised in this study that ASSR can also be used to diagnose a cochlear dead region using similar theoretical principles to the current behavioural methods.\nThe proposed study will involve testing normally hearing and hearing-impaired adults with and without dead regions. The objective method will be optimised and validated against results of the behavioural methods. \nThe outcome of this project will be objective methods for screening and diagnosing the extent of severe hearing loss caused by dead regions, which can be further validated and adopted for use in infants and young children.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802190","grantId":"G0802190","fundValue":"222328","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Karolina  Kluk-De Kort","coPersons":["Colette  McKay"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
