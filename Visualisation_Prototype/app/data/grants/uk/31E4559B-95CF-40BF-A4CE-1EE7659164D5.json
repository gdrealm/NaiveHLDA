{"id":"31E4559B-95CF-40BF-A4CE-1EE7659164D5","title":"Neurocognitive predictors of adolescent depression: a high risk longitudinal study","abstractText":"Depression is a common, debilitating condition that is one of the leading causes of medical disability in the world. Most people have their first episode of depression during adolescence. There have been concerns about the safety and effectiveness of antidepressants in young people and therefore treatment for adolescent depression focuses on psychological therapies. Once experienced, depression is very likely to recur especially if onset is early. Depression in the teenage years can ?set the scene? for a lifetime: these young people are less able to fulfill their academic and training potential and a significant proportion will continue to have mental health problems in adult life. Once experienced, depression has a chronic and relapsing course with many affected individuals spending a significant proportion of their lives with depressive symptoms. Early recognition and prevention of depression in young people is therefore a priority for a healthy society. If we can prevent first episodes of depression in adolescence (rather than treating episodes when they occur) this could reduce medical and economic burden and individual suffering across a lifetime. A better understanding of the psychological processes involved in the onset of depression can help develop therapeutic strategies to prevent depression. Adolescents who have a parent with clinical depression are at especially high risk of developing depression. This group therefore deserves special consideration for early intervention and prevention initiatives and they are the focus of this proposal. This study will involve tracking a large group of adolescents at high risk of depression over a three year period to understand how depression develops in this group. It will focus on psychological factors that predict the onset of depression. The results of this study will help to develop psychological interventions to protect young people against developing depression and improve recognition of those at the greatest risk of adolescent depression. It is hoped that the results of this study will help health resources to be targeted at individuals most in need and contribute to improved health outcomes for these young people.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802200","grantId":"G0802200","fundValue":"392053","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frances  Rice","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
