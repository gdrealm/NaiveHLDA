While the initial impact in Yorkshire, Humberside and Worcestershire was documented by the media, the extended process of physical, social and personal recovery from the flood experience will be lost from the headlines as local people, key agencies and government departments seek to re-establish the social and physical fabric of affected local communities.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of Flood, vulnerability and urban resilience is to undertake a real-time longitudinal study using an action research model to document and understand the everyday experiences of individuals following the floods of June 2007 in interaction with networks of other actors and organisations, strategies of institutional support and investment in the built environment and critical infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>The project design adopts a tried and tested action research methodology previously used to investigate recovery following the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease disaster. The research involves a longitudinal qualitative diary-based method developed to capture peoples' everyday experiences as they move through what is likely to be a drawn out process of recovery.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F032412/1","grantId":"ES/F032412/1","fundValue":"150337","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"William Peter Medd","coPersons":["Gordon P Walker","Nigel  Watson","Maggie  Mort"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
