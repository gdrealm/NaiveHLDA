Citizen activities matter because engagement assists public policy outcomes, such as safer communities and more efficient public services. However, little is known about the link between interventions designed to stimulate participation, the level and depth of civic engagement and policy outcomes. This grant aims to develop greater knowledge and understanding about such links and the type of interventions that policy-makers can undertake to sustain the activities of citizens as users and co-producers of services. The project uses innovative experimental methods, including randomized control trials and design experiments, as well as more traditional survey re-analysis, to understand the civic-outcome link.</p>\n\n<p>The first task is a re-analysis of Citizenship Surveys along with aggregate data to probe the civic-outcome link. The second is a deliberative intervention that investigates the impact of deliberation on a randomly selected panel of internet users. The third is two randomized control trials designed to reduce car use and improve the environment. The fourth is two design experiments on implementing innovative measures to encourage citizen involvement in political decision making.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Further information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Project contact: Professor Peter John, University of Manchester</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:peter.john@manchester.ac.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">peter.john@manchester.ac.uk</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>ESRC contact: Chris Wyatt</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:chris.wyatt@esrc.ac.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">chris.wyatt@esrc.ac.uk</a></li>\n\n <li>Telephone: 01793 413054</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Project website: <a href=\"http://www.civicbehaviour.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.civicbehaviour.org.uk</a></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E019781/1","grantId":"ES/E019781/1","fundValue":"665085","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  John","coPersons":["Edward  Fieldhouse","Elizabeth  Richardson","Gerry  Stoker","Graham  Smith"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" The project shows that an external agency can stimulate citizens to increase their contributions to public goods, producing more recycling, petitioning, charitable giving, donating, deliberating and volunteering as a result. We counter recent work in political science that claims that citizens are becoming more disengaged from public. Instead, we offer empirical support for those who say there is considerable potential in citizen involvement in the delivery of public policies (e.g. Hirst, Sirianni, Fung, Smith and Halpern). We show the type of message the citizen receives, such as form of canvassing and feedback, matters as does the particular design of the institutional arrangement, which may allow for debate and for the provision of default options. These findings have contributed to the academic debate about civic participation using powerful research evidence with a clear, distinct message. In particular, we have put together in 'nudge' and 'think' two different intellectual traditions of study, which are not often taken together. The project has extended the use of experiments in public policy and political science in the UK. Prior to our project, these were rarely used, and tended to be confined to social and health policies, but we have applied them to a range of political outcomes and contexts to test different mechanisms for citizen engagement. The application of experiments in UK political science and public policy has become more common as a result of our work. The findings have had an impact on the communities of researchers where the work was presented above, such as colleagues in the PSA who attended the panels and those in the American Political Science Association. Don Green [Columbia] included our experiments figure in his forthcoming book, Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation (the street recycling experiment is one of his worked examples). The work was presented to the Experiments in Government and Politics group in the US, at to the York trials unit and its members. The paper published in Political Quarterly has nine citations, and in particular has influenced the theoretical work on nudge, for example appearing in the work of Joel Anderson (Utrecht), in his review in Economics and Philosophy, 26(3). The experiments on household recycling have made an impact in the specialist research community, such as the paper published in the Journal of Environmental Management, and experts such as Peter Shaw (Southampton) are aware of our work. Our work has become important in social policy, and aspects of the research appeared in the edited volume Local Governance, Changing Citizens Policy Press and Peter John presented to LSE Social Policy on 26 May 2011. Researchers on the project have used their knowledge about field experiments to develop a specialist experiments panel in PSA, and the Manchester Experiments Research Network, so the work and interest in experimental methods diffuse to a wider circle of researchers.
