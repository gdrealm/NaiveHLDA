In doing this dystroglycan has a stabilising role in the cell and helps to prevent damage when cells are under stress. One example is when dystroglycan is lost from muscles cells, such as in several muscular dystrophies, here the muscle cells are more easily damaged and die. Besides this stabilising role, dystroglycan is also able to transduce signals that regulate the shape and stability of all cells. Dystroglycan is therefore of fundamental importance in maintaining connections between cells, in governing cell shape and also in determining cell polarity i.e. knowing top from bottom and front from back. As a consequence of these functions dystroglycan is important for cell viability and is required to form tissues, dystroglycan also acts as a point for some bacteria and viruses to gain entry to the cells. This research will address the way in which dystroglycan is able to send and receive signals, and the interactions that dystroglycan has with other proteins that are important for its function. We hope to apply this basic knowledge of dystroglycan function to understanding diseases including muscular dystrophy and cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701129","grantId":"G0701129","fundValue":"447174","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  Winder","coPersons":["Gaynor  Miller"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
