{"id":"BC546937-8C1A-4FCA-8480-4858CD8FF331","title":"Data Capture of Syria Chemical Weapons Allegations","abstractText":"This project seeks to collect information related to the recent United Nations investigation into allegations of chemical weapons use in the suburbs of Damascus, Syria on August 21st 2013. Confirmed by that investigation team in its interim report on September 16th 2013 the UN investigation team found that the nerve agent Sarin had been used. The UN Secretary-General described this attack as constituting &quot;the most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988&quot;. \nData collected during this project will include government policy documents; media reports; non governmental comment and analysis. Key to the project will be the collection of material from social media platforms. These will span media sharing platforms (e.g. Youtube, Vimeo, Flickr etc.), Networking (e.g Facebook, Linkedin etc.) Blogs (e.g. Wordpress, tumblr) Microblogs (Twitter), Discussion platforms (Reddit) the more innovative sources such as crowdsourcing sites (ushahidi, irevolution, etc.) and live streaming services such as Bambuser. These materials constitute citizen reporting on the events related to the UN report and on the conduct of the investigation itself. The richness of the media means that useful data is collected both intentionally and unintentionally within meta data and background information. To increase the utility of these data a series of initial analysis papers and/or detailed thematic chronologies will be generated as well as a searchable database. \nThe collection of information relating to the United Nations confirmation of nerve agent use in Syria is an important task for a number of reasons including:\n1. The confirmation of use has set in motion a series of unexpected events which have potentially profound consequences, not just for how in the future allegations of chemical weapons use are dealt with, but also for scholars in areas such as international relations, regional studies, toxicology and international law. \n2. International responses to the allegation of use have given unusual weight to data produced by non governmental sources. This includes for example, intelligence agencies publicly referencing Internet and social media evidence as indicative of a chemical attack occurring with such force that a potential kinetic response was considered. The value of such material, as intelligence or court admissible evidence, is yet to be decided including how such material should be gathered and presented to be admissible.\n3. Already we are witnessing data relating to the investigation 'disappearing' from public view as narratives concerning, for example, who authorised the use of the nerve agent are debated. Near contemporary collection of data therefore generates a more accurate repository and acts as a witness to such events, and in particular gives victims a voice in future academic and policy shaping analysis.\n4. Past experience concerning allegations of chemical and biological weapons use suggests that data will continue to 'disappear' from public (and therefore academic) view as a narrative becomes dominant. Failure to collect information now that attests to multiple narratives may result in future research being based on incomplete or potentially flawed or otherwise contaminated dataset.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L014505/1","grantId":"ES/L014505/1","fundValue":"135562","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Caitriona  McLeish","coPersons":["James  Revill"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
