However, despite progress in understanding the mechanical andoptical properties of nano-materials we are still at the dawn of the fields of nano-optoelectronics andnano-photonics. Advances in understanding the fundamental materials science of these nano-materials todaywill therefore have a major impact on a wide range of commercial products over the next 30 years. One of thedifficulties with developing nano-optoelectronic components is the complexity of measuring their electricalproperties. Traditionally, new materials and devices have been tested via electrical transport measurements.Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make electrical contacts on a 30nm diameter nano-wire or anano-particle. Indeed even if the contacts are made it is then difficult to separate the properties of thenano-material from those of the contact. Additionally, such measurements are plagued by reproducibilityproblems. Thus there is a pressing need for techniques that can quickly and reliably extract the electricalproperties of nano-structured materials. The availability of such techniques would greatly accelerate thedevelopment of new materials and allow devices based on these materials to be brought to the market sooner.We propose to solve these problems by applying the technique of optical pump terahertz probe spectroscopy(OPTPS) to semiconductor nano-wires, and by developing refined models to extract the most importantdevice-specific electrical properties from the measured data. The knowledge we gain will help us develop newoptoelectronic devices based on semiconductor nano-wires.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H016368/1","grantId":"EP/H016368/1","fundValue":"755087","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  IP from this proposal is currently in the process of being protected and an EPSRC Impact Acceleration Award has been awarded to demonstrate a prototype.

The instrument and analysis techniques we invented during the project allowed us to measure the key electrical 'figures of merit' of these semiconductor nano-structures just by shining terahertz frequency light at them. We investigated a wide range of semiconductor nano wires, consisting of elements form groups III and V of the periodic table, and determined the following key electrical properties: electrical conductivity, mobility, and charge carriers lifetime, as well as their surface recombination velocities. From this wealth of information we identified GaAs nano wires for high-speed communications application and InP nano wires for use in solar cell applications. During this project technology was developed that is applicable to production-line quality control. In additional intellectual property was developed for future high speed communications systems. The instrumentation developed during the project has application in quality control during the manufacture of nano materials, and for fast development and optimisation of production techniques. The semiconductor nano wires investigated and fabricated in the project have the potential to be used as building blocks for electronic and optoelectronic devices including high speed photoconductors and as active elements in photovoltaic devices.
