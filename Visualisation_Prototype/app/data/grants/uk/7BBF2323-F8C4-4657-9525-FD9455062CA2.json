{"id":"7BBF2323-F8C4-4657-9525-FD9455062CA2","title":"Methods for longitudinal studies with multiple outcomes, informative drop-out and censoring: a study in cognitive decline","abstractText":"The proposed work aims to develop statistical methodology for longitudinal studies which simultaneously involve informative drop-out, censored observations (floors, ceilings or interval-censored) and multiple outcomes of different types (survival times, discrete or continuous repeated measures). The new statistical methods will be illustrated by undertaking analysis of the University of Manchester Longitudinal Study of Cognition, a longitudinal study that was established with the scope of examining the nature, time course, extent and aetiology of changes in cognitive function in old age. This will provide answers to a number of important substantive questions in the field of cognitive decline, depression and Alzheimer’s disease in elderly people. In particular, the project will model the causal/temporal relationship between cognitive decline and depression in older age and will elucidate the relation over time between cognitive decline or depression and onset of Alzheimer’s disease. The new methodology will be implemented into a statistical program which is freely downloadable from the internet.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2921","grantId":"RES-000-22-2921","fundValue":"80721","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Milena  Falcaro","coPersons":["Andrew Richard Pickles"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
