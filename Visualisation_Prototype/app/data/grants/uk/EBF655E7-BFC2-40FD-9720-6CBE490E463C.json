It results in irregular menstruation, is the main reason for ovulation-related infertility and, because of its associated metabolic abnormalities, carries a high risk of developing diabetes. However we still know very little about its cause or causes, which makes diagnosis imprecise and means that we are treating the resulting symptoms rather than the underlying causes. The main problem that we are attempting to address in this application is to understand the reasons why women with PCOS ovulate infrequently or not at all. \n\nA woman is born with a supply of eggs that must last throughout her reproductive lifespan. These eggs are surrounded by a single layer of supporting (granulosa) cells and stored in tiny follicles in the ovary. This resting pool of follicles is termed the primordial pool. The processes that prompt primordial follicles to start growing remain unclear but there is evidence that locally produced growth factors play an important part, particularly those of the so-called transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) family. Much of this evidence comes from studies of mouse follicle development in our own laboratory. TGFbeta growth factors are proteins that are produced by and act in follicles of all sizes, including the very smallest, primordial, follicles. \nIn our earlier studies of ovarian samples from women with PCOS, we have shown that the problems that lead to infrequent ovulation may lie in the very earliest stages of the life of the ovarian follicle and we have already shown that at least one of the TGFbeta family members (anti-M&uuml;llerian Hormone or AMH) is produced abnormally in very small follicles of women with PCOS. For the current proposal we will have unique access to ovarian tissue from women with and without PCOS, much of which will come from a research-orientated programme for conservation ofovary tissue in young women about to undergo treatment for cancer. Every sample that we obtain will be &quot;spare&quot; tissue samples that would normally be discarded. We will also be able to collect small biopsies of women with and without PCOS who are undergoing routine laparoscopy (to visualise the ovaries and Fallopian tubes) or who are having ovarian &quot;drilling&quot; as a procedure to stimulate ovulation.\n\nWe will determine where and when (according to developmental stage) TGFbeta growth factors (and their receptor targets) are produced, how they signal within ovarian cells, how they may interact other growth factor networks, and whether these processes differ between normal and polycystic ovaries. We will also examine the effects of added TGFbeta growth factors in small samples of cultured ovarian tissue. We expect these studies will provide important clues not only to understanding fertility problems in women with PCOS but also how they may relate to the development of metabolic disorders, including diabetes, to which these women are predisposed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M012638/1","grantId":"MR/M012638/1","fundValue":"401683","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2018-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Franks","coPersons":["Claus Yding Andersen","Kate  Hardy"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
