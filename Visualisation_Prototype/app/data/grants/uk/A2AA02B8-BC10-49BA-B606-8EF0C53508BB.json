{"id":"A2AA02B8-BC10-49BA-B606-8EF0C53508BB","title":"Evidence synthesis for genetic association studies","abstractText":"One explanation for variation in health outcomes, for example why some people get heart disease and others do not, is that genetic variants carried by some proportion of the population increase their risk of disease. However recent intense efforts to find these genetic variants have been only partially successful, apparently because the genetic effects are small and so can only be detected in vary large studies, or by combining or synthesising information across many smaller studies. This evidence synthesis has been very successful in other fields of biomedicine, but application to genetic studies is difficult and new methods are needed. This application will begin to develop such methods.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600580","grantId":"G0600580","fundValue":"353550","fundStart":"2007-03-19","fundEnd":"2010-09-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Whittaker","coPersons":["Juan P  Casas","Liam  Smeeth","Claudio John Verzilli","Aroon Dinesh Hingorani"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
