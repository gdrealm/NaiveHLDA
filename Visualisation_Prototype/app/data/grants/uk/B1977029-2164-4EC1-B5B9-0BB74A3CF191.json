{"id":"B1977029-2164-4EC1-B5B9-0BB74A3CF191","title":"Biomedical Visualisations and Society","abstractText":"<p>The grant funds a series of workshops (2009/10) for early career social science researchers to develop their expertise in relation to the sociology of medical visualisations. The aim is to build research capacity in this growing field by enabling early career researchers to gain technical knowledge and by providing opportunities for international networking, interdisciplinary networking and peer collaboration. Each workshop includes: a fieldtrip to see the focal technology with expert guidance, a lecture from a leading social scientist and a participatory workshop with ample time for networking. Focusing on four technologies (anatomical representations and plastinated prosections; diagnostic radiology; virtual reality; non-diagnostic obstetric ultrasound) we address the social and political implications, of visualisations. Themes include: the characteristics of visual knowledge; the “black-boxing” of design decisions, work practices, and regulation; patients experience of medical imaging; the dematerialization of the body; the movement of medical images from the clinic into broader society and tensions between different interpretations of images; and the limitations of the knowledge medical visualizations provide in relation to complex social issues. The outcomes of the workshops include a project website, a collaboratively produced bibliography and four collaboratively written working papers outlining the key themes and questions emerging from each workshop.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-810-21-0030","grantId":"RES-810-21-0030","fundValue":"28915","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie  Roberts","coPersons":["Frances  Griffiths"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
