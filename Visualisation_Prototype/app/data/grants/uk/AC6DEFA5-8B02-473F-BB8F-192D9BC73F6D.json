The research programme of the Group focusses on observational spectroscopic studies of the role of molecules and dust chemistry in astrophysical processes in stellar, circumstellar and nebular media, coupled with laboratory astrophysics of interstellar dust reactions and processes of particular importance in star-forming regions. The continued success of the research depends strongly on a sound level of computer support for data reduction, analysis and modelling, and maintaining and extending our collaborations with both UK-based and international researchers through short-term visits to Nottingham.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D001684/1","grantId":"PP/D001684/1","fundValue":"3207","fundStart":"2007-01-16","fundEnd":"2010-07-15","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Advancement of understanding of interstellar matter Education Cultural","person":"Peter John Sarre","coPersons":["Martin Robert McCoustra","June  McCombie"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
