It has also been observed that warmer natural waters contain smaller phytoplankton cells. This is related to a field of prior research concerned with similar phenomena, and has been summarized under various ecological &quot;laws&quot;, e.g., the temperature-size rule, James's Rule, and Bergmann's Rule. In short, warming benefits the small. Most prior explanations of this phenomenon have focused on physiological explanations, but our work shows for the first time that competition can also be an important factor: smaller phytoplankton cells are expected, based on our work, to have an accentuated competitive advantage for nutrient uptake and rapid growth in warmer waters. The same may be true of other ectotherms.\n\nMany results related to marine fisheries are underway, to be published within the next year or so. Understanding the mechanisms by which organisms become smaller in warmed ecosystems may help is predict when this will occur, and thereby understand effects on the food chains that depend on the species. The work is basic science - it illuminates one of the key impacts of climate change on biota. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
