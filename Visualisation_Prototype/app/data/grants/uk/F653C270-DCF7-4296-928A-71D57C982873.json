Technological plasmas are increasingly used in industrial processing of materials, particularly to affect their surface properties, and are widely used in the semiconductor industry. Energy from controlled plasma fusion of hydrogen isotopes presents us with the possibility of a 'clean' energy source to replace fossil fuels and to alleviate global warming resulting from carbon dioxide emissions from current generation power stations.The cross section for electron removal or ionization of the simplest atom (hydrogen, or its isotope deuterium) by antiprotons is currently of considerable interest. This is the simplest collision system for testing theory with only one active electron and, since the antiproton cannot capture an electron, the detection of a hydrogen ion in coincidence with an antiproton after the collision is a signature of the ionization process. We will measure the cross sections for ionization of atomic hydrogen by antiproton impact at low energies, in a range never before accessed experimentally. Our understanding of the ionization mechanism in such a simple three-body system should enable an important step forward in current theoretical models.A firm theoretical understanding of ionization is important to the applications mentioned above, as theory is often used to provide input to simulations and in the interpretation of observations in physical situations where dedicated experiments are difficult, or even impossible...","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I005692/1","grantId":"EP/I005692/1","fundValue":"2480","fundStart":"2010-06-17","fundEnd":"2011-03-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used by many scientists to justify theoretical and experimental work in number of areas of basic physics.
