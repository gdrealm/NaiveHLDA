{"id":"CBC410DA-9B0E-4F3F-B7DA-6B52B725C454","title":"Temporal forensic analysis of digital Camera sensor imperfections for picture dating","abstractText":"The research proposal aims to investigate the temporal variations of camera sensor imperfections in order to establish, for any given digital camera, a theoretical model that allows the analyst to estimate the acquisition date of digital pictures. This will advance the field of forensic science, with the potential for applications in high profile cases that require the extraction of evidential information for courtroom purposes. In this project, the analyst is assumed to have the camera device or a set of trusted pictures taken by the same camera and whose acquisition time is known. The goal is then to date one or more images supposedly obtained from the same source and whose acquisition time is unknown. This application will obviously help forensic investigators analyse incidents and link different events.\nThe novelty of the proposed approach lies in (i) New techniques for efficiently estimating the sensor pattern noise for the purpose of temporal analysis (ii) Classification and temporal analysis of three types of pixels, namely, normal pixels, abnormal but not yet defective pixels, and defective pixels. (iii) Use of machine learning techniques to model the temporal behaviour of camera sensor imperfections.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L006812/1","grantId":"EP/L006812/1","fundValue":"95000","fundStart":"2014-08-31","fundEnd":"2016-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Fouad  Khelifi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
