Co-production comes in two familiar forms. The first is where individuals work to meet their own needs alongside professionals. The other is where individuals work collectively to meet the needs of their community through volunteering or engaging in joint action. This research looks at what drives citizen participation in these individual and collective forms of co-production through surveys in five local authorities in England and Wales. The level of individual co-production is substantially higher than collective co-production. Both forms show increased levels where people are more satisfied with consultation and when they have a strong sense that they can make a difference. Levels of individual and collective co-production did not vary much with socio-economic variables although greater age tends to be negatively associated with individual co-production but positively with collective co-production. Our main policy recommendation flows from our findings: public authorities need to do more to convince citizens that their actions will make a positive difference if they wish to see co-production levels increase.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I50754X/1","grantId":"AH/I50754X/1","fundValue":"32056","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Tony  Bovaird","coPersons":["Gerry  Stoker"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" This study has demonstrated that individual and collective co-production have rather different characteristics and correlates. This reinforces the findings of our previous international study (Loeffler et al, 2008; Parrado et al, 2013; Bovaird et al, 2012)) and highlights the importance of distinguishing between them for policy purposes.\n\n\n\nIndividual co-production is easier that collective co-production, as it does not rely on group activities or on the reaction of other people to one's activit These findings are potentially important to local public service agencies in desiging and implementing a strategy for activating citizens in co-commissioning, co-design, co-delivery and co-assessment of publicly-valued outcomes. \n\n\n\nIn addition, the findings suggest to the relevant central government departments (e.g Cabinet Office, HM Treasury, Communities and Local Govenrment, Health, Culture Media and Sports, Education) how they might build in support mechanisms to their policies for increasi Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
