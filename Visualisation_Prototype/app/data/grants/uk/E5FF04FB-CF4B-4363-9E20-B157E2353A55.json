Traditionally, it has been thought that vision, more than any other sense, was central to spatial understanding, both when looking at an environment directly or when imagining it.&nbsp;Research with the blind has similarly argued that whilst sight allows us to develop a mental ‘map’ of the external environment, the blind are restricted to only knowing where things are in relation to where they themselves are. However, recent investigations have begun to suggest that the blind are able to understand space in the same map-like way as are the sighted.</p> \n<p>Vision is not crucial to understanding space.&nbsp;However, it is not clear how similar or different the mechanisms underlying spatial understanding for the sighted and those born totally blind are. Similar processes would suggest that the sensory source (eg vision, touch) of the spatial information was not crucial to understanding space; different processes would suggest that sensory source affects the way space is understood. This question will be explored by examining performance patterns and by looking at brain activity through the use of Event Related Potentials (ERPs).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2026","grantId":"RES-000-22-2026","fundValue":"77832","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Freeland Eardley","coPersons":["Martin  Eimer"],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
