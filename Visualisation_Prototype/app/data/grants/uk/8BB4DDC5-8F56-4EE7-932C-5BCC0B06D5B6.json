{"id":"8BB4DDC5-8F56-4EE7-932C-5BCC0B06D5B6","title":"Substrate-transporter complexes in the twin-arginine protein transport system","abstractText":"Some proteins operate on the outside of the bacterial cell, for example the toxins produced by bacterial pathogens. Since all proteins are made inside the bacterium the extracellular proteins must be moved out of the cell across the normally impermeable cell membrane. This task is carried out by machines termed protein transporters that are located in the cell membrane. One type of transporter moves unfolded proteins, threading them across the membrane like string through the eye of a needle. By contrast, a second type of transporter, which we term the Tat system, moves folded proteins across the membrane. This is much more challenging than threading and so it is thought that the Tat system operates by an unusual mechanism. The Tat system is required for many bacterial processes including energy generation, cell division, pathogenesis, and the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis of soil bacteria with plants. The Tat protein transport system is not only found in bacteria but is also present in the chloroplasts of plants where it is essential to form and maintain the proteins required to carry out photosynthesis. The heart of the Tat system is a complex formed by two proteins called TatB and TatC. This complex sits in the cell membrane and recognises and binds the proteins that are to be transported. It then binds another protein called TatA to form the active transporter. This project aims to characterise the complexes formed between the Tat components and the transported protein in more detail with the aim of increasing our understanding of the unusual mechanism of the Tat system. The Tat system is a possible drug target because it is required for bacterial pathogenesis but is not found in humans. It is also of biotechnological interest because it could be utilised to secrete useful protein products.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F02150X/1","grantId":"BB/F02150X/1","fundValue":"373829","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Benjamin Charles Berks","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" The twin arginine (Tat) protein transport system is involved in moving folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of prokaryotes and the thylakoid membrane of plant chloroplasts. The Tat system is of potential use as pathway to produce proteins of industrial or pharmacological utility. \n A membrane bound receptor protein complex containing the proteins TatB and TatC recognises `signal peptides' on proteins that will be transported by the Tat system. Our work characterised the interactions between the signal peptide and TatBC using a range of biochemical and biophysical techniques. \n We identified two modes of signal peptide binding which differ in their binding strength. We found that there was one high affinity binding site in each TatBC complex but multiple low affinity binding sites. This implies a functional asymmetry with the TatBC complex which we infer to be of mechanistic importance. We found that the TatB protein is essential to the formation of the high affinity binding site. These results have significant implications for the mechanism of the Tat transporter. Demonstrates that techniques used to analyse protein-protein interactions between water-soluble proteins can be adapted to the analysis of much larger, multi-subunit, membrane protein complexes.
