It can lead to a severe haemorrhagic fever that can be fatal unless treated in hospital. At the early stages it is impossible to judge which patients are going to suffer the more severe symptoms and should be admitted to hospital. During epidemics literally thousands of cases can occur at the same time and completely overwhelm the hospital systems. This research aims to develop a simple predictor of disease severity which would allow the high risk patients to be admitted to hospital whilst those at lower risk could be managed at home.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801508","grantId":"G0801508","fundValue":"576025","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin Robert Screaton","coPersons":["Juthathip  Mongkolsapaya","Bernard Vincent North"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
