{"id":"4D7DE202-07C6-4E83-BBF1-BC0B0D74DB7C","title":"Yap: a novel regulator of satellite cell fate with regenerative medicine potential","abstractText":"Stem cells are required to maintain and regenerate our organs. Stem cells are also a treatment option and could potentially be used to replace dead insulin-secreting cells in the pancreas of patients with diabetes. Another strategy is to develop drugs for example to stimulate the production of additional stem cells by the body itself. This could potentially be used to increase the number of stem cells in aged human muscle, where it is reduced roughly by half. The aim of the proposed project is to investigate for the first time a protein termed Yap in satellite cells which are the stem cells of our muscles. We hypothesize that Yap is important for controlling the number of muscle stem cells and their repair activity. To test our hypothesis we will either remove or overactivate Yap in muscle stem cells and then investigate how this affects the numbers and repair activity of muscle stem cells. We then aim to identify the parts on our chromosomes to which Yap binds to in order to investigate how Yap exerts its function in muscle stem cells. Taken together, these experiments will inform us whether Yap is a suitable drug target to modulate the numbers and repair activity of muscle stem cells. If it was then Yap-targetting treatments could be used in the management for example in regulating the behaviour of stem cells in patients with muscular dystrophy and in the elderly.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100193","grantId":"G1100193","fundValue":"508767","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Henning  Wackerhage","coPersons":["Peter Steven Zammit","Cosimo  De Bari"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
