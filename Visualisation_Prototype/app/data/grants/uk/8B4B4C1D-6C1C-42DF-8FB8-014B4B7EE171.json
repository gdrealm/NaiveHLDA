{"id":"8B4B4C1D-6C1C-42DF-8FB8-014B4B7EE171","title":"Violence against women and the millennium development goals: Using global evidence to inform policy","abstractText":"<p>Despite accumulating evidence of the extent of violence against women, and the high burden it places on womenâ€™s health, investment in this issue is woefully inadequate. In part, this neglect stems from the difficulty that agencies, advocates and policymakers have in accessing relevant, up to date, and easy-to-use evidence on the extent of violence and its role in undermining other development agendas, such as fighting HIV. For the past two years the Gender, Violence and Health Centre has been leading an assessment of the global prevalence and health burden of child sexual abuse, intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence. The team has searched more than 26 databases in English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese and Russian; screened more than 30,000 abstracts and identified approximately 1,000 studies with information on the prevalence of abuse and its impact on the health of women, men and children.</p>\n\n<p>The project will systematise this information and produce estimates of the health burden of violence by region and translate the findings into easy to use resources (eg global maps, policy briefs, etc) for policymakers and advocates. In addition, project staff will work with partners to disseminate the findings via conferences, webinars, meetings, and social media. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I003045/1","grantId":"ES/I003045/1","fundValue":"92840","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte Helen Watts","coPersons":["Karen  Devries","Cathy  Zimmerman","Loraine  Bacchus"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
