{"id":"B71AF5AE-FDC0-412D-8160-8DA8FF9C8D5F","title":"An investigation of tetrapod skull architecture using advanced computer modelling techniques.","abstractText":"The skulls of animals must balance the conflicting demands of strength and stability with flexibility, so that they can open their mouths as wide as possible and apply a maximum bite force without damaging the enclosed brain and sense organs. Ancestors of reptiles, birds and mammals had a solid skull except for eye and ear openings, but they soon began to develop openings (fenestrae) in the side of the skull behind the eyes; now different skulls have different patterns of fenestrae, but it is still not understood why. Furthermore the overall geometries of skulls are different. There is variation in skull depth, in the size of the brain and/or sense organs, in the complexity of the jaw muscles, and in the length of the neck. All of these features, individually or in combination, have a major effect on skull function (biomechanics) and may underlie the radical differences in skull architecture of living animals. The aim of this research is to understand the relationship between biomechanical forces and skull shape in living animals, and in particular to determine the biomechanical significance of skull fenestrations. To do this work, we need to combine the expertise of mechanical engineers, digital imagers, bone biologists, and morphologists, and use advanced computer modelling techniques to perform sophisticated biomechanical analyses. In this project, information from museum specimens of living animal groups (obtained by advanced computer imaging - High Resolution Computed X-ray Tomography) will be combined to develop accurate models of a range of skulls. These can be modified to change basic parameters (e.g. eye size, brain size, patterns of fenestration), and then loaded in ways that simulate changing complexities of the jaw and neck muscles, changes in size of the brain and sense organs, and/or increasing bite force. As a result, we can, for the first time, test a series of theories to explain skull shape. Not only will the study advance our knowledge of the development of a key group of organisms but it will also deepen our understanding of the complex relationship between biomechanical forces, soft tissue structures and skeletal shape. Understanding this complex relationship is important, not only to general biology but also to medicine (e.g. bone repair and remodelling, over-use injuries, osteoporosis).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E009204/1","grantId":"BB/E009204/1","fundValue":"339302","fundStart":"2007-09-13","fundEnd":"2010-09-12","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The research has provided much useful information on the relationship between biomechanical forces and skull geometry, which (with BB/E014259/1) has led directly to two follow-on projects to further elucidate: (1) the role of sutures and skull flexibility (kinesis) in some animals; and (2) the biomechanics of mandibles, which is providing information that will be useful to future dental research. In addition, the work has led to a long-term research project investigating craniosynostosis, a rare clinical condition where premature fusion of the sutures in the skull occurs. That project includes an investigation into the biomechanics of skull growth, which will have other potential clinical applications.

We considered reptiles but the results apply to all animals including humans. Many of our target animals were relatively small, making traditional experimental approaches technically difficult, even without the ethical concerns. We therefore developed a sophisticated computational approach that combines the expertise of biomechanical engineers and functional morphologists. It involves the following steps: (1) development of an anatomically accurate 3D computer model of the target skull and neck; (2) inclusion of cranial joints; (3) incorporation of relevant head and neck muscles; (4) development of a moving computer model (MDA, multi-body dynamics model) that replicates jaw movements and muscle actions; (5) validation of the model by comparison with the living animal (where possible); (6) analysis of the model (FEA, Finite Element Analysis) to examine patterns of strain related to feeding and other activities; (7) modification of the skull architecture (adding/removing openings or bars), with repetition of step (6). \n\nThis protocol allowed us to test theories about the complex relationship between biomechanical forces, soft tissue structures and skeletal shape. \n\nOur results have shown: \n\na) That the combined use of MDA and FEA yields more realistic models than FEA alone. \n\nb) That the presence of neck muscles (and thus of a neck) did not alter strains significantly in the skull, although strains were larger in some areas when the neck musculature was included. \n\nc) That fenestrae appear to develop in areas of the skull where strain is low and may therefore be an expression of mechanical efficiency, at least in part. \n\nd) That skull sutures do not lower the average strain in the skull, but do tend to reduce peak strain values and distribute the strains more evenly. Thus while strains decrease in some areas, they increase in others. This result has important implications towards bone adaptation and remodelling, and may explain the maintenance of the current skull structures. The presence of cranial soft tissue between the skull and braincase, around the jaw joints, and in some key points of the skull also contributes to shock-absorption. \n\ne) That muscle cross-sectional area, generally used to predict muscle strength, underestimates this strength if the muscles concerned have a complex internal architecture (i.e. pennate, as in lizards and turtles). \n\nf) That mobile joints in lizards and bracing bars in tuataras (and dinosaurs, crocodiles and birds) may be different ways of avoiding damaging strains around the jaw joint. \n\ng) That in animals without socketed teeth, feedback from the jaw joint and adductor musculature is likely to have an important role in modulating biting. a) Sea turtle and tuatara conservation - understanding feeding mechanics and diet\nb) Presentation of science to the general public \n\nRelated research continues - with increasing interest in clinical problems. \n\na) Early suture work developed into further projects into craniosynostosis\nb) New approaches to the modelling of biological systems\nc) Education and museums\nd) Insights in the role of jaw joint feedback in the control of biting (potential for understanding human bite anomalies) Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
