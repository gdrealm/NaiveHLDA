They are similar to electrons but do not have any electric charge. It was recently discovered that neutrinos are not massless but have a very small mass. Super-NEMO is one of several planned future experiments to investigate the nature of the neutrino and, in particular, whether a neutrino is the same as its antiparticle or not.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H004122/1","grantId":"ST/H004122/1","fundValue":"22138","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mary  Carter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
