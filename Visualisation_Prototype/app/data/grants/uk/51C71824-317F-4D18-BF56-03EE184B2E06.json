After the initial trauma, a number of processes can cause further damage to the brain. One of these factors is the inability of nerve cells (neurones) to make enough energy. This study investigates how neurones use different fuels after head injury, and how this differs from normal brain and other tissues such as muscle. By using a technique called microdialysis we can deliver different brain fuels (glucose, pyruvate, succinate) and track how the brain uses them by tagging each fuel with a form of heavy carbon (C13). We can also use a specialised form of MRI scan called phosphorus MR spectrocopy to measure how much energy is stored in the cells as a molecule called ATP. A better understanding of how the brain makes energy when it is injured can allow us to develop treatments for a variety of conditions including head injury.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002277","grantId":"G1002277","fundValue":"408036","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Hutchinson","coPersons":["David Krishna Menon","Thomas Adrian Carpenter","John Douglas Pickard","Peter  Grice","Adel Ezzat Helmy","Michael  Murphy","Keri  Carpenter","Clare  Gallagher"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
