Previous work (RES-000-22-1540; Ambridge et al, in press), which used a new paradigm for obtaining graded gramaticality judgements from young children, provided support for two proposals: (1) Entrenchment: Repeated presentation of &quot;The rabbit disappeared&quot; makes the error seem increasingly ungrammatical. (2) Verb semantics: Children learn that &quot;disappear&quot; is an internally-caused, single participant action, and hence&nbsp; incompatible with the meaning associated with the SUBJECT VERB OBJECT construction (one participant causing another to perform an action).</p>\n\n<p>The studies in the present grant will compare two hypotheses for a single learning mechanism that yield both these effects. Under the two-level entrenchment account, presentation of a verb in a particular construction (eg the intransitive) constitutes evidence that verbs that share semantic features (ie semantic classmates) may not appear in non-attested constructions (eg the transitive causative).Under the strengthening-of-construction-semantics account, children learn that certain verbs may not be used in particular constructions (eg the transitive causative) by gradually learning more and more about the semantics of individual constructions, and of individual verbs, thus eventually allowing them to reject “mismatches”</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F025165/1","grantId":"ES/F025165/1","fundValue":"216299","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  As with most research projects that seek to understand the processes behind typical language development, the short term impacts are mostly scientific. However, in the longer term, research on the formation and restriction of linguistic generalizations will inform interventions for children with language impairment, and educational practice more generally. This research also suggests useful strategies for adult learners of a second language (whether this is English or another language).\n\nIn the longer term, our findings regarding the acquisition of the ability to form and restrict linguistic generalizations will benefit clinicians working with children with language impairment; we have ensured that these findings will be communicated to this group by presenting our findings in journals/conferences that are widely read/attended by language practitioners.

The project has made a significant contribution in this area, and has so far yielded five journal articles (three of which are already published or in press), with more to follow (exceeding our proposed output of three). \n\nThe first study investigated whether two previously-proposed accounts were supported for overgeneralization errors involving the double-object dative construction (e.g., *John said Sue something). Under the entrenchment hypothesis, repeated presentation of a verb in permitted constructions (e.g., John said something to Sue) leads to the ever-strengthening inference that its use in non-attested constructions is not permitted. Under the semantic verb class hypothesis, speakers form classes of verbs with similar meanings that are restricted to particular constructions only. As predicted by the entrenchment hypothesis, the unacceptability of overgeneralization errors was significantly correlated with verb frequency. As predicted by the semantic verb class hypothesis, children used the meanings denoted by novel, experimentally-taught verbs to determine the constructions in which they can and cannot appear. Following positive reviews, a revised journal article has recently been resubmitted to the leading international linguistics journal (Language). \n\nThe remaining studies compared two new single-process accounts designed to incorporate both entrenchment and semantic verb class effects. Under the two-level-entrenchment account, statistical entrenchment effects are extended to verbs with similar meanings. Under the incremental learning of verb and construction semantics account, speakers avoid extending verbs into constructions with which they are semantically incompatible. The findings of these studies supported the incremental learning of verb and construction semantics account. In particular, we found that independently manipulating the semantics of either the construction (Ambridge et al, 2009; Cognitive Science) or the verb (Ambridge et al, in press; Cognitive Linguistics) influences the perceived grammaticality of transitive causative uses of novel verbs (e.g., *The man meeked the ball). We have also completed an analagous study on the double-object dative construction, which is currently in the process of being written up.\n\nWe have also conducted three additional studies that go beyond those outlined in the initial proposal:\n\n1) An extension of the Language study discussed above that investigates overgeneralizations involving the locative constructions (e.g., *I spilled the floor with juice; *I filled some juice into the cup). This study is currently in the process of being written up.\n2) An extension of the semantics studies discussed above to overgeneralizations involving un-prefixation (e.g., *I unclosed the door). This study is particularly important as it extends both the theoretical account and the grammaticality judgment methodology from the domain of syntax into the domain of morphology, and has been submitted to Cognition.\n3) An extension of the incremental learning of verb and construction properties account to the domain of the English past-tense, where the relevant properties are phonological, as opposed to semantic. This study is currently in press at Developmental Psychology. Extend to other languages (I plan to apply for a grant to do just this). Education","dataset":"gtr"}
