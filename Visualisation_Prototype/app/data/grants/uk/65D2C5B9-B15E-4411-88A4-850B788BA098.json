Recently, we have witnessed multiple sophisticated targeted attacks against governments and companies. Such attacks are much different than traditional network attacks, because attackers have virtually unlimited resources and can tailor their operation to the victim's network, making these attacks very difficult to detect. In fact, current state of the art detection techniques are inadequate to protect computer networks against targeted attacks.\n\nIn this proposal, we aim to make some fundamental steps towards being able to reliably detect targeted attacks on computer networks. To this end, we plan to abstract the observation from the actual manifestation of an attack, and focus on the purpose behind network activities instead. We believe that modern machine learning techniques such as deep belief networks can be used to automatically learn high-level features from network data. Such features are indicative of the purpose for which the network activity is performed, rather than of the specific techniques and tools used to accomplish that purpose. These high-level features can then be used in traditional supervised machine learning to detect whether a network activity is being performed with a malicious intention or a benign one.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N008448/1","grantId":"EP/N008448/1","fundValue":"98243","fundStart":"2015-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gianluca  Stringhini","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
