{"id":"35FA0CFF-67C8-4FD2-A5B8-BE1C7F76F318","title":"OpenPlant","abstractText":"An essential concept in Synthetic Biology is that genetic systems can be constructed using standardised, interchangeable parts. For example, functional DNA sequences such as promoters, ribosome binding sites and coding sequences can be used to develop synthetic gene systems that can be used to reprogram living systems in a systematic way. The prospect of large-scale reprogramming of living systems, will require access to relatively large numbers of components. This is in contrast to existing GM products that contain one or a few components. There is growing requirement for libraries of well characterized routine components that can be shared for the construction of a variety of systems, where small companies would be ensured freedom to operate. This is essential to foster the kind of innovation seen at the emergence of other new technologies such as microelectronics and software development.\n\nAccordingly, a substantial part of the Synthetic Biology field has promoted open standards and sharing of data and resources, inspired by the open source software movement. The educational community has embraced the open source principle, and DNA parts are widely and freely distributed internationally as part of educational efforts like the iGEM community, and grows year-on-year. The BioBricks Foundation is a non-profit organisation which has roots in the academic community, and which has promoted a legal framework which would allow protection of Synthetic Biology applications and key activities, but which would facilitate sharing of parts. \n\nPlant biotechnology is a good example of a field where current IP practices have led to a restriction of exchange and innovation, and this model is threatening to predominate in plant synthetic biology. For examples, one just has to look at restrictive licensing of basic technologies like transformation, selection markers and useful genes. We believe that the field needs to explore new &quot;two-tier&quot; intellectual property models that will protect investment in applications, while promote sharing of DNA components and freedom-to-operate for small companies in commercial applications of Synthetic Biology. As the speed and scale of biological assembly increases, this becomes more pressing.\n\nAs part of the OpenPlant initiative, we will establish open-source DNA registries across the UK for sharing information, and to join an international web of registries with plant specific parts. The technology is inherently low cost, renewable and has obvious applications for new sustainable technologies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L014130/1","grantId":"BB/L014130/1","fundValue":"11788000","fundStart":"2014-07-31","fundEnd":"2019-09-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Baulcombe","coPersons":["Jonathan Dallas Jones","Alison  Smith","George Peter Lomonossoff","Cathie  Martin","Alexander Arundell Webb","Sarah Ellen O'Connor","Paul Edwin O'Maille (JIC)","Sebastian  Schornack","James Phillip Haseloff","Christopher  Howe","Julian  Hibberd","Giles  Oldroyd","Alison Gail Smith","Nicola Joan  Patron","James Warren Ajioka","Pietro  Cicuta","James  Locke","Anne  Osbourn","Rob  Field","Dale  Sanders"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
