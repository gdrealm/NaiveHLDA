Uncertainty is a construct that is central to the real options theory which is the studyâ€™s proposed theoretical angle.</p>\n\n<p>The following hypotheses are initially posed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Greater market uncertainty increases the likelihood of commercializing patented inventions in form of a spinout rather than licensing.<br /></li>\n\n <li>Greater technological uncertainty increases the likelihood of commercializing patents in form of a spinout rather than licensing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Threat of preemption negatively influences the likelihood that a patented invention will be exploited through firm formation. Preemption refers to the possibility of other parties entering the same market.</p>\n\n<p>The core dataset tracks all patented inventions (811) of the largest research institute in Germany from 1990 to 2003. The data includes the outcome of each invention with the exact dates of all events. The proposed study is novel in the following four ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>It will use rigorous quantitative data.<br /></li>\n\n <li>It is the first to explore a quantitative dataset in Europe.<br /></li>\n\n <li>It will use longitudinal data from a complete population.<br /></li>\n\n <li>It will use a new theoretical approach, the real options theory. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2254","grantId":"RES-000-22-2254","fundValue":"80673","fundStart":"2007-05-31","fundEnd":"2008-05-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Vangelis  Souitaris","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
