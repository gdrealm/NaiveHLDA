Debates have raged over the extent to which parents have a right to buy educational advantage for their children and to avoid local secondaries in search of a 'better' education elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Political philosophers have written about the extent to which particular parental decisions on school choice can be considered 'fair', and a weight of opinion exists in all directions on what the British public ought to think.</p>\n\n<p>However, what does that public actually think? Do people believe there is a 'right' to choose schools for children? Do they think it is fair for parents to pass on cultural, social and financial advantage in terms of the choices they make? Do they acknowledge the notion that personal and familial actions around school choice might have implications for others? Questions such as these will be addressed via the 2010 British Social Attitudes survey.</p>\n\n<p>This survey series is Britain's longest running and most authoritative survey of national attitudes, allowing comparisons of views between parents and non-parents, those with different social characteristics, those who have made different school choice decisions and those with different local schooling options available.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H033831/2","grantId":"ES/H033831/2","fundValue":"2959","fundStart":"2011-09-30","fundEnd":"2012-10-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sonia Rose Exley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
