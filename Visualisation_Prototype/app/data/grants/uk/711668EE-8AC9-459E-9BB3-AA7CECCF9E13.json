The Grid is shorthand for the emerging technical standards and tools being developed to facilitate collaboration and simplify the sharing of data resources and analysis routines. NCeSS was created in 2004 to promote e-social science – the use of the Grid to benefit the social sciences. NCeSS has a distributed structure, comprising a coordinating Hub at the University of Manchester and a network of research Nodes and small grant projects in universities across the UK. The Hub co-ordinates NCeSS research activities, providing the intelligence, planning and organisation necessary to give strategic direction to the UK's e-social science programme, as well as providing training, technical support, information services and support to users. It acts as the central resource for e-social science issues and activities in the UK, integrating them with ESRC research methods initiatives and the wider UK e-Science Core Programme, and liaising with parallel initiatives overseas. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-149-28-0001","grantId":"RES-149-28-0001","fundValue":"1102050","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Halfpenny","coPersons":["Rob  Procter","Keith John Cole","Terry  Hewitt"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
