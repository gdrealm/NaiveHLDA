{"id":"02F0C481-AF52-4892-B064-CBAFE82D1FA7","title":"Web Services 4 Life Sciences: A Curated Catalogue of Life Science Web Services","abstractText":"WS4LS is an initiative aimed at providing easy access to a catalogue of Web Services relevant to the life science communities. Web Services are defined by the W3C as a software system designed to enable machine to machine interoperability over a network. However, the discovery of Web Services is today quite a difficult task for bench scientists whom do not have the time or means to endeavor in the informatics related to these. Web Services are poorly described. WS4LS intends to provide easy, human accessible content documenting Web Services by extensive use of service ontologies through which it will be trivial to discover a function or operation, as required by the end user. Until recently, laboratories had to invest locally in the implementation and maintenance of bioinformatic tools and databases to carry out both day to day as well as complex tasks. WS4LS addresses the 'where and how' of Web Services for scientists and exposes how to build these into local analytical pipelines. WS4LS will also provide the means for creating communities that will share knowledge and enhance scientific interactions at various levels. WS4LS e-scientists communities will complement existing efforts and generate a Google-like Coop [http://www.google.com/coop/].","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F01046X/1","grantId":"BB/F01046X/1","fundValue":"316888","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The BioCatalogue (http://www.biocatalogue.org) continues to be actively used. It is managed by University of Manchester and it is hosted at the EMBL-EBI. It currently has 793 registered contributing members, 1168 active services, and 1350 archived services. It recently had a significant curation overhaul.\nAverage user visits per year: 9709\nAverage sessions per year: 17244\nAverage page views per year: 50872\n\nIt forms part of the ELIXIR-UK portfolio of resources and contributes to the ELIXIR registry. \n\nThe BioCatalogue spawned the BioDiversityCatalogue (www.biodiversitycatalogue.org) for BioDiversity Services which forms part of the BioDiversity Virtual eLab (http://www.biovel.eu). \n\nA generalised platform for Web Service Catalogues - the ServiceCatalographer, has been spawned as a factory for making specialist Web Service Registries (http://www.servicecatalogue.org.uk/). \n\nThe platform was also adopted by PANACEA - a USA catalogue of Web services that automated the process of acquisition, production, maintenance and updating of the language resources required by machine translation.\n\nAn iPad/iPhone app was also developed for mobile access to the Catalogue, and it has been fully integrated into the Taverna Workflow Management System (http://www.taverna.org.uk).

We developed, and continue to support and curate, a Web Services Catalogue for the Web Services of the Life Sciences community. Thus bioinformaticians and developers of bioinformatics tools can find, annotate, monitor and advertise web services. This means that they can be reused beyond their original authors and that reinvention can be reduced.\n\nThe Catalogue is in active use and has spawned clones for the Biodiversity Community. It forms part of the Software Catalogue of the ELIXIR European Research Infrastructure. \n\nAn iPad/iPhone app was also developed for mobile access to the Catalogue, and it has been fully integrated into the Taverna Workflow Management System (http://www.taverna.org.uk) The BioCatalogue is already in use, and is to become part of the ELIXIR Registry family. The resource is freely accessible.\n\nThe software is open source and freely available under a BSD license. \n\nThe findings on web service management and the quality of web service publishing, has been reported in international conferences and publications.
