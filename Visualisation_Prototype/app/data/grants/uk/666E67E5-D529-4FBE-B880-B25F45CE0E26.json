The normal age of puberty is 10.5 years in girls and 11.5 years in boys. Chronic malnutrition, illness and social deprivation are the most common causes of delayed puberty, in a global context. However, there is considerable public and medical interest in the falling age of puberty because of the consequences of a mismatch between the psychological and body changes caused by the early rise in 'the hormones' and the actual level of maturity of the individual. Although obesity and overweightness, which are reaching epidemic proportions in children in the UK and other countries, are considered the principal culprit, there is increasing evidence that psychosocial stress also plays a role. Early puberty is associated with stress in the family domain, especially, absence of father, parental dysfunction, parent-child conflict and sexual abuse. Early onset of puberty puts girls at increased risk of earlier sexual activity and first pregnancy, in addition to gynaecological disorders including cancer, depression and many other health problems, which have long-term consequences for Women's Health in general. The recent report (Dec. 3, 2010) from the UK Government's poverty advisor, Frank Field, advocates that 'Britain must not pussyfoot around with feckless parents and dysfunctional families, and children's needs are more important than that of the mothers'. Normal puberty starts with activation of a small area in the brain called the hypothalamus that begins to secrete a brain hormone called gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which sets in motion a cascade of hormonal signals that lead to stimulation of both the ovaries and the testes that not only drives sexual maturation but triggers voice changes, new body hair and the moodiness associated with adolescence. Recently a new brain chemical, or neuropeptide, called kisspeptin was found to be a critical link in activating the GnRH nerve cell in the brain. Although, kisspeptin is undoubtedly the single most important activator of the GnRH system it now remains to be discovered what triggers the kisspeptin system at puberty. We have recently discovered that the major stress hormone in the brain, corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), has a direct inhibitory action on the kisspeptin system in adults that may explain reproductive disorders including infertility. In addition, we have found that at the time of puberty there is a reduction in the activity of the CRF system in the hypothalamus that is responsible for activating the adrenal glands that release the stress hormone, cortisol, into the blood. Moreover, blockade of CRF actions in the brain with an anti-CRF drug causes earlier puberty suggesting that normally CRF may play a key role in the triggering of puberty onset. However, there is another major CRF system in the brain that controls emotion, called the amygdala. The amygdala not only enhances the stress response, but controls anxiety, especially stress-related reward seeking behaviour that includes the increased consumption of energy rich foods or 'comfort foods'. We have recently discovered that the amygdala also sends inhibitory signals to the reproductive centres and previous studies showed an inhibitory influence of the amygdala on the timing of puberty. In pilot studies using animal models of delayed puberty (early life infection stress) or advanced puberty (eating energy rich foods) we have discovered that the CRF system in the amygdala was activated or inhibited respectively. These models provide a unique opportunity not only to discover the key interactions between the emotional stress areas in the brain (amygdala) and the reproductive centres (containing kisspeptin-GnRH) that controls the timing of puberty in response to the environment, but may help future developments of more effective treatments for stress-related disorders of puberty.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J002232/1","grantId":"BB/J002232/1","fundValue":"741012","fundStart":"2012-01-25","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Elucidation of the neural mechanism underlying altered pubertal timing is not only critical for human health and wellbeing, and therefore society in general, but is important for animal production with its implication for food production and food security and in animal care and husbandry in general, which may impact on our endeavours to protect endangered species. Therefore understanding how the brain dictates fertility, in particular pubertal timing will be of general interest to heath care professionals and the general public. Additionally, the farming community, and these involved in animal husbandry, for example zoo managers and keepers will benefit from the finding of this project. Importantly, communicating these findings, through journals, books, and scientific society web pages, such as the British Society for Neuroendocrinology, could improve lifestyle choices of the general public on the importance of stress management.

Additionally, this advancement of puberty is clearly correlated with up-regulation of hypothalamic kisspeptin signalling and acceleration of luteinising hormone (LH) pulse frequency; the latter the first time demonstrated in the rat. However, ovarian cyclicity and ovulation were disrupted in the immediate post-pubertal period and this continues into adulthood. These data may be of wider significance because of their parallel to the obesogenic phenotype of precocious puberty. We have also demonstrated that the medial (MeA) amygdala, in contrast to the CeA, has an inhibitory influence on pubertal development that is un-related to change in food intake. We have made seminal observations on the role of Kisspeptin, Neurokinin B and Dynorphin (KNDy neuronal) signalling in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus in pubertal timing and revealed the integrative function of these co-expressing neurochemicals in regulation of puberty and stress-induced suppression of the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator, which is the central regulator of reproduction and fertility. With over 12 publications in premier Endocrine and Neuroendocrine journals with at least another 4-5 to follow, plus numerous presentations at scientific conferences around the globe, the output of this research for the scientific and clinical community is significant in terms of enhanced understanding of stress related issues of pubertal development and fertility in general. Although the basic nature of our research makes it difficult for an immediate impact on clinical health policy, there is reason to believe it may add to the body of knowledge that one day will make a difference in this arena. With respect to the lay community, one of my PhD students participated in the Cheltenham Science Festival in 2012 and we occasionally write a brief article for the Kingâ€™s College newsletter that is available to the general public and alumni.
