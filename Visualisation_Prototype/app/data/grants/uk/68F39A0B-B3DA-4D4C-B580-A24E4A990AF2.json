It is clear that we need to manage our agricultural systems more judiciously to yield benefits from ecosystem services, including biodiversity conservation, carbon and nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas regulation, along with food production. Grasslands are thought to be a key system for provision of these ecosystem services due to their large global coverage, but also because of their potential as reservoirs of biodiversity and nutrients. For instance, in the UK grasslands cover 36% of the land surface and already hold 32% of the UK soil carbon stock, and if managed correctly they could store even more. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have identified grassland management as having the greatest potential to sequester additional C if managed correctly, and so grasslands are a key system for climate change mitigation. Here we propose that multiple ecosystem services, such as carbon storage, nutrient retention and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in grassland can be enhanced with management of the diversity and composition of the plant community. The reason for this is that plant species differ greatly in their functional characteristics, or traits, and these differences strongly influence the amount and quality of organic inputs to the soil, which in turn stimulates components of the soil microbial community responsible for soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. Moreover, these differences in traits could change the magnitude and direction of ecosystem services such as from net emission of greenhouse gases, towards mitigation via vegetation management. In this study we will characterise the differing traits of key grassland plant species associated with grassland biodiversity restoration, and test their impact on grassland ecosystem services including emissions of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, soil microbial activity and nutrient cycling and retention. This will provide the first information on the potential for plant diversity to be utilised to manipulate soil nutrient cycling towards greater carbon and nitrogen storage, and lower greenhouse gas emission.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I009000/2","grantId":"BB/I009000/2","fundValue":"507236","fundStart":"2013-02-04","fundEnd":"2017-11-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The research is still ongoing and engagement activities aimed at maximising the use of our findings are planned for the final year of the project.

In light of this we have set up several experiments at a range of scales, from a small, greenhouse mesocosm experiment to a large-scale, long term field study in the Yorkshire Dales. \n\nIn partnership with Natural England, a large-scale field experiment was established in 2012-2014 within the Ingleborough NNR in Yorkshire. The field experiment consists of a plant diversity manipulation, whereby plant functional groups in the MG3b Geranium syvalticum - Anthoxanthum odoratum grassland - a diverse upland hay meadow community - were sown and transplanted into the existing hay meadow. Over five years we aim to determine how different mixtures of plant functional groups affect the soil microbial communities. This year we have continued to sow seed mixtures and transplant plug plants within the treatment plots. We have taken monthly gas flux measurements over the 2014 growing season for CO2 (photosynthesis, respiration and net ecosystem exchange), CH4 and N2O, as well as soil cores for measuring changes to C and N stocks within dissolved and microbial biomass pools. We have carried out vegetation surveys on all plots, which indicate that the plant communities within the plots are now beginning to resemble the functional group treatments intended. Finally, in September we undertook a hay cut on the plots in line with the sites current management plan, and the harvested plant material has been saved for total aboveground biomass, C and N measures.\n\nAlso in partnership with Natural England, we set up a mesocosm experiment at Colt Park, within the Ingleborough NNR, with the aim to quantifying differences in plant traits between 27 grassland plant species, and how these correspond to changes in nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas fluxes. Having established the mesocosms in 2013, this year we have taken monthly gas flux measurements over the growing season using static chambers for CO2, CH4 and N2O, as well as soil cores for measuring changes to C and N stocks within dissolved and microbial biomass pools. Next year we intend to continue with greenhouse gas measurements, and in June we will carry out stable isotope labelling before harvesting plant material for plant trait assessment, including metabolomic profiling on shoot material. We will also harvest soil samples to assess C and N stocks and to examine differences in the soil microbial communities via metagenomic profiling, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nIn early 2014 we set up a greenhouse mesocosm experiment in Manchester with the aim of exploring how plant communities of low and high trait diversity respond to changes in soil depth under ambient and drought conditions, and the effect that these changes have on the soil microbial community and C and N cycling. CO2 measurements were taken on a weekly basis throughout February - May and analysed using a PP systems EGM4 portable IRGA coupled to a customized chamber lid. In June mesocosms were harvested, and soil and plant material was analysed for plant and microbial community structure, and C and N stocks. Data analysis is still on-going. Our findings will be of direct relevance to land managers, famers and policy makers with interests in managing grasslands for ecosystem services. Given that the experiments are not finished, we have not yet realised this potential. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
