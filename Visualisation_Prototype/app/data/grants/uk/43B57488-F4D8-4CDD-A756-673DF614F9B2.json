{"id":"43B57488-F4D8-4CDD-A756-673DF614F9B2","title":"The E-tech element potential of submarine ferromanganese crusts","abstractText":"High concentrations of technologically critical elements (such as Te, cobalt, REEs, Nb, Pt, W, Bi, Ni, Mn &amp; Ti) occur throughout the global ocean basins where they are incorporated into thick crusts of ferromanganese oxide (otherwise known as Fe-Mn crusts). These crusts have attracted particularly interest because they are very rich in rare elements such as cobalt, tellurium and selenium. These elements are in short supply but they are critical to emerging new technologies including renewable energy and the 'green' economy. Recent estimates of the potential global tonnage of these metal rich crusts suggest about 200 billion tonnes exists on the seafloor. International interest is growing with China and Japan applying for mining licenses from the United Nations International Seabed Authority. Hence the need to address concerns about the sustainability of these crusts as a resource and their potential environmental impacts if exploited.\n\nThis proposal aims to establish a consortium of geological, biological and oceanographic researchers and industry specialists that will identify what processes control the formation, distribution, abundance and concentration of metal-rich crusts on the deep seafloor. By bringing together a team of specialists, we will also address technical issues surrounding the exploration of these crusts and environmental issues related to their exploitation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L002353/1","grantId":"NE/L002353/1","fundValue":"50704","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Bramley James Murton","coPersons":["Alan John Evans","Rosemary Anne Edwards","Paul  Lusty"],"organisation":"National Oceanography Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
