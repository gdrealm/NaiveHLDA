{"id":"ADE7E0A3-BE03-40A9-A6BA-FFE0D6059341","title":"Superspreading: self-organization on nano-scale","abstractText":"The mechanism(s) underlying the phenomenon of superspreading is somewhat mysterious and an investigation of it using a set of new and comprehensive experiments is proposed. The results will be used to formulate new physical and mathematical modelling of the process. The investigation will include studies of the self-organization on nano-scale of superspreaders at the liquid / air and solid - liquid interfaces, and nano-scale forces in thin layers, and their influence on superspreading behaviour. Using independent experiments (Fourier Transform Infra-red Spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy) the nano-scale forces will be directly measured and their influence will be incorporated into the theoretical modelling. The latter leads to predicting the way of synthesis of new superspreaders with desirable properties. The proposed research is an International effort with Professor Ramon Rubio (Universdad Complutense, Madrid, Spain) and Dr Randal Hill (DowCorning, USA).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D077869/1","grantId":"EP/D077869/1","fundValue":"347839","fundStart":"2007-06-20","fundEnd":"2010-12-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The finding have been cited, publications have been downloaded widely.

Two stages of spreading were found: the fast first stage. Duration of this stage is well correlated with adsorption kinetics on liquid-air interface and the slow second stage where the spreading is determined by a transfer of surfactant molecules onto the bare hydrophobic substrate in front of the moving three phase contact line (autophilic phenomenon). The presence of this stage was directly confirmed by our American colleagues (S Garoff&acute;s group, Carnegie Mellon, University). A new method to determine two critical concentrations was suggested. It was proven by earlier researchers that there is a contradiction in the superspreading phenomenon: it is not enough surfactant on the liquid -air interface to support the very fast spreading. This contradiction was resolved:&quot;storage&quot; of trisiloxane molecules was discovered, which is a denser phase on the liquid-air interface. This denser phase does not change the interfacial tension but serves as a reservoir of trisiloxane molecules, which allows the very fast spreading (superspreading). At the moment the mystery of superspreading is resolved. The reasearch outcomes are already in use but details can not be disclosed because of a confineniality ahreement. The obtained reasearch outcomes can be used in agrochemical industry, personal care products, wastwater treatment, electronic industry. Further details can not be disclosed because of a confidentiality agreement. Chemicals,Electronics,Environment,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
