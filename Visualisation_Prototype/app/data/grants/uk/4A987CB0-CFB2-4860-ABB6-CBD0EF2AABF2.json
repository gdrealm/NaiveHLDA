Overall, the research contributes to ongoing inter-disciplinary debates on the future of work and socially-sustainable regional competitiveness and is being undertaken in consultation with the following end-users in the policy community: TUC, Amicus, and the East of England Development Agency; and in Ireland: the Work-Life Balance Network, and Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1574","grantId":"RES-000-22-1574","fundValue":"3394","fundStart":"2006-04-25","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  James","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
