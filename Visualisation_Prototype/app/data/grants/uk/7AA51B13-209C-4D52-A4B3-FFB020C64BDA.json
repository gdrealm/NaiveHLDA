The reason why these drugs work, clinically, is unknown. Our basic science points to an action on pH changes in the computational part of nerve cells in the brain. Our current evidence not only provides an explanation as to why these drugs work, but also suggests that a major part of nerve cell function is being ignored by the neuroscience community. Our work is aimed at understanding better the role of neuronal pH changes in normal nerve function. We can then compare these changes with those seen in either patients with carbonic anhydrase sensitive disorders or in animal models of similar diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400614","grantId":"G0400614","fundValue":"296853","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christof  Schwiening","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
