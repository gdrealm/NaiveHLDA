{"id":"8A98C883-02B5-411C-8D84-861D368EC63F","title":"North Indian Literary Culture (1450-1650)","abstractText":"Early modem north India was a multilingual society, with literary production in both cosmopolitan languages and vernaculars. Yet literatures in the various languages have been studied entirely separately. This project will study &quot;literary culture&quot; taking into account multilingualism and the range of literary tastes and patronage, in a period of political transition when vernacular literature flourished. It will analyse a select corpus of literary, biographical and historical texts in Persian and the vernaculars, investigate evidence of interaction (bilingual texts, translations) and highlight the role of north Indian music in bringing together Indo-Muslim elites and local traditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119154/2","grantId":"119154/2","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Francesca  Orsini","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Oriental & African Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
