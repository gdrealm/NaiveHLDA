However, any assessment of these expected health gains and costs will be uncertain, particularly if the technology is new and has not been widely used in the NHS. In these circumstances further research would be able to confirm whether or not the technology is worthwhile, leading to better decisions for future patients. There will be circumstances in which this research can be conducted while the technology is in wide spread use but in others the type of research which is needed may only be possible before the technology is approved and made available. This research intends to establish the principles of what assessments need to be made to guide the decisions about whether a technology should only be approved for use in research or when approval can be granted while additional evidence is gathered. It will also examine how these assessments should be made. For example they could be made based on a set of criteria applied to the type of information and analysis currently considered by NICE in their appraisal process or could be based on additional information and analysis that could be conducted and made available. This research will include an examination of past decisions made by NICE as well as a series of more detailed case studies. The results of this research will be presented at a series of workshop which will include representative of those who have an interest in and responsibility for different aspects of the appraisal of health technologies. These workshops will make recommendations about what assessments are needed and how they should be made.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802659","grantId":"G0802659","fundValue":"186556","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Karl Phillip Claxton","coPersons":["Stephen  Palmer","Louise  Longworth"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
