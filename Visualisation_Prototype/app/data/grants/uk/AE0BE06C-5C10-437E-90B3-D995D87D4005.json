These grains formed at over 4,500 million years ago in small protoplanetary bodies as they heated up shortly after accretion, mobilising ice and other fluids. As such these grains record some of the earliest stages of planetary alteration in the solar system, recording the timescales of these early events and the conditions and possible origin of the fluids.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M00421X/1","grantId":"ST/M00421X/1","fundValue":"13669","fundStart":"2014-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Franchi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
