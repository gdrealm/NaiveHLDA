{"id":"27698946-6BBA-4C85-9860-F09D6BE49BDB","title":"Imagination and the Imaginary","abstractText":"This work is exploring the workings of the Imagination , in order to make clear the link between imagination, desire and emotion. It is looking for an account which makes evident the commonalities in the way imagination works in perception, agency and artistic creation. It aims to do this by linking the philosophical account of the imagination, conceived of as some kind of faculty, perhaps that of creating inner or outer images, with the concept of the Imaginary as it is found in psychoanalytic thought. There the Imaginary is, broadly speaking, the domain of affect,(emotion). Philosophers writing on the imagination have emphasised the close link between imagination and desire and emotion, but have not provided an account which made this link other than contingent Reworking the notion of the imagination to include aspects usually theorised in contemporary writing under the concept of the 'imaginary', places affect at the centre of our imaginative faculty. \n\nThe account of the imagination which is offered here weaves together the role of imagination in perception and agency with its role in artistic creation .The central idea informing this account is of the imagination as form giving ; the form captured, sometimes misleadingly, in the concept of an image. What is crucial here, however, and provided by the integration of the concept of imagination with that of the Imaginary, is that the image or form is the bearer of emotional significance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E50521X/1","grantId":"AH/E50521X/1","fundValue":"33148","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kathleen  Lennon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
