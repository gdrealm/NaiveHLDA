Thus, electromagnetic safety is a major issue in the design, operation and public acceptance of such systems. The EU has recently published limits for electromagnetic field exposure, but they do not readily apply to resonant environments such as vehicles and buildings. Also, the field distributions that arise in these structures are so complex that reliable assessment of the exposure by measurement is not practicable. This proposal therefore concerns the development and experimental validation of large-scale simulation methods to assess the characteristics of fields due to radio transmissions in such environments. Model content, analysis methods, efficient simulation strategies and field mitigation techniques will be addressed, using car and aircraft based case studies. This application is part of a DTI Technology Programme submission.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D033187/1","grantId":"EP/D033187/1","fundValue":"351627","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Findings used to generate EU research grants and standards Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Transport Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"R J Langley","coPersons":["J  Rigelsford"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" We have examined electromagnetic field exposures inside vehicles and concluded that even in the most demanding environments such fields are within safety guidelines.
