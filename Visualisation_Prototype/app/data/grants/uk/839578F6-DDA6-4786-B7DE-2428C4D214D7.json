Potato blight causes ~&pound;2 billion annual losses to potato crops, globally. Current BBSRC funding supports isolation of resistance genes that will be deployed to enhance blight control. Flavonoids are health-promoting natural antioxidants, but potatoes - though a major dietary component - contain only low levels. Flavonoids can be elevated substantially using transcription factors identified at the John Innes Centre through BBSRC funding. We propose to use 'cis-genic, non-GM' technology to produce potato lines that combine late blight resistance with enhanced flavonoid content and nutritional/health value using constructs crafted only from potato DNA. These improved potato lines will form the basis of a new spin-out company from the Sainsbury Lab and John Innes Centre, to exploit the global potential of varieties with novel traits produced using cis-genic technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E52718X/1","grantId":"BB/E52718X/1","fundValue":"112179","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  the company Norfolk Plant Sciences has been set up to exploit understanding of genes that regulate flavonoid biosynthesis.
