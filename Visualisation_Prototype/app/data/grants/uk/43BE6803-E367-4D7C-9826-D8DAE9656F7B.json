{"id":"43BE6803-E367-4D7C-9826-D8DAE9656F7B","title":"Communication, language and power in the Achaemenid Empire: the correspondence of the satrap Arshama","abstractText":"The Achaemenid Persian Empire (550-330 BC) was the largest state-formation in Europe or Western Asia before the Roman Empire and at greatest extent stretched from Greece to western India and from Central Asia to the northern Sudan. Multi- and cross-disciplinary study of its history through written and material evidence from a great variety of cultural settings has developed remarkably since the late 1970s (characteristically through collaborative enterprises) and it is this that provides the network's over-arching academic context: its root purpose is to advance understanding of Persian imperial culture.\\n\\nThe network plan starts from 34 documents (33 in Aramaic, one in Egyptian demotic) either written by Arshama or his officials or addressed to him or alluding to his official activities. 26 form a single archive from an unknown Egyptian site, 7 come from a Jewish archive at Elephantine and one from Saqqara. The specific aim is to use the documents as the focus for (a) investigating how the Persian imperial state ruled and exploited its subjects and (b) drawing scholars from several UK HEIs into a conscious Achaemenid Studies network. The documents fit the purpose perfectly since \\n- they provide primary evidence from the heart of the imperial bureaucracy and the entourage of one its most powerful figures\\n- they have never received in their own right the systematic historical and linguistic study they deserve\\n- as (predominantly) Semitic documents from the circle of an Iranian governor in Egypt (the empire's second-wealthiest province and a region with an exceptional cultural and historical identity) their study is of interest to and requires the expertise of a wide range of philological and historical specialisms\\n\\nWe shall pursue this aim by four means\\n\\nClose reading of texts. 24 sessions in Oxford will provide a basic introduction to Achaemenid Aramaic and the opportunity to read through the documents in detail. The actual parchments will be available for examination.\\nObjectives\\n- acquisition of language skills and an ability to engage with the linguistic aspect of problems in historical interpretation\\n- new readings of parts of documents that survive in damaged or fragmentary form\\n- informed contribution to workshops and conference \\n\\nWorkshops and conference. 5 workshops will address major issues in Achaemenid history for which the Arshama documents provide one (but characteristically only one) of the important bodies of evidence. A conference will draw together conclusions reached, and new problems identified, in the workshops and be an opportunity to present projects results to an academic audience beyond the network's core participants. Both workshops and conference will benefit from the participation of major non-UK scholars in the field. \\nObjectives\\n- fuller understanding of the correspondence as an archive associated with a particular office-holder\\n- better location of the correspondence in the context of other types of bureaucratic document from other imperial regions\\n- sharper sense of the relationship between imperial masters and their subjects\\n- new perspectives on many issues of governmental procedure and ideology \\n\\nExhibition. An exhibition of original documents and associated material from the Bodleian dovetailing with an 'Arshama trail' in the Ashmolean. There will be an annotated catalogue and an accompanying public lecture.\\nObjectives\\n- to publicize the Arshama material and its implications\\n- to provide (in the catalogue) a resource for outreach activities\\n\\nPublication. Research results will be disseminated in two forms: a large multi-author volume (containing texts, commentary and thematic papers) and an Oxford-hosted web-site (texts, photographs, basic annotation). \\nObjectives\\n- dissemination of new data and ideas to the relevant academic community\\n- provision of a reference point for further research on Achaemenid Egypt and on other regions or aspects of the empire.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H033866/1","grantId":"AH/H033866/1","fundValue":"32144","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  One of the most important aims of the project was to provide linguistic training in Aramaic, a general sort of &amp;amp;quot;Achaimenid cultural awareness&amp;amp;quot; for Classicists, and a contact with advanced research in Achaimenid and Ancient Near-Eastern history. Anecdotal evidence is that this particular training has borne its fruits, in enriching the way senior and younger classicists do their work on ancient history, in teaching and research. \n\nThe second aim was to enliven direct, technologically sophisticated work on a particular type of evidence for the Achaimenid empire, namely the material remains which both tell us about empire and, in a way, embody empire-- in the case of the Arshama archive, the very parchment letters, the sealings and the bags. Lindsay Allen (KCL) has pursued her work on the association between the sealings and the letters; in the aftermath of work promoted by the research project, Mark Garrison (Trinity University) has identified another exemplar of Arshama's sealing-- in a much earlier context, the Persepolis Fortification Archive which confirms that the seal, when used in the late fifth century, was an heirloom; the Bodleian Library has continued close work on the Arshama material, notably located an box of unpublished fragments, and preparing an application to have this material examined with x-ray spectroscopy .

The first is a set of detailled findings, which are important for the scholarly and philological aspect of the Arshama latters; the second is a set of general historical insights, of importance for our understanding of the Achaimenid empire and empires in general. \n\n\n\nA.. Detailed findings. \n\nThe project generated a number of detailed findings involving the documents in the Arshama archive. The constant reading of the letters, in interdisciplinary sessions involving scholars with overlapping specialties in ancient history, Akkadian, Iranian languages, and Aramaic, generated a stream of corrections or alternative interpretations in the text of the very well known and important letters of Arshama. The examination of the material objects in the archive generated findings on the association between letters and sealings, and the storage methods for this archival dossier (the Bodleian has two, not one leather bag). Finally, the extremely high quality of all the objects was emphasized by all participants who handled the material, in repeated seminar-like meetings before the objects. \n\nB. General findings\n\nThe general points are of great importance for the study of empires. First, the crucial importance of the relationship between &amp;amp;quot;public&amp;amp;quot; (the realm of imperial power and administration) and &amp;amp;quot;private&amp;amp;quot; (the realm of estate administration and profit). The distinction does exist, but is blurred, especially in the case of the Achaimenid super-elite, the &amp;amp;quot;sons of the house&amp;amp;quot; which belong to the ruling dynasty. More generally, the theme of the economic self-interest by the imperial elites within the Achaimenid empire appeared in sharp relief throughout the discussions. \n\nThe second cluster of findings concerned Achaimenid Egypt. The nature of control (with thinly distributed means, concentrated in case of crisis) was very vividly understood from the information in the Arshama archive; and, equally important, the seriousness of revolt in Achaimenid Egypt (a finding which has consequences in challenging the current orthodoxy about the Achaimenid empire). Finally, the multi-cultural nature of the presence of empire in Achaimenid Egypt was also commented on, notably by G. Vittmann, the specialist in Demotic who participated in the project. \n\nAll these findings about Achaimenid Egypt also threw light on the general structure of empire and administration: military control, diversity of administrative personnel, and most importantly, the importance of language and communication in mediating and structuring empire. Our findings are of interest to the general public, because they illuminate how multi-cultural empires work-- with a combination of collusion, force, and economic exploitation-- in the context of the ancient Near-East.\n\n\n\nThey also show how complex historical problems can be shown to the public, with a combination of exhibition and web presence.
