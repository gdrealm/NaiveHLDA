{"id":"8991808D-8346-4910-81DC-24341D0DC834","title":"Groundwater Futures in Sub-Saharan Africa","abstractText":"Groundwater Futures in Sub-Saharan Africa (GroFutures) will develop the scientific evidence and inclusive groundwater management processes by which groundwater resources can be used sustainably for poverty alleviation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It will improve understanding of the volume and renewability of groundwater in SSA, and develop robust models and tools to forecast available groundwater resources under changing climate, land-use and demand scenarios, including expansion of arable land under irrigation. GroFutures will examine current groundwater governance processes and identify pathways toward more sustainable and equitable use of groundwater resources that are reconciled to projections of changing demand and resource availability. It will assemble an international consortium of scientists with an unmatched track record of groundwater research and stakeholder engagement in SSA that both leverages substantial additional investment (&pound;461,000) and engages with research and development communities across Anglophone and Francophone Africa. GroFutures will also establish a Network of African Groundwater Observatories that representing the primary groundwater environments and development governance challenges in SSA that features a new dataset of 25 records of groundwater-level observations that are 2 to 6 decades duration from across SSA enabling the most rigorous analysis of the relationships among climate, land-use and groundwater recharge that has ever been conducted in the tropics. Dedicated basin observatories will be constructed that will enable very detailed monitoring of the physical process by which groundwater is replenished and application of a new method for quantifying the volume of groundwater in African aquifers thereby overcoming fundamental limitations in present knowledge of groundwater in SSA. GroFutures will also employ an innovative and participatory approach to the management of groundwater which will enable for explicit consideration ofthe views of poor people in making decisions over the allocation and development of groundwater resources.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M008576/1","grantId":"NE/M008576/1","fundValue":"255357","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2019-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Guillaume  FAVREAU","coPersons":["YAHAYA  NAZOUMOU","Ouassa  Tiekoura","IBRAHIM BABA GONI","Jean-Michel  Vouillamoz","Benjamin  Ngounou Ngatcha"],"organisation":"Institute of Research for Development","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
