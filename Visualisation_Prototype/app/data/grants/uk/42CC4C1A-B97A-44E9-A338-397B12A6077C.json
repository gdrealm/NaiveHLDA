EMSIRDecMo will develop and integrate a robust DECISION TOOL for predicting the outcomes of a wide spectrum of energy-related building\nretrofit actions (key outcome 1). The tool will also assess actual outturns against target, supporting early corrective action. Real-time data provided by the existing cloud-based EnerGenius Energy Management System ('EMS') includes minute-byminute gas, electricity, electrical circuit, oil consumption/tank level, temperature and relative humidity. EnerGenius features an excellent User Interface ('UI'), which will now evolve its landlord-centric modules. Initially focused on social landlords, the decision tool will use iterative outcome-based parameterisation overlaid on laboratory-derived data.\n\nEMSIRDecMo will also derive a TEMPERATURE DECAY RATE for a property; an outcome-based indicator of overall insulation effectiveness: a key statistic for both landlord and occupant (key outcome 2). \n\nFinally, existing sophisticated EnerGenius user control features will be enhanced to support both local and remote DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT (DSM) tools to reduce energy costs and improve grid performance (key outcome 3). These DSM tools will use aggregated domestic electrical loads, particularly electrical domestic water heating, to develop income streams from Transport System Operators (TSOs). Load shifting and frequency management will represent distinct revenue streams.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M506709/1","grantId":"EP/M506709/1","fundValue":"156862","fundStart":"2014-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sreejith  Nanukuttan","coPersons":["Muhammed  Basheer"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
