However, copying others may not always result in optimum behaviour. If all individuals in a population copy those around them then no individual is sampling the environment and establishing whether another behaviour would be more productive; thus, copying alone produces a population which becomes 'stuck'. For behaviours to become more effective an individual must step outside the status quo and make a change to current practice; s/he must innovate.</p>\n\n<p>This series of studies investigates changes in young childrenâ€™s reliance on social learning and/or personal learning (innovation), using an artificial fruit paradigm in which children are presented with a puzzle box containing a reward, with some participants having witnessed a model extract the reward from the box, while others must attempt this with no demonstration. A multidimensional approach is taken, investigating the full context of the learning situation, including the characteristics a child brings to a task (eg age, gender, cognitive and social skills), the role of a model's characteristics (eg, their reported expertise, the number of models), and the role of contextual factors (eg, task difficulty, social pressure).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021385/1","grantId":"ES/J021385/1","fundValue":"204159","fundStart":"2012-09-29","fundEnd":"2016-03-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emma Grace Flynn","coPersons":["Luc-Alain  Giraldeau"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
