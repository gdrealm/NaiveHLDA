{"id":"9BCC1E39-2B26-4AB1-9E4D-0EE401CCE741","title":"Grant in Aid of Supporting the 6th UK Technological Plasma Workshop","abstractText":"Plasma physics and engineering is an interdisciplinary field that have over many decades enabled some of the most exciting science and contributed to major industrial innovations. Its continued growth can only be sustained when more and more young researchers choose plasma science as the field of their future career. In the UK, this has in part been fostered through the successful series of Technological Plasma workshops (TPW). To further this strategic effort of the UK technological plasma community, we request aid in funding of the next TPW in Milton Keynes hosted by the Open University and the University of Oxford.The next TPW will be anchored with four plenary talks given by leading international plasma scientists as well as talks by plasma technologists in Industry. These will be supplemented with several contributed talks so as to engage young scientists in the most exciting and current challenges facing the technological plasma science and their industrial and medical applications. Through the provision of subsistence costs, the workshop will aim specifically at promoting young researchers' participation and contribution in the form of oral and poster presentations. It will also be used to showcase the UK technological plasma science to attract overseas attendees. Furthermore, key industrial needs will be raised and discussed, together with discussions on current plasma research programmes, UK networks and sources of funding which can be used to address these needs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G031312/1","grantId":"EP/G031312/1","fundValue":"5851","fundStart":"2008-11-11","fundEnd":"2009-05-10","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research meeting was successful and the structure and organisation was passed on to future hosts.
