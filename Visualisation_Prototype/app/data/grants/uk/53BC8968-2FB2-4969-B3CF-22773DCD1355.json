The human genome sequence was completed at the start of the millennium; this resulted in significant public and scientific interest in understanding the DNA sequence 'code' and how it is 'translated'. The sequence of the genome provides information about our ancestry, hereditary diseases, our features (such as eye, skin or hair colour) and our physiological 'make-up'. In order to truly understand the genome sequence it would be desirable to have simpler DNA sequencing methods so that many more genomes could be sequenced. Currently, methods require expensive reagents, are laborious and take a long time. Despite the fact that the human genome was sequenced a decade ago and better DNA sequencing methods have been since developed, a simple, cheap, fast, accurate DNA sequencing method is still an important goal. In our view, what is needed is a small scale technology, something that works like a hard disk drive, where a tiny read head is scanned past the stored information (the DNA strand) and the information (the sequence) is read directly without need for any complex processing of the genomic DNA molecule. We propose to flow DNA molecules through a nanopore that will act as a 'read head' and detect and identify the nucleic acids in the DNA sequence by their response to laser excitation. Identifying the DNA base sequence in this way will be highly ac curate, and capable of detecting damage or modification to particular bases from environmental or cellular processes which can control the switching on and off of genes. DNA sequencing techniques are crucial to obtain a better understand of all organisms, not just humans, and a fast, cheap DNA sequencing method will be able to answer many more questions as well as also provide a diagnostic tool. These studies will provide proof of concept data appropriate to demonstrate a very new DNA sequencing approach.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I023720/1","grantId":"BB/I023720/1","fundValue":"117976","fundStart":"2011-11-21","fundEnd":"2012-11-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tracy  Melvin","coPersons":["William S.

Two different three-dimensional gold nanoporous structures. The silicon Klarite samples were provided by Renishaw Diagnoitics and used to produce 100nm thick, three-dimensional gold films. Subsequent milling using a helium ion microscope provided a 50nm hole. The structure and hole size was chosen based upon theoretical studies performed in a new collaboration with Dr Martin Charlton and his PhD student, Swe Zin. These results were disseminated by the post-doctoral researcher appointed to the grant in Dr Melvin's lab.\n\nii) Direct detection of the nucleic acid bases by SERS approaches using the 3D gold structures. Substrate fabrication was optimised to provide direct detection by SERS of the nucleic acid bases within DNA sequences, this detection limit had only previously been observed for nanoparticles.
