We will look at whether religion, household mobility and ethnic diversity in the area is linked to individuals' honesty, and whether parents' and children's honesty is correlated. We will also see whether dishonesty in the experiment is linked to future unemployment and crime. The second experiment will take place in a school. We will see whether children's honesty is affected by their peer group behaviour, and whether honesty makes children more or less popular over time.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009214/1","grantId":"ES/K009214/1","fundValue":"230378","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2015-01-06","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Hugh-Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
