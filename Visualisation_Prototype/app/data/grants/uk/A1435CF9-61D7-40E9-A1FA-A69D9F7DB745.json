That is, women may have a harder job than men to be effective through their talk: to be listened to, included in key decisions, taken seriously, and to influence the views of others effectively. This study will take a linguistic perspective on this issue of female under-representation by exploring the significance of talk in senior management meetings. </p>\n\n<p>The way senior people speak in meetings is critical to their sense of professional identity, relationships with colleagues, achieving effective and influential leadership, and ultimately productivity for their businesses. This will be the first detailed study of the subject in the UK, seeking to be much more specific about what constitutes 'effective' and 'less effective' interactions within business meeting settings, and whether 'effectiveness' is related to gender. This ethnographic study of real meetings will make use of observation, interviews and documentary analysis. The study could also help to heighten awareness and change practices in business meetings so that both men and women feel that they are playing a really effective role as business leaders. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G035008/1","grantId":"ES/G035008/1","fundValue":"67933","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith Anne Baxter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
