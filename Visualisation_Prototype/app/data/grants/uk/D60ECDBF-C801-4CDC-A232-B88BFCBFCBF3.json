Misunderstandings about sexuality can cause distress and vulnerability. Families may play a more significant role in supporting the sexual development of their children with intellectual disabilities but there has been little research concerning parents' perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The proposed study will compare mothers' attitudes and experience of dealing with the sexual development of their offspring, aged between 16 and 21 years of age, with and without intellectual disabilities. The first phase of the research will be a qualitative investigation of mothers who have a child with an intellectual disability and a similarly aged same sex sibling without a disability. Semi-structured interviews will be used to explore the similarities and differences of dealing with the needs of their two offspring. A survey will be used in the second phase of the study, where the views of (30) mothers of young people with intellectual disabilities and a second group of (30) mothers of non-disabled young people will be compared. It is hoped that the insight into mothers' views will help with the provision of sensitive support to families, and help schools, colleges and health professionals to work more effectively in partnership with them.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3124","grantId":"RES-000-22-3124","fundValue":"80853","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Gerald Jahoda","coPersons":["Richard  Hastings"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
