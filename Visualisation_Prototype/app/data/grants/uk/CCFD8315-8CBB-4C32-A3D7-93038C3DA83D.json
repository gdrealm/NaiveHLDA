{"id":"CCFD8315-8CBB-4C32-A3D7-93038C3DA83D","title":"Measuring complex outcomes of environment and development interventions","abstractText":"<p>Investments to promote desired environment-development outcomes are some of the hardest to assess, because the causes of environmental resource scarcity are complex, and affect multiple aspects of human wellbeing, not just income. Credible evaluations of the impacts of these programmes on human wellbeing are few, offering little evidence to inform decision-makers about what works, for whom, and why. This project has three parts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>a methodological research component, that focuses on how to measure the multiple development impacts of environment-development interventions on the poor</li>\n\n <li>a field research component, that will test the different methodological approaches with developing country researchers to specifically evaluate two field interventions focused on Payments for Ecosystem Services (one in Africa and one in Asia) under different social, ecological and political conditions</li>\n\n <li>a practical component, which will use the results of the research to directly inform how environment-development projects are implemented in the field, building upon the consortium's networks of partners and programmes.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Reseach results will directly impact how current environment-development policies are implemented, and will inform the design of future initiatives.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J018155/1","grantId":"ES/J018155/1","fundValue":"463194","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Wilkie","coPersons":["Katherine Mary Homewood","Eleanor  Milner-Gulland"],"organisation":"Wildlife Conservation Society","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
