This has come to light after the discovery of a whole new class of genes which, unlike most genes, do not produce proteins. Instead they make very small RNA molecules, called microRNAs. There are at least 800 microRNAs within the human genome which have different effects. They work by binding to the messenger RNA of other genes and inhibiting the production of the proteins made from these genes a process known as translation. Each of these 800 small molecules is believed to interact with 100 other genes, thus adding to the complex regulation of the human genome. Already it has become clear that malfunction of miRNA regulation is associated with a growing list of human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and viral infections. Other methods of regulating expression of genes at the level of translation also exist, and little is known about how these methods interact with miRNA regulation. This study will analyse the interaction between miRNAs and other control elements in regulating specific genes. It will also look for changes in this regulation that occur when cells are stressed, as many changes in translation occur under these conditions. This study will lead to a greater understanding of how gene expression is controlled and the complexity of the human genome.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F019017/2","grantId":"BB/F019017/2","fundValue":"106429","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Only for basic understand research application so far Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology ","person":"Martin David Bushell","coPersons":["Anne Elizabeth Willis"],"organisation":"MRC Toxicology Unit","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
