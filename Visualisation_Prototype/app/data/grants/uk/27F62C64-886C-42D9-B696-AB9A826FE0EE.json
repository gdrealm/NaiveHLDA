{"id":"27F62C64-886C-42D9-B696-AB9A826FE0EE","title":"Where Rising Powers Meet: China and Russia At Their North Asian Border","abstractText":"<p>The ‘Where Rising Powers Meet’ project aims to investigate what the Russian-Chinese border can reveal about the differing political economies of the two countries and their trajectories in the post-1991 era. Since each state exercises full sovereignty right up to their mutual border, there is no better place to compare the two remarkably dissimilar ways that economic development, the rule of law, citizen rights, migration, and inequality are managed. Yet state policies encounter volatile, more or less independent activities across this border. An important question the project will address is: how stable is this situation and what do the trends visible today indicate about the future of the two ‘rising powers’?</p>\n\n<p>This project, based at Cambridge but working in collaboration with colleagues in China, Russia, Mongolia, France and Denmark, is both multidisciplinary and multi-sited. The research team, composed of anthropologists, sociologists and economists, will be carrying out research at various sites along the border, from Mongolia in the west to Vladivostok in the east. The project has obtained the ethical approval of the University of Cambridge.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J012335/1","grantId":"ES/J012335/1","fundValue":"506297","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We are just entering the 3rd year of this project. We have many publications, but they are all recent and we anticipate that the impact will become evident soon. \nOur project has elicited interest in China, Japan, and Russia, and publications are forthcoming in these countries / languages. Our colleagues in the Chinese Academy of Sciences have invited us to participate in events they organise and they advise the Chinese government on border policy.

We have contributed to anthropological theory on the concept of borders. We have gained a deeper understanding of the differences between Russian and Chinese societies, and of the changing nature of the relations between the two countries. Regional specialists rarely know about both sides of this border. We are providing a fuller, more comprehensive picture in the context of a changing geo-political balance between Russia and China, environmental problems, new and evolving trade &amp; transport links, and migration policies.
