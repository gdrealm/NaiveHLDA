We do this by connecting the field of Live Coding, with that of the mathematics of weaves, realising a wide range of impacts including in education, public understanding of the basis of mathematics in craft, and music technology.\n\nWhat are the historical and theoretical points at which the practice of weaving and computer programming connect? What insights can be gained if we bring these activities together, through live shared experience? How do digital technologies influence our ways of making, and what new digital technologies can we create to explore their social use in creative collaboration?\n\nOur research challenge is to unravel industrial and contemporary technological developments in weaving and computer programming, in order to expose and challenge assumptions, and make the Human processes involved visible. In particular, to explore and communicate the nature of mathematical thinking in ancient weaving, and creative thinking in contemporary computer programming, bringing key contributions to discussion of making in the humanities.\n\nOur team will take a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach, combining theoretical and technological developments with historical investigation and participatory action research in developing and exploring all of the above. Through this work, live coding research will be grounded in craft and developed in new social and pedagogic contexts, and research into the mathematics of weaving will be developed with key impacts realised in public understanding of ancient technologies.\n\nLive coding is a creative approach to computer programming, which with the support of AHRC Digital Transformations research development funds, has in recent years become an established field in music technology research. By making the act of computer programming more public, live coders have been able to demonstrate how code can be worked creatively, as a kind of meta-material. This is typically put into practice for live music performance, where programmers are on stage, coding music live for an audience, in concert halls, or possibly in night clubs to an audience who are dancing to algorithms. The programmers' screens are generally projected, so that the audience is able to see the programmer actively defining musical patterns and sounds, while they hear the results.\n\nThe work of Ellen Harlizius-Kl&uuml;ck approaches the difficult task of making some of the internal mathematical processes required for weaving on hand looms visible. Weaving can easily be dismissed as a manual, boring task but in practice using ancient looms is a difficult task with high cognitive load. Indeed, Harlizius-Kl&uuml;ck has uncovered that the development of mathematics in ancient Greece frequently relied upon weaving metaphors. A further echo of this relation can be seen in the influence of the Jacquard Loom in the mechanical computers of Charles Babbage, and the metaphors drawn by his collaborator Ada Lovelace.\n\nBy connecting live coding with weaving we have the opportunity to explore how mathematical thinking can be exposed in activities which are generally thought of as solitary. We will explore this notion by creating a programming language designed for describing the complex patterned structures of woven threads, and using it to drive computer-controlled looms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M002403/1","grantId":"AH/M002403/1","fundValue":"64750","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alex  McLean","coPersons":["Kia  Ng"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
