The scarring impairs liver function. The ultimate treatment of liver fibrosis is transplantation. Unfortunately this is limited due to the high numbers of people in need of a transplant. For this reason, identifying effective anti-fibrotic treatments at early stages of disease would be hugely beneficial. To achieve this better understanding of how the scar forms is needed. Although progress has been made in this area, unfortunately there are still no approved anti fibrotic treatments. To tackle this problem, I have identified SOX9 as a core factor responsible for mediating large components of scar formation. It is now essential to determine whether loss of SOX9 can be used as a means of reversing scar formation and ultimately fibrosis in the liver. This project will develop models to test whether loss of Sox9 prevents or ameliorates liver fibrosis and if over-expression of Sox9 worsens or accelerates the disease. In addition, I will discover what other genes lie downstream of SOX9 and integrate these with known signalling pathways important in liver fibrosis to uncover new targets and potential for therapies against liver fibrosis.\nTaken together, these experiments are anticipated to prove an important role for Sox9 in organ fibrosis and assist in identifying new pathways of value in the search for new therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J003352/1","grantId":"MR/J003352/1","fundValue":"453427","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Piper Hanley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
