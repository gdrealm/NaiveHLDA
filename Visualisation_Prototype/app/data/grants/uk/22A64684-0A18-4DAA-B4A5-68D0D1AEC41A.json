{"id":"22A64684-0A18-4DAA-B4A5-68D0D1AEC41A","title":"Preoperative evaluation of bone quality for dental implant therapy using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy","abstractText":"The success of a tooth implant depends on the quality and structure of the jaw bone. Current bone evaluation methods are expensive, time consuming, have limited availability and can risk exposing the patient to harmful radiation. A possible, novel, approach to this problem would be the use of a laser-based analytical technology known as LIBS to determine whether implant treatment would be suitable for a particular patient. LIBS is a rapidly emerging technique and is successfully employed in tissue analysis and by forensic laboratories. The technique is relatively inexpensive and offers rapid in-situ measurements and diagnosis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802650","grantId":"G0802650","fundValue":"94169","fundStart":"2009-07-15","fundEnd":"2010-07-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Dennis Pilkington","coPersons":["Gillian  Croft"],"organisation":"University of Salford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
