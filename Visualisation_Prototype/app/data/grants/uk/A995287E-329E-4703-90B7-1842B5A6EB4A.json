{"id":"A995287E-329E-4703-90B7-1842B5A6EB4A","title":"The Fuelling of Star Formation in Primordial Galaxies","abstractText":"A central cornerstone of our model of galaxy formation is how typical galaxies acquire their gas and the mechanisms by which the gas fuels star formation in these galaxies. Newly forming galaxies are usually so far away that the light we detect from them has taken several billion years to reach us, so that we are essentially peering into the most distant corners of the Universe and into the past, when the Universe was very young and just starting to form stars and galaxies. The light from these baby galaxies is also typically very faint as they are so far away; but in rare instances, a system's light can be magnified and stretched artificially by intervening matter by a process called gravitational lensing. A handful of normal galaxies in formation which have been gravitationally lensed in this way have been found serendipitously by sky surveys. \n\nThis project will allow us to dissect the gas distribution in one of these very distant star-forming galaxies on unprecedentedly small scales of ~0.02'' for such a distant galaxy (corresponding to a physical scale of about 200 pc; for reference, our Milky Way Galaxy is about 30 kpc across). These observations will be among the first that the new Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) will perform in its ``early science'' mode, and provide a showcase of the facility's capabilities. ALMA is an array of 66 telescopes situated in the Atacama desert in Chile that will collect and combine the radio waves from our astronomical source to construct images that are comparable to those that would be obtained with a hypothetical giant telescope 14 km in diameter!\n\nThe combination of ALMA's unique sensitivity and spatial resolution applied to this highly magnified system will allow us to address questions which are science drivers of the ALMA and facilities of the future: yielding insights into the kinematics of the interstellar medium in a normal, young galaxy seen 12 billion years ago.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L000598/1","grantId":"ST/L000598/1","fundValue":"13757","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Since the grant began I have been notified of an additional ``high priority'' ALMA award (as PI) in Cycle 2 (this is in addition to the one the grant was awarded for). I was awarded 5.5 hrs in Band 7 using the compact configuration to directly detect the submillimetre continuum emission in a sample of 10 `typical' unlensed $z=3$ LBGs for the first time. This was motivated by our benchmark stacking measurement of LBGs using new SCUBA-2 measurements in the submm from the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey of which I am a co-I (Coppin et al.,2014, MNRAS in press arXiv:1407.6712).

This paper is an important step forward in the field to connecting these moderate normal star forming galaxies in formation to more extreme star forming systems at the same epoch. The SCUBA2 stacking detection in my paper is the first time this population of galaxies (typical Lyman break galaxies at z~3, 4, 5) have been detected at these long wavelengths, setting a new benchmark for continuum and CO studies of these systems at high-redshift. It is these findings that led to our further ALMA award, based on our benchmark submm flux we measured for the population. Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
