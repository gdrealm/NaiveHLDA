With recent advances in treatment resulting in greatly improved cancer survival rates, it is becoming increasingly important to counter adverse effects of treatment such as ovarian failure and infertility. Breast cancer patients are the most common group affected: 25% of these patients are pre-menopausal at the time of diagnosis and treatment will affect ovarian function in around half of these women. Loss of fertility can be a vital issue, but even where that is not the case, early onset of the menopause, with all of its accompanying adverse effects, is an important consideration for longer-term health care. While effects on the ovary are known to result from damage to ovarian follicles, the structures containing the eggs, it is not known what stages of follicle, or what cell types within the follicle, the chemotherapy drugs initially damage. This application proposes to use tissue culture techniques with isolated ovarian follicles, methods in which we have a great deal of expertise, to investigate this problem. We will investigate the precise stages of development of ovarian follicles at which they are most sensitive to different chemotherapy drugs, which cells within the follicle are the main site of damage from chemotherapy, and how this damage may indirectly affect other follicles growing within the ovary. We believe that this will be a powerful way forward that will, in the longer term, allow clinicians to test and compare the levels of damage to the ovary of a range of chemotherapy drugs, and provide the information necessary to facilitate ways of preventing ovarian failure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002118","grantId":"G1002118","fundValue":"707783","fundStart":"2011-09-26","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Norah  Spears","coPersons":["Richard  Anderson","Charlie  Gourley","Evelyn  Telfer"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
