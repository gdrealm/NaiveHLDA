Alcohol places an unnecessary and preventable burden on health services. \nResearchers only partially understand how interventions reduce the risk of alcohol misuse and violence. The lack of reliable ways of measuring harm and the lack of watertight research methods mean that there are many uncertainties. This project addresses these problems by rigorously assessing how changes within licensed premises might impact on injury and illness. First, reliable measures of alcohol misuse and violence will be developed and, second, the effects of implementing changes will be measured. Measures which will be assessed include precisely targeted breath analysis and police and accident and emergency data. If reliable measures and evidence that the intervention works emerge then a large scale experiment will be the subject of a further application.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701758","grantId":"G0701758","fundValue":"354723","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Christopher Moore","coPersons":["Jonathan  Shepherd","Simon MARK Murphy","Laurence Anthony Moore"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
