The current 'blind spot' is our inability to combine genomic and proteomic data with understandings of molecular mechanism and biochemical pathways in living systems. For instance, we may know the atomic structure of a protein, understand its protein or ligand interactions, how and where it assembles into multi-component structures within the cell. However, we are unable to image any of these processes directly in living cells with the necessary resolution to give a complete and satisfactory understanding of how things work. Recent forums of leading microscopists both in Europe and the UK have highlighted this issue and also the pressing needs to achieve higher resolution multicolour live cell microscopy. While new optical techniques are constantly evolving there still remains a critical gap between what is possible using electron sources and optically based methods. To meet this challenge we propose the development of our novel probes that will eventually result in a live cell, multicolour/component imaging within an Electron Microscope, making an apparent Fluorescence electron microscope (FEM). By combining recent technological advances in both optical and electron imaging with the development of our novel luminescent probes, we believe that this approach will create a technology that will far surpass any other known technique currently being developed and provide the step change required in microscopy to start true multicolour sub-light resolution imaging with few constraints and address this major limitation in biology. This would be a ground-breaking advance in biological imaging. We recognised that any new technology trying to enable sub-light/diffraction limited nanometre resolution imaging is limited by currently available fluorescent/luminescent probes that have all been designed for photoluminescent imaging. Our approach is to encapsulate, or chemically passivate, specially engineered nano-sized (in the region of 10nm) cathodoluminescent materials such as the material used for P43 (in colour TV screen phosphors) for cell labelling. These probes will have the added advantage that they will also be suitable for standard photon excitation and exhibit far better properties compared to most other fluorochromes due to their high electron beam and photo-stability, very narrow emission peaks and inert nature. Taking the advantage of conventional optical microscopy and the use of different luminescent probes to study multiple cellular components in a live environment and the resolution that can be achieved using a scanning electron beam, we will remove the current 'blind spot' in studying living systems. This will have a far-reaching impact on biological and medical research with the elucidation of fine detailed particle maps and the ability to study receptor organisation and interactions. Such interactions are known to play key roles in cell signalling, recognition and other vital cellular functions that are critical for healthy cell function and disease, yet little is understood due to our current inability to visualise live samples. As well as the biological applications, we believe our new luminescent probe technology will impact widely on many other fields, such as polymer research, surface science, micro and nanotechnology. Our probes and FEM will therefore have the widest possible application across many academic and industrial disciplines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F005016/1","grantId":"BB/F005016/1","fundValue":"412609","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jack  Silver","coPersons":["Robert  Withnall","George Robert  Fern","Paolo  Coppo"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
