A recent review of the literature highlighted some of the key skill-based differences that have been reported both in regard to how performers allocate limited attention resources within the visual field and the manner in which the different components of visual system (i.e., the fovea, parafovea and periphery) are employed to capture relevant information to guide action. Of particular interest in aiming tasks is the work on the quiet eye period (QE), defined as the final fixation on the target prior to initiation of the obligatory motor response toward the target. A longer QE period, with an earlier onset of QE has been consistently reported to characterise expert performance, as well as performance outcome. During this time, it is proposed that the movement parameters for the required action are set. However, despite the plethora of research on QE, the underlying mechanisms and neural activity present during this behaviour are unknown. By increasing our knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning the effective use of vision, in particular QE, we can explore how training programmes can be designed to facilitate performance across numerous domains. The current project aims to identify the functional and neural mechanisms of QE, and how these interact with stress, specifically anxiety, and whether we can use this knowledge to expedite skill learning and modify behaviour.\n\nIn Phase One of this project, we will examine whether QE can protect against distracting stimuli, to keep the performer focused on the task-relevant cues. Subsequently, we will use brain-imaging techniques to highlight key areas of the brain that are activated during QE. We will compare gaze behaviours and neural activation between elite and sub-elite archers using an aiming task. This will enable us to identify structural differences in behaviours between skill levels. \n\nIn Phase Two of this project, we will use the same task as in Phase One, but test archers in the real-world environment. We will also manipulate anxiety via financial incentives and peer-based competition. This will enable us to identify how the mechanisms identified in Phase One are affected by stressors. By comparing between skill levels, it will enable us to identify how anxiety is mediated by expertise.\n\nIn Phase Three of this project, based on the data gathered from the previous phases, we will design and implement training interventions which aim to improve the gaze behaviours of sub-elite athletes. Specifically, we will attempt to modify QE behaviour to promote effective and efficient attention control. We will also monitor brain activation throughout the intervention to identify any neurological changes that occur as a result of training.\n\nThe project will identify the mechanisms underpinning expert performance in aiming skills and determine whether learning can be expedited through trans-magnetic simulation and behavioural modifications. Our work will highlight the neural activation during QE for the first time, enabling the development and monitoring of superior skill. Moreover, the project will improve conceptual understanding of how performance is influenced by anxiety and whether, and in what manner, any negative effects may be mediated by expertise. The knowledge generated will help refine and develop methods employed to improve perceptual and cognitive skills in other professional fields such as the military, law enforcement, emergency services, medicine/healthcare, as well as in education and training more generally.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J018880/1","grantId":"BB/J018880/1","fundValue":"230036","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings will be used in the near future to investigate gaze strategies in both novice and expert archers. In indeed &quot;quiet&quot; gaze is indicative of superior performance, then archers that show increased gaze variability will be able to benefit from this Quiet eye training (see Causer, Holmes and Williams, 2011). In addition, by measuring this quiet eye phenomenon using a different eye tracking technique, we have overcome some of the inherent limitations in the identification of quiet eye. Finally, our findings further suggest that the quiet eye can be measured in a laboratory setting and thus the underlying mechanisms of the quiet eye can now begin to be explored.

In particular, we investigated whether expert archers showed a longer &amp;amp;quot;Quiet eye&amp;amp;quot; compared to novices in the field. Research has shown that experts &amp;amp;quot;quiet&amp;amp;quot; their gaze prior to a required motor response and that this stable gaze lasts for longer compared to novices: thus, experts show longer quiet eye durations (QED) compared to novices and QED is also longer during more accurate performance.\nAt this point, our objectives were to identify QED differences in expert archers compared to novices in the field. In addition, our main goals for the study is to identify the neural mechanisms and networks involved in this QE phenomenon. Thus, another aim was to implement laboratory-based tasks in which QED effects could be replicated in these two populations. \nA total of 21 participants have been tested (10 experts and 11 novices). Expert performers were tested in the Archery GB facilities at Lilleshall National Sports Centre (UK). Novices were tested at Brunel University and were all part of the Brunel Archery Club. All participants were tested twice for a field task and a computer task. The field task consisted of shooting at 30 m to an 80 cm archery target, whilst, the computer task also recreated this field experiment but shooting was controlled via a joystick (also see Behan and Wilson, 2008). Eye movements were measured using a portable gaze tracker (30 Hz) and using electro-oculography techniques (1000 Hz). Performance was also measured and correlated to QED. \nOur results so far have revealed that expert archers do indeed exhibit quiet gaze strategies (longer QED) compared to novices in the field. These results could prove useful for archers in particular with training as gaze training has been shown to be successful at improving accuracy in many of the above mentioned sports. \nResults from the computer task also showed distinct gaze strategies between groups, however, the task did not elicit expertise effects (no transfer of performance). We however, did observe QED differences related to task complexity, particularly in novices. These results could point to increased processing efficiency in expertise. It has been previously suggested that the QED is associated with the allocation of attention to task-relevant cues for a more effective motor programming and execution (Causer et al., 2012).Our novel task could also provide valuable information on the neural networks involved in this processing. As mentioned, our findings suggest that task complexity influences gaze strategies in novices but that expert's prolonged QED may indeed show improved motor programming in this group. This suggest that the QED could be analysed in a laboratory setting in which other potential mechanism involving the QED could be explored. In addition, our findings also suggest that archers could also benefit from gaze training. In particular, gaze strategies, specifically the QED, has been shown to be affected by anxiety and distractors (Behan and Wilson, 2008). Thus the next steps would be to implement these training schemes to aid learning and improve performance in this population or in aiming sports in general. \nQED training has also been implemented outside of sports, such as with surgeons. Identifying the mechanism involved in QED may shed light into the underpinnings surrounding motor learning. Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism","dataset":"gtr"}
