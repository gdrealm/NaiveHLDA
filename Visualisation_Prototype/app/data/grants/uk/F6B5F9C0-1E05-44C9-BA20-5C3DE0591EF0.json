It is proposed that an advisory panel that includes young people will be set up at an early stage to review the progress of the research and discuss issues that arise. The views of the advisory panel will also have a key role to play in informing the development of subsequent policy interventions and social marketing strategies. The results and implications of each stage of the study will be disseminated to the wider public through the development of a dedicated section on the ISM web site and will be responsive to consumer feedback.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501282","grantId":"G0501282","fundValue":"341573","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gerard Bernard Hastings","coPersons":["Avril  Taylor","Fiona  Harris","Sally Jane Haw","Amanda  Amos","Douglas  Eadie"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
