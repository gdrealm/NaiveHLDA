Priestley, mid-twentieth century popular modernist","abstractText":"The objective of the research is to complete one 60 000 word monograph and one \n6000 word refereed article on the legacy of the dramatic and theatrical writings of J.B. Priestley. There are a number of critical works on Priestley but none which interrelate his plays, novels, theoretical and polemical writings with an analysis of his legacy as a theatre practitioner. The research process involves an examination of primary and secondary materials in print and in archive holdings at The Theatre Museum, The Priestley Collection at the University of Bradford, The Mander and Mitchenson Theatre Collection, the BFI and The Harry Ransom Arts and Humanities Centre in Austin. Many of these archive holdings, especially the scripts, letters and prompt copies deposited in Austin (mid 1960s and 1980s), have not been examined by recent scholars. The research will bring an analysis of these materials to a re-evaluation of Priestley as a major figure in the development of British drama in the twentieth century. The research will examine Priestley's oeuvre in the context of other theatre writing by his contemporaries, the commercial British theatre industry of the mid twentieth century and in terms of the polarised frameworks of modernist and popular cultural production. The monograph will interface biographical, dramatic and theoretical materials with analyses of his 'theatrical' novels (The Good Companions, Jenny Villiers, The Lost Empires), films, the critical reception of his work and range of productions of Priestley's plays in the US and Europe as well as in British theatres. \nThe article will focus on Priestley's theoretical positioning's on dramatic writing and theatre production in order to locate his legacy as that of a socialist theorist/theatre practitioner as well as a playwright. Much of the existing scholarly and popular writing on Priestley fails to assess in any detail the legacy of Priestley's work as a theorist and practitioner, and the aim of this research is to contextualise Priestley as an experimental but popular playwright who battled with the commercial British theatre production system of the mid-twentieth century, in order to find a place for his work which although popular, often challenged audiences and managements who were eager to avoid financial risk.\n\nPotential Applications and Benefits:\n\nThe research project will facilitate the completion of a monograph and one article providing a much needed re-evaluation of J.B. Priestley, not only as a dramatist still popular with European and American audiences, but also as a practitioner and theorist. It will enhance our understanding of the dynamics of theatre culture of the mid twentieth century and provide a much needed contemporary account of his work and legacy for a wide academic readership.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D50032X/1","grantId":"AH/D50032X/1","fundValue":"29936","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maggie  Gale","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
