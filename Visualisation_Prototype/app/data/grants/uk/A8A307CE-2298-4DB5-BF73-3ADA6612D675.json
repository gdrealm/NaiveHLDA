Almost all research on male-to-male sexualities in this context is conceived within mainstream public health paradigms. From a social-scientific – especially anthropological – perspective, such approaches offer limited analyses of the relationship between sexual subjectivity and (public health) discourses, connections between ‘local sexualities’ and global systems, and ways in which sexuality between men in India may have little to do with culturally congruent meanings.</p>\n\n<p>Against this background the present research will explore the ‘lifeworlds’ of men who have sex with men in a suburban town in West Bengal. The aim will be to examine the effects of nascent sexual health work aimed at such men in this context, considering ways in which it might inform incipient, ‘new’ ways of thinking about male-to-male sexual subjectivities and practices.</p>\n\n<p>Ethnographic research will also take place in national and international sexual health and HIV prevention programming milieux, to examine ways in which men who have sex with men have been conceived as the subject of interventions in such contexts.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F000960/1","grantId":"ES/F000960/1","fundValue":"142580","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Boyce","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
