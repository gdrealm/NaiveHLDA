As the number of constituents increases collective behaviour involving largenumber of the elementaries emerges. It turns out that eigenvalues of large random matrices --- square array of numbers drawn with theaid of the throw of a die (which accounts for the randomness) and itscontinuous generalization involving differentiation---also behave in a similar manner. In these projects the behaviour of thethe eigenvalues in both instances will give value insights into the model complex systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H023127/1","grantId":"EP/H023127/1","fundValue":"15674","fundStart":"2009-11-14","fundEnd":"2010-09-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Yang  Chen","coPersons":["Ari  Laptev"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
