They are of particular interest in aero-engines, where they help to improve engine efficiency and minimise the consumption of aviation fuel. This proposal is concerned with investigating cutting type wear experienced by abradable linings, during the incursion of a blade tip into the lining. Previous studies have considered the process to be similar to that of high speed machining, whereas recent observations from engine tests have indicated that debris is in fact ejected from the rear of the contact.In this study a demonstrator platform will be developed for simulating aero-engine compressor rubs, and the associated contact mechanics investigated using an ultrasonic technique in combination with a finite element model. Through this approach, material failure points will be identified, and insight gained as to why debris is ejected from the rear of the contact. Blade tip geometries will also be investigated as part of this study, as well as their effect on material removal. This topic area is particularly pertinent as aero-engine manufacturer's looks to minimise blade tip clearances further inorder to increase engine efficiency, thus increasing the frequency of abrasion events.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H023895/1","grantId":"EP/H023895/1","fundValue":"100576","fundStart":"2010-11-15","fundEnd":"2011-11-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew Barry Marshall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" Abradable linings are used within compressors and turbines as they allow blade tip clearances to be minimised, whilst not suffering the penalty of blade tip wear. They are of particular interest in aero-engines, where they help to improve engine efficiency and minimise the consumption of aviation fuel. The nature of the contact between blade tips and abradable materials is not well understood, and in some cases blade wear still occurs. The aim of this project was to investigate this contact, and fundamentally understand the interaction mechanism between these two components.\n\n\n\nA laboratory demonstrator platform was developed, capable of generating the wear conditions observed for abradable linings in an aero-engine compressor. Results from the test rig were compared to engine data and good agreement shown. High-speed imaging techniques were used to investigate the nature of the blade tip contact with the abradable. This technique was able to highlight aspects such as adhesive transfer of abradable material to the blade, and explain the overall wear behaviour of the components. Through this study the drivers behind the propensity for a given wear mechanism were identified, for both cases with beneficial and detrimental effects on the blade. The outcomes of this work will aid in the design and selection of future abradable materials. The research undertaken is of primary use to manufacturers of rotating turbo-machinery, i.e. aero-engines, land based gas turbines, where small clearances are required between blades and housings to maximise efficiency. The abradable linings researched are used in these scenarios, allowing tight clearances, but provide a sacrificial media preventing damage should the blade strike the casing wall. The results from this study highlight the factors behind a variety of abradable lining wear mechanisms, and how detrimental wear scenarios (such as adhesion) can be avoided - through for example the choice of increased porosity. Thermal degradation of abradable materials was also investigated, and its effect on wear, and this information is useful in selecting service intervals. \n\n\n\nOn a broader point, the outcomes from this study can be used by turbo-machinery manufacturers in conjunction with material suppliers, to help develop the next generation of abradable materials, which can be designed to wear in a more controlled manner. This work can be put to use in both academic and non-academic contexts. The study has highlighted the key drivers behind a number of abradable lining wear mechanisms from a materials perspective, and can be used by materials engineers (both coating manufacturers and academic researchers) to help design the next generation of abradable lining. \n\n\n\nDirectly, this research has shown the potential to gain meaningful results concerning abradable materials from a laboratory based test arrangement, and provides the potential for further investigation of alternative materials (i.e. nickel based abradables).
