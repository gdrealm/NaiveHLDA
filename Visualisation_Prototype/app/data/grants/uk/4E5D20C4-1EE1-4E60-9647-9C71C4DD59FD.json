It is a major research hub directing international research networks and young scholars in identifying the appropriate balance to be struck between protection and regulation, freedom and privacy, the market and intervention to promote policy objectives such as education and research. In addition to its dynamic and cross-cutting research programme, the Centre fully exploits its technical and legal expertise in the delivery of its teaching and public engagement agenda","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D502519/1","grantId":"AH/D502519/1","fundValue":"1672320","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our findings helped to shape policy responses and governance structures across the fields of technologies that SCRIPT investigated. A key part of the grant was to set up Foresight Fora that coordinated academic responses to consultations and similar submissions to policy makers, by establishing UK wide 'fast-response' networks.

Legislation is often &amp;quot;too much too late&amp;quot;, involving highly punitive responses to the latest moral panic, which often does little to achieve the protection of key values and can stymie responsible technological development and growth by protecting antiquated business models. Certain interests - such as these of developing countries, SMEs and, in some cases, consumers - are systematically sidelined in these developments. Even more worrying, these legal tools often fail to realise the benefits even for those groups they are meant to protect, misaligning legal conceptualisations and responses with the expectations and interests of creators and innovators. Certain less obvious legal concepts that are in principle available to address these deficits are underused in favour of ideas from traditional criminal and IP law. To address these shortcomings, we have developed new forms of interaction between lawyers, scientists and policy makers and contributed to a more holistic approach of co-regulation that changes behaviour through a mixture of economic incentives, technological architecture, training/education and formal legislation using traditional legal ideas more creatively. We have demonstrated that the Internet, just as science in general as a global communications space, is a self-organising entity that has proven problematic for regulators, and that in order to regulate them, we must first understand how networks of this type operate. Case studies in copyright policy, peer-production and cyber crime, providing in-depth analyses of the challenges posed by the science and technology's complex dynamic networks. We developed new approaches and solutions were developed for specific problems and case studies such as trusted computing, medical databases, neuroimaging, open source licensing, and online behavioural advertising. More specifically, we \n- took a new approach to &amp;quot;foresighting&amp;quot; that facilitates risk assessment for emerging technologies and identifies regulatory gaps and shortcomings. \n- demonstrated key legal concepts that can be represented computationally to contribute to regulation through architecture and facilitate e.g. &amp;quot;privacy through design&amp;quot;\n- showed how synergies between often underused legal concepts from human rights law, competition law, and tort law (reliance liability) can be used to give voice to often silenced interests and balance better and in democratically more accountable ways the various interests that scientific developments touch upon.\n- showed how co-regulation in the media sector can be reformed, with specific reference to professional regulation and the demise of the Press Complaints Committee in the UK to ensure coherence and effectiveness of regulation in the media sector in the light of convergence and the challenges that face states in seeking to promote a plural and diverse media environment\n- identified problems with reliance on the concept of &amp;quot;informed consent&amp;quot; in medical law and technology law, and suggested ways in which this abstract idea can be enriched in a co-regulatory model\n - demonstrated the potential of open source and open access models, and contributed to legal tools that make them more robust\n- developed new forms to communicate key scientific ideas to lawyers, and new methods to explain legal issues pertaining to technology regulation to scientists, software developers and the wider public. These methods involved also interaction with artists, authors of literary works including comic books, software developers and people from the fields of popular culture to develop communication channels that go &amp;quot;beyond text&amp;quot;. \nTogether, these approaches can rebalance the interests and value commitments of various stakeholders, with an overarching metric of reducing where possible regulation while enhancing trust, and maximising openness while protecting secrecy, when and only when necessary, better. A key part of our work was to create structures that enabled not only centre members, but academics working in cognate areas across the UK and Europe to influence policy formation. Our Foresight Fora coordinated highly interdisciplinary responses to consultation exercises class for evidence and submissions to policy makers, working closely with professional bodies such as BILETA or NGOs such as the Open Rights Group.\nAll of our research streams have attracted follow up funding that allows us to work with specific research users in turning the more abstract and conceptual findings into specific models of governance, software development or teaching and training tools. Particularly successful is our continuing work with regulators and data controllers in the field of medical data, both in the UK (e.g work with the Scottis Informatics Programme (SHIP) or the ESRC Administrative Data Research Centres: ADRC Scotland) and internationally (from advisory work for the government of Argentina to involvement with the EU Commission's Innovative Medicines Initiative on stem cell banking: EBiSC)\nThe groundwork on law compliant software design and assistive legal technologies that were laid in this project are now been taking up by collaborative work with major commercial law firms and rightholder organisations for the digital economy through the RCUK funded CREATE network\nWe developed new training material for practitioners, including contributing to a ground breaking new EU certified programme on skills in digital evidence for judges, prosecutors and police, and material for wider outreach work with comic book illustrators and creative writes to turn our ideas into a format that is accessible to the wider public. \nSCRIPT remains a research centre at the University of Edinburgh and continues to host the innovative open access journal SCRIPTed that was funded through the grant, and has &quot;spun off&quot; new, more specialised centres and communities that implement and further develop the findings of the grant, including the Mason Centre for Medical law and Ethics UoE, or the European Association of Health law that the grant helped to set up.
