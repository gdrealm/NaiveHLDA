{"id":"E9AE8565-1977-4FEE-8A9F-11CB26B037B4","title":"Designer Catalysts for High Efficiency Biodiesel Production","abstractText":"Tackling the current world energy crisis is recognised as a top priority for both developed and developing nations. Alternative energy sources are therefore urgently sought in response to both diminishing world oil reserves and increasing environmental concerns over global climate change. To be truly viable such alternative energy sources must be sustainable, that is have the ability to meet 21st century energy needs without compromising those of future generations. While a number of sustainable technologies are currently receiving heavy investment, the most easily implemented and low cost solutions for transportation needs are those based upon biomass derived fuels. Spearheading such renewable fuels is biodiesel - a biodegradable, non toxic fuel synthesised from animal fats or plant oils extracted from cereal or non-food crops. We recently developed a range of first-generation solid acid and base catalysts that respectively remove undesired free fatty acid (FFA) impurities, and transform naturally occurring triglycerides found within plant oils into clean biodiesel. Here we propose to achieve a step-change in both catalyst, and overall process efficiency, through a combination of new synthetic materials chemistry and reactor technologies, in combination with computer-aided catalyst and process design. Our goal is the delivery of second-generation mesostructured solid acids and bases, optimised for efficient diffusion and reaction of bulky triglycerides and FFAs, and an intensified process allowing tandem esterification and transesterification of plant oil. Together these new green chemical technologies offer vastly streamlined biodiesel production, with associated annual energy savings of 5.5 billion kWh and a reduction in CO2 emissions by 2.4 million tonnes per annum at current production rates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F063423/1","grantId":"EP/F063423/1","fundValue":"389296","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This report, commissioned by the German Academy of Sciences was co-authored by selected delegates at their 'Biofuels and Bioenergy' workshop held in Griefswald. The report details recommendations made by delegates at the meeting about the sustainability of biofuels across Germany and Europe.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.leopoldina.org/uploads/tx_leopublication/201207_Stellungnahme_Bioenergie_LAY_en_final.pdf\n\nA group of experts from various disciplines have been helping the Leopoldina investigate how Germany can best harness biomass in ways that make sense from the point of view of energy and the climate. The statement on the opportunities and limits of bioenergy analyses the availability and feasibility of using biomass in Germany, provides an overview of energy conversion technologies and introduces promising approaches to producing hydrogen from renewable resources.\n\n\n\nThe recommendations contained in this statement are intended to provide parliaments, ministries, associations and companies with well-founded and unbiased support in making the important decisions that will lay the foundations for a climate-friendly, secure and sustainable use of bioenergy.\n\nContribution Method: The role of catalysis in the sustainable conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals, in particular biodiesel synthesis, features as an important technology.
