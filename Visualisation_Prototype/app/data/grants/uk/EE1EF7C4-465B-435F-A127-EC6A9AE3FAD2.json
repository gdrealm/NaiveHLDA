{"id":"EE1EF7C4-465B-435F-A127-EC6A9AE3FAD2","title":"New and Improved Electroceramics","abstractText":"This Large Grant proposal combines the expertise of Sheffield and Leeds to establish a major electroceramics research hub. Electroceramics are advanced materials whose properties and applications depend on close control of crystal structure, chemical composition, ceramic microstructure, dopants and dopant (or defect) distribution. In most cases, properties depend on a complex interplay of structural, processing and compositional variables. They find applications in various physical forms, eg as ceramic discs, thick and thin films and multi-layer devices consisting of alternating layers (up to several hundred) of ceramic and metal electrodes. The particular property of interest may be a bulk property of the crystals, for example, high levels of ionic conductivity, mixed electronic-ionic conduction, ferro-, pyro- piezo-electricity or ferrimagnetism. Alternatively, it may relate specifically to the grain boundaries (or surface layers) in polycrystalline materials and to small differences in composition and therefore electrical behaviour between the bulk and grain boundary (or surface) regions. Such heterogeneous, or functionally-graded ceramics find many applications eg non-ohmic devices in current limiters such as varistors and thermistors. This proposal focuses on new and improved electroceramics for potential near- and long-term applications. The work will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with complementary skills in materials discovery, modelling, processing and advanced characterisation. Such a multifaceted approach to electroceramics research and development does not exist in the UK within a single institution and the establishment of a 'hub' between the two universities will allow us to compete with the best in the world. Three work packages are proposed.I. New and improved bulk materials: structure-property relations, including: (a) novel perovskite-type materials with targeted functionality: ferroelectricity, reversible electro-strain, piezoelectricity, magneto-electric coupling and mixed conductivity; (b) development of new low temperature co-fired ceramics based on Sillenites; (c) oxygen nonstoichiometry and core-shell phenomena in doped BaTiO3; (d) development of improved lithium battery cathodes based on layered rock salt structures. II. Materials processing and development in thin and thick film form, including:(a) BiFeO3-PbTiO3 and BiMeO3 thin films for ferroelastic/ferroelectric switching for actuator and memory applications; (b) thin film feasibility studies on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell structures; (c) thick and thin films based on the novel ferroelectric system Ba2RETi2Nb3O15 to assess their potential device applications; (d) development of a masked Electrophoretic Deposition technique to deposit planar magnetoelectric composites based on Pb(Zr,Ti)O3-Pb(Ni,Nb)O3 (soft piezoelectric) and (La,Ca)MnO3 (magnetostrictor). III. Modelling of bulk materials and interfacial phenomena: (a) Development of Finite Element modelling of current pathways in (i) heterogeneous ceramics, (ii) local probe measurements within grains and across individual grain boundaries and (iii) multilayer devices; the results will be used to simulate Impedance Spectroscopy data and allow comparison with, and interpretation of, experimental data; (b) Modelling of functional oxides: point defects, electronic band structure calculations and mass diffusion in ceramics; this will underpin the experimental programmes on the development of new materials and the role of dopants in existing materials. Work packages I and II will be supported by a wide range of characterisation techniques available at Leeds and Sheffield for studying bulk and interfacial phenomena. New characterisation techniques will be applied: aberration-corrected TEM allows true atomic scale spectroscopy of interfaces and defects; Kelvin Probe Microscopy gives direct imaging of the work function variation in grain and across grain boundary regions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G005001/1","grantId":"EP/G005001/1","fundValue":"3789800","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  IR: The major findings in establishing a tape casting/screen printing capability have been used to generate significant amounts of further funding and have become intrinsic to Sheffield's research portfolio, generating &amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;?3M in related projects\nAW: Recognition of the voltage-dependence of p-type semiconductivity in some ceramic oxides and attribution of its origin to redox-active oxygen has changed my perspective of p-type semiconduction.

The major breakthrough in this area was the establishment of multilayering technology at Sheffield via Denis Cummings (PDRA). This facility generated several articles in referreed journals but importantly has become the backbone of the group in terms of prototype device capability and feeds into many projects including the recently awarded grant 'Substitution and Sustainability in Functio\nAnthony West (AW): The main discovery is the effect of bias voltage on the electrical properties of bulk ceramic materials that have been doped by an acceptor mechanism. Six publications have followed on alkaline earth titanates with the perovskite structure and one on doped bismuth ferrite which shows a remarkable insulator-metal transition at room temperature. This work is likely to expand to consider situations under which oxygen in oxides can be redox active\n\nJohn Harding (JH) was responsible for the modelling part of the grant. Working in collaboration with Derek Sinclair (DS) the modelling showed that the widely accepted mechanism to produce semiconducting grains (direct donor-doping) in PTCR BaTiO3-based thermistors is incorrect and demonstrate an alternative based on Ti vacancies. We have made a major code development to analyse impedance spectra. A fast, efficient finite element code now enables direct analysis (i.e. no equivalent circuits) of impedance spectra for three dimensional heterogeneous ceramics with realistic microstructures of ceramics and incorporating contacts, grain boundaries, and grain cores.\nDerek Sinclair (DS) developed structure-composition-property relationships in several important perovskite-type oxides. Particular emphasis was given to the electrical properties that ranged from dielectrics to semiconductors to ionic conductors. Systems included A-site ordered perovskites such as CaCu3Ti4O12, B-site deficient hexagonal perovskites such as Ba3LaNb3012 and A-site disordered cubic type (Na,Bi)TiO3 (NBT). A major discovery in this work was high levels of oxide-ion conductivity in NBT and this has led to the development of a new family of oxide ion conductors with potential as electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells. IR: The tapecasting/screen printing methodologies introduced by this grant have shown to be very useful with projects ranging from the development of thermoelectric generators to carbon capture and utilisation either planned or in progress.\n\nJH The finite element code will be of wide utility in impedance spectra analysis and can be extended to consider thermistors and piezoelectric systems. \n\nDS The discovery of oxide-ion conductivity in NBT was unexpected and raises the potential for other new families of Bi-based perovskites oxide as a new class of solid electrolytes. These materials may have applications in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Electronics,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
