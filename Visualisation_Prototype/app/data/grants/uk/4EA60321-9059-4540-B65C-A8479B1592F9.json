Although the development of policy towards inclusion in the UK is well-advanced (although by no means all-encompassing), very little is known about the social outcomes of existing inclusive arrangements. This study will employ a multimethod research design to systematically evaluate the social impacts of inclusion on children with SEN and their mainstream peers in six primary schools in one Local Education Authority. Specifically, the study will first investigate the social position of ‘statemented’ pupils (ie those with a statement of SEN) and their perceived self-esteem. Second, it will examine mainstream pupils’ attitudes towards their peers with SEN while evaluating the effect of increased contact between the two populations on such attitudes. And third, it will seek to identify teaching strategies and wider school practices conducive to the promotion of social interaction and the development of friendships between pupils with and without SEN. In pursuing these lines of enquiry, the study aspires to provide rich and rigorous insights into the development of truly inclusive institutional cultures, an issue of fundamental importance to both practitioners and policymakers.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0069","grantId":"RES-061-23-0069","fundValue":"91126","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elias  Avramidis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
