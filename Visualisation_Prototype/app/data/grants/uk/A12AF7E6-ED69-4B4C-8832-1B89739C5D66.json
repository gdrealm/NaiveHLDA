In about 1972 their collaboration ceased.&nbsp; Bourdieu’s career progression from 1972 is well known.&nbsp; Much less is known internationally about the subsequent work of Passeron. The purpose of this project is to assess and represent the work of Passeron and to articulate the important philosophical and methodological differences between the two men.</p>\n\n<p>Bourdieu and Passeron collaborated in 1968 in publishing Le m&eacute;tier de sociologue. It was intended as the first of several volumes of methodological guidance for research students. Similarly, the purpose of the proposed project is to use a re-opening of the debate between Bourdieu and Passeron as a heuristic device for stimulating discussion amongst UK research students, particularly in respect of the relationship between the sociology of culture and cultural studies. The main products of the research will be an introductory guide to the theoretical issues and an authorized translation of Passeron’s Le raisonnement sociologique (‘Sociological reasoning’), first published in 1991 and revised in 2006.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F025327/1","grantId":"ES/F025327/1","fundValue":"66880","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Derek  Robbins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
