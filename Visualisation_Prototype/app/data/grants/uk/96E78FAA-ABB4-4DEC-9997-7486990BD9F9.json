However, despite billions invested in rural handpumps one in three handpumps do not work in rural Africa. This represents a huge wasted investment and is associated with high but avoidable health, welfare and livelihood costs. Encouragingly, the risk of handpump breakdown bears all the hallmarks of an insurable risk.</p>\n\n<p>A recent technological breakthrough by researchers at Oxford University makes an insurance model now feasible. Like any insurance model premiums are lower with more handpumps as they spread the risk across all users. What is not clear is how much users would pay and what level of maintenance service they would want. Linking consumer demand with insurance supply will then provide a credible basis to test such a new handpump insurance product in the next phase of the research. There is a lot of excitement and interest in the research with the project partners including the Government of Kenya, United Nations Children Foundation (UNICEF) and mobile phone companies and operators (GSMA). If this project is successful it could help the 276 million rural Africans access safe and reliable water to make their lives and futures healthy and wealthier. That would be good news for everyone.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K012150/1","grantId":"ES/K012150/1","fundValue":"85519","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Adrian Hope","coPersons":["Peter  Harvey"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
