In particular, the series seeks to debate the value of new theoretical and methodological approaches to understanding mental health problems and the multiple processes of marginalisation and exclusion that are often associated with this phenomenon.</p> \n<p>The political and intellectual climate is now ideal for a seminar series that seeks to consolidate interdisciplinary approaches to the study of mental health and illness in ways that are also inclusive of practitioner and service user voices. The aim of this strategy will be to critically explore the emergent ‘new wave’ of social science and user-led research into key aspects of mental health issues, and through this to encounter innovative ways of conceptualising, studying and representing the lived experience of mental health problems. Reflecting critically on what ‘community life’ now offers people with severe and ensuring mental health problems, this interdisciplinary agenda seeks to enable a dialogue across usual disciplinary and sectorial divides to create new knowledge communities that identify and debate the value of 1) innovative methods for researching mental health issues 2) new theories about inequalities and mental health 3) recent conceptualisations of ‘emotional health’, medicalisation and treatment and 4) the development of ‘social models’ of madness in the context of the development of service user movements. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4233","grantId":"RES-451-25-4233","fundValue":"8175","fundStart":"2006-11-20","fundEnd":"2008-05-19","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Charles Freestone","coPersons":["Hester  Parr","Ewen  Speed","Anne  Rogers","Louise  Woodward","John Aggergaard Larsen"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
