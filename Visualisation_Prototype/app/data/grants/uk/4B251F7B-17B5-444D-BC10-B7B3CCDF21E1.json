In particular, we will be optimising the growth of cardiac muscle and neural tissue in a 3D perfusion bioreactor whilst incorporating electrical stimulation regimes. The bioreactor configuration is entirely novel and we will strengthen and finalise our existing IP and file a patent as a result of this grant. This project will engage with a variety of industrial collaborators in market steering capacity and tissue phenotype maintenance proof of concept data will be gained.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M013545/1","grantId":"BB/M013545/1","fundValue":"133831","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Harriet Cartmell","coPersons":["Nigel John Cassidy"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
