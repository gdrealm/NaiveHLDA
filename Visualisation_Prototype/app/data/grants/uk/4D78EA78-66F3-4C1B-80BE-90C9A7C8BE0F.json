The research will construct a bridgehead between transitional justice and the sociology of the legal professions. It will also draw upon a range of interdisciplinary literature, including comparative legal studies, historical institutionalism and social movement theory.</p>\n\n<p>The aims of the project are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to develop a comparative perspective on the sociology of lawyering exploring lawyers as actors within and beyond the courtroom; to examine the intersection between lawyers and other key civil society, political and legal actors in social movements</li>\n\n <li>to explore the contribution of lawyers in shaping local and international understandings of the ‘rule of law’</li>\n\n <li>to interrogate the extent to which transitional contexts may be viewed as ‘exceptional’ from the experiences of settled democracies</li>\n\n <li>to chart the relevance (or not) of key themes on the relationship between law, lawyers and political and social change in such contexts, in particular legal culture, colonial and post-colonial lawyering and legal pluralism. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project will draw from comparative legal methods and socio-legal traditions of empirical fieldwork in conducting 120 semi-structured interviews across the six field sites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J009849/1","grantId":"ES/J009849/1","fundValue":"490193","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"K  McEvoy","coPersons":["Louise  Mallinder","Marny  Requa"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
