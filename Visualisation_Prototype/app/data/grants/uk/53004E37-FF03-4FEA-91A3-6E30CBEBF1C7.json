We are interested in a microorganism called Sulfolobus solfataricus which is able to survive in extreme conditions such as high temperature (approaching the boiling point of water) and acid conditions. Hence, the interesting question that drives this research is how come it can survive under such extreme conditions, when other microorganisms cannot, and what happens when the conditions change. To investigate how Sulfolobus solfataricus responds to temperature variation, when grown on different types of food (e.g. different types of sugar) we will concentrate on the chemical reactions that occur within the cell. In particular we will concentrate on what is called the central carbohydrate metabolism (CCM) which converts sugar to energy to grow and maintain life via many chemical reactions. During these reactions, proteins are made, modified and broken down. This project, as part of the large EU consortium, which will be conducted in Phillip C Wright's lab in Chemical Engineering at Sheffield, specifically aims to determine when (temporal changes) and by how much these proteins change (quantification and post-translational modification) and whether they interact with each other (protein-protein interactions), under the changing temperatures. The reason this is important is that proteins are the 'doing' molecules in the cells. The results from this programme will feed directly into a wider investigation about how the other parts of the organism work. These other parts include the DNA of the cell and other chemicals that react and move around the cell. The overall idea is to create a computer model that describes how the cell works and how all these chemicals work together to cause the cell to behave how it does. This is important as there is great potential in medicine and biotechnology for proteins that can work in these extreme conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F003420/1","grantId":"BB/F003420/1","fundValue":"167816","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Knowledge has been used academically by consortium members to formulate new projects, especially in Germany  ","person":"Phillip Craig  Wright","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" Understanding of mechanisms of growth by this extremophile in response to feedstock change and temperature Knowledge is underpinning other bids.
