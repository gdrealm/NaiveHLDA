Variation in the PbO/Nb2O5 ratio across the substrate will be monitored using energy and wavelength dispersive x-ray microanalysis and changes in symmetry will be investigated use glancing angle X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Screening of the dielectric properties will be performed using local impedance measurements under zero and bias field at radio frequencies in order to determine compositions with the highest figure of merit for tunable filter applications. Limited MW measurements will be performed on optimised compositions to determine whether these compounds exhibit sufficient tunability and low enough dielectric loss to have a significant impact in the microelectronics community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F015631/1","grantId":"EP/F015631/1","fundValue":"93319","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian Elliott Hayden","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
