{"id":"2C211E41-40FC-4AF6-87C9-9A3CACD679B9","title":"Mechanistic and evolutionary analysis of the natural variation in Arabidopsis vernalization response","abstractText":"A full understanding of how climate change will influence plants requires an understanding of how mechanisms used to monitor environmental cues have changed as plants have adapted to different habitats. Regulation of flowering in many plants in temperate and arctic environments includes a requirement for a period of exposure to cold, known as vernalization. In this proposal we want to fully characterize the molecular basis of natural variation in vernalization. A major regulator of this process is FLC, a floral repressor. The gene encoding FLC needs to be silenced for flowering to proceed and the speed this happens differs in Arabidopsis collected from different habitats. We will analyse FLC regulation and how it has evolved in response to adaptation to different climates. 'Mix-and-match' versions of FLC genes from the different natural variants will be analysed in transgenic plants to uncover which of the different nucleotide changes contributes to the altered vernalization response. In collaboration with Dr Magnus Nordborg, a population geneticist, we will then analyse FLC in a worldwide set of Arabidopsis accessions and relate sequence variation to vernalization response. We will also undertake experiments analysing the fitness benefits of this variation and compare these data to field-derived phenotypic data generated in two parallel studies. This will reveal whether variation in vernalization is important for adaptation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I007857/1","grantId":"BB/I007857/1","fundValue":"722076","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The research in this proposal had impact in three quite different areas: \n\no It has added to our overall understanding of the evolutionary processes underpinning natural diversity. \no The emphasis on variation in response to changes in temperature is important given our world is warming. Information from this research will be highly relevant for improving knowledge on likely changes in plant phenological behaviour - plant timing mechanisms - as our climate changes. \no Time to flowering is a key trait in breeding of many crops. The focus on molecular basis of natural variation in vernalization is relevant to breeding and production of many winter-grown vegetable crops, specifically broccoli and cauliflower. This work led to a BBSRC LINK grant (starting 2009) with Elsoms Seeds and Bejo Zaden BV, Weatherquest and Jim Monaghan at Harper Adams to analyse similar variation in horticultural brassicas. Development of varieties less influenced by temperature but still allowing production at different times of the year would considerably reduce waste, potentially open up new production areas and increase efficiency of delivery. \nWe have continued to discuss the climate change work with colleagues in the Environmental Sciences Dept at the University of East Anglia - now a formal partnership called the Earth and Life Systems Alliance. One PhD studentship has been funded under this agreement to model how molecular variation in temperature-regulated gene expression would influence the effect of future climate warming on vernalization of A. thaliana accessions.

This revealed the surprising role of FRIGIDA to prevent flowering in autumn in those locations where temperature and photoperiod at this time of year are conducive to flowering. We worked extensively with Dr Magnus Nordborg (initially at USC, USA and now at Gregor Mendel Institute, Vienna) to characterize the loci with a major effect on vernalization response. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) were combined with extensive quantitative trait locus analysis. This revealed interesting issues with using GWAS to map adaptive traits. \n\nOur aim was to relate molecular variation to phenotypic diversity focusing on variation in vernalization. Through analysis of the worldwide FLC haplotype structure from &gt;1300 A. thaliana accessions we identified five predominant FLC haplotypes defined by non-coding sequence variation. Genetic and transgenic experiments showed they are functionally distinct with non-coding polymorphism influencing the rate of FLC epigenetic silencing. This non-coding variation at a single locus accounts for a large proportion of the natural variation in vernalization of A. thaliana accessions. Field and glasshouse studies showed these multiple, functionally distinct, FLC haplotypes appear to have contributed to the broad geographical and niche range of A. thaliana accessions. This work will be used by commercial producers to breed for varieties more resistant to varying environments. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
