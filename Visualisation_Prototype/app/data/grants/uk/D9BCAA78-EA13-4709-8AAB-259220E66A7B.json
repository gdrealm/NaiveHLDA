{"id":"D9BCAA78-EA13-4709-8AAB-259220E66A7B","title":"Computational methods for multiphysics interface problems","abstractText":"Many problems in science and technology includes a fixed or moving boundary over which\ntwo different physical systems are coupled. This situation is particularly common in systems in\nmedicine and biology, for instance: in the human arteries the fluid dynamics of the blood couples to the solid dynamics of the arterial wall, in rivers and estuaries the free flow couples to the porous media flow in the infiltrated river bed. Making accurate computational predictions of the evolution of such systems remains an important challenge for engineers and the accurate mathematical analysis of the associated methods is even more daunting. Indeed no known methods allow for rigorous mathematical analysis and many suffer from problems of stability or accuracy depending on the orientation of the interface. Numerical computations are most often performed on a computational mesh, that is a decomposition of the computational domain in a large number of small building blocks, so called elements. An important feature of the methods that we propose is that the interface may cut through the elements of the computational mesh, or in other words, the computational mesh does not need to fit the interface.\n\nIn multiphysics problems the situation is often complicated by the fact that the computational mesh may not be adapted to fit the interface, but the coupling of the two systems must take place independent of the mesh. This is the type of situation that we aim to study in the present project. New approaches will be designed for multiphysics couplings over moving interfaces. The mathematical methods will be designed so as to be robust and accurate and we will also explore the possibility to decouple the two systems for efficient time advancement. This may lead to very important savings in computational time, in particular for nonlinear problems.\n\nThree important model cases will be considered: the coupling of two fluids of which one or both may be viscoelastic, the coupling of free flow and porous media flow and finally the coupling of a fluid and an elastic structure. All of these applications have important applications in the modeling of the human cardiovascular system, but also in a wide variety of other applications such as ink-jet printers, environmental science, chemical industry and so on.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J002313/1","grantId":"EP/J002313/1","fundValue":"420615","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used in methods implemented in several computational codes.

Sometimes the geometry can be very difficult to mesh, this is for instance often the case for geometries obtained using MRI scans in biomedical imaging. Situations can also arise where the domain changes under the computation due to time evolution or due to some optimisation that depends on the domain shape. In such cases repeated re-meshing can be very costly and sometimes impossible due to topological changes, i.e. for instance formation of drops in a two phase flow. For cases where meshing is too expensive a well-known tool are so called fictitious domain methods. They allow computations on a fully structured mesh and conditions on boundaries or interfaces are imposed implicitly through the computational method. Traditionally these methods have suffered from the drawback of either strongly reduced accuracy, or problems with the stability.\n\nIn the present project we have developed and analysed new techniques that make it possible to use fictitious domain methods without loss neither of accuracy nor of stability. The framework allows for general couplings between systems with different physical character as well as the solution of problems defined on surfaces and boundaries and the coupling between problems in the bulk and on the surface. \n\nThe developed methods have been implemented in a computational code that is destined for the public domain. The methods are implemented in a software library that will soon be put in the public domain and can then be used by engineers and scientists. Other engineering groups are also implementing our theoretical results into their computational codes.
