{"id":"50FEEF93-DF7F-49A7-ACE0-B71C977CDA3A","title":"Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences - Cross Council Science","abstractText":"As a subject of wonder and beauty, pure mathematics is one of the highest expressions of human culture, and the applications of mathematics, often unperceived, are truly all-pervasive in our modern world. The Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences is dedicated to enabling UK researchers to interact with the best scientists from around the world, in themed research Programmes. The cross-disciplinary breadth of Programmes is extraordinary; the Institute is a place where the underpinning mathematics is brought to bear on big scientific issues. As well as research in mathematics per se, future Programmes and workshops include: challenges in genome analysis; laboratory and astrophysical plasmas; uncertainties in climate modelling and prediction; the design and analysis of experiments; the mathematics and applications of branes in string and M-theory; topological dynamics in the physical and biological sciences; and adaptive mesh modelling in the atmosphere and ocean. The quality of the Programmes and the unrivalled INI environment have attracted, in the years 2005-9, the winners of 5 Fields Medals, 3 Nobel Prizes, 5 Wolf Prizes, and 2 Abel Prizes.The environment for participants is exceptional: a dedicated and purpose-designed building; office, computing and AV support including a state of practice multi-media environment for video recording, webcasting and videoconferencing; superb library support including over 40,000 books in Mathematical Sciences within 50 metres of the Institute and access to the full library of Cambridge University; the opportunity to interact with the wider community in Cambridge and nearby Institutes; and experienced staff who know what works, and who provide full support to organisers and participants, to enable them to focus on their science. Questionnaire responses show that the commitment of staff is hugely appreciated. Institute Programmes are generally of six, four or one month's duration, with usually two Programmes running in parallel, each with 20-30 scientists in residence. Programmes include particularly intense periods of instructional courses and workshops for 100 or more scientists, which are frequently held elsewhere in the UK to maximise opportunity for the UK community and access for early career researchers. The format is well-established and has been exceptionally successful in the 86 Programmes run to date. The collaborations established between UK scientists and with those from elsewhere often continue and bear fruit over a long period; this is fostered by one-week follow-up meetings to earlier Programmes. The Institute responds to shorter term needs through 'Open for Business' meetings with industry and business, and scoping meetings to support the development of innovative multidisciplinary proposals. The Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) is at the heart of a rigorous peer review process involving up to eight referees, to ensure that every Programme is of the highest quality. In forming their judgements, the SSC considers these reports in the context of: the quality of the research proposed; its timeliness; the opportunities it offers to bring together different branches of mathematics and/or application areas; demand from and value to the UK community; and the potential impact which the special environment of the Institute can engender. The SSC also takes account of activities at other Institutes world-wide. Out-reach activities of the Institute include involvement with the Cambridge Science Festival, and growing a network of people in business, primarily in the City, who value the Institute, and the opportunity that it gives to engage informally with leading scientists. More than 75 business people have been involved to date, and they will be the basis for a fundraising effort to help ensure the future well-being of the Institute, and that there are no financial barriers to participation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I016392/1","grantId":"EP/I016392/1","fundValue":"443222","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The science undertaken at the Institute covers the widest possible range from Astronomy to Zoology.
