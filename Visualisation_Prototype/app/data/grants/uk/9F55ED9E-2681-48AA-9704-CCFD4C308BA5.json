Improved access to, and use of these data, will ensure some of the major issues facing society can be tackled innovatively and efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>This will be achieved by safely managing and maximising the use of new anonymised, linked data from across sectors and government departments, and working across academic disciplines. This will create new evidence to guide development, implementation and evaluation of public policy and future research, as well as new methods to link and analyse data. Working as part of the Administrative Data Research Network, the Centre aims to develop new linked data resources, provide access to these data, ensure they are used safely and effectively, and develop research capacity.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L007517/1","grantId":"ES/L007517/1","fundValue":"11550200","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter William Smith","coPersons":["Gemma  Tetlow","Paul  Wilkinson","Ben  Anderson","Elizabeth Jane Shepherd","Lorraine Margaret Dearden","Richard Keith Wortley","G  Moon","Oswald George Parchment","Harry  Hemingway","Gabriele B.
