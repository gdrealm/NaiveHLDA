{"id":"D2A8B252-8929-4BDC-AC1B-A0BE36712BA8","title":"Framing Victims: Photographs of Jews in Holocaust Exhibitions in the UK and Germany","abstractText":"My project is an analysis of the use of photographs in the representation of Jews in Holocaust exhibitions in Britain and Germany. I concentrate on two exhibitions, each located at the heart of the national narrative of Britain and Germany: the permanent Holocaust exhibition in the Imperial War Museum in London, and the part of the Berlin Jewish Museum which addresses the Holocaust. In these two exhibitions, I investigate the production of meaning through the display of photographs.\\n\\nPhotographs play a significant part in narrating the history of the Holocaust in exhibitions. My interest lies primarily in photographs of Holocaust victims. I focus on three categories of photographs: family/private photographs, photographs of atrocities, and photographs of religious Jews. I argue that the ways in which photographs of Jews are chosen and displayed and what is excluded from view, reveal what curators wish visitors to see. The immediate setting of the display, the size of the photographs, the background on which they are placed, the lighting, the captioning or lack of captioning, all convey messages about the relevance of the Jewishness of victims of the Holocaust to the narration of its history. \\n\\nMy study presents a significant critical reflection on current exhibition production, highlighting the ways in which a display as a whole, and photographic presentations in particular, construct a moral narrative of the history of the Holocaust. I query whether the educational aim of Holocaust exhibitions is matched in the manner of display and whether interaction of visitors with the exhibiton of photographs is encouraged by its presentation. I explore how the physical layout of the exhibition narrative governs the engagement of visitors with the display. Holocaust education aims to enable visitors to question their own assumptions about the world in which they live. My study presents an analysis of the design of two significant European Holocaust exhibitions, and examines the possibilities offered by their physical layout to re-assess the contexts of the visitors' lives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G004196/1","grantId":"AH/G004196/1","fundValue":"23555","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Hannah  Holtschneider","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
