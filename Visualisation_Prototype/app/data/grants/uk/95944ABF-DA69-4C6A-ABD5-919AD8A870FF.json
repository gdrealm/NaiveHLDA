{"id":"95944ABF-DA69-4C6A-ABD5-919AD8A870FF","title":"Bringing the 4th Dimension to Chemical Crystallography - Time Resolved Photocrystallography","abstractText":"The importance of knowing the structure of a material to atomic resolution, the number and nature of the connectivities between the atoms, is fundamental in understanding the properties of the material. X-ray crystallography is the best method of obtaining the detailed structure of solid materials, and provides a 3D picture of the structure. However, until now, it is a technique that only looks as molecules in their ground (unreactive) state. In this proposal, for the first time, we wish to introduce the dimension of time into the crystallographic experiment. By combining the X-ray experiment with a synchronised light source, that activates the molecules into an excited (reactive) state, we will look at the structures of species with lifetimes of microseconds or even nanoseconds. To achieve this we need to build protective molecular cages around these photoreactive molecules, and to compare their solid state behaviour with what occurs in solution using time resolved IR techniques.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D058147/1","grantId":"EP/D058147/1","fundValue":"421928","fundStart":"2006-09-29","fundEnd":"2010-09-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings within this project have led to the development of a new class of metal-organic framework materials which have developed a new class of materials for subsequent academic study. One of the lead papers published from this study, Nature Chem., 2010, 2, 688 - 694, has been cited over 50 times and is developing a new field within the general area of MOFs.

This was achieved through the successful demonstration of the incorporation of photoactive components within framework systems and their subsequent investigation using X-ray diffraction techniques. Our high profile work is having an impact at an academic level which will ultimately feed into a greater understanding of photoactive materials notably for use in energy devices. Our results give insight into the nature of photochemical processes and this is having an impact on academic understanding in the wider photochemistry/photophysics field. Ultimately this will have an impact on researchers in the chemical industry developing new, clean methods of chemical synthesis using light and also in the energy sector for those developing new methods of light-harvesting.
