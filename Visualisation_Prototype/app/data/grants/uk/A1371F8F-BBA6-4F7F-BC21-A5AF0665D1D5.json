{"id":"A1371F8F-BBA6-4F7F-BC21-A5AF0665D1D5","title":"Transforming the high value joint replacement industry with additive manufacture","abstractText":"We plan to disrupt the existing supply chain model for orthopaedic surgery by utilising our pre-operative planning capability\nto drive the ordering process. Additive manufacture already enables us to fabricate customised high-accuracy one-off\nsurgical instrumentation for complex orthopaedic surgery. By defining up front the specific operative requirements in\nroutine cases we can reduce costs for both the hospital buying the goods, and the implant company. This happens in two\nways: by avoiding inventory costs and by greatly reducing the instrumentation needed for each procedure. These benefits\nare twinned with increased surgical accuracy, providing a higher value service for the patient. This project will develop an\ninnovative highly automated supply system, triggered by the surgeon's interactive request for an order. We will supply a\nsterile customised instrument set manufactured in the UK, along with the correctly sized implant direct to the hospital.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505146/1","grantId":"EP/L505146/1","fundValue":"100981","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Justin  Cobb","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
