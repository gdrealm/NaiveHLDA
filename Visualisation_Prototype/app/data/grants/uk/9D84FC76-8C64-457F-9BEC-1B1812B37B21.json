Even modern experimental methods do not provide sufficient temporal and spacial resolution to trace the development of fibrillation in samples of cardiac tissue, not to mention the heart in vivo. Advances in human genetics provide information on the impact of certain genes on cellular activity, but do not explain the resultant mechanisms by which fibrillation arises. Thus, for some genetic cardiac diseases, the first presenting symptom is death.Computer simulations of electrical activity in cardiac tissue have already led to developments in our understanding of heart fibrillation and sudden cardiac death and their impact is expected to increase significantly as we approach the ultimate goal of whole-heart modelling. Modelling the propagation of Action Potential through cardiac tissue is computationally expensive due to the huge number of equations per cell and the vast spacial and temporal scales required. The complexity of the problem encompasses the description of ionic currents underlying excitation of a single cell through the inhomogeneity of the tissue to the complex geometry of the whole heart. The timely running of computational models of cardiac tissue is increasingly dependent on the effective use of High Performance Computing (HPC). Current state of the art cardiac simulation tools are limited either by the availability of modern, detailed models, or by their ease of use. The miscellany of current model implementations leads many researchers to develop their own ad-hoc software, preventing them from both utilising the power of HPC effectively, and from collaborating fluidly. It is, therefore, impeding scientific progress.The aim of this project is to develop an HPC environment for biophysically and anatomically realistic simualtion of cardiac activity, an adaptable and extensible framework with which High Performance Computing may be harnessed by researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I029826/1","grantId":"EP/I029826/1","fundValue":"30824","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Henggui  Zhang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" Key findings: \n\n\n\n- Beatbox has been transferred from an in-house tool into a publicly\n\n available software distributed freely under GNU license, with\n\n auto-configuration infrastructure to be easily adaptable for new\n\n architecture, detailed user manual, automatic tests, and example\n\n scripts illustrating its use.\n\n\n\n- New technical features have been incorporated into the software: new\n\n solvers (multigrid elliptic solver for the bidomain model,\n\n alternating-direction timestepper for the diffusion); several new\n\n local kinetics/cardiac excitation kinetics models, both from CELLML\n\n and implemented from scratch or based on author code; examples of\n\n new anatomical models (human atrium, rabbit heart), including those\n\n that originate from MRI datasets, and new output and postprocessing\n\n facilities.\n\n\n\n- A workshop for the current and prospective users of Beatbox has been\n\n held, with presentations explaining principles and software\n\n solutions befhind it, as well as hands-in tutorials. \n\n\n\n- The software has been used in ongoing research which resulted in a\n\n number of journal publications and conference presentations. Some of\n\n the research results would be difficult or impossible to obtain with\n\n other existing software, for instance, arrythmogenic effect of\n\n nontrivial spatio-temporal changes of cardiac tissue properties\n\n (reperfusion arrhythmias) and complex behaviour of scroll waves in\n\n realistic atrial geomery subject to feedback-controlled low-voltage\n\n stimulation. The software is usable by pharmaceutical and biomedical industries, for &quot;in silico&quot; say for testing of new drugs or ICDs. It is also usable for education purposes, say by students of electrophysiology, both within and outside academia. Finally, some of the programming solutions are usable in software technology. The software is distributed freely under GNU license through author's website. \n\n\n\nThe research results are disseminated in the usual way, through open publications, conference presentations and personal contacts of the authors.
