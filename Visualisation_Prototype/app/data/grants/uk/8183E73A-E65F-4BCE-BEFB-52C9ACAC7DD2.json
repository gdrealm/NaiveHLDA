{"id":"8183E73A-E65F-4BCE-BEFB-52C9ACAC7DD2","title":"Cognitive Electrophysiology UK: Getting the Most from Studies of Memory, Language and Attention.","abstractText":"<p>This seminar series is designed to provide a forum for the UK’s cognitive electrophysiology researchers. Since the introduction of neuroimaging methods such as fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) the related technique of Event Related Potentials (ERPs, a measure of brain activity derived from EEG - the electroencapholgram) has become a mainstay of the human cognitive neuroimaging field. This method allows investigation of the functional and neural basis of abilities such as memory, attention and language, and provides fine-grained information about the time course of cognitive processing.</p> \n<p>The aim of the current proposal is to bring together the strong but widely distributed expertise that exists across the UK. At present there are a large number of researchers using similar ERP research methods to investigate similar questions about cognition, but who have very little direct interaction. The seminar series will bring together researchers, producing a web-based directory of ERP researchers in the UK, providing a forum for discussion on-line, and hopefully encouraging continued interaction and collaboration long after the series has finished. The series will also involve a series of meetings and training events, highlighting important methodological advances, and allowing the development of ‘best practice’ across researcher laboratories.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4113","grantId":"RES-451-25-4113","fundValue":"15375","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David Ian  Donaldson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
