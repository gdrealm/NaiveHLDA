Functional genetics.","abstractText":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease, which often affects young women. There is no effective treatment for MS. To develop new drugs it is necessary to understand in detail what kind of disease MS is. \nIt has been known for many year that there is a strong genetic component in MS, and there have been many attempts to identify the actual genes that predispose to the disease.\nWe will study a number of genes that play roles in the immune-response to shed light on which part of the immunesystem that contribute to the development of MS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800500","grantId":"G0800500","fundValue":"844248","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Lars  Fugger","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
