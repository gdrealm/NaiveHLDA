Over the last decades, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these systems has greatly improved, with extensive development and use of mathematical models. In sharp contrast, little is known about how these two crucial oscillators interact, and how these interactions affect cellular proliferation, DNA repair and apoptosis, in normal or cancer cells. On the one hand, the disruption of circadian clocks impairs cell physiology and quality of life. On the other hand, disruption of cell cycle, DNA repair or apoptosis can profoundly impact on cell and organism survival. Experimental and clinical data show that circadian disruption accelerates malignant proliferation, and that DNA damage can reset the circadian clock. Therefore, a central question to be addressed is how interactions between the circadian clock and the cell cycle affect cellular proliferation and (geno)toxic sensitivity in normal and cancer cells, and how this knowledge translates into new prevention or treatments. C5Sys integrates experimental, mathematical and bioinformatic approaches to explore the dynamic links between circadian clock and cell cycle, and their relevance for normal and malignant cell physiology and proliferation. C5Sys maps these interactions and the coupling between both oscillatory systems through a systems biology (SB) approach. C5Sys investigates how the circadian clock can act as a gatekeeper of cell cycle progression in normal and cancer cells. This will result in the identification of novel targets for these clock-cell cycle interactions, whose internal or external perturbations could affect cancer progression and/or could impact on cancer treatments. C5Sys assembles 7 European teams with extensive complementary background and wide international scientific recognition in the fields of circadian clocks, cancer dynamics, DNA repair and apoptosis, as well as bioinformatics, mathematical models and time series analysis and imaging. C5Sys is organised in 5 workpackages (WP), with tight mutual interactions between experimental, mathematical and statistical teams within and between WPs. C5Sys will: 1) map critical interaction nodes between circadian and cell cycle clocks, whose disruption is relevant for altered or malignant proliferation; 2) characterize the time scales in the signalling pathways, which are critical for the coupling of both biological clocks, including those operating at higher frequency; 3) determine the rhythmic signals whose disruption participates in malignant growth; 4) provide an integrated 'proliferative' cellular model incorporating circadian and cell cycle clocks and underlying rhythmic signalling pathways; 5) determine model properties in cancer cells; 6) probe the relevance of targeted interventions for disrupting or reinforcing the coupling of circadian clock and cell cycle in silico; and 7) attempt to provide in vitro and in vivo proof of principles of the relevance of model-based chronotherapeutic interventions. The novel cell lines, biomarker monitoring methods and mathematical tools, which will be developed as a result of this proposal, will circumvent current bottlenecks in the exploration of temporal changes in functional genomics and their potential therapeutic relevance for cancer. C5sys results will trigger 1) innovative chronotherapeutic research for several human diseases involving circadian and cell cycle systems and 2) dedicated technology development for scientific and biomedical applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I004521/1","grantId":"BB/I004521/1","fundValue":"246768","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Alan Rand","coPersons":["Sascha  Ott"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
