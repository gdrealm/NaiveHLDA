More than 80% of this heavy, unconventional oil, lies in the Western hemisphere, whereas more than 80% of conventional light oil lies in the Eastern hemisphere (mainly in the Middle East). Over the next 10-30 years, geopolitical factors, and also the emerging strength of Asian countries, especially India and China, will create increasing tensions and uncertainty, with regard to the availability and supply of crude oil. Alongside gas, nuclear and renewables, crude oil will continue to be an important part of the UK's 'energy mix' for decades to come. How will the crude oil we need for industry and transportation be obtained and will it be as secure as it was from the North Sea?The huge Athabasca Oil Sands deposits in Canada (1.5 trillion barrels) provides an opportunity for the UK to secure access to a long-term, stable supply. The first step towards this was the development of a new technology, THAI - 'Toe-to-Heel Air Injection', to produce Oil Sands bitumen and heavy oil. It was discovered by the Improved Oil Recovery group at the University Bath, in the 1990's, and is currently being field tested at Christina Lake, Alberta, Canada. In 1998, in collaboration with the Petroleum Recovery Institute (PRI), Calgary, Canada, the Bath group discovered another process, based on THAI, called CAPRI. The THAI-CAPRI processes have the potential to convert bitumen and heavy crude into virtually a light crude oil, of almost paraffin-like consistency, at a fraction of the cost of conventional surface processing. A surface upgrading plant has recently been proposed for the UK, at a cost of $2-3 billion.The advantage of CAPRI is that it creates a catalytic reactor in the petroleum reservoir, by 'sleeving' a layer of catalyst around the 500-100 m long horizontal production well, inside the reservoir. The high pressure and temperature of the reservoir enable the thermal cracking and hydroconversion reactions to take place, so that only light, converted oil is produced at the surface. Apart from the cost of the catalyst, which can be a standard refinery catalyst, the CAPRI reactor is virtually free! All that is needed is to inject compressed air, in order to propagate a combustion front in a 'toe-to-heel' manner along the horizontal production well.In collaboration with the University of Birmingham, the project will investigate the effectiveness of a range of catalyst for use in the CAPRI process. The University of Birmingham team, led by Dr. Joe Wood, will investigate the long-term survivability of the catalysts, which is critical to operation of CAPRI. Once the catalyst is emplaced around the horizontal well, it will be expensive to recover or replace it. Previous 3D combustion cell experiments conducted by the Bath team, only allowed catalyst operating periods of a few hours, whereas in practice, the catalyst will need to survive, remain active, for days, or weeks. The Bath team will undertake detailed studies to characterise the internal pore structure of the catalysts used in the experiments, to obtain fundamental information on catalyst deactivation, which can be related to the process conditions and oil composition. They will also develop a detailed numerical model of the CAPRI reactor. This will provide a tool to explore 'fine details' of the THAI-CAPRI process, which will aid in the selection/optimisation of the most suitable catalysts. The model will be incorporated into a larger model using the STARS reservoir simulator. Preliminary reservoir simulations will be made to explore the potential operating conditions for CAPRI.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E057977/1","grantId":"EP/E057977/1","fundValue":"422727","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Joseph  Wood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" The worldwide conventional crude oil demand is on the rise and because of the rising prices, unconventional oils are becoming more economically attractive to extract and refine. However, technological innovation is needed, if heavier oil supplies are to be further exploited. Toe-to-heel air injection (THAI), and its catalytic add-on (CAPRI) processes combine in-situ combustion with catalytic upgrading using an annular catalyst packed around the horizontal producer well. These techniques offer potentially higher recovery levels and lower environmental impact than alternative technologies, such as steam-based techniques. An experimental study is reported concerning the optimization of catalyst type and operating conditions for use in the THAI-CAPRI process. The feed oil was supplied from the Whitesands THAI pilot trial. Experiments were carried out using microreactors containing 10 g catalyst, with oil flow of 1 ml/min and gas flow of 0.5 l/min, under different temperatures, pressures and gas environments. Catalysts tested included alumina supported CoMo, NiMo and ZnO/CuO. It was found that there was a trade-off in operation temperature between upgrading performance and catalyst lifetime. At a pressure of 20 bar, operation at 500 _C led to an average of 6.1 _API upgrading of THAI oil to 18.9 _API, but catalyst lifetime was limited to 1.5 hours. Operation at 420 _C was found to be a suitable compromise, with upgrading by an average of 1.6 _API, and sometimes up to 3 _API, with catalyst lifetime extended to 77.5 hours. Coke deposition occurred within the first few hours of the reaction, such that the catalyst pore space became blocked. However, upgrading continued, suggesting that thermal reactions or reactions catalysed by hydrogen transfer from the coke itself play a part in the upgrading reaction mechanism. The CAPRI process was relatively insensitive to changes in reaction gas medium, gas flow rate and pressure, suggesting that the dissolution of hydrogen or methane from the gas phase does not play a key role in the upgrading reactions. By careful control of the temperature and oil flow rate in the in-situ CAPRI process, additional upgrading compared with the THAI process alone may be effected, resulting in a more valuable produced oil, which is easier to transport. The work is of interest to petrochemical companies including Petrobank Energy and Resources, who were a project partner. Alta Innovations at the University of Birmingham will assist with patents and technology transfer issues. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
