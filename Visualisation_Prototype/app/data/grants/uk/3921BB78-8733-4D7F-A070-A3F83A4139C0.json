It is also very common among children with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It left many children suffering from the bacterial resistance due to irrational use of antibiotics, especially in less developed rural area. Antibiotic widely abused in China, more severe in rural areas. However, few studies focused on this area in developing countries including China. We intend to carry out a feasibility study rural Guangxi, China to explore an effective approach of reducing irrational antibiotic prescription for upper respiratory infections (URTIs) among children. \nTo define the facilitators and barriers that influence antibiotic prescribing for childhood URIs in rural Guangxi, questionnaire will be used to interview policy makers from provincial, county Bureau of Health and leaders from township hospital. We will also interview these policy-makers, clinicians and caregivers to obtain their perspective opinions regarding rational antibiotic use. Then the theory based intervention package, which had been developed in Bangladesh and tested in Zhejiang province, will be evaluated in rural Guangxi once adapted further to be sensitive to the local context. Finally the intervention package will then be tested in 6 townships within one county. Six township hospitals will be divided into three groups. The arm A will be only targeted clinicians, with: operational guidelines and training on rational antibiotic use, mobile message reminder from pharmacist). Group B will be involving both clinicians and caregivers , which will include: the leaflet material and video information on rational antibiotic use, workshops between parents/caregivers and the trained kindergarten volunteers. The usual-care control group C will manage patients according to the clinicians' normal procedures without any intervention. \nWe will carry out the intervention for 6 months and collect inpatient and outpatient prescriptions for 6 months before and after interventions. A questionnaire survey will be conducted to see the changes among clinicians, caregivers and kindergarten teachers' knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) before and after intervention at each group. Interview and group discussion will be used to see if this study is feasible and acceptable with the intervention package. Also positive and negative factors for the intervention implementation will be carried out. We will assess effectiveness though the difference in the antibiotic prescriptions rate among all the prescriptions between before and after intervention and between intervention and control groups. Those preliminary data will help us to aid in planning a larger effectiveness study in whole Guangxi province.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M022161/1","grantId":"MR/M022161/1","fundValue":"151260","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Xiaolin  Wei","coPersons":["John  Walley","Qiang  Sun","Yanhong (Jessika)  Hu","Jun  Zeng","Mei  Lin","JIA  YIN","Guanyang  Zou"],"organisation":"Shandong University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
