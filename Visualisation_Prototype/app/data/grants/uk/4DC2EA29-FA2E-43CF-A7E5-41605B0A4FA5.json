{"id":"4DC2EA29-FA2E-43CF-A7E5-41605B0A4FA5","title":"Urban pollinators: their ecology and conservation","abstractText":"There are two schools of thought concerning the effect of urbanization on pollinating insects. On one hand, urbanization is considered to be one of the major causes of insect decline, in particular through the alteration of ecological features important to pollinators, such as food and nesting sites. On the other hand, some urban habitats are remarkably good for pollinators: 35% of hoverfly species known from the UK were recorded in a single garden in Leicester, and urban habitats are one of the few habitats where bumblebees are not declining. Our research will start by asking where pollinators are found in the UK landscape, by comparing pollinator diversity in three habitats: cities, farmland and nature reserves. Rather than just counting species though, we will use a systems approach to study the network of interactions between plants and their pollinators, as these interactions have a profound impact on a community's response to species loss, stress and ecological restoration. In the second stage of the proposed research, we will look in detail at the pollinator fauna of four cities (Bristol, Reading, Leeds and Edinburgh), with the aim of quantifying the value for pollinators of various city habitats. While ecologists know a little about the value of urban gardens for pollinators, practically nothing is known about the value of industrial estates, school grounds, allotments, graveyards and the many other habitats found in cities. Our pilot data suggest that some habitats can be remarkably good for pollinators, or can be managed to be so. Again a network approach will be used, and the impact of change will be predicted using an entirely new mathematical tool - one which combines data on the network of interactions linking pollinators to flowers with data on meta-community ecology (how the whole system of local pollination networks responds to species loss and species dispersal). In the final stage of our proposed research, we ask whether we can improve conditions for urban pollinators. We will use a large-scale field experiment, replicated in four cities, in which we will manipulate pollinator food supplies by introducing an urban version of the field margins sown with 'nectar flower mixtures' on farmland to conserve pollinators. Our plant mixes will be chosen to provide pollinator food, be low-maintenance, and look attractive to the human eye. Working with local professional conservation practitioners in each city (seven of these are named collaborators on the proposal), treatments will be implemented in a bold experimental design in four cities. As can be seen from the letters of support, our project will provide the exact data that practitioners need for evidence-based conservation management of pollinators. Moreover, The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 states that public authorities must have regard to conserving biodiversity. Evidence-based urban planning offers considerable promise for pollinator conservation. By using our data to understand the value and spatial properties of the urban habitat mosaic, Local Authorities will be able to integrate pollinator conservation into the 9% of land that comprises urban areas in the UK. Members of the proposed research team have the skills, experience and wherewithal to improve pollinator conservation significantly in the UK. Led by Memmott, the team consists of university-based pollination ecologists, taxonomists to identify the many hundreds of species that will be found, and conservation ecologists, with long-term interests and influence in urban areas, to implement the changes needed to conserve both the pollinators and the ecosystem services they provide. Our research proposal is exciting, timely, pioneering and ambitious. It is also very feasible, as a clear management structure is in place. We will provide both scientific excellence and immediate conservation impact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I000208/1","grantId":"BB/I000208/1","fundValue":"42431","fundStart":"2011-01-10","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Potts","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":" Pollinators supply a crucial ecological service, and finding ways to improve their lot is a major challenge. Urban environments are growing across the UK and flower-rich oases in otherwise uninviting city habitats could support large numbers of pollinators. Although urban areas are expanding1, outside urban nature reserves towns and cities provide little protection for biodiversity. Urban habitats have the potential to provide excellent conditions for pollinators however; for example half of Germany's entire bee fauna have been found in Berlin2 and 35% of British hoverfly species were sampled in a single Leicester garden3.\n\nThis project has been investigating three questions: 1) How does the insect pollinator biodiversity in urban areas compare to that of nature reserves and farmland? 2) Where are the hot-spots of insect pollinator biodiversity in urban environments? 3) How can we improve insect pollinator diversity and abundance in urban areas? The project team includes academics from the Universities of Bristol, Edinburgh, Leeds, and Reading, taxonomists at the National Museums of Wales, local councils, and local Wildlife Trusts.\n\n1. Comparing urban areas to farmland and nature reserves\nTo examine how the pollinator communities in urban areas compare to other habitats, the project team sampled pollinators in farmland, nature reserve and urban sites in and around 12 cities across the UK, from Dundee in the north to Southampton on the south coast. A dedicated team of fieldworkers recorded insects visiting flowers and the plant species on which they were feeding across the 36 sites. Results suggest that whilst urban areas contain fewer pollinators overall, the abundance and species richness of bees in urban areas is equivalent to or better than other habitats.\n\n2. Urban pollinator hotspots\nUrban habitats were sampled intensively in four cities (Bristol, Reading, Leeds and Edinburgh) over two years to quantify pollinator abundance and diversity in nine urban habitats. Pollinators were sampled in 360 different locations across the four cities and sampling sites included over 400 gardens. Other sites sampled were allotments, gardens, parks, cemeteries, car parks, urban nature reserves, road verges, other greenspace and manmade surfaces. Pollinators and flowering plants were recorded along sampling walks at each site. The preliminary findings suggest that allotments and gardens contain high numbers of pollinators. Multiplying the data up to the level of whole cities indicates that gardens are likely to provide key habitat for pollinators at a city scale as they contain high pollinator numbers and comprise approximately one third of urban land. Parks and other amenity greenspace are a key urban land type on which conservation efforts could be focused as they make up a large proportion of urban land but contain comparatively fewer pollinators.\n\n3. Urban flower meadows\nIn the third phase of the project we examined if the addition of urban flower meadows containing nectar- and pollen-rich plant species can improve conditions for pollinators in urban areas. In partnership with local councils, sixty large flower meadows were planted in areas of amenity grassland in Bristol, Reading, Leeds and Edinburgh in 2013. Three types of meadows were sown: a perennial mix, and two types of annual meadows with differing management strategies. Insect pollinators visiting meadow flowers were sampled at monthly intervals. Feedback from the public was incredibly positive and the meadows were popular with insects too. The results from this study are being collated and full analyses are yet to take place. Council and Wildlife Trust practitioners have been engaged with the project from its inception and the information will be made available to practitioners in a format that will allow them to apply the project findings in urban areas across the UK. The project impact plan comprised a conference for UK conservation practitioners and outreach work with schools in each of the four cities. The conference for practitioners took place in September 2014 generated much positive feedback and will guide the direction of future knowledge exchange activities.\n\nThroughout the project the team have engaged with the public and other stakeholders via the project website, blog and Twitter accounts to great success. Numerous outreach activities including talks to beekeepers and allotment associations and presentations at pollination festivals and Eco-schools events have enabled the research to reach a broad audience.
