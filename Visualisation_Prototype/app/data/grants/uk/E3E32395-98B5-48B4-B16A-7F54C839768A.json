This may be as a consequence of travelling as tourists to new areas; of urban regeneration; or as a result of cognitive decline, where the familiar becomes unfamiliar. This research explored the experiences, mechanisms and strategies used by older people to navigate unfamiliar as well as familiar urban spaces. Forty four participants who took part in a reality cave exercise, focus groups, a questionnaire and a sub group (10) who visited an unfamiliar area as pedestrians describe their use of landmarks, signage and their experience of navigating both familiar and unfamiliar town centres. \n\nLandmarks and distinctive buildings were more important than signage in navigating unfamiliar areas; however the meaning of space and memories attached to place were significant, particularly in familiar spaces. Sensory overload and confusion over spaces shared by traffic and pedestrians were barriers to navigation and a positive appreciation of the environment. Such experiences can contribute to policy and practice implications for planners in designing for an ageing population. Planners are committed to make public spaces 'older person friendly' but they need to provide a number of different cues for navigation within the environment to meet diverse needs of older people. Designing outdoor spaces and routes that are pleasant, accommodating, easily walkable and navigable is important in making the environment less worrisome so that older people are able to retain their independence.
