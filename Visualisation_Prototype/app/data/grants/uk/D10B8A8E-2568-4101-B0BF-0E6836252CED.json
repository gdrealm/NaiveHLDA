The basic idea behind our research is that oscillations of the abundance of a species in a location are decomposed by the frequency they occur there at, and we obtain their strength and phase as a function of time and frequency. \nOur mathematical analyses, undertaken so far, indicate that there is considerable variability in synchrony between species and that the abundance of the plankton species examined does not affect their synchrony. Two species show similar patterns to temperature. A manuscript describing these results: &quot;Climate-change-related regime shifts have affected spatial synchrony of plankton dynamics across the North Sea&quot;, with Emma Defriez as first author,was submitted earlier in the year to the Proceedings of the Royal Society. We expect that our work will, in due course, prove of value 1) in contributing to understanding of the rate and scale of environmental and climate change 2) applied to ecosystem and resource management of the seas around the UK and 3) make available new tools that can be applied in marine and terrestrial ecology.
