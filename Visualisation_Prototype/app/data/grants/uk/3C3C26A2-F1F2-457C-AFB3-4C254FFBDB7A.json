{"id":"3C3C26A2-F1F2-457C-AFB3-4C254FFBDB7A","title":"Wavescape","abstractText":"The video and sound installation WAVESCAPE forms a vital component of an ambitious body of work connected by underlying themes and threads.\\n\\nMuch of my photographic and video work has explored moments involving the encounter between people and nature, and the implicit human desire to experience the 'sublime'. I have been interested in exploring photography's fundamental role as a mediator, particularly in terms of imagery generated.\\n\\nThe Severn Bore wave is my inspiration and primary source material for this practice led research project. The banks of the Severn bear traces of the Bore; erosion etched into the landscape, and grasses and reeds broken down and covered in a fine layer of mud by the post-wave floods. There are also traces left by the crowds - areas of grass and reeds flattened by the shuffling of a crowd of individuals rather than by the continuous force of the wave. I am interested in these evidential traces and in how they signify the presence of the crowd in relation to the surge of the water. Furthermore, I am interested in how far the wave's status as 'event' is defined through the act of it being seen - through the presence of the crowd as witness, and in relation to the film, as a frame through which this natural phenomenon can be viewed. \\n\\nIn relation to 'meaning', it is a highly mobile phenomenon, existing in many different capacities depending on the context or agenda with which it is viewed. I am interested both in what these crowds bring to the event, and also in what inspires them to come in the first place: They are there to witness the spectacle, but through that, to connect with something that taps into the Romantic notion of the Sublime. I am interested in making a depiction of this event that is framed through the presence of the crowds because it is that presence which gives it a contemporary context, and which grounds it in the ordinary, the everyday. In these terms, I am interested in the relationship between contingency and the sublime, where the crowds seem to constitute the contingent frame for this sublime spectacle of nature.\\n\\nWorking with a professional film crew, I will film the crowds of people as they gather at night to watch the wave. Lit by an ambient single source spotlight, these clusters of people are fore-grounded as a key element in the entire spectacle. I am interested in building upon and critiquing the British pictorial landscape tradition through opening up more dynamic, self-conscious modes of engaging with representations of the Sublime in landscape art as well as the landscape itself. \\n\\nAs well as the filmed footage produced, I will gather sound from the midst of the crowds and this will form another crucial aspect of my source material. The sound is relevant as it will provide a strong sense of narrative to more abstract imagery. Spoken references to the wave; the time it's due, low level anxieties that it has been missed, or that it will not happen that night, combined with every day banter, jokes, reminiscences etc, will provide a counterpoint to the wave itself, which will be evoked through the sound of the water as it surges past. The sound track will dynamically combine both of these elements, grounding this sublime natural phenomenon into the context of the everyday vernacular.\\n\\nI'm interested in how this natural spectacle has played out over centuries, and is thus imbued with its own hidden narratives which are inextricably linked to the landscape, to time, to local mythology, to the cycles of the moon, and to the geography and sociology of the region. I am interested in how to infuse a landscape subject with narrative. I will aim to resolve formal questions of moving image and sound with an archaeology of place, and, through defining a relationship between the wave and its audience, in exploring the possibility of making a work that could function as a celebration of the vernacular sublime.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H038590/1","grantId":"AH/H038590/1","fundValue":"27359","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sophy  Rickett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Kingston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
