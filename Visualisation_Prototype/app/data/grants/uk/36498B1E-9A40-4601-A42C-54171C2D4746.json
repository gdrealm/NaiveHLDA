We would emphasise the extreme simplicity of the procedure described, the ease of preparation of a wide range of catalysts without need for chromatography, the absence of any sensitive materials or toxic heavy metals, the use of water as co-solvent, and the retention of double bond stereochemistry. The procedure requires no close monitoring, and provides remarkably clean reactions in an inexpensive, simple, and rapid process using minimal quantities of catalyst. Overall, the synthesis of a typical catalyst and the asymmetric oxidation together takes no longer than 6 hours. Further development by modification of catalyst structure and extension to functionalized alkene substrates is now desirable. This proposal alms to improve an these initial findings and we seek to prepare improved activity catalysts and to improve the scope aid generally of the approach. We plan to develop immobilised catalysts in which the catalysts are retained on the surface of inorganic supports by electrostatic Interaction. We plan to develop a new stable, fully reusable catalyst for important oxidation reactions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C523067/1","grantId":"EP/C523067/1","fundValue":"268115","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Hutchings","coPersons":["Philip  Page"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
