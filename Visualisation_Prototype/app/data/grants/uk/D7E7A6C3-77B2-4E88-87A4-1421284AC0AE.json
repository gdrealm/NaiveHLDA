The IP which we will exploit is the generation and detection of terahertz radiation from a new material (iron-doped indium gallium arsenide, Fe-InGaAs) which is showing tremendous potential for integration with relatively cheap telecoms wavelength lasers, which we developed using a recent EPSRC grant (PORTRAIT; EP/D50225X/1). We have protected use of this material for THz spectroscopy by a recent GB patent application (GB 0912512.1), and now seek to commercialize our results in order to push the wide-scale uptake of THz spectroscopy systems across a broad range of application areas, which include (but are not restricted to) the pharmaceutical, security, process monitoring, and medical sectors. In each area, there have been extensive demonstrations (by both academia and industrial R&amp;D laboratories) of the potential impact of THz spectroscopy, but the keys factors of price and lack of portability have so far limited commercial uptake. Our new material allows efficient THz emission using cheap and highly portable (1.55 micron) fibre lasers. We have shown that it is possible to construct fibre-coupled THz emitters and detectors using our material which offer greater flexibility and enhanced performance compared to existing technology. We now seek to create optimized prototype THz emitters and detector components, based on our recently patented new material, which will be appropriate for widespread applications of THz frequency range sensing across many sectors.Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) systems have wide-scale applicability, especially for the measurement of polycrystalline powders, which typically have characteristic fingerprint spectra in the THz frequency range. THz spectroscopy and imaging systems thus offer the possibility of non-contact characterization and monitoring of a wide range of materials, which include pharmaceutical drugs, drugs-of-abuse, and explosives, inter alia. We are targeting the pharmaceutical market during the Follow-on funding period, owing to the established use of THz technology there. THz-TDS is proven to have importance in the pharmaceutical industry owing to its ability to distinguish polymorphic forms, and the ability to penetrate tablet coatings and packaging. Furthermore, it provides complementary information to other vibrational spectroscopic techniques, particularly Raman spectroscopy, owing to the different selection rules governing which normal modes are observed. The US Food and Drug Administration guidance for pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, and quality assurance has explicitly placed process analytical technologies, such as THz-TDS, as central to innovation in pharmaceutical manufacture over the coming decade.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H029583/1","grantId":"EP/H029583/1","fundValue":"148329","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Edmund Harold  Linfield","coPersons":["John  Cunningham","Alexander Giles Davies","Alison  Marshall"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" There are a large number of potential applications for terahertz spectroscopy and imaging systems. In the academic sector, these range from understanding the vibrational structures of crystalline materials, to probing the fundamental excitations in semiconductors and nanostructures. In the industrial sector, applications range from process monitoring in the pharmaceutical industry, through to non-destructive testing, security scanning, and medical engineering. Yet, traditionally, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy systems have used 800 nm Ti:sapphire laser-based technologies. Not only does this lead to higher system costs, but it also means that it is not possible to benefit from the wide range of components that are readily accessible at telecommunication wavelengths (around 1550 nm).\n\nAn earlier EPSRC collaborative grant (PORTRAIT; EP/D50225X), with the University of Essex (PI), University College London, the University of Bath, and the Centre for Integrated Photonics (CIP, formally Corning, and now Huawei) aimed to address this and develop terahertz sources and detectors operating at 1550 nm wavelength. During this programme, Leeds demonstrated photoconductive emitters and receivers operating at 1550 nm, using Fe-doped InGaAs and InGaAsP grown by MOCVD at CIP. Detailed characterization was undertaken of the materials as a function of wavelength (750 - 1600 nm) using a Ti:sapphire pumped OPO system, and photoconductive switches structures were designed, fabricated and tested for use both as emitters and receivers. The performance matched, and indeed exceeded, that obtained using low-temperature-grown GaAs at 800 nm, opening up the possibility of developing and exploiting terahertz spectroscopy and imaging systems based on telecommunications-based technology. The results were jointly patented by the University of Leeds and CIP.\n\nThis EPSRC Follow-on Fund grant focused on developing commercialization opportunities for the technology. A detailed optimization of the detectors was undertaken, and a full 1550 nm system established based on Fe:doped photoconductive emitters and receivers. The reproducibility of the growth was studied in depth, and the effect of varying iron concentration on the emission and detection was investigated for both InGaAs and InGaAsP materials. It thus supported the development of the material as a potential commercial alternative to 800 nm GaAs-based photoconductive switch technologies. The patented, demonstration of 1550 nm components for generation and detection of terahertz frequency radiation led the award of an EPSRC programme grant (COTS; EP/J017671) with UCL, Cambridge and LCN to develop coherent terahertz systems. It also supported the award of an ERC Advanced Grant (TOSCA).
