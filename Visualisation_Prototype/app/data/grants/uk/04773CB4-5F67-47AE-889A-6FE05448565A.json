Current gas detectors fulfill\nthe legal requirements, but at a cost that limits widespread use, especially in the third world. The cost barrier cannot be\nbroken with current PCB - silicon chip solutions and a radical rethink is required. Hybrid plastic electronics and dedicated\nsilicon chips along with integrated gas sensors is a design that is now possible, combining the knowledge of a polymer\nelectronics company, gas detector company and dedicated silicon chip suppliers. This new system could also offer a\nradical new change in design allowing a wider acceptance of the product. This low cost gas detector can be the first\nproduct of a family of personal safety monitors, air quality cards and homeland security / first responder protection alarms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L50516X/1","grantId":"EP/L50516X/1","fundValue":"149137","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Henning  Sirringhaus","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
