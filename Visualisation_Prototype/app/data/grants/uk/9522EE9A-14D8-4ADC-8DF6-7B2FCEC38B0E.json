{"id":"9522EE9A-14D8-4ADC-8DF6-7B2FCEC38B0E","title":"New detection modes for droplet microfluidics","abstractText":"This project is based on the idea that the classical test tube in experimental biology can be replaced by miniature water-in-oil droplets. The droplet is the equivalent of an ultra-small test tube. Droplet volumes are typically in the femto- to nanolitre range. Furthermore, up to 10e10 droplet reactors fit into a millilitre-sized tube. Importantly, an equivalent number of experiments can be carried out simultaneously. The key idea is that the droplet compartment combines the functional molecule with information on its identity and a readout of its function. Thus the droplet contains everything needed to assess and decode a particular experiment or profile a library member. This system is ideally suited for directed evolution, because genotype and phenotype are combined in the droplet. We have recently performed directed protein evolution in this format (Kintses, B. et al &amp; Hollfelder, F. Chemistry &amp; Biology 2012, 19(8):1001-9) and now propose to add another detection mode for assays that are based on generation of a chromophore, to allow a wider range of biological functions to be screened.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K013629/1","grantId":"BB/K013629/1","fundValue":"87810","fundStart":"2013-08-31","fundEnd":"2014-07-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Darwinian evolution of enzyme relies on the ability to test millions of enzyme variants for their ability to make useful products. One of the most efficient ways of testing many variants is to compartmentalise them in picolitre droplets. We have established a new way of product detection in microdroplets (by absorbance) and are now using this new mode of product detection with two industrial partners to improvement of enzymes for 'green' and efficient manufacturing of pharmaceutical reagents.

We showed the utility of this device by performing selections for enzymes with improved activities. In this way large collections of enzyme variants (up to 10e5 per day) can be analysed. This facility will be used in protein engineering by 'directed evolution', a process in which randomised enzyme mutants are improved in iterative Darwinian selections. The ability to perform absorbance detection in microdroplets enables many new assays of enzymes for use in biotechnology. We are collaborating with two industrial partners to apply this technology to directed evolution of enzymes for green manufacturing.
