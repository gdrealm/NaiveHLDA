In response to this request, Dr. David Hemery CBE and colleagues developed a unique pupil-centred educational programme.</p>\n\n<p>The programme entitled 'Be the Best You Can Be' is, via the provision of teacher and peer coaching, designed to facilitate pupil awareness and responsibility. In doing so, pupils identify their own goals and are challenged to lead their own development.</p>\n\n<p>Supported by key education, government, and sporting agencies, it is intended that the programme will be integrated into the National Curriculum via Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education. With roll-out in mind, it is imperative that the programme is empirically tested, refined, and a better understanding of the experiences and needs of participants identified. </p>\n\n<p>Working in collaboration with stakeholders to ensure that the best use of social science is achieved and applied, the aim of this research is to examine whether the programme promotes positive changes in key learning and well-being outcomes. In addition to quantitative data from 10 schools, a mixed-method approach will be used to describe, analyse and explain the differing experiences of participants. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-177-25-0011","grantId":"RES-177-25-0011","fundValue":"80550","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our ESRC award helped us to refine, improve and evaluate the Be the Best You Can Be (BtBYCB) school-based intervention (http://www.21stcenturylegacy.com/). This programme was successfully launched by 21st Century Legacy in March 2011. BtBYCB aims to inspire, engage and empower young people to find their unique potential and to follow their dreams. In April 2012, the BtBYCB initiative was integrated into the New Curriculum for Secondary Schools (under the subject heading of PSHE; Key Stage 3). That is, via ASDAN Education, the completion of BtBYCB now results in 3-credits towards the Certificate of Personal Effectiveness GCSE equivalent qualification. By the end of 2013, BtBYCB had already been delivered to over 125,000 pupils in a diverse range of schools across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Dr David Hemery CBE, founder of 21st Century Legacy, &quot;Schools report that the enthusiasm generated by BtBYCB, driven by the programme's focus on personal agenda, is leading to increased aspirations in other areas of students' lives&quot;. The development of the programme received support from the Chair of Ofsted who commented that the unique characteristics of BtBYCB &quot;...gives your dynamic project a real credibility that is not often found in other projects whose aspirations may be similar&quot;.

By showing which aspects of the intervention work and why, the results have the potential to contribute to policy decisions as they relate to translating research into practice. Indeed, as the principles underpinning the proposed work (i.e., SDT) have been shown to be invariant, the methods of intervention and the mechanisms underpinning adaptive and sustained behaviour-change are of direct relevance to other domains. For example, direct impact may extend to research and practice in clinical settings (e.g., smoking cessation), medical sciences (e.g., preventive and behavioural medicine), and higher education sectors (e.g., promotion of autonomous and &quot;deep&quot; learning). Areas of policy-making that may benefit directly from the results include Local Authorities (including LEAs), Primary Care Trusts, and NHS schemes designed to target adaptive educational engagement, well-being and health. Further funding has already been sought in an attempt to bring such impact to fruition. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
