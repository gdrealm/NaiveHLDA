{"id":"911B3C4C-0C63-4967-A954-BB755D1946FE","title":"The influence of incentives on children s consumption of vegetables","abstractText":"The aim of this research project is to examine the effectiveness of incentives or rewards in child feeding with a view to improving the guidance given to parents in managing food refusal.\n\nThe diet of UK children is a source of great concern and evidence suggests that children growing up in the 1950s had healthier diets than the present generation who eat too much fat and sugar and far too few fruit and vegetables. This pattern of ‘modern malnutrition’ is a major contributing factor to the current epidemic of childhood obesity. \n\nParents report the frequent use of rewards to encourage their child to eat more healthily, but many feel that it is wrong to do so. This research project will explore the true impact of two types of reward (small and immediate, or tokens exchangeable for rewards at the end of the study) on children’s acceptance of vegetables compared with repeated tasting alone. \n\nThe results of the research will be disseminated to both academic and clinical audiences via conferences and papers in peer-reviewed journals, but will also be communicated to the public in the form of information leaflets distributed to health professionals or directly to parents, and as part of our existing training programmes for health workers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701864","grantId":"G0701864","fundValue":"423642","fundStart":"2008-09-15","fundEnd":"2011-11-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Lucy Jill Cooke","coPersons":["Helen  Croker","Jane  Wardle"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
