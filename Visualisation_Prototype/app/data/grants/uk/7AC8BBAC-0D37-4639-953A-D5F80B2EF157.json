{"id":"7AC8BBAC-0D37-4639-953A-D5F80B2EF157","title":"The development of catalytic Mitsunobu reactions","abstractText":"One of the major challenges facing chemists and chemical engineers today is the development of clean, energy efficient processes. Inherent in this problem is the necessity to selectively form chemical bonds under environmentally benign conditions. We propose to develop catalysts which will mediate clean, atom efficient versions of a family of chemical reactions used in academic and industrial laboratories worldwide. These reactions currently produce two molecules of waste for every molecule of product generated. In contrast, the only waste product produced by the proposed catalytic chemistry is water. The proposed research will result in cleaner chemical reactions which will be widely used in academic and industrial laboratories and is fundamentally significant to the fields of catalysis and green chemistry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H018034/1","grantId":"EP/H018034/1","fundValue":"99837","fundStart":"2010-03-08","fundEnd":"2011-03-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Within academia our findings have formed the basis of at least ten publications from other research groups which build upon our work.\nSome of the methods that we developed for the synthesis of alkyl chlorides are being used in pharmaceutical research laboratories for chemical synthesis of drug candidates.
