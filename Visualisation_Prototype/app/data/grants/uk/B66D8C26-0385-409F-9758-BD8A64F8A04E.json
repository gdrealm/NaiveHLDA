Recently it has been appreciated that the presence of disorder in organic semiconductors means that the dependence of mobility on carrier density is just as important as the field dependence. Current models are therefore unable to provide a consistent description of device performance under different conditions based on a single set of parameters, and the microscopic parameters extracted from models are often misleading. In this project we aim to develop improved models that take into account disorder, not just for carrier transport but also for charge separation and injection. We will validate these models against experimental data, particularly temperature-dependent data, and will assist in transferring successful models into the easy-to-use software packages developed and used by other partners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/I001980/1","grantId":"TS/I001980/1","fundValue":"144470","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our work has been implemented to improve a commercial device modelling software package produced by one of the industrial partners in the project.
