{"id":"94B8215F-CF0C-4D56-A849-BABF14378595","title":"Computational and cross-linguistic investigations of lexical stress","abstractText":"<p>Some words in English have stress on the first syllable ('ZEbra'), whereas others have stress on other syllables ('giRAFFE'). How do children learn to assign stress to words when reading, and does this vary across languages? It may be that the child learns to store the stress position in a lexical representation, or alternatively the child may apply rules based on letters or sublexical structure to assign stress. A third possibility is that children may use multiple probabilistic cues to assist in stress assignment. </p> \n<p>In coordination with an Australian ARC-funded grant at Charles Sturt University, this project will test the types of information that are available within different languages to assist in stress assignment. The two projects will use a combination of computational modelling, corpus analysis, and (in the Australian project) experimental techniques. </p> \n<p>The project tests&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>At what stage in reading, if at all, children are sensitive to probabilistic relationships between written, spoken, and grammatical category information and stress position;&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Whether a probabilistic approach to stress assignment is an adequate reflection of the developmental data;&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Whether there cross-linguistic relationships between written, spoken, and grammatical information and stress.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1975","grantId":"RES-000-22-1975","fundValue":"77535","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Padraic  Monaghan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
