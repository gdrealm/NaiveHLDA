We aim to develop a better understanding of why worry keeps going for people with GAD and then we hope to develop ways to help them worry less. \n\nPeople with GAD tend to make more negative interpretations of ambiguous information and focus their attention on negative information. We think this may keep worry going. To see whether this is the case, volunteers and clients in treatment for GAD will be invited to complete tasks that will measure their attention, the way they interpret information and how much their worry keeps going. New procedures will be developed to help people who worry direct their attention to more positive information and interpret information in a more positive way, to see if this helps people worry less. \n\nThis will enable us to improve talking therapies for GAD. Our findings will be published, presented at conferences and at workshops where people learn to do talking therapies for GAD.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400342","grantId":"G0400342","fundValue":"216983","fundStart":"2005-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Colette Rosanne Hirsch","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
