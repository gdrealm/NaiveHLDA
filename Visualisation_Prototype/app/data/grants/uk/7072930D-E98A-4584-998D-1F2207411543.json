Family business tend to have a less defined mode of decision making compared with non family businesses and often fail to practice sound managerial judgments when engaging in risky behaviour. This is not helped by the behaviour of family firm members when &quot;stewardship over the company is replaced by personal interests&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Existing research into FBs is largely descriptive and further research is needed. While family businesses take many forms, by definition they have to contend with the complexities of family life as part of the way that they deal with business challenges. Following on the work of Rajagopalan and Spreitzer (1996) we adopted their derived cognitive model of strategic change. </p>\n\n<p>The aim of the seminar series is to explore this model fully in the case of second generation family owned businesses and to explore whether strategic change passing from the first generation to the second generation is evolutionary. The aims of the six research seminars in the series will be achieved by setting out six defining questions on Strategic Thinking in Second Generation Family Business firms. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0735","grantId":"RES-451-26-0735","fundValue":"17904","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  O'Regan","coPersons":["Abby  Ghobadian","Ossie  Jones","Mark William Gilman","Umit Sezer Bititci"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
