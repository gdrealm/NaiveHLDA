Street demonstrators are often MORE connected to formal politics than non-demonstrators, and this pattern is even more pronounced for those who protest the most frequently and intensely.\nWe also discovered that climate change activists frame their message as part of a broader discourse for global justice. We have produced summary reports of all the UK protests we surveyed, which will be useful for all NGOs / social movement organisations staging street demonstrations.
