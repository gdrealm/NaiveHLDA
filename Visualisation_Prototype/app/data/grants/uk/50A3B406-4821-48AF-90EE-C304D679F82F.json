Unfortunately there is one main drawback in the technique, that being that typical XPS measurements are performed in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions (10-10 mbar), due to the need of minimising the chances of unfavourable collisions occurring before the excited photoelectrons reach the energy analyser. Due to this restraint, studying the surfaces of technologically important materials occurs at a pressure many orders of magnitude lower than the operational conditions of the systems themselves (1-50 bar). Bridging this so-called &quot;Pressure Gap&quot; has remained a significant technological challenge. Very recent developments in electron energy analyser and sample holder design have for the first time allowed photoelectron spectroscopic measurements to be performed in ambient pressures of up to 25 mbar. The opportunity to study &quot;real&quot; surfaces in-situ and in-operando is a step change in the field of photoelectron spectroscopy, and opens a new and vital chapter in the area of surface science.\n\nThe ambient pressure photoelectron spectroscopy (APPES) system is a state-of-the-art laboratory-based instrument with capabilities of performing high-energy resolution, low signal-to-noise photoemission measurements in up to 25 mbar ambient pressure with a number of different gases (O2, N2, H2, ethylene, acetylene). The instrument is equipped with a monochromated x-ray source and a high transmission, differentially pumped electron energy analyser. The system is fitted with an in-situ sample cell, which can provide a temperature range of 80 - 1100 K in the ambient atmospheres, permitting in-operando measurements. This specially designed modular in-situ cell, which is fully retractable from the analysis chamber, also allows standard UHV XPS comparative measurements to be performed with ease.\n\nThe APPES instrument based at the Department of Materials, Imperial College London will be highly multidisciplinary, covering five broad research themes (i) Energy; (ii) Catalysis; (iii) Electronic Materials; (iv) Biomaterials; (v) Environmental and Heritage Science. The instrument, while hosted at Imperial is engaged in highly collaborative research at a regional, national (including the Diamond Light Source) and international level, with access arrangements also provided through coordination the National XPS Facility (NEXUS) at the University of Newcastle. This new approach to providing wide- reaching access will allow the APPES technique to be fully exploited and generate world-leading cutting edge scientific output.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K004913/1","grantId":"EP/K004913/1","fundValue":"313049","fundStart":"2012-10-31","fundEnd":"2016-10-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  As stated in the Key Findings, as there has been a short timeframe since the instrument was delivered and commissioned in the laboratory, we have not yet had enough time to deliver impact. One area that our findings have driven is in the sale of additional instruments to other research institutions. \n\nWe expect that the instrument will deliver significant impact in each of the 5 research themes (catalysis, energy materials, electronic materials, biomaterials, environment and heritage science). The theme of catalysis has already secured an EPSRC award to study CO2 reduction catalysts using high-pressure XPS.\n\nWe have also secured another award to develop a reaction cell that permits the loading and measurement of vacuum sensitive samples into the instrument without the sample ever experiencing a vacuum environment. The &quot;BioCell&quot; will allow measurement of (principally) biomaterials without degrading the surface. This is the only known instrument capable of performing these measurements.

We have developed a unique system that allows the measurement of chemistry and physics of surfaces under a gaseous environment - compared to traditional vacuum measurements. The unique high-pressure reaction cell allows precision control of sample environment, thereby allowing controlled and reproducible measurements to be performed. The system was commissioned this summer (2014), so we still have a considerable amount of exciting research to perform. There are a number of publications in the process of being published based on this work. We have done extensive research to understand the behaviour of gas flow near the sample surface - which is very important to the high-pressure XPS community as knowing exactly the pressure of the surface at the point of measurement, is critical to understanding the surface chemistry. We are also implementing an upgrade to the system, which will increase the signal-to-noise of spectra and also reducing the time taken to perform experiments. All of these activities will be used by the wider (global) photoemission community\n\nThe system (the most-advanced of its kind) was built by a British-Swedish company in Hastings, UK. As a result of this award they have sold a number of additional high-pressure XPS systems (based on the design specified by the PI of this grant) to other research institutions (notably the University of Julich, Germany).
