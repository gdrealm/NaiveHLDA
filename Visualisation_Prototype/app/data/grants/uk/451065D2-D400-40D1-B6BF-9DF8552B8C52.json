Injured cartilage that does not heal by itself leads to osteoarthritis, a disease that destroys the surfaces of the joints. It brings about severe joint pain and reduced function, making it difficult to walk and sleep. The current National guidelines for treatment of osteoarthritis (NICE) offer treatment options limited mainly to symptom relief with pain-killers and physiotherapy, and recommend only one surgical procedure, joint replacement with an artificial prosthesis, indicated in advanced disease with joint failure. This involves major surgery, which is costly and invasive. The artificial joints rarely restore a full range of movement and, most importantly, they do not last forever. This is a major limitation for young individuals and very active people. There is therefore a medical need for the development of new treatments that can prevent or cure osteoarthritis at the early stages. Instead of using prostheses, regenerative medicine offers to repair the joints with the patients' own cells, which are grown in the laboratory and then implanted back in the knee to repair the cartilage. Unfortunately, growing cells from each patient is costly and cumbersome, and must be repeated for every single patient. An industrial production of large batches is difficult. Thus, for its costs and challenging manufacturing this technology is not routinely available.\n\nThe mission of our consortium is to regenerate fully functional and pain-free joints by implanting biological devices into cartilage lesions in key-hole surgery. The questions we want to address are how to 1) make a consistent and effective biological device (not metal or plastic); 2) make it available off-the-shelf; 3) make it easy to administer to patients.\n\nOur consortium sets out to link leading academic clinicians and scientists, in the UK (Universities of Cambridge, Aberdeen, Nottingham, Oxford and Queen Mary London) and The Netherlands (Universities of Rotterdam and Nijmegen), to bring together multiple disciplines such as engineering, biology, and material science, with the ultimate goal of clinical delivery to patient benefit. Our focus is on repair and regeneration of cartilage to prevent or alleviate symptoms in patients with early osteoarthritis, and ultimately provide a lifelong solution to restore a normal working pain-free joint, thereby avoiding joint replacement. \n\nRecent studies, largely from our laboratories, have identified special repair cells, called stem cells, which are naturally present in the joint of adult individuals and have capacity to form the repair cartilage tissue, when natural healing occurs. We have also identified chemical and physical means to artificially activate these cells within the joint. Therefore we now want to build special scaffold materials, which can be inserted into the cartilage wound and, through their physical characteristics or through the release of chemical substances, can attract the repair stem cells. Once these cells enter the scaffold material, they will proliferate and will find adequate stimuli to form cartilage. The scaffold material will be degraded over time, leaving a cartilage repair tissue that is exclusively made by the patient's own cells. \n\nThe research programme will go from bench to bedside and will respond to the needs of the healthcare providers, such as the NHS, and the expectations of the industry to develop novel treatments for osteoarthritis. These treatments will take the form of key-hole and minor surgery, which can be used throughout the NHS. Our goal is to make those treatments easily affordable, easy to apply and deliverable in day case, ultimately available to all patients without requirement for specialist centres.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L022893/1","grantId":"MR/L022893/1","fundValue":"1171130","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  McCaskie","coPersons":["Andrew  Carr","Jonathan Alistair Cook","Ruth Elizabeth Cameron","Frances Margaret Henson","Francesco  Dell'Accio","Anke Jozefien Roelofs","James Bruce Richardson","Kevin  Shakesheff","Serena  Best","Cosimo  De Bari","Giovanna  Nalesso","Brian Kevin Park"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
