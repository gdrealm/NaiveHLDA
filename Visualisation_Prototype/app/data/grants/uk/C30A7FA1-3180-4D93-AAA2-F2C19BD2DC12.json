The largest ice caps in the Arctic, and indeed the largest ice masses outside the Antarctic and\nGreenland ice sheets, are those of the Canadian Arctic islands. Importantly, new findings indicate that, for 2004-2009, a\nsharp increase in the rate of mass loss also makes the Canadian Arctic Archipelago the single largest contributor to global\nsea-level rise outside Greenland and Antarctica (Gardner et al., 2011, Nature). Each of these large Canadian ice caps is\ndivided into a series of drainage basins that flow into fjords via narrow, heavily crevassed fast-flowing outlet glaciers which\ndissect the islands' fringing mountains. A major question for scientists and policymakers is, therefore, how these ice caps\nwill continue to react to the temperature rises that are predicted for the 21st century, noting that Atmospheric General\nCirculation Models predict that temperature rise will be significantly greater in the Arctic than at lower latitudes. Numerical\nmodelling of large ice masses is constrained, however, by a lack of knowledge of the geometry and nature of the bed of\nthese outlet glaciers. We will acquire geophysical data from ice-cap outlet glaciers draining the large ice caps on Ellesmere\nand Devon islands in the Canadian Arctic using an airborne ice-penetrating radar, laser altimeter, gravimeter,\nmagnetometer and GPS instruments. We will focus on three key areas of each drainage basin: the heavily crevassed fastflowing\noutlet glaciers themselves, an upper transition zone between the ice-cap interior and the narrow outlet glaciers; and\nthe grounding zone marking the transition to floating ice tongues at the head of some Canadian High-Arctic fjords. Our \nscientific objectives are: (a) to determine ice-surface and subglacial-bed elevation; (b) to characterize the substrate, in\nparticular whether it is bedrock or deformable sediment; (c) to establish the distribution of subglacial melting; (d) to reveal\nbasal character changes at the transition zones between inland ice, outlet glaciers and the grounding zone; (e) to provide\nnew estimates of outlet glacier calving fluxes and their variability on up to decadal timescales. This information, integrated\nwith satellite datasets on outlet-glacier surface motion and our earlier observations of the regional-scale geometry of these\nice caps, will provide fundamental boundary conditions for the numerical modelling of these ice caps and, thus, how they\nmay respond to atmospheric and ocean warming over the coming decades, with implications for sea-level rise.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K004956/1","grantId":"NE/K004956/1","fundValue":"21133","fundStart":"2013-03-31","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Martin John Siegert","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" Satellite datasets covering the 104,000 km2 area of ice caps and outlet glaciers in the Canadian Arctic islands, the largest outside Greenland and Antarctica, have been used to map the ice extent and velocity structure in the whole archipelago.
