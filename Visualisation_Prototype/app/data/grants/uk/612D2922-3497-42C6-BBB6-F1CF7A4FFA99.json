It will explore the links between individual risk and time preferences and behaviour, with a focus on health and wellbeing. A representative sample of about half the respondents within the IP will take part into two experimental sessions, taking place at an interval of 12 months. In each session, risk and time preferences will be measured through experimental tests from behavioural economics involving real monetary stakes.</p>\n\n<p>Combined survey and experimental data will be then used to empirically test three specific research questions related to the “validity” of experimental measures, namely:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to which extent the survey and the experimental measures relate to each other and capture the same underlying attitudes</li>\n\n <li>the links between risk and time preferences and health-related behaviour</li>\n\n <li>the stability over time of risk and time preferences and their response to events and life changes.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001965/1","grantId":"ES/K001965/1","fundValue":"174671","fundStart":"2012-12-03","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matteo Maria Galizzi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
