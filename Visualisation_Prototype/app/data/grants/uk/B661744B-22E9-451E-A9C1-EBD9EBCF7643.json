A UK company CXR have developed an X-ray scanner with multiple sources that can be switched on in a predetermined sequence. This is much faster than the the conventional approach where a single source is rotated around the object. However the reconstruction of images from this sytem requires new mathematical theory and algorithms.The new fast system can also be used to monitor the flow of mixtures such as oil, gas and water in in pipes, an important problem in the oil extraction industry.In this project we will develop and test new reconstruction algorithms for these applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E010997/1","grantId":"EP/E010997/1","fundValue":"503594","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"William Robert Lionheart","coPersons":["Trevor  York"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
