{"id":"C3DAA021-A158-40A0-8711-DE2274C2C27F","title":"Stability and order preservation in chemical reaction networks","abstractText":"Networks of chemical reactions abound in nature. Despite internal and environmental fluctuations these &quot;chemical reaction networks&quot; (CRNs) often reliably perform some task. In biology, understanding this robustness is key to understanding processes such as metabolism and signalling, and thus to understanding disease; in chemical and biochemical engineering it is central to the design and control of reactors, and to minimising inefficiency and energy losses. \n\nWhile robustness is often found, instabilities can also be observed in CRNs. Sometimes instability can be catastrophic - chemical engineering disasters can often be traced to an unpredicted instability; but instability may also be useful - the role of calcium oscillations in biological signalling is a familiar example. The experimental and mathematical literature in this area provides numerous examples which illustrate the complex and sometimes counterintuitive behaviour of CRNs, and the need for more &quot;global&quot; theory to inform us on their behaviour. \n\nSome insight can be gained by simulating computer models of CRNs. But the limitations of this approach are illustrated by the fact that there are some well-known - and surprisingly small - systems of chemical reactions for which it is unknown whether there exists some choice of reaction rates (kinetics) at which the system can display &quot;switching&quot; behaviour or oscillation. The reason is that simulation, while extremely useful, can only provide information for some fixed kinetics. On the other hand, practical difficulties in experimental measurement mean that precise kinetic data is often not available for a CRN. Global theory fills the gap, begin able to explain reaction network behaviours from network structure. Recently, work in this area has seen some difficult problems reduced to simple, rapid calculation. \n\nThe aim of this project is to develop an important area in the global theory of chemical reaction networks. A key feature of this work will be to make minimal assumptions about the rates of reactions, and thus to derive conclusions based largely on qualitative knowledge of the interactions. A powerful body of mathematical theory, the theory of monotone dynamical systems, will provide the main tool for the analysis of CRNs. This requires both development of new areas within the theory, and imaginative application of the what is already available. Theoretical work, development of algorithms from the theory, and application to experimentally studied systems, will all be important components of the work to be undertaken.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J008826/1","grantId":"EP/J008826/1","fundValue":"100192","fundStart":"2012-02-13","fundEnd":"2014-08-12","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have not so far been used outside of research communities. However, this area of research has potential for considerable impact. Some of our papers and software produced during the EPSRC grant have had significant impact on research in this area, with the potential for impact beyond research communities. Most important amongst the outputs is the open source, web-based, tool we have produced (CoNtRol) allowing a non-expert user to get a rigorous, detailed, structure-based analysis of an arbitrary reaction network (up to size limitations). This opens up the possibility that experimental scientists/ engineers will begin to use this tool as a precursor to numerical work or experimentation. This structural analysis potentially allows more interesting questions to be asked, and can lead to more targeted numerical/ experimental work. While I am not aware of direct societal or economic impacts so far, the choice to focus considerable effort on building a powerful, user-friendly, cross-platform piece of software, greatly enhances the possibility of long-term impact.  ","person":"Murad  Banaji","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Portsmouth","findingsText":" With my research associate and collaborators, I have developed tools to identify families of chemical reaction networks (CRNs - these might occur, for example, as subnetworks in living cells) with behaviour restricted by the property of being &amp;quot;monotone&amp;quot;. These tools are both theoretical (we have proved that certain families necessarily are monotone); and algorithmic - we have written programs which are able to search for networks (upto certain size limitations) which are monotone. We were able to characterise those families which were monotone in certain ways (e.g. preserved &amp;quot;simplicial orders&amp;quot;), but were not successful in finding a complete characterisation in terms of network structure in general: however our attempts in this direction have convinced us that this is a difficult problem, and that there may never be a simple computable condition both necessary and sufficient to identify a network as monotone. \n\nIn addition to the work on identifying monotone chemical reaction networks, we have explored the implications of monotonicity combined with other commonly occurring features of chemical systems. This mathematical work has allowed us to prove that systems with certain combinations of features necessarily have very simple behaviour which does not depend on initial data or kinetic parameters. Networks with such simple behaviour provide the natural &amp;quot;building blocks&amp;quot; of more complex networks and provide insight into how, for example, biological networks can be controlled to encourage or discourage some particular behaviour. \n\nMy collaborators and I have also tackled a number of related questions on chemical networks, complementary to questions about monotonicity. With co-workers at Imperial, I did delicate and mathematically nontrivial work on necessary features for a chemical oscillator; and I have also been consolidating earlier strands of work identifying reaction networks which permit/ forbid multiple equilibria. Recently, with a co-worker at Kent, I have been developing theorems which can be broadly described as &amp;quot;thermodynamical&amp;quot; which explain a number of earlier results on CRNs as a consequence of a single feature, nonexpansivity with respect to an appropriate norm.\n\nFinally, the applications-oriented work has also inspired some elegant new mathematical theory (mainly in combinatorics, and in analysis) which has a life of its own beyond the applications. I have found, for example, interesting new results on qualitative matrices and graphs, and on the number and stability of equilibria in classes of dynamical systems which need not arise from chemistry. This work, which has been presented at conferences aimed mainly at pure mathematicians, has publicised the fact that chemical reaction networks are an application which generates interesting and nontrivial mathematical questions, potentially opening the door for the influx of more mathematicians into the area. Our work is already well-regarded and referred to in academic communities. For example a preprint (currently under review) on the possibility of multiple equilibria in CRNs has sparked considerable debate in the community, and is already referred to in several preprints by other research groups, despite not yet being published. Several of our theoretical results quite naturally lend themselves to development and generalisation, and we expect this to happen during the coming two-three years. In some cases we have theorems which have proved hard to cast as algorithms (namely where checking that a given CRN satisfies conditions of the theorem is algorithmically nontrivial), and we expect to see work on this occurring on the future. \n\nRegarding non-academic communities, we believe that publicising the algorithmic side of our work is the most important route towards impact. To this end we published a short paper in Bioinformatics aimed at experimental/ systems biologists (rather than mathematicians), describing this algorithmic work. We expect to see analysis via CoNtRol (our web-based platform for the autamated analysis of CRNs) figuring as a precursor to experimental studies, and also to see its batch-processing capabilities generating new hypotheses about CRNs.
