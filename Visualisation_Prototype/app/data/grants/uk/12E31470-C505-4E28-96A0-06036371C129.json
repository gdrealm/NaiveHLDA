In particular, the changing status of the image (with digital techniques) and of the body (with generic manipulation) is discussed. In both cases, previously fixed phenomena (the photograph and the human body) which seemed to promise singularity, authenticity and integrity are now being re-imagined as potential unstable imitations. This book argues that such transformations pose a cultural disturbance to our senses of selves and our relationships to others.\n\nAddressing debated in film studies, cultural studies, queer theory and women's studies, this project examines how film about generic engineering produces both clone ideas and images of scientific failure and monstrosity. Examining how these images of perfecting and deviation articulate, ideas about sexualised and racialised bodies, the book considers a selection of films both in terms of their own cinematic language and as symptoms of wider cultural anxieties, most especially about the separation of reproduction, kinship and sexuality.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111726/1","grantId":"111726/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jackie  Stacey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
