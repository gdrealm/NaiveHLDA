Research into memory is particularly important as it gives us our sense of identity. Deficits in learning and memory occur in many diseases, injuries and during aging. Identifying the key molecules involved in these processes, will help reveal targets for new therapeutic interventions to reverse the devastating consequences of memory loss, this research is particularly important for our aging population. The brain consists of many cells or neurons that communicate via connections called synapses. Information flows through neurons via small electrical impulses, a bit like a computer. At most synapses these electrical impulses cause release of chemicals that bind to the output neuron causing it to become more excitable and propagate the electrical impulse to the next neuron in the circuit. The brain also stores information during learning and retrieves it as memory. There are special parts of the brain for learning e.g. the hippocampus. When an animal experiences learning stimuli there is a persistent increase in synaptic transmission between hippocampal neurons called Long Term Potentiation (LTP), this increase continues after the original stimulus is removed and is a synaptic mechanism for learning. These long-term changes in synaptic activity can cause increases in synaptic growth and connections between neurons, a process called synaptic plasticity that is thought to be a synaptic mechanism of memory. LTP and learning is initiated by calcium (Ca2+) entering the neuron and activating an enzyme called Ca2+ responsive kinase (CaMKII). CaMKII is abundant in the brain, constituting 1-2% of its total protein and is one of the main synaptic proteins. Once activated by increased Ca2+, CaMKII is able to cause a switch in its own activity so that it remains active even after Ca2+ has gone down. This special ability of CaMKII to maintain its own activity has been termed 'the molecular memory switch' and is required for both LTP and learning. CaMKII then regulates the activity of other proteins at the synapse that together maintain the increased synaptic transmission of LTP. In addition CaMKII activity can lead to many of the other changes occurring during synaptic plasticity and memory formation. These CaMKII mediated changes in synaptic plasticity are required for learning and memory in most animals including Drosophila. Although fruitflies are small they are smart, for instance they can land on the ceiling and detect that fruit in your fruit bowl has gone off before you can. In this proposal we wish to study CaMKII-mediated synaptic mechanisms of learning and memory further taking advantage of powerful genetics of Drosophila. One important question we wish to answer is: How is CaMKII's activity regulated and localised at synapses during learning? We have found that in flies like in mammals, at inactive synapses with low levels of Ca2+, CaMKII can regulate its own activity by a second mechanism that tends to inactivate CaMKII. We found a novel protein that interacts with CaMKII at fly synapses called CASK that tends to inactivate CaMKII thereby disrupting the ability of CaMKII to undergo the molecular memory switch. These changes would be predicted to interfere with LTP-like events and learning and memory. Therefore in this proposal we wish to determine the direct role of CASK and CaMKII activity in synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory using flies. To achieve this we will make new fly CaMKII and CASK mutants and determine the effect of these together or alone on a range of synaptic events in parts of the fly brain that mediate learning and memory. Finally we will determine the role of CaMKII and CASK in the fly's learning and memory behaviour. This will provide important insight into how brains have evolved their huge capacity to acquire and store information.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G008973/1","grantId":"BB/G008973/1","fundValue":"432783","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This research has lead to at least 8 peer reviewed research articles in international journals.

This communication is initiated through a chemical process triggered by calcium entering brain cells and activating a key enzyme called 'Ca2+ responsive kinase' (CaMKII). Once CaMKII is activated by calcium it triggers a switch in its own activity, enabling it to remain active even after the calcium has gone. This special ability of CaMKII to maintain its own activity has been termed 'the molecular memory switch'.\nBut, until now, the question still remained as to what regulates this key chemical process that allows us to learn and form long-term memories. \nResearchers from the University's School of Physiology and Pharmacology, conducted experiments using the fruit fly (Drosophila) to analyse and identify the molecular mechanisms controlling this switch. Using advanced molecular genetic techniques that allowed them to temporarily inhibit the flies' memory, the team were able to identify a gene called CASK as the synaptic molecule regulating the switch. The findings were published in Frontiers in Neural Circuits.\nDr James Hodge, the study's lead author, said, &quot;Fruit flies are remarkably compatible for this type of study as they are both highly genetically tractable and possess similar neuronal functions as humans&quot;. \nMemory test\nIn experiments to test learning and memory ability, the team trained flies to recognise two odours, one associated with a mild shock, the other without a shock. They found that around 90% were able to learn to avoid the odour associated with a shock after just one cycle of training. \nThe team also found that flies lacking the CASK and CaMKII genes showed disrupted memory formation. In repeat memory tests, flies lacking these key genes were shown to have no ability to remember at three hours (mid-term memory) and 24 hours (long-term memory), although their initial learning or short-term memory wasn't affected.\nFinally, the team introduced a copy of the human CASK gene into the genome of a fly that completely lacked its own CASK gene and was, therefore, not usually able to remember. They showed that flies which had a copy of the human CASK gene expressed in the part of their brain dedicated to learning could remember like a normal wildtype fly. \nDr Hodge said, &quot;These findings not only pave the way for us to develop new therapies which reverse the effects of memory loss but also prove the compatibility of Drosophila to model these diseases in the lab and screen for new drugs to treat dementia and age-related memory decline. Furthermore, this work provides an important insight into how brains have evolved their huge capacity to acquire and store information.&quot;\n\nFurther reading\nCASK and CaMKII function in the mushroom body ?'/ss' neurons during Drosophila memory formation.

We wish to study this aging process in the lab.\no We wish to know if manipulation of certain learning genes and changes in diet can improve the memory of these aged flies and allow them to have the memory of young flies again.\no Ultimately this will help the development of much needed treatments for age-related memory impairment and dementia.
