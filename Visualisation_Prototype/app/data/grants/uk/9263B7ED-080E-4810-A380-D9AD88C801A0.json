{"id":"9263B7ED-080E-4810-A380-D9AD88C801A0","title":"Queen's University Belfast Consolidated Grant 2014 - 2017","abstractText":"Our Consolidated Grant brings together research projects in astrophysics within the Astrophysics Research Centre, and atomic physics calculations within the Centre for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, plus collaborative work between the two Centres, in a programme which covers all of the AGP-funded activities within the School of Mathematics and Physics at Queen's University Belfast. The programme is diverse, involving observational and theoretical studies of astrophysical sources ranging from the Sun to solar system bodies (asteroids and comets), planets orbiting stars other than the Sun (exoplanets), interstellar clouds of gas where stars are forming, and exploding stars in distant galaxies (supernovae). It also includes the calculation of data for atomic processes in very complex ions, such as singly ionized iron (Fe II), and the application of these results to a range of astronomical objects, such as highly active, intrinsically bright galaxies called quasars, which are at extremely large distances and hence observed when the Universe was very young.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L000709/1","grantId":"ST/L000709/1","fundValue":"1674430","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Our publications are academic in nature and have been used by other members of the astronomical community to inform their own research plans (such as followup work and papers).
