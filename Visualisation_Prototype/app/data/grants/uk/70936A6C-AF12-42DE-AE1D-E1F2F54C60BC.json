{"id":"70936A6C-AF12-42DE-AE1D-E1F2F54C60BC","title":"Full Proposal for a Smiths University Strategic Partnership in Advanced Electrical Power and Actuation Systems","abstractText":"This proposal describes the establishment of a Smiths Aerospace University Technology Strategic Partnership Centre (SA UTSP) at the University of Nottingham in collaboration with the University of Warwick. The partnership involves the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the School of Mechanical, Manufacturing and Materials Engineering at Nottingham and the School of Engineering - Electrical and Electronic Division at Warwick.The UTSP has a five year plan to research advanced power management, advanced power distribution and drives and advanced actuation in order to further the development of the more electric aircraft for civil, military and UAV applications. Six research streams focus on:o Integrative system modelling and electrical power system architectures,o Technologies and techniques for advanced power switching,o Technologies and strategies for high reliability actuation systems,o Technologies and strategies for enhanced heat transfer in aerospace systems,o Technologies for system integrity implementation / diagnosis and prognosiso Power converter topologies and control for electrical aircraft systems and power management.These core streams are expected to expand and attract other funding as the UTSP becomes established. The project aims, through its core streams, to close the gap between dream and reality in order to make a convincing case for the more electric aircraft. This requires work in two distinct research fields. The first is to find the optimal methods of using existing device capabilities and technologies and to identify any critical need for technology improvement. Determination of the most appropriate power system architecture is an example. The second is to research improved devices, which overcome the known limitations of existing components. Solid-state primary distribution switches and high power to weight ratio actuators are examples here. There are however five basic requirements to fulfil in each case. These are; minimum eventual projected cost, minimum weight, minimum volume, maximum reliability and maximum functionality.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D032377/1","grantId":"EP/D032377/1","fundValue":"1374950","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project concerned the establishment of a Smiths Aerospace University Technology Strategic Partnership Centre (SA\nUTSP) at the University of Nottingham in collaboration with the University of Warwick.

The findings are being taken forward to higher TRL levels in a number of ways. These include a follow on GE UTSP (100% industry funded) and subsequently UTSP 2020 (100% industry funded) and major EU Aerospace programmes (for example Clean Sky). In all cases the impact is to improve More Electric Aircraft performance with follow-on impacts of reduced environmental impact and lower transport costs.
