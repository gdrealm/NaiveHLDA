They are managed in three separate statistical offices and the data are not released to researchers' desktops for analysis.&nbsp; To date there has been little thought about how integrated projects might be undertaken with these three studies. This is an important issue as there are significant demographic and health differences between these three constituent parts of the UK which are under-explored.&nbsp; This project considers a range of practical issues associated with undertaking such comparative research, and to do this an original research project will be undertaken which draws on information from all three. The substantive focus of the project will be analysing the association between self reported health and long-term illness in the 2001 Census and subsequent mortality and how this relates to socio-economic status and location. This project will be an exemplar of how to undertake UK analyses of the three sources in combination and deal with the various statistical (different sampling fractions etc) procedural/technical (different variable names etc) and other challenges posed.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-348-25-0013","grantId":"RES-348-25-0013","fundValue":"78682","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emily M D  Grundy","coPersons":["Paul  Boyle","Dermot  O'Reilly"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
