Campylobacter jejuni, the most frequently reported food-borne pathogen associated with\nhuman illness in the UK, causes over 460,000 reported cases of campylobacteriosis annually, leading to over 22,000\nhospitalisations and 100 deaths, at a cost to the UK government of over &pound;900 million. While substantial research funding\nhas been invested by the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) and other organisations across the farm to fork continuum, the\nindustry is currently focussed on Campylobacter reduction using carcass processing interventions such as rapid surface\nchilling rather than on farm-level interventions which would serve to prevent/reduce the substantial impact C. jejuni infection\nhas recently been estimated to have on animal health and welfare in intensively farmed poultry.\nThe aim of this research is to develop a commercially viable on-farm real time portable sampling and detection tool to\ndetermine the Campylobacter status of flocks during production and prior to slaughter. The preliminary research to be\ncarried out by this team will use an appropriate extraction system in synergy with GC-MS technology to capture and identify\nunique volatiles released through the metabolic activities of Campylobacter. Determination of detectable levels of known\nCampylobacter-associated volatiles will be investigated using several species and strains of Campylobacter in pure culture\nand in the presence of a range of different background materials (e.g. chicken faeces; litter) at different stages of growth.\nScreening for Campylobacter-associated volatiles in chicken (and possibly other poultry) faecal material using confirmed\nCampylobacter-positive and -negative samples will also be conducted, including PCR identiication of isolates as required.\nThe unique volatiles identified by GC-MS will then be used to optimise the sensor, and on-farm detection will be re-evaluated\nusing adsorbents containing trapped volatiles. The Harper Adams team will utilise a competent, post-doctoral\nanalytical chemist who will be supported by Dr Lynn McIntyre with her wealth of knowledge on Campylobacter biology and\nby Dr Frank Vriesekoop who brings expertise in pathogen physiology and the application of analytical chemistry and\nmethod development.\nA number of potential applications and benefits are associated with the development of this testing platform which could\nextend beyond the single issue of Campylobacter detection in poultry to multiple target pathogens/analytes of relevance to\ncrops and animals such as E. coli O157, Salmonella, mycotoxins and botrytis, and detection of specific diseases such as tuberculosis and mastitis. In relation to this specific application, the development of a hand held air sampling device\ncapable of instantaneously detecting the presence of Campylobacter would offer a real time detection method not currently\navailable to the poultry industry which could be applied at various points in the poultry production chain, from hatchery\nthrough farm production and processing, to the retail level. The ability to make simple frequent measurements to\naccurately pinpoint disease onset would enable farm/area mangers to identify potential links to farm activities and biosecurity practices, which is not currently possible using pathogen culture or PCR protocols. Likewise, such a detection system could be used during processing to assess the impact of carcass reduction strategies. Empowering poultry industry staff to make changes that can reduce the incidence of Campylobacter in poultry destined for the retail market would ultimately result in the greatest benefit; that of a reduction in public health burden associated with this zoonotic pathogen.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M028364/1","grantId":"BB/M028364/1","fundValue":"136564","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Lynn  McIntyre","coPersons":["Frank  Vriesekoop"],"organisation":"Harper Adams University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
