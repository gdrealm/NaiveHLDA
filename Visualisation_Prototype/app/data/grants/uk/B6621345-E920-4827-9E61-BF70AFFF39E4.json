A vast amount has been written about the country house and its owner. Much of it has focused either on consumption as part of wider estate finances (funded through marriage settlements, mortgages and credit, and analysed in terms of income and expenditure) or on luxury goods and the outcomes of consumption - goods as 'art' collections and the country house as the embodiment of social and cultural capital. Little attention has been paid to everyday goods (and their relationship to luxuries) or to the mundane processes of consumption and the systems of supply which met the needs and wants of the elite. \\nRather than offer another description of the material culture of the country house, this project engages with several wider debates. The first centres on changing cultures of consumption. Eschewing simple notions of conspicuous consumption or of the elite as connoisseurs, the project will establish how they fitted into wider patterns of consumer behaviour usually examined through the activities of the middling sorts. Second, by focusing on the systems of supply and the processes of acquiring goods, it stresses the everyday practicalities of consumption and the relationship between buyers and sellers, exploring the extent to which 'ordinary' tradesmen were seen as arbiters of taste. Third, it links to debates over the value systems which shaped consumption. At one level, the research explores the interaction between national and local identities: specifically the position of London in structuring and articulating consumption. At another it foregrounds neighbourly, familial and inter-generational relationships, and shows how a better understanding of the disposal as well as the accumulation of goods provides important insights into consumer motivations.\\nThese debates are explored through a comparative study of two Warwickshire houses and their owners: Stoneleigh Abbey owned by the Leighs and Alscot Park owned from 1749 by the Wests. By the mid 18th century, both families were very wealthy by county standards and enjoyed national connections as well as considerable local influence. They can be seen as typical of two strands of the provincial gentry: the Leighs were an old-established family, present in Warwickshire from the 16th century; John West came to the county having made his money from trade and politics in London - he was thus arriviste and strongly metropolitan. In their similarities and differences, they afford insights into wider practices and attitudes amongst the provincial elite and consumers in general.\\nThe significance of this research stretches far beyond a better knowledge of elite consumption. First, it will revise our understanding of the practices and motivations of consumers during a key period of transformation in domestic material culture and consumerism. In particular, it challenges established theorisations of consumption as primarily an expression of social status, stressing instead the heterogeneity of cultural capital, and the everyday, contingent and relational nature of consumer behaviour. Second, by exploring the ways in which people operated as part of a national and local elite, but also as family members and as individuals with their own tastes and value systems, the research questions the relationship between (social) structures and individual agency. Third, it throws new light on the nature and construction of provincial culture, building on a growing appreciation of the resilience of local identity through the 18th century to challenge the overweening importance accorded to national-metropolitan systems of taste. \\nBeyond the realm of academia, the research will provide the wider public with a more nuanced understanding of the workings of the country house, and offer the heritage industry opportunities to present different narratives of the country house as a lived space.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H008365/1","grantId":"AH/H008365/1","fundValue":"160139","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings of this research project have been and continue to be used to produce a range of outputs aimed primarily at academic audiences, including journal articles, book chapters and conference papers.

Our research on the Leighs of Stoneleigh Abbey, Newdigates of Arbury Hall and Drydens of Canons Ashby has revealed a number of important findings:\n\n\n\n1. In contrast with the popular image of spendthrift behaviour, elite spending was often carefully managed to keep it within the bounds of income. Sustained periods of high spending were rare, one of two broad behavioural patterns being adopted. In some families (e.g. Leighs), there were short bursts of conspicuous spending, generally occurring at points of inheritance – a finding which supports Amanda Vickery’s argument regarding family cycles and the costs of setting up a household. Other families (Newdigates) spread their spending more evenly, maintaining a relatively steady level of expenditure on long-term projects of building or refurbishment. \n\n\n\n2. The number of children to be provided was an important factor in shaping spending patterns, but more significant was the early death of the owner and periods of trusteeship brought about by minority or mental illness. These limited conspicuous consumption and allowed the estate to be closely managed. These findings support the important, but often overlooked, conclusions arrived at by Peter Roebuck in his study of Yorkshire gentry landowners, and suggest a ‘habit’ of consumption across elite society not defined by any precise location in the landed order\n\n\n\n3. Spending was also moderated by the retention of many older items alongside those newly purchased. This was most evident in terms of furniture and household goods which were often moved around and between houses to accommodate and complement new goods. This was motivated in part by utility and in part by notions of patina, which remained a strong influence on elite cultures of consumption despite the growing importance of novelty. \n\n\n\n4. Elite material culture was shaped by the imperatives of fashion and luxury, but these were tempered by specifically aristocratic concerns for traditional markers of heritance and by the particular tastes, interests and lifestyles of the individual. Whilst these were constrained by the expectations of status and position in society, individual preference was important in interpreting the normalising influence of taste and fashion. Yet elite consumption was also a social activity, shaped by the needs, desires and advice of family and friends.\n\n\n\n5. The objects and opulence we associate with the aristocracy did not form the backbone of their consumption habits. Indeed, in most years, the largest proportion of elite expenditure comprised everyday items such as provisions, groceries, cleaning and servants’ wages. Such practical considerations form an often-overlooked point of connection between households of rich and poor.\n\n\n\n6. The processes and patterns of supply which maintained the country house were complex and variegated. Local towns and villages were important points of supply, even for some luxury goods. Conversely, whilst London dominated in the provision of high-end goods, it metropolitan tradesmen also supplied everyday goods, in part because London was ‘local’ during the season when the elite took up residence there. Custom was spread widely amongst suppliers, with a relatively small number establishing long-term relationships, usually on the basis of reputation and trust. The project has many potential applications outside academia, some of which are already beginning to be put into effect.\n\n1. The research findings offer the study houses insights into what are often neglected aspects of their history. Exploiting these insights can offer new ways of interpreting the house for visitors. This has been put into practice at Stoneleigh Abbey, where leaflet outlining the consumption practices of two owners (Edward and Mary Leigh: Children of Stoneleigh Abbey, 1749-1806) have been distributed to visitors. A poster exhibition on Mary Leigh has also been mounted since 2012 and guides for younger visitors provided in the same year.\nAt Canons Ashby, the research was mined to provide the basis for Storytelling at the house during the 2012 season. It has also been used to construct a smart phone app which forms an interactive guide to the house.\n\n2. The approach taken by the research offers an innovative way of presenting country houses to the visiting public by emphasising them as lived spaces and sites of consumption. Rather than view the house as a series of set pieces, it might be possible to think of and present it more in terms of the flows of goods and people that moved through the house. This ties into the growing interest in making narratives part of country house visiting and offers the potential to engage visitors in the everyday lives of country house owners by presenting them as consumers who, like us, had to shop negotiate with tradesmen, acquire new things and discard others, and, in doing so, relate to family and neighbours.\n\n3. Specific research on inventories of the house contents offers the potential to reconstruct in detail the contents of particular rooms and to mark changes in fashion and taste over the generations. Perhaps most excitingly, this has formed the basis of a smart phone app which provides an interactive guide to Canons Ashby. Visitors choose which elements of the house to focus on, thus escaping from the necessity of always telling just one story through the presentation of the room/house. \n\n4. The project also offers the opportunity to bring together academic research and practitioners within the heritage industry, especially those involved in the interpretation and presentation of country houses. This has been put into practice through two mechanisms. First, the project has a dedicated website (http://consumptionandthecountryhouse.ning.com/) which offers a forum through which researchers, practitioners and others can exchange information, ideas and opinions. More formally, there was an international conference, co-sponsored by English Heritage (18-19th April 2012 at the University of Northampton), which brought together academics, curators and historical interpreters to present research findings and interpretative practice. The success of this led to a follow-up conference (15-16th September 2014) which again attracted over 60 delegates from across Europe.\n\n5. Disseminating the research findings provides the opportunity to engage the interest of the wider public, not simply in country houses, but more particularly in the ways in which they might best understand them as dynamic and lived spaces. Bringing to the fore the people who lived and worked in these places, and highlighting the decisions they made about buying and using goods helps to provide a real point of contact between past and present, and between the aristocracy and ordinary people. To this end, the project has sought to disseminate findings through popular history publications (BBC History magazine, July 2011) and talks to various Local History Societies.
