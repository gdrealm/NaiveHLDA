In rat experiments we have found a type of cell which can be cultured from a stem cell present in adult tissues. When transplanted into an injury site, these cells induce regrowth of the severed nerve fibres and restore function. We seek to provide the information needed to translate this to a first clinical trial in a specific type of human injury which is usually the result of traffic accidents, and where nerves are torn out of the spinal cord. Such injuries lead to paralysis, loss of sensation, loss of bowel and bladder control, sexual functions, and frequently intractable pain.\n\nThere is already, in our hospital, a routine procedure for re-implanting the severed nerves. This leads to some recovery of the larger muscles, but the hand remains paralysed and the leg cannot be used in walking. No sensation is restored, and there is a limited reduction of pain. In initial experiments in a rat model the transplanted cells bring back the sensation needed for hand movements and increase the outgrowth of nerve fibres from the spinal cord. This proposal is to determine:\n\n(a) the range of sensations which can be restored by these transplants and \n\n(b) the extent to which leg movements can be restored. This will provide the evidence needed to translate this experimental data to a clinical trial.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J015369/1","grantId":"MR/J015369/1","fundValue":"361934","fundStart":"2012-10-15","fundEnd":"2015-10-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ying  Li","coPersons":["David  Choi","Daqing  Li"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
