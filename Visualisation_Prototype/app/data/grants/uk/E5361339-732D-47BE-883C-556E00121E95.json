Formal and informal aspects of schools are inter-related. Social capital influences young people’s cultural capital, via perceptions of, and participation in formal curricula. Formal aspects of school (e.g. curricula, spatiality of classrooms/units, (de)valuing practices) affect young people’s sociality.\n\n\n\nEmotional capital underpins social capital (Holt et al., 2013); young people’s sociality is largely based on emotional recognition, not rational attempts to gain advantage.\n\n\n\nYoung people’s social relationships are complex; simultaneously but variously nurturing and conflictual, with inclusions, exclusions and subtle messages about relative value reproduced along a variety of grounds. \n\n\n\nDifferent geographies of socio-cultural expression exist, tied to factors including: age, social class, gender, and broader socio-spatial contexts of schools and homes. E.g. in some schools more conflictual expressions of sociality are typical, whereas in others exclusions and marginalisations are more subtle.\n\n\n\nThose with SEN, especially BESD, are often excluded and devalued, especially those also from socio-economically disadvantaged homes (Holt et al., in prep).\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent spaces\n\nGeographical differences exist at variety of scales; within/between schools and LAs are specific sites where policies and practices are interpreted (Lea et al., in prep.).\n\n\n\nLA and within-school geographies of: inclusion/inclusiveness; level of support for SEN; transport; voluntary sector involvement; availability of inclusive or segregated leisure activities; rurality/urbanity, influence young people’s sociality.\n\n\n\nContext matters in converting social to other capitals; e.g. social ‘capital’ in special schools or units does not convert to cultural capital as readily, given constraints on accessing mainstream curricula/qualifications (Holt et al., 2012). \n\n\n\nMost young people value special schools or units. However, previous experiences of exclusion in/from mainstream schools often leads to moving to these spaces, which are also sites of exclusion/marginalisation for some.\n\n\n\nRelationships and associated ‘cultures’ move between spaces via individual/collective bodies as ‘habitus’; e.g. social relationships outside school provide social and emotional capital to young people in school. \n\n\n\nFriendships are more readily forged around shared interests than direct adult interventions, such as buddy schemes (Holt et al., 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting different scales and types of inclusion/exclusion\n\n\n\nA disproportionate number of young people with specific diagnoses of SEN (BESD and moderate learning difficulties) come from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds (Bowlby et al., forthcoming).\n\n\n\nHowever, certain SEN are normalised in particular contexts; e.g. children with socio-emotional differences are more often diagnosed with BESD in socio-economically mixed or advantaged areas than in disadvantaged contexts where some level of socio-emotional differences is viewed as the norm (Lea et al., in prep.).\n\n\n\nYoung people’s social relationships often, although not always, reproduce broader social exclusions, based on SEN and socio-economic disadvantage.\n\n\n\nLacking the social, economic and/or cultural capital to participate in leisure activities exacerbates exclusion – these types of capital are not always associated. The research could be used to inform education policy and practice about the education of young people with SEN. The innovative methods developed in the research could be used in a variety of sectors to seek the experiences of young people with a variety of mind-body-emotional characteristics in a host of contexts. The research has been fed-back to the staff, students and parents at the schools and Local Authorities in which the research was conducted. The findings are being disseminated to a wide policy and academic audience via a website, a final conference and other activities. The research has the potential to influence policy and practice about the education of young people with Special Educational Needs with implications for social inclusion in society, by highlighting the importance of sociality of young people to their educational and social participation and some of the quite simple measures that can be employed to encourage social inclusion of young people with SEN in school, home and leisure spaces.
