Over time the nerve damage accumulates leading to fixed and progressive disability in the vast majority of patients. Therapies for MS presently are limited only to partially reducing the frequency of individual attacks. There are no effective treatments to protect the nerves. This study is trying to explore whether stem cells taken from the patients bone marrow or skin could through a cell infusion (similar to blood transfusion) protect the nerves of the MS patient.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0502107","grantId":"G0502107","fundValue":"692405","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Siddharthan  Chandran","coPersons":["Alastair  Compston","Alan James Thompson","David  Miller","Alasdair  Coles"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
