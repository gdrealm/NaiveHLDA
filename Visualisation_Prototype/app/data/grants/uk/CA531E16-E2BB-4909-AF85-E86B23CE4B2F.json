Illustrated with audio, video and theatrical memorabilia of various kinds, the interactive/multimedia e-books will be based on previous AHRC-funded research conducted by the APGRD team on the history of the ancient plays on the modern stage. \n\nAs an internationally renowned centre for the study of the performance history of ancient drama, the APGRD has a unique and very rich collection of materials related to the performance of ancient drama from antiquity to the present. It is essential that its holdings are made more widely available and not simply accessible to those who can visit the Classics Centre in Oxford, as is currently the case. The interactive/multimedia e-books will enable us to work with brand-new technologies - tablet technology as a viewing platform for the e-book, for example, is only 4 years old. Using these cutting edge technologies, the interactive/multimedia e-book will not only expand our audience base; it will also enable us to communicate simultaneously with different types of audience, through the possibility of building different levels and pathways through the interactive/multimedia e-book. We will therefore be able to communicate with much younger audiences as well as extend our dialogue with theatre goers and practitioners around the globe, where the ancient plays enjoy equal prominence within the performance repertoire. \n\nThe first of the interactive/multimedia e-books will be on Euripides' Medea, and will draw on and extend the content of the print volume Medea in Performance 1500-2000 (edited by Edith Hall, Fiona Macintosh and Oliver Taplin, Oxford 2000); and the second volume will be focused on Aeschylus' Agamemnon and will be built upon the contents of Agamemnon in Performance: 458 BC to AD 2005 (edited by Fiona Macintosh, Pantelis Michelakis, Edith Hall and Oliver Taplin, Oxford 2005). In multimedia/interactive form, the research contained within the print books will be considerably enhanced both by the use of theatrical ephemera, photographic, audio and video material already housed in the APGRD's collections and by newly commissioned interviews with theatre practitioners and scholars specialising in ancient drama and its afterlife on the stage in the modern world. The aim is ultimately to produce interactive/multimedia e-books to accompany all publications published by researchers at the APGRD (16 have been published to date) and to provide a platform for other projects to produce similar materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M008762/1","grantId":"AH/M008762/1","fundValue":"80272","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Fiona  Macintosh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
