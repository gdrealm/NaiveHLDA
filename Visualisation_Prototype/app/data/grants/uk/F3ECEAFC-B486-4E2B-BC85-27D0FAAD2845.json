{"id":"F3ECEAFC-B486-4E2B-BC85-27D0FAAD2845","title":"Development and implementation of a web portal linking Kingston Museum's Eadweard Muybridge Collection to international centres and resources of Muybr","abstractText":"Kingston Museum possesses an extraordinary collection of artefacts and documents bequeathed by the pioneer of photography and moving image, Eadweard Muybridge (1980-1904), who is one of the seminal figures both in experiments into human movement, and in the early development of cinema. The Muybridge Collection remains relatively-little known, largely due to a lack of resources and of the means to make it visible to large-scale public audiences. The Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture at Kingston University has allied itself with the museum in a unique, committed collaborative venture, a central aim of which is to create an internet resource which will form a portal between Kingston Museum’s Muybridge Collection and the collections of Muybridge’s work owned by museums and institutions in other countries, notably in teh USA. The project aims to vastly increase knowledge of the Collection, to enhance the income-generating potential of Kingston Museum, and to form a crucial element in the future development of the longstanding and productive research-collaboration which exists between Kingston University and Kingston Museum.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H500286/1","grantId":"AH/H500286/1","fundValue":"19724","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-02","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used to inform the Muybridge Revolutions exhibition at Kingston Museum in 2010; the Tate Muybridge catalogue 2010 and accompanying Schools programme ; a HLF bid for a proposed Muybridge Centre at Kingston Museum, and by the 125 participant organisations.

This new knowledge about Muybridge has been embedded in Kingston Museum, Kingston University and our international collborators' websites and organisations. \n\nMoreover, through the project, we have discovered that the Kingston collection is one of the three most significant Muybridge collections in the world because of its unique holdings. The findings have informed several research putputs, a special edition journal (see publication) taken forward the Muybridge scholar Stephen Herbert and the Muybridge publication by Stephen Barber (see publication). It has also informed the workof opther internationakl scholars including the Canadian - baseed scholar Marta Braun.
