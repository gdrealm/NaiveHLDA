In the same way as our bodies have a skeleton that provides us with support and strength, the cells of our bodies have a skeleton - called the cytoskeleton - which also provides support and strength. The cytoskeleton is involved in many important aspects of the life of the cell, including cell movement, architecture and multiplication. Studying the cytoskeleton is important both so we can understand how healthy cells work, but also to understand malfunctions of the cytoskeleton in disease. My research team studies the three-dimensional structure of the cytoskeleton, because knowing what the cytoskeleton looks like contributes to our understanding of how it works in the cell. We use a very powerful microscope to take pictures of individual cytoskeleton molecules and then use computers to combine these pictures and calculate their three-dimensional shape. Our current research focuses on a part of the cytoskeleton called microtubules. These are long cylindrical structures that act like tracks around the cell and along which the cell's transporter motors travel; these motors are called kinesins and there are lots of different types. In this project, we will be studying a kinesin type-5, which is very important for accurate cell multiplication. We want to know how kinesin-5s use cellular fuel to move along microtubules and how this activity is controlled. We have had some exciting recent results from our microscopy studies and we want to know more about how this tiny, essential motor works. Previous experiments, including our own research, have suggested that kinesin-5 motors have an on-off switch that tells them when to move, but we don't understand very well how this works. The aim of our new project is to understand this switch and what controls it. This is particularly important because we know that cancer results from out-of-control cell multiplication, so we also hope that by understanding how kinesin-5 switches itself on and off, we might be able to provide more insight into how cancer can be treated.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H005137/1","grantId":"BB/H005137/1","fundValue":"326484","fundStart":"2010-07-12","fundEnd":"2013-07-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings can be used by other researchers working on the fundamental mechanisms of kinesin molecular motors.

In collaboration with Prof. Steven Rosenfeld (Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA), our sub-nanometre resolution reconstructions enable visualisation of coupled nucleotide-dependent conformational transitions of kinesin-5-specific structural elements. This reveals the structural basis of kinesin-5 force generation and the mechanism for their inhibition by small molecules. The purpose of this research was to uncover aspects of how cell multiplication is controlled and how it might be turned on and off.
