Our crystals\nenable the energy of a single photon to be split and conserved as two lower-energy photons at different colours; the laws of\nphysics state that if one of these photons is created then the other must also exist. In this project, we seek to reduce the\nmanufacturing tolerances required to generate indistinguisable photons between parallel sources and our objective is to\nprove our new approach across multiple devices. This is an important step in enabling scalable quantum applications\nwhere many indistinguishable photons are needed in parallel, such as quantum computing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M508329/1","grantId":"EP/M508329/1","fundValue":"92173","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter George Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
