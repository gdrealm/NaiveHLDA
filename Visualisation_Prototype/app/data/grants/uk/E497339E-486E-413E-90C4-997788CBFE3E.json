It aims also to discuss this process within the wider social and political context of life in Europe, especially the ways that the contemporary Alevi interpretation of Islam may be shaped by the experience of the diaspora community in Europe. It will also consider the possible implications of the fact that that international institutions, such as the European Commission, have begun to draw attention to the place of minority religious groups in Turkey. For the purposes of comparison, part of the research concentrates on a further group, the Yezidis, who though smaller, appear to possess certain similarities with the Alevi community. This activity will be accompanied by extensive literature and internet surveys, as well as close co-operation with a Heidelberg research team, who have kindly offered to share our mutual findings.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2592","grantId":"RES-000-22-2592","fundValue":"83370","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David Peter Shankland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
