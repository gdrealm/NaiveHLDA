The problem of flow in collapsible tubes has therefore received much interest in the biofluids researchcommunity. Experimentally, the problem is typically studied with a `Starling resistor', a device in which fluid isdriven through a finite-length, thin-walled, elastic tube whichis mounted on two rigid tubes and enclosed in a pressure chamber.One of the most striking features of this system is its propensity to develop large-amplitude self-excited oscillations. Our understanding of the mechanism(s) that initiate and maintain these oscillations is still very limited. It is the aim of this research proposal to undertake the firsttruly comprehensive study of flow in 3D collapsible tubes, employinga combination of theoretical (asymptotic), numerical and experimental methods.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D070422/1","grantId":"EP/D070422/1","fundValue":"234567","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthias  Heil","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
