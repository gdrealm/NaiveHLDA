Exploratory drilling is high risk and one way to improve efficiency is by using model predictions of past climates to identify key regions. This proposal is a joint collaboration between GETECH (a petroleum and minerals consultancy) and the University of Bristol. We are seeking proof-of-concept funding (a) for GETECH to prepare palaeogeographic reconstructions for three past time periods, and (b) for the University of Bristol to use these maps to perform state-of-the-art palaeoclimate model simulations. Both GETECH and the University of Bristol will use these results to investigate the accuracy and applicably of the climate models for exploration. If successful, this will lead to commercial products for the oil exploration industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H525562/1","grantId":"NE/H525562/1","fundValue":"3952","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Dan  Lunt","coPersons":["Paul  Valdes"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" The aim of this project was to explore possibilities of running palaeoclimate simulations using palaeogeographic maps provided by the geological consultancy GETECH.\n\n\n\nWe were successful in running some short pilot simulations for three key time periods in the past. n/a Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
