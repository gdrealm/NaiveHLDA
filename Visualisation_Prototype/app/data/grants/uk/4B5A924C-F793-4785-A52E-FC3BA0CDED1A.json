{"id":"4B5A924C-F793-4785-A52E-FC3BA0CDED1A","title":"Calculating the rate of Antarctic Bottom Water formation using new theory, fine-scale modelling and observations","abstractText":"The equatorial regions of the Earth receive more solar energy than the polar regions. The extra heat is transported polewards in approximately equal parts by the circulations of the atmosphere and ocean. Warm surface waters enter the polar regions, where they release their heat. As these surface waters cool, they can begin to freeze to form sea ice and this releases dense brine into the ocean. The combination of surface cooling and brine release causes the surface waters to become sufficiently dense to sink. The cold bottom waters so formed then flow equatorward, balancing the poleward surface flow. The location and mechanism of bottom water production affects the spatial distribution and intensity of the ocean circulation, which helps determine the weather.\n\nEvidence from climate models and observations suggest that bottom water formation around Antarctica will be affected by global warming and will influence the climate and weather in both the Southern and Northern hemispheres. In order to accurately predict future climate change, climate models require an adequate representation of bottom water formation around Antarctica, which is presently lacking. \n\nAs a result of their limited spatial resolution and simplified physics, climate models are unable to represent adequately the small-scale processes responsible for the formation of bottom water. Climate models typically produce too little bottom water and this water is too warm and fresh, which has been ascribed to inadequate representation of winter freezing of seawater to form sea ice, which releases brine into the upper ocean. This proposal will use high resolution numerical modelling of the sea ice and ocean, combined with field observations to improve our understanding of the processes controlling bottom water formation around Antarctica.\n\nWe will focus on a particular region, over the continental shelf north of the Ronne Ice Shelf, since this region is believed to be responsible for about a third of the bottom water formed around Antarctica, is representative of other regions of bottom water formation around Antarctica, and because, relative to other areas in the Southern Ocean, we have a lot of data with which to test our model. We will explore the role of the Ronne polynya, an open water region in the sea-ice cover caused by winds blowing off Antarctica, and frazil ice formation, in controlling the bottom water formation in this region. Frazil ice consists of millimetre-sized ice crystals that form and grow when the seawater is below its freezing point. We will include the physics of frazil ice formation into our models. We will test our models with recently-acquired oceanographic and atmospheric data and satellite observations. \n\nWe will use our models, which will be the most physically-sophisticated, and highly-calibrated, models to date, to calculate the rate of bottom water formation over the Ronne continental shelf. The models, once calibrated for the Ronne continental shelf, will be used to calculate total bottom formation around the whole of Antarctica. In addition to new estimates for bottom water formation, we will develop new model physics and identify the optimal representation of ocean mixing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I023708/2","grantId":"NE/I023708/2","fundValue":"91175","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  A paper has been submitted for peer-reviewed publication describing our work on frazil and grease ice: \nA new parameterisation of frazil and grease ice production in a climate sea ice model\nby AV Wilchinsky, HS Heorton, DL Feltham, PR Holland\n\nAnother paper has been published in collaboration with colleagues at BAS:\nMarius ?rthun, Paul R.

The ice can form as frazil ice, which are tiny ice crystals that form in supercooled water, or as columnar ice from the top of the sea surface down.\n\nFrazil ice formation is particularly important in cracks, known as leads, in the sea ice cover in winter, which expose the ocean to the cold atmosphere, and in open water regions in the ice cover. As frazil ice collects in leads it forms grease ice and eventually consolidates to form a continuous ice cover. Frazil and grease ice formation accounts for approximately half of sea ice formation in the Southern Ocean. \n \nA new model has been developed that accounts for the physics of frazil and grease ice formation and this model has been incorporated into a sea ice model component of a climate model. The importance of frazil ice has been studied and, particularly, its role in salt release into the ocean where it affects the formation of dense bottom waters. By developing the frazil ice module in a climate sea ice module that is used by many groups and climate modelling centres, including the UK Met Office, the fundamental outputs of our work - a more physically realistic and accurate frazil ice description - will be used by all of these groups.
