{"id":"EF3081F1-CBD2-40C1-9847-635271391E75","title":"TRIUMF travel for experiment S1107","abstractText":"An excellent new physics opportunity is opened up by the Tigress collaboration's investment (along with the University of York in the UK) in a compact silicon box called SHARC that will operate inside the Ge array, and allow the study of nucleon transfer reactions. The high beam quality and intensities of ISAC-2 beams are well adapted to transfer studies, and the energies have now reached 4.5 - 5.0 MeV/A, where the shapes of the differential cross sections are characteristic of the transferred angular momentum and the optical model analyses to obtain spectroscopic factors is reasonable and proven. The Surrey group played a prominent part in the design of SHARC and this will be the first physics experiment to exploit this new investment. The experiment will be the first of its type, in which the use of gamma-rays to isolate individual states in the studied nucleus is essential, and makes use of the intense sodium beams available at the present first-generation radioactive beam facility at TRIUMF. It is likely to be the forerunner of a major theme in experimentation at the world's next generation radioactive beam facilities, which are just now being constructed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H003916/1","grantId":"ST/H003916/1","fundValue":"7671","fundStart":"2009-07-24","fundEnd":"2009-09-23","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Wilton  Catford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
