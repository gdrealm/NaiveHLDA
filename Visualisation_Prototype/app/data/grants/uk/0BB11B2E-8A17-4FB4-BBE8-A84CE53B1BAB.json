This retroviral latency is the greatest single obstacle to the eradication of a retroviral infection: although drug treatment for HIV infection is highly efficient at suppressing HIV replication, the virus is not cleared from the body because there is a reservoir of cells containing latent HIV, from which the virus reactivates if drug treatment is stopped, resulting in the development of AIDS. Understanding retroviral latency is also of critical important in the development of safe retrovirus-based viruses used in gene therapy. \n\nHuman T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the other main disease-causing retrovirus in humans. Present mainly in the tropics, HTLV-1 causes 2 types of disease: an aggressive leukaemia, which is almost uniformly fatal, and a chronic disabling paralytic disease, which is also untreatable. There is no vaccine. \n\nRetroviral latency has been difficult to study in HIV infection, because HIV rapidly kills the infected cell when the virus is reactivated. HTLV-1, in contrast, does not kill the infected cell but drives it to proliferate. \n\nAims\n\nThe aim of this programme is to identify how retroviral latency is regulated, to allow the virus to persist despite the host immune response and drug treatment. We have developed a sensitive, high-throughput technique to map the integration site of retroviruses in the host DNA and, crucially, to quantify accurately the abundance of each clone of infected cells. We have shown that the integration site of the retrovirus, which is different in each clone of infected cells, is a major factor that determines the abundance of that clone. In Part A of the proposed programme, we will use this new technique to identify the features of the integration site that are associated with reactivation of the virus and proliferation of the cell. To do this we will study DNA from peripheral blood taken from patients with the different diseases caused by HTLV-1. In Part B of the programme we will test specific hypotheses on the molecular mechanisms of retroviral latency: 2 hypotheses that we have already formulated, and further hypotheses that we develop from the data obtained in Part A. \n\nApplications and benefits\n\nThe benefits of this work will be two-fold. First, it will lead to fundamental advances in the understanding of the regulation of latency of retrovirus such as HIV and HTLV-1, and viruses used in gene therapy. Second, the ability to predict and explain why certain individuals develop serious diseases from HTLV-1 infection whereas others remain healthy will provide tools for prognosis and monitoring response to treatment of the HTLV-1-associated leukaemia and the paralytic disease. The mathematical techniques developed will be of wide application in medicine, ecology and population biology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K019090/1","grantId":"MR/K019090/1","fundValue":"796411","fundStart":"2013-11-04","fundEnd":"2017-11-03","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Charles R M Bangham","coPersons":["Graham P Taylor"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
