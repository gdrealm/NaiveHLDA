(The cerebral cortex is the biggest part of our brains, which does most of the thinking and perceiving). The point of this is to discover what kind of neural code the brain actually uses - do the exact times of spikes matter? We will establish the feasibility of doing this by means of monitoring flashes of light along branches of neurons called apical dendrites, which rise most of the way towards the surface of the brain. Whenever a brain cell fires a nerve impulse, this also travels backwards along part of the apical dendrite. Calcium enters the dendrite during the nerve impulse. In specially genetically-engineered mice this can briefly make an artificial calcium-sensing protein in the dendrite fluoresce more brightly (flash) when illuminated by strong, fast pulses of infra-red laser light focused down a microscope. This '2-photon' microscope can also be used to build up beautiful 3-dimensional pictures of brain cells in the grey matter of the cerebral cortex,despite it being non-transparent. One of the biggest technological hurdles in developing a technique to record spike times from all neurons at once in a chunk of grey matter, is the difficulty of focusing a microscope up and down through the thickness of the grey matter rapidly enough. We propose to test whether we can use the spike-related calcium flashes along the apical dendrites to get around this problem: if we can record spike times from dendrites of all the neurons we are interested in at a single depth in the cortex, there is no need for rapid up and down focusing. In practice, we will probably need to repeat the process at 3 or 4 different depths, since the flashes typically don't run along the full length of a given apical dendrite. But we can 'splice' together spike times from different depths to get a picture of the total network activity in that volume of brain for a given stimulus, repeated carefully while focusing at the different depths. If we do this for enough stimuli, we should be able to understand whether the brain uses the precise times of spikes across large networks of neurons to encode important information.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F016484/1","grantId":"BB/F016484/1","fundValue":"27011","fundStart":"2008-05-22","fundEnd":"2009-11-21","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Better understanding of dendritic function.\nSoftware for analysing miniature post-synaptic potentials.\nPublications, others now actively researching the area of NMDA spikes in dendrites.\nGiven numerous seminars in other universities, including abroad.
