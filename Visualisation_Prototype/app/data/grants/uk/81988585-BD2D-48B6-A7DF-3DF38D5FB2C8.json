UV-B induces physiological responses in plants, including changes in morphology and development and the regulation of various genes involved in secondary metabolism, chloroplast function and protection of the plant from damage by UV-B. Remarkably, very little is known about how UV-B is perceived by plants and how it initiates responses. However, the first component involved in these processes has recently been identified, a protein called UVR8. Moreover, UV-B exposure stimulates movement of UVR8 into the cell nucleus. The aim of this project is to define regions of the UVR8 protein involved in movement into the nucleus and the regulation of transcription and to identify proteins that interact with UVR8 to mediate these processes. An additional objective is to investigate how UVR8 associates with DNA in the region of a gene it regulates. Establishing how UVR8 is regulated and how it functions to control gene expresion will help us to understand how UV-B regulates aspects of plant growth and development and how plants survive in sunlight.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F014961/1","grantId":"BB/F014961/1","fundValue":"420303","fundStart":"2008-04-11","fundEnd":"2011-10-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth Islwyn  Jenkins","coPersons":["John MacKie Christie"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
