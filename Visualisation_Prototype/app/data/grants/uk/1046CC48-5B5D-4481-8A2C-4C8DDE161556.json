{"id":"1046CC48-5B5D-4481-8A2C-4C8DDE161556","title":"Improving access to safe drinking water: prospection for low-fluoride sources","abstractText":"Fluoride in drinking water is one of the most significant water-quality problems affecting populations in Africa. Long-term use of drinking water with fluoride significantly above the WHO guideline value of 1.5 mg/L can have serious effects on health, manifested most prominently by dental and skeletal fluorosis. The Rift Valley of Ethiopia is an arid, groundwater-dependent region with well-established links between fluoride in drinking water and fluorosis. Despite the recognised fluoride anomalies on a regional scale, local-scale variations and their controls are poorly defined and understood. This pilot project aims to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of fluoride in groundwater in a selected study area of the Rift. The project will characterise the variability, evaluate the underlying causes and determine whether the variations show sufficient predictability to be of practical benefit in providing guidance on improving abstraction strategies. The institutional arrangements governing water management and supply (regulation, policy, funding, capacity and prioritisation) will be assessed in order to understand the governance context of water supply in the area investigated. Through these combined approaches, the project aims to define the most effective ways to translate an improved knowledge on fluoride distributions into improved access to sources of safe, low-fluoride drinking water.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L001837/1","grantId":"NE/L001837/1","fundValue":"46080","fundStart":"2013-07-24","fundEnd":"2014-07-23","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Van Steenbergen","coPersons":["Asefa  Kumssa Afeta"],"organisation":"MetaMeta","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
