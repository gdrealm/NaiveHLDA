These processes occur on the surface of most of our planet and change the soil’s properties. For example, they aid water and air movement through the soil and so help plant growth. Plants, grown in the soil support most life on earth. Understanding such processes is important for food and fibre production, particularly as climate change may alter soil properties.\nThe project unites a team of biologists, soil scientists and engineers. Some of the team study interactions between the soil, plant growth and soil organisms. The civil engineers quantify soil as a material to support buildings and other structures (so they don’t settle into the ground or collapse) and as a material to be removed when tunnelling. They experiment and model how foundations and tunnels work for safe and efficient construction. By combining experiments and bringing our knowledge together we will improve understanding and management of the relevant biological systems and processes. Finally, the biology may also lead to the improvement of engineering methods by mimicking natural processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701965","grantId":"G0701965","fundValue":"110532","fundStart":"2008-10-14","fundEnd":"2009-10-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Fraser Bransby","coPersons":["G  Bengough","Jonathan Adam Knappett","Blair  McKenzie"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
