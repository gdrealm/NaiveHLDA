In particular green infrastructure can provide the basis for considering and developing more integrated planning policy, strategic thinking, multi-functionality, ecological and landscape connectivity, access to green space and more sustainable urban development. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-623-26-0005","grantId":"RES-623-26-0005","fundValue":"1517","fundStart":"2009-06-25","fundEnd":"2010-06-24","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This funding was for a collaborative CASE studentship.
