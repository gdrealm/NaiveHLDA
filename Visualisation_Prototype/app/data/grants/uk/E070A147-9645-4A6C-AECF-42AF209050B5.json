This novel, naturalistic, multimodal form of interface should also improve the quality of online communication and collaboration.&nbsp;Taken together, embodied interaction should have a positive effect on skills such as problem solving, narrative and literacy.<br /><br /></li> \n <li>investigate the potential and limitations of embodied interaction paradigms and notations as well as of current sensor technology for childrenâ€™s game authoring environments.<br /><br /></li> \n <li>identify and develop a suitable interdisciplinary network which will include teachers, game software designers and developers, researchers in the sensor technology area and educational researchers working in the areas of computer programming, narrative and the performing arts.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E008674/1","grantId":"ES/E008674/1","fundValue":"49325","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith  Good","coPersons":["Judy  Robertson","Pablo  Romero","Benedict  Du Boulay"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
