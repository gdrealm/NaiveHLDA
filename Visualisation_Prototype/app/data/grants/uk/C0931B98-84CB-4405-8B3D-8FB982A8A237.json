{"id":"C0931B98-84CB-4405-8B3D-8FB982A8A237","title":"The Research Complex at Harwell LIFEtime Instrument","abstractText":"The LIFEtime Instrument employs advanced laser based instruments to characterise changes in biologically important molecules such as proteins and DNA. These changes occur across a wide range of timescales and we will observe them using subtle changes in the way they absorb infrared laser light. The optical changes indicate changes in molecular structure and environment that underlie molecular reactivity. A wide range of BBSRC relevant research will be performed on the LIFEtime instrument in areas as diverse as protein folding, understanding photosynthesis, understanding the physical basis of catalysis and signalling in enzymes and light activated proteins and designing new biomolecular probes for cell imaging and medicine. \n\nMost light driven processes in nature occur in cascades of gradually slowing steps; the faster ones affect the outcome of the slower ones. Thus, light harvesting that plants use to grow and produce food, for example, in photosynthesis starts by femtosecond processes, (1 femtosecond = a thousand million millionths of a second) and is the time scale of atoms moving in molecules. On these timescales primary energy and electron transfer (ET) reactions occur, yet are followed by hundreds of picoseconds (million millionths of a second) and longer times for molecular rearrangements that determine the yields of the reaction. The movement of electrons and protons within molecules is ultimately stabilised through separation of the negative and positive charges. This separation can be through diffusion or across a membrane taking place on microsecond to millisecond timescales. These longer time processes also include changes in molecular geometry, isomerisation, structural bond changes. Additional energy relaxation pathways include thermal processes and these also involve kinetic cascades such as in the case of protein folding, which starts with femtosecond structural fluctuations and finishes on millisecond timescale. We propose to install within the Research Complex at Harwell a world-unique instrument, LIFEtime, for interrogating kinetics and structural changes of biological systems spanning over 10 orders of magnitude timescale, within a single experiment, on a single sample and under identical experimental conditions. This will allow a comprehensive study of many dynamic processes in biological systems in their whole complexity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L014335/1","grantId":"BB/L014335/1","fundValue":"828604","fundStart":"2014-01-02","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The Loan Pool was managed by STFC on behalf of EPSRC in order to provide UK researchers access to state of the art lasers in their home institutes.

With this we can follow biological processes from the very beginnings watching charge flow and atomic nuclei move to large scale structural changes as the molecules change shape and interact with their environment.
