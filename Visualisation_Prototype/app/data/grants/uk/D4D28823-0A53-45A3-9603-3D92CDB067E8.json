Depression is a severe mood disorder that is characterised by clinical features such as anhedonia (a loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities), cognitive and emotional impairment, psychomotor retardation, and disturbances in sleep and appetite. 20-40% of all patients do not benefit from traditional treatment methods such as psychotherapy or anti-depressant medication. This project will investigate a potential new treatment method: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based neurofeedback. In this method people undergo fMRI-scanning and receive continuously updated feedback about the activity level in a certain brain area, which they use to learn to control their own brain activity. It has previously been shown that chronic pain patients experienced considerably less pain after exercising control over a brain area involved in pain processing. In our project feedback from a region involved in positive emotion processing will be provided so that depressed patients can learn to regulate their emotional state. A pilot study of this method from our group has shown that depressed patients are both able to regulate their emotional network and experience significant improvements in mood.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100629","grantId":"G1100629","fundValue":"371731","fundStart":"2012-02-08","fundEnd":"2015-02-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Edmund Linden","coPersons":["David  Cohen","Christopher John Evans","Mary L Phillips","Paul Anthony Keedwell"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
