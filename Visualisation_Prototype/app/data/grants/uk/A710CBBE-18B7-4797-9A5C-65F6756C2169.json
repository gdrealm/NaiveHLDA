{"id":"A710CBBE-18B7-4797-9A5C-65F6756C2169","title":"Plastic UV Radiation Protection Operating by Stokes Emission (PURPOSE PROJECT)","abstractText":"This project aims to develop novel energy harvesting products for a wide range of applications. This will be achieved by enhancing the properties of polymer composites; more efficient use of solar/therm-al energy, longer life and recyclability. These improvements stem from the use of novel inorganic phos-phor particles downconverting solar UV light to other parts of the electomagnetic spectrum. With the incorporation of low cost novel phosphors, the new composite materials will have more efficient UV protection (giving longer life and enhanced recyclability), provide innovative thermal heating for clim-ate control (in both car and domestic interiors), and give enhanced plant growth (by converting light to increase the intensity of the wavelengths of light used in photosynthesis). In summary, this generic tec-hnology has the ability to deliver significant energy benefits across a wide range of applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G000271/1","grantId":"TS/G000271/1","fundValue":"461183","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jack  Silver","coPersons":["Paolo  Coppo","Karnik  Tarverdi","Robert  Withnall","Peter Stewart Allan","George Robert  Fern"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
