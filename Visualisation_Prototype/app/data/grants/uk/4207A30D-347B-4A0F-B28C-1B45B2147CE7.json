The debate raises several key questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>what is the current contribution of UK cities to national economic competiveness</li>\n\n <li>how do they compare with their competitors internationally</li>\n\n <li>what is their potential to increase their economic contribution in future? </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>This study will answer these questions by analysing a series of databases on city regions’ economic performance created by ONS, Eurostat, OECD, and DG Regio. It will focus upon the impact of the current recession upon the performance and prospects of UK cities in national and international contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will examine recent datasets, to compare the economic performance of UK city-regions with their European and international counterparts. We will focus on key performance measures such as GDP, labour market and demographic trends and on indicators of the drivers of competitiveness - innovation, skills, economic diversity and connectivity. Our focus is principally on the 2000-10 decade, allowing us to explore developments before and during the current economic crisis.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00414X/1","grantId":"ES/K00414X/1","fundValue":"129729","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Parkinson","coPersons":["Jay  Karecha","Richard Allen  Meegan"],"organisation":"Liverpool John Moores University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
