{"id":"5296E83D-81F5-487C-B0EE-0675FCCAC9DF","title":"Non-equilibrium and relaxation phenomena in graphene-based devices","abstractText":"Graphene (a single atomic layer of graphite) first experimentally isolated and identified only four years ago, is rapidly revealing its great potential as an important material for future electronic devices. In order to progress towards realistic device applications of graphene, it is important to address the issues which will affect the operation of graphene in real circuits, where high currents will lead to overheating and non-equilibrium charge carrier distributions. The proposed joint project will launch an internationally leading programme involving three research groups which are already well established in graphene research and have expertise in complimentary areas. By combining fabrication technology of graphene-based devices, transport and optical studies, and theoretical modelling, we will investigate the kinetic properties of charge carriers and phonons (lattice vibrations) in graphene over a broad range of operating voltages, temperatures and optical intensities, with the aim to establish and improve the operating characteristics of graphene-based electronic and optoelectronic devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G041954/1","grantId":"EP/G041954/1","fundValue":"308719","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vladimir  Falko","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
