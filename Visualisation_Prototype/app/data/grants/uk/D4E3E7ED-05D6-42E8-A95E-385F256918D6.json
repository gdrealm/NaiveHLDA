It will provide a national focus that spearheads UK academic and industrial research to accelerate the application of synthetic biology in fine and speciality chemicals production and the generation of new state-of-the-art tools to facilitate this translation.\n\nSynthetic biology is an emerging science that has the capacity to transform the UK and European industrial landscape in sustainable manufacturing processes across all industrial sectors. UK industries, from large multinationals to a large number of small and medium enterprises, are internationally well positioned to benefit from the multitude of novel technologies developed in synthetic biology laboratories. To accelerate the translation of synthetic biology towards the fine and speciality chemicals market, the Centre will unite technologies, tools and ideas that emerge from academic institutions throughout the country, harvest synergies across the industrial and scientific sectors, and address the novel ethical and regulatory challenges faced by a disruptive technology at the interface of life sciences, chemistry and engineering.\n\nThe Centre will be located in the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, a unique cross-disciplinary research centre at the University of Manchester, bringing together more than 500 researchers with expertise in molecular biology, chemistry, engineering, material and computing science, and medicine at the forefront of international developments in synthetic biology. As part of the MIB, the Centre will build on a long and distinguished track record in spin-off formation and translating innovative research to industrial application, including a substantial portfolio of partnerships, e.g., with Syngenta, GSK, BASF and Shell. \n\nThe Centre will operate an open and inclusive approach driven by the unique industrial needs of synthetic biology. This will allow it to harness the scientific expertise of the synthetic biology community at Manchester and throughout the country, by facilitating multiple research projects positioned primarily at the Technology-Readiness Levels 1 to 3, but also including industry-driven academic-led proof-of-concept and proof-of-utility projects with partners from industry and academia at the higher Technology-Readiness Levels.\n\nThe Centre will develop major programs in the ethical and regulatory aspects faced by synthetic biology. By initiating early dialogue on responsible innovation, providing expertise, guidance and training in responsible governance of synthetic biology innovation, and promoting public engagement and training for the research community, the Centre will create the conditions for accelerated exploitation of the opportunities generated by the rapid advances in synthetic biology for the benefit of the UK economy. Colleagues at the Manchester Institute of Science Ethics and Innovation will be central to this effort to mitigate technology risks (real or perceived) associated with this new industrial revolution, while the University of Manchester Business School will develop the responsible innovation and market analysis strategies required to realize emerging opportunities as science progresses. This will be supported by analysis and stimulation of collaborative developments in this multi-disciplinary/multi-sector field.\n\nThe Centre will respond continuously and flexibly to developing needs from industry partners new scientific trends across the academic landscape. Its strategic goal is to position UK industry at the forefront of the exploiting synthetic biology for chemicals and natural products biosynthesis by providing a 'one-stop access' to world class physical infrastructure/scientific knowledge that will propel fine and speciality chemicals production towards sustainable manufacturing processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M017702/1","grantId":"BB/M017702/1","fundValue":"10198900","fundStart":"2014-11-14","fundEnd":"2019-11-13","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel Shaun Scrutton","coPersons":["Sally  Randles","Sam  Hay","Royston  Goodacre","Adisa  Azapagic","Pedro  Mendes","Nicholas John Turner","Andrew William Munro","Rainer  Breitling","Perdita Elizabeth Barran","Jason  Micklefield","Abdullah  Gok","Sabine  Flitsch","Daniela  Delneri","Neil  Hall","Eriko  Takano","Peter James Martin","David  Leys","James  Winterburn","Jonathan Richard Lloyd","Douglas Bruce Kell","Neil  Dixon","Christiane  Hertz-Fowler","Jean-Loup  Faulon","Nicholas Paul Lockyer","Philip  Shapira","Carole  Goble"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
