This will build on the Fama-French and Momentum portfolios and factors for the UK market established by Gregory, Tharyan and Huang (2009).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our first objective is to expand this dataset to include the full range of portfolios available for the US. Second, we will expand the available factor and portfolio data to encompass ongoing developments in literature relating to returns and asset pricing. Third, we will undertake a comprehensive range of asset pricing model tests to develop a more convincing model of the cross-section of UK stock returns. Lastly we will develop the UK literature on implied cost of capital (ICC). With reference to the latter, we will both test alternative models of ICC and examine the role of implied, rather than realised, returns in asset pricing tests.</p>\n&nbsp;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J023914/1","grantId":"ES/J023914/1","fundValue":"285112","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Gregory","coPersons":["CHRISTINA  DARGENIDOU","Rajesh  Tharyan","Pengguo  Wang"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" This is project is ongoing.
