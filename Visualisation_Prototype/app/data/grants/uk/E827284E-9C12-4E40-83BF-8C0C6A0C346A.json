The LC-MS will supplement gas chromatography-mass spectrometers and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers housed in the School of Biosciences at Exeter University, to provide an analytical facility for biomolecules. The LC-MS will be used to support a wide range of research projects in the area of plant and microbial sciences. The projects to be supported and enabled include the following. 1. Investigations of the synthesis and function of vitamin C in plants and of the genetic control of metabolism. 2. The response of plants to fungal and bacterial pathogens: what kinds of chemical signals and defensive chemicals are involved in disease resistance. 3. Toxin production by pathogenic bacteria. 4. Algal metabolism: algae (phytoplankton) are important for photosynthesis and productivity in the oceans and are key in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Studies of algal metabolism in conjunction with new genome sequence information will provide new information on their response to climate change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F011652/1","grantId":"BB/F011652/1","fundValue":"249420","fundStart":"2008-08-13","fundEnd":"2009-08-12","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  Smirnoff","coPersons":["Murray  Grant","Nicholas Jose Talbot","Richard William  Titball"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" The grant enable purchase of two mass spectrometers and associated equipment to establish a metabolomics and proteomics capability at Exeter University.
