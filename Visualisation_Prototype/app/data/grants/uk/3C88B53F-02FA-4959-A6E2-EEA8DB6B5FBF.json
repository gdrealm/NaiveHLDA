{"id":"3C88B53F-02FA-4959-A6E2-EEA8DB6B5FBF","title":"Astronomy and Astrophysics at Edinburgh: New Applicants Request","abstractText":"An astonishing feature of modern astrophysical research is that we have in principle a chain of explanation that stretches from processes on cosmological scales of billions of light years, down to the creation of stars, planets around the stars and life on the planets. In a sense, this process is almost a closed loop: the early universe was once of subnuclear scale, so that quantum mechanical uncertainty is bound to seed fluctuations in density, which eventually collapse under gravity to make astronomical structures. This is the same physics of the very small that governs the formation of the atoms out of which we are all made. \n\nBut unanswered questions abound at all stages of this process. Our theories of the early universe and explanations of its current expansion rest on the concept that empty space can have weight: the so-called &quot;dark energy&quot;. We need to study its properties and understand its origin. In so doing, we often assume that Einstein's relativity describes gravity correctly, but can we test this? If the standard theory is correct, dark matter is required, and we are driven to follow the processes by which it clumps, and by which the gas within these clumps evolves, eventally forming stars. New large telescopes on the ground, together with the Hubble Space Telescope, allow us to see this process in action. Nearer to home, we can dissect galaxies such as our own Milky Way into individual stars, for the most detailed view of how they were assembled. And finally we can carry out detailed computer simulations of how structure formation may have progressed, allowing a comparison of real and virtual universes on an equal footing. \n\nResearch in astronomy in Edinburgh attacks all these connected questions. Progress is rapid, and our understanding evolves rapidly. Major progress, even if not final answers, can be expected within a few years. This is an exciting time for our understanding of the universe and our place within it.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L000644/1","grantId":"ST/L000644/1","fundValue":"331955","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"John Andrew Peacock","coPersons":["Andrew Robert Liddle"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" Too early in the grant.
