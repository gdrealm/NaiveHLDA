The potential to reduce thermal heat losses through insulation and airtightness (in particular in pre-1980s housing), upgrade the household appliance stock (using the latest energy saving models) and integrated on-site renewables and microgeneration (developing a 'prosumer' culture and reducing energy bills) still remains largely unrealised. There are a number of challenges in providing advice for retrofit solutions to consumers which will promote behaviour change and influence purchasing decisions. Currently consumer information is based on standardised methodologies for nominal house types and the resulting predictions of energy savings have minimal resemblance to reality where the thermal efficiency of the dwelling, efficiency of heating system and appliances, occupancy, user behaviour and preferences will have a significant impact on the effectiveness and uptake of retrofit measures. One solution is to provide consumers with personalised, accurate and trustworthy predictions of energy saving measures which are calibrated and tailored to their dwelling and living patterns, presented in a format to engage and promote action. \n\nThis proposal will facilitate a widespread uptake of retrofit measures in UK homes by implementing a holistic approach to providing consumers with personalised, tailored retrofit advice delivered using methods to maximise consumer engagement. Smart Home technology provides a unique opportunity to use real-time measurements, advanced data analytics, digital signal processing and communications techniques, novel visualisation, semantic web and cloud computing technologies to generate advice at different levels of abstraction for informed and justified decision making. The Smart Home concept is currently gaining significant momentum and new developments in open systems, simple use and installation features (ie plug and play), mobile access (ie Smart Phones) and connectivity have brought the concept to the attention of energy companies, ICT companies and appliance manufacturers. The IBM vision of a Smart(er) Home gives three characteristics: 1) Instrumented (sensors and automation of household activities); 2) Interconnected (communication between devices and wider networks - allowing remote access and control of devices); and 3) Intelligent ('the ability to make decisions based on data, leading to better outcomes'). Smart Homes provide consumers with more control over their homes and energy systems and, importantly, how their energy demand and costs can be reduced through interventions. \n\nThis proposal brings together a multi-disciplinary team of building, ICT, energy, design and user experts to develop a personalised decision support platform for building envelope retrofits, heating system and appliance replacement purchases, and on-site renewables integration. This will deliver a step-change in the provision and accuracy of retrofit advice to UK householders leading to a low-energy and low-carbon future housing stock. The outcomes will be of benefit to: energy, ICT, embedded systems and telecommunication companies developing technology and business models for Smart Home services; consumers to lower their energy bills and improve the safety, security and comfort of their homes; building component, boiler and appliance manufacturers developing the next generation of low-energy products; and policy makers for new insights into innovative approaches to meeting the security, affordability and carbon reduction aspirations of the UK energy system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K002368/1","grantId":"EP/K002368/1","fundValue":"238914","fundStart":"2012-06-19","fundEnd":"2015-12-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vladimir  Stankovic","coPersons":["Lina  Stankovic"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":" The team has deployed energy (and environmental) sensing equipment in 20 homes in England, from which we are automatically and remotely collecting measurements in real time (every 6secs) to our server at Strathclyde for over a year now. After data checking and cleaning, we have carried out a range of analytical work ranging from successfully tackling the challenges of disaggregation or non-intrusive appliance load monitoring of low-granularity, one dimensional smart-meter data with low complexity algorithms for a large range of appliances, to developing activity recognition algorithms for mapping these appliances or technologies to domestic practices. We can now generate, from smart meter data alone, itemised billing down to appliance level or down to activity level, e.g., how much does cooking in your house cost? Our findings answer questions such as &quot;How can signal information processing turn smart meter data into 'useful' information?&quot;, &quot;How much and what kind of data do we need for effective data analytics?&quot; and &quot;How to map technologies to domestic practices to increase the impact of this 'useful information' feedback?&quot; This is useful for policy makers, including DECC, utilities, energy service providers, Consumer Access Device (CAD) implementers Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
