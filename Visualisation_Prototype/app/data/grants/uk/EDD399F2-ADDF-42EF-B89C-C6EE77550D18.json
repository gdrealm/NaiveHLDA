Firm links have been established with the Chair of the APPG and with senior policymakers at VisitEngland, the Family Holiday Association, and key providers, and with a wide range of academics outside the Social Tourism field. This provides a strong foundation for an enduring network.\n \nThe series identified and clarified key conceptual and policy issues that must be addressed if Social Tourism is to develop. These are discussed in Impacts.\n \nActivities\n\nWe made a substantial contribution to the APPG report 'Giving Britain a Break' where our research was mentioned frequently. The report is the most high profile public policy engagement with Social Tourism in the UK and we have built strong links with the Chair, Paul Maynard MP and his staff. We received unsolicited invitations to address the Tourism Management Institute (TMI) annual conference in October 2011 and to organise a future event exploring Social Tourism for the Tourism Society, the industry's professional body in October 2012. \nThe total attendance at the series was 239. Demand was high and we had to create waiting lists and turn down some applications in order to limit numbers to levels that allowed discussion and delegate participation. We achieved an excellent mix of participants embracing academics from many different backgrounds and at different stages of their careers (ranging from 38 professors to 26 PhD / early career researchers). Over 20% of participants were practitioners - from the tourism industry, destinations, public policy and Social Tourism providers. There was a consistent international element to the series embracing both speakers (5) and participants (26). We are proud that we were able to give a voice to social tourism participants, who presented and attended. \n\nFormal and informal feedback was very positive. Participants commented on the value of discussion informed by different disciplinary, practitioner and national backgrounds. They almost invariably rated the seminars as highly useful, interesting and enjoyable; a typical comment described the series as 'an absolutely critical opportunity to reflect on social tourism'.

It is well established as part of public policy in much of mainland Europe, but not in the UK, where it depends largely on the charitable sector. Now, in austere economic times, social tourism has scope for novel and cost effective policy innovation. However research in the field has so far been partial and fragmented, and interaction between UK academics has been limited, as has interchange between academics and practitioners, and between the UK and mainland Europe. This seminar series brought together academics, public policymakers and industry practitioners from the UK and abroad to debate and develop the potential of social tourism. The seminars were very well attended, raised the profile of Social Tourism, and clarified and developed the key conceptual and policy issues that must be addressed if it is to develop in the UK. Initial findings have already made a substantial contribution to the All Party Parliamentary Group report on Social Tourism, 'Giving Britain a Break', the most high profile public policy engagement with the subject in the UK. As a result of the series, a new network of over 200 academics and practitioners has been created and this will form the basis for future research in Social Tourism. Scientific impacts were achieved through conceptual development and capacity building. Economic and societal impacts were achieved instrumentally with stakeholder groups. Cultural change and network building contributed to both sets of impacts.\n\nThe seminars were research and practice informed, with debates and links between practitioners and scholars. This built capacity and networks, whilst practitioners were informed about and debated current research, exchanging experience internationally, widening networks. \n\nConceptual impacts of the seminars demonstrated that \n\no National institutional and social contexts are important to framing the concept and devising policy. International engagement informs understanding of potential and impact, but highlights that read-across in policy specifics is limited. The 'rights' approach to tourism in mainland Europe contrasts with a long history of the state remaining uninvolved with tourism in the UK.\no The idea of Social Tourism is unfamiliar in UK policymaking and tourist industry circles - even amongst those who could be seen as Social Tourism providers; it often occurs under other names\no Confusion in terminology and the existence of contradictory, overlapping conceptualisations of Social Tourism both explains unfamiliarity and inhibits engagement by industry and policymakers. Addressing this was agreed to be crucial but difficult by all participants. Industry and policymakers called for more academic research.\no Sound economic evidence must be assembled if Social Tourism is to develop, especially in austere times; demonstrable benefits on public sector budgets are required.\no The organisers' model of the nature of Social Tourism was validated, further developed and the role of social enterprise incorporated.\nThis provides the basis for more rigorous further research in social tourism.
