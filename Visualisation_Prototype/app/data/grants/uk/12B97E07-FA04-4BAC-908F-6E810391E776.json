During this period of Chilean history there was a general repression of civil liberties that coincided with a period of general and organised public protest against the military government. This is the first chronological reconstruction of the period in the English language, and it explores previously unpublished primary sources from ecclesiastical archives and privately printed materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112562/1","grantId":"112562/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mario  Aguilar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
