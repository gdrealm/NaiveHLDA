These challenges are exacerbated by political, institutional and economic factors, including limited management and regulatory capacity, and highly inequitable access to reliable potable water. This research seeks to improve understanding of the drivers of short to medium term hydro-meteorological variability, its socioeconomic consequences and develop approaches for improved water resources management in the region.\nThe proposed collaboration addresses important knowledge gaps in the effective management of water security. Hydro-meteorological variability is large and spatially extensive such that prolonged floods and droughts cause macroscale socioeconomic impacts yet these are poorly understood. Seasonal forecasts show greater skill for southern Africa relative to many other regions but reliability and skill remain important constraints. This project will assess and refine seasonal forecasts for water management, model the socioeconomic consequences of hydro-meteorological variability and develop knowledge transfer techniques, such as Info-Gap Decision Theory for supporting water management under conditions of high uncertainty. A co-design process will engage with two case studies to develop decision-relevant indicators, and high level dissemination and up-scaling will occur through regional workshops with strategic decision-makers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L008785/2","grantId":"NE/L008785/2","fundValue":"286105","fundStart":"2014-02-10","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Declan  Conway","coPersons":["Timothy John Osborn","Bruce Alistair Lankford","Stephen  Dorling"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
