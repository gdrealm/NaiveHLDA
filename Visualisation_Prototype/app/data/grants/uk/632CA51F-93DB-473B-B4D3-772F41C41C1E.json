The developing human nervous system is susceptible to many toxicants, and chemical exposure during development may cause lasting neurological deficits. As such it is necessary to test potential developmental neurotoxins to determine the safe dose of these chemicals and ensure that they are only used within safe limits. The currently accepted method of testing potential developmental neurotoxins is using animals such as mice and rats, with 34,515 animals being sacrificed for this purpose in 2005 alone. The aim of this Pilot Study is to develop a method that will greatly reduce the number of animals used in testing developmental neurotoxins by using human stem cells that we grow in the laboratory. Stem cells have the ability to produce specialised cells for various tissues in the body. The type of stem cells that we will use, develop into the type of cells that make up the human brain. The development of these stem cells into brain cells is particularly sensitive to the effects of neurotoxins. We therefore aim to develop a model where we can accurately and rapidly measure how toxic chemicals are by the degree to which they inhibit the stem cells from being able to develop into working neurones and astrocytes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100152/1","grantId":"G1100152/1","fundValue":"73514","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Eric James  Hill","coPersons":["Harri Rheinallt Parri"],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
