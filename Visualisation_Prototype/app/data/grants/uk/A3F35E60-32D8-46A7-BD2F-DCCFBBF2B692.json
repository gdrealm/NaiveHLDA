{"id":"A3F35E60-32D8-46A7-BD2F-DCCFBBF2B692","title":"Experimental bifurcation analysis for hybrid testing methods 2","abstractText":"In hybrid testing a critical system component (such as aircraft landing gear or bridge cable) is tested in the laboratory as if it were part of amuch larger system. The missing part of the larger system (the restof the aircraft or bridge) is simulated numerically on a computer andcoupled to the critical component via sensors and actuators.We plan to unlock the full potential of this numerical-experimentaltesting technique by developing novel mathematically-inspired toolsthat will allow one to automatically find and then track stabilityboundaries in relevant system parameters. This will constitute a majorstep forward from the present approach of changing a single parameterstep-by-step and then recording what happens. We propose to develop and implement these new methods for two mechanical test bed systems of fundamental relevance, namely, adriven pendulum-oscillator and a magneto-rheological damper system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F030711/1","grantId":"EP/F030711/1","fundValue":"301655","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David James Wagg","coPersons":["Bernd  Krauskopf","Simon Andrew Neild"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" This project led to the first experiments being carried out that allowed dynamic &quot;continuation&quot; to happen. This means continuing a periodic solution in the experiment as a parameter is varied. However, not just varied in a stable regime. This project enabled a saddle-node bifurcation to be passed, so the unstable solution branch was continued as well Other leading groups of researchers around the world have applied this new technique to other systems Aerospace, Defence and Marine","dataset":"gtr"}
