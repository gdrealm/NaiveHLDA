One important question is why individuals with anxiety-based problems persevere with a worry bout for longer than non-worriers despite this increasing their distress. </p>\n\n<p>A number of personality factors have already been identified as characteristics of chronic worriers, and these include negative mood, poor problem-solving confidence, and an intolerance of uncertainty (a predisposition to react negatively to an uncertain event or situation). </p>\n\n<p>This research will investigate how these personality factors influence cognitive mechanisms to generate perseveration or catastrophisation of worrying. Studies will investigate how manipulating these personality factors affects:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>an individual's goal-setting strategies for worrying; that is, how they affect the kinds of implicit 'stop rules' that an individual adopts for terminating a worry bout;</li>\n\n <li>the type of information processing strategy that individuals adopt when in a worry bout; that is, whether they adopt a deliberate systematic approach to processing worry-relevant information, or whether they adopt a less effortful approach based on judgmental or heuristic rules.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Such an endeavour will be a significant contributor to the development of therapeutic interventions for worry-based mental health problems.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H023704/1","grantId":"ES/H023704/1","fundValue":"321565","fundStart":"2010-05-17","fundEnd":"2013-05-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham Charles Davey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
