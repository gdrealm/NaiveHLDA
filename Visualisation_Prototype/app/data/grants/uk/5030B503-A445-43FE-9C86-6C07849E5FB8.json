At the second two seminars, participants will investigate more specifically what shift are occurring in the United States’ capacities, first in terms of ‘national power’, ie&nbsp; resource-levels, economic size and military capabilities, and second in terms of its ‘structural power’, ie its position as an agenda-setter in international institutions and its political and cultural attractiveness (‘soft power’).</p>\n\n<p>The fourth seminar will discuss rising powers, particularly China, and their capacity to rival the US in these areas. The concluding event of the series, hosted at Chatham House (the Royal Institute of International Affairs) will synthesis the findings of the series. The findings of the series will be presented in a Report on American Power, published at the end of the series.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J022284/1","grantId":"ES/J022284/1","fundValue":"17717","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2014-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Adam  Quinn","coPersons":["Michael  Cox","Xenia  Dormandy","Stuart  Croft","Inderjeet  Parmar"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
