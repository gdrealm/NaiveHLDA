{"id":"82B9F83A-FDC0-4610-AA09-764E5113B61D","title":"Improving Asphalt Mixture Performance through Surface Chemistry, Adhesion and Micro-Structural Characterisation","abstractText":"A range of researcher-based activities, including researcher exchanges between the University of Nottingham, Imperial College and Texas A&amp;M University, workshops and research seminars, will be used to develop international and cross-disciplinary collaboration in the field of pavement engineering materials. The strategic areas of adhesion and the physicochemical interfacial properties of bitumen and aggregate, and the micro-structural characterisation of asphalt materials will form the basis for the research activities. Two-way researcher exchanges will form the main component of the activities and provide researchers with the opportunity to work closely with other international research groups as well as inter-disciplinary groups. The face-to-face dialogue that will be possible with these extended research visits will allow researchers the unique opportunity to identify research challenges and develop innovative approaches and research solutions to the various issues associated with the performance of pavement materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F012500/1","grantId":"EP/F012500/1","fundValue":"152337","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gordon  Airey","coPersons":["Andrew Charles Collop"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
