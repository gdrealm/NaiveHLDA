Given the importance of earthworms in the environment, this isn't a trivial matter. Earthworms have been termed &quot;ecosystem engineers&quot;. They ingest a vast amount of soil and in the process break down organic matter, mix up soil and, via their burrows, keep soils aerated. Because of these activities earthworms help the ecosystems in which they occur to provide various benefits or services. These so called ecosystem services include food production (plants grow better in the presence of earthworms) and flood control (soils with lots of earthworm burrows can store more water and also water drains more rapidly through burrowed soil thereby reducing the chances of flooding).\n\nGiven the beneficial role of earthworms in the environment it makes sense to manage soils in a way that helps earthworms flourish. We can only do this if we understand what impact soil properties and land management practises have on the distribution of earthworms. In the UK semi-natural grasslands account for about 16% of land use and managed, nutrient-enriched grasslands account for an additional 20 %. These grasslands are used for food production; animals used for dairy and meat production graze on them. Traditionally agricultural management has focussed on improving the nutrient quality of the grass so as to maximise production. But as society increasingly appreciates the various services that the environment can provide such as biodiversity and water storage as well as food production it is worth asking what impact management strategies have on the earthworms that contribute so strongly to so many vital services.\n\nOur research aims to look at how earthworms are distributed along a gradient of grassland intensification, from low input, low grazing intensity grasslands to high input, high grazing intensity grasslands. We are particularly concerned with understanding the spatial distribution of earthworms in these grasslands and how this relates to soil properties and grassland management. By sampling earthworms and soil properties at a range of spatial scales, from fields to farms to the whole of the UK, we will be able to determine whether there are critical thresholds of agricultural intensification beyond which earthworms, and hence the ecosystem services that they provide, are lost from grassland systems.\n\nMembers of the public will get involved in our work by helping us with the sampling and learning how to identify earthworms at workshops. The records of earthworms we collect will feed into the ongoing earthworm recording scheme and the work of the Biological Records Centre. Both of these activities will give our work a lasting legacy beyond the life of the project. For example, repeat surveys could highlight changes in earthworm numbers in response to environmental change. The earthworms and soils that we sample will also be archived for future research. We will involve the land owners where we sample earthworms in our discussions and discuss our results and models with then as well as policy makers, conservationists and ecologists to ensure that they are used to help protect and potentially increase earthworm numbers in order to protect the varied ecosystem services that grasslands provide whilst maintaining necessary levels of food production.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K015338/1","grantId":"NE/K015338/1","fundValue":"147617","fundStart":"2013-09-23","fundEnd":"2014-12-22","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Too early for them to be used - one year project still active.  ","person":"Paul  Eggleton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Natural History Museum","findingsText":" Our studies of grassland earthworms have revealed the importance of pH, soil moisture and nitrogen as drivers of earthworm abundances and diversity. In particular, it has shown that nitrate concentration has a humped relationship with the abundance of common British earthworms, with low and high levels of nitrate having low numbers of earthworms and intermediate levels having high numbers of earthworms. This has important consequences when attempting to employ earthworms as providers of ecosystem services in agricultural systems. The findings are of particular importance in conventional and organic agriculture as they give an idea under what conditions earthworms may be providing valuable ecosystem services.
