Its function is to develop research in the 5 language fields of French, Germanic, Italian and Hispanic (Spanish &amp; Portuguese) studies [FGIH], within the UK and internationally, with a particular focus on interdisciplinary studies.\nPsychoanalysis has not only entered the common language, in a variety of forms, but has enabled distinctive theoretical questions to be framed in every sphere of the arts &amp; humanities. This Network will bring researchers in the arts and the humanities whose work uses psychoanalytic theory together with psychoanalytic clinicians to discuss questions of common interest.\nA Steering Committee of 16 was convened in 2004 and a Workshop held in Oct 2005 was attended by 24 people (out of 70 who responded to a preliminary Call). At this Workshop a number of issues were highlighted for development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E508618/1","grantId":"AH/E508618/1","fundValue":"24432","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Naomi Dinah Segal","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
