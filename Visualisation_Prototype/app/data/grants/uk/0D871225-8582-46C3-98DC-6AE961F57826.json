We propose to take a roughly 25% share of time with the East Asian Observatories (EAO) being the lead operator, and Canada also taking a smaller share (TBC). \n\nEAO are committed to operating JCMT for an initial period of 5 years; we are committed to a contribution from our own resources of &pound;300k pa for 3 years and we are here requesting matched funding from STFC for the same period. In addition we request a small amount of travel funds to allow UK astronomers to spend time working with the EAO scientists in Hawaii. \n\nThe UK financial contribution will allow it to not only gain access to a proportionate (smaller than the present 55%) share of observing time but actually to continue a leading role in the major surveys and targeted observations currently being undertaken at a fraction of the current cost to the UK. This is because the EAO see the operation of JCMT as a way to develop the skill base of their own communities and to benefit from the enormous expertise of the UK community. Therefore the baseline plan is that all partners will put 50% of the total observing time into survey programmes defined and exploited by joint science teams. The UK community will thereby gain access to at least 62.5% of the total science output of JCMT at a total cost of ~&pound;1M over 3 years compared to a similar fraction at present as the major partner at a total cost of around &pound;2M per year","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M003019/1","grantId":"ST/M003019/1","fundValue":"448007","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Walter  Kieran  Gear","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
