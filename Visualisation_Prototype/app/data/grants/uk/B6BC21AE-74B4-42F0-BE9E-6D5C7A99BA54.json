The BlueGene/Q computer at Edinburgh provides petascale capability, employing the most energy-efficient technology in the world, and will be utilised for projects selected by DiRAC's Resource Allocation Committee (RAC) through peer review.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K005804/1","grantId":"ST/K005804/1","fundValue":"341753","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Donovan Kenway","coPersons":["Peter  Boyle"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
