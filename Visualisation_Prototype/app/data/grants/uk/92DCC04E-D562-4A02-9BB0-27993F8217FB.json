However, the alcohol biobutanol is widely acknowledged as a 'superior biofuel'. It is traditionally produced via a sugar-based fermentation process using a bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum. The process, however, remains uneconomic due to feedstock prices, which represents 60-80% of production costs.\n\nAnother member of the same family of bacteria, Clostridium pasteurianum is a robust, fast growing bacterium which is also able to grow on glycerol as well as sugars and produce valuable 3-carbon (1,3 propanediol) and 4-carbon chemicals (butyrate &amp; butanol). The microbe has tremendous potential as a fermentation host but has not been exploited due to its limited substrate range and mixed array of chemical products that result in low butanol yield compared to current commercial. In this project we aim to use synthetic biology to introduce new metabolic pathways for starch utilisation and butanol production into C. pasteurianum with the aim to produce butanol in high yield from starch. Genetic manipulation based on gene knockout will also be used to inactivate competing pathways. \n \nThe partners have extensive experience with solventogenic Clostridia. Nottingham's CRG has developed an impressive range of gene tools and recently completed the determination of the complete genetic blueprint (genome sequence) of C. pasteuranium. GBL has identified novel pathways for both starch degradation and butanol production from its unique collection of commercial strains and leads recommercialisation efforts for the butanol fermentation. This collaboration between GBL and GRG enables, for the first time, a targeted and rational approach for strain improvement in a novel host using synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. This project clearly demonstrates the potential application of synthetic biology for industrial biotechnology. Fermentation performance from the engineered C. pasteurianum strains will be benchmarked against GBL's best performing commercial strains and if promising taken forward for further development. The project output will also support additional projects with this microbe focused on extending the substrate range to include cellulosic feedstocks and developing glycerol metabolism for the production of 3-carbon chemicals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L004356/1","grantId":"BB/L004356/1","fundValue":"246156","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The overall aim of this project is to enhance and extend the capabilities of solventogenic bacteria in terms of fuel and chemical production from cost effective feedstocks. As this is an Industrial Partnership, the primary beneficiary is Green Biologics Ltd. They will directly commercialise all useful strains that emerge from the project and will have first refusal on any foreground intellectual property that arises.\nProject outcomes will allow improved fermentation process economics and product diversity, thus encouraging more rapid and wide spread adoption of clostridia-based butanol fermentation as a process to produce high volumes of low cost butanol as a chemical commodity and potentially as a biofuel. The partnership are anticipated to directly benefit from the outputs of the project through their commercial adoption via the pipeline established by GBL to scale-up and commercially produce fuel and chemical products by clostridia fermentation.

To date we have:-\n\n[1] Completed the entire genome sequence of two Clostridium pasteurianum strains and completely annotated the genomes \n\n[2] Isolated a super transforming derivative of the host strain and optimised transformation to be several orders of magnitude higher than the parent strain\n\n[3] Identified the most appropriate plasmid replicons to be used\n\n[4] Exemplified ClosTron technology by making a pyrE mutant\n\n[5] Implemented Allele-Coupled Exchange (ACE) to make a pyrE mutant in the genome.\n\n[6] Used the strain created to implement in-frame deletion technology using a negative selection marker based on a heterologous pyrE gene.\n\n[7] Used the deletion technology to make in frame deletions in genes encoding\nenzymes involved in by-product formation.\n\n[8] Demonstrated functionality of a high level, orthogonal expression system\n\n[9] Cloned heterologous genes involved in butanol formation ready for insertion into the genome using ACE\n\nThe end date of the project has been extended until 31st January 2015. Our findings represent an exemplar example of the suitability of Nottingham's Roadmap for gene system development in clostridial species, through its flawless adaptation to Clostridium pasteurianum. Currently, the number of researchers in the UK investigating butanol-producing clostridia is very restricted, limited to just a couple of groups. The fundamental findings of this project will help others in the UK to embrace clostridial research.\n\nAlthough the commercial partner are only interested in starch as a feedstock, the organism is particularly adept at growing on glycerol. Glycerol is a versatile carbon and energy source and presently it is produced in large scale as the principle by-product (10% w/w) of the biodiesel industry where the rapidly expanding market for biodiesel has dramatically altered the cost (for crude glycerol, prices have decreased from $0.25 per pound to $0.05 per pound) and availability of glycerol. It is now essentially a waste product of biodiesel industry and it has been estimated that the production of crude glycerol from biodiesel industry will reach 37 billion gallons by 2016. Nottingham will therefore independently pursue this feedstock through the award of a Marie Curie International Incoming Fellow who will start at Nottingham in 2015.
