{"id":"F8E1FE63-B17F-4444-9779-322904E5D147","title":"Governing drug-related crime in the risk society","abstractText":"<p>In the course of the last fifteen or twenty years, risk has become one of the central terms of social and cultural thought and commentary. Risk thinking and risk management have come to occupy a distinctive place within contemporary politics and government. The overarching aim of this research is to further understand this ascendance of risk as a framework for viewing and acting upon human behaviour. It seeks to do so by an empirical study of policy and practice in one of the most pressing social problem fields of the early twenty-first century -&nbsp;the area of drug-related crime. The Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) is a major government initiative aimed at tackling this issue by using the criminal justice system to identify drug-using offenders and channel them in to drug treatment. This research will examine the principles and assumptions underpinning DIP through documentary analysis and interviews with key national and regional policymakers. Its implementation in practice will be explored in three local case studies, employing a multi-method approach, drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data. The study will further knowledge about strategies for tackling drug-related crime as well extending understanding about the place of risk in contemporary life.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0028","grantId":"RES-061-23-0028","fundValue":"232496","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Toby  Seddon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
