{"id":"1EE0AC1E-3CB5-47BD-9CD9-2800145D6CF5","title":"Travel support for Edinburgh PATT observers 2010-2012","abstractText":"We request a continued roll-forward of our PATT grant (ST/F012292/1), for support for telescope travel and subsistence at the modestly increased level of &pound;12000 per year. This funding level is based on the 18 months of actual spend for the current grant, which exceeds somewhat spend anticipated under the current award of &pound;10,000 per year. This increase in our typical annual bill for travel to telescopes can be attributed to the continued expansion of the observational group at Edinburgh. With UKIDSS set to continue for the next 3 years, and SCUBA2 survey observing scheduled to commence in early 2010, our PATT funding requirements are unlikely to decrease in the next 2-3 years, and may even grow further.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H008594/1","grantId":"ST/H008594/1","fundValue":"24542","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  This research has primarily been of benefit to the academic community. Its main non-academic impact has been in terms of contribution to outreach, especially in the Royal Observatory Edinburgh Visitor Centre.  ","person":"John Andrew Peacock","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" The research supported under these programmes covered a broad range of astronomy and astrophysics. Probably the most significant achievement has been mapping the cosmological distribution of matter in a range of wavebands, as well as inferring the distribution of dark matter. Thus we can visualise how dark matter pulls together gas and measure the quantity of star formation that results. All important results from these grants form part of the academic research literature, and will be elaborated further by interested specialists.
