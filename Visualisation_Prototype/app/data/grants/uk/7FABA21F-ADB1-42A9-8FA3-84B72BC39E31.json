{"id":"7FABA21F-ADB1-42A9-8FA3-84B72BC39E31","title":"ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science (CASS)","abstractText":"<p>Corpus linguistics uses computers to permit the analysis of millions, or even billions, of words of data to look for patterns of usage that are not necessarily observable otherwise. It was pioneered largely in the UK. It has revolutionised linguistics, changing the way language is analysed and how languages are taught. Beyond linguistics, it has profoundly altered how computers can engage with human language - corpus methods lie behind many of the most effective language technologies today, such as web searching and voice recognition. Yet while the analysis of language is a thread that runs through all of the social sciences, they have not, so far, benefitted notably from the corpus approach.</p>\n\n<p>The Centre will change that by demonstrating the benefits of the corpus approach to social science. The Centre will also train a new generation of social science researchers to use these techniques. Building on an initial five year investment by the ESRC, the Centre will work for 15 years to facilitate the uptake of corpus techniques in the social sciences. In doing so, it will turn one UK success story - corpus linguistics - into another: corpus informed social sciences.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002155/1","grantId":"ES/K002155/1","fundValue":"2955580","fundStart":"2013-03-31","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tony  McEnery","coPersons":["Elena  Semino","Ian  Gregory","Peter John Diggle","Jonathan  Culpeper","Steven  Young","Paul Edward Rayson","Kate  Cain","Paul  Iganski","John  Urry","Andrew  Hardie","Richard Zhonghua Xiao","John Paul Baker","Chakravarthi  Ram-Prasad"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
