{"id":"787BBF16-C8BA-4143-91E6-38E8CACCEC4D","title":"UKDP: Integrated DEmentiA research environment (IDEA)","abstractText":"The UK Dementias Platform (UKDP) is a radically new approach to dementias research. It brings together data from around 2,000,000 study participants from 22 cohorts to try and discover the causes of dementia and to find out ways of slowing it down. The platform has been funded to the level of &pound;12M.\n\nIn this proposal we want to improve UK infrastructure for dementia research so that the most can be made of the opportunity provided by UKDP. We wan to improve the infrastructure by buying important pieces of equipment that will put the UK at the forefront of dementia research worldwide and by establishing networks of scientists who will work together to make best use of the equipment. \nThe three themes of the proposal are imaging, informatics and stem cells.\n\nFor imaging we want to establish a network of PET/MR scanning facilities across the UK so that the molecular processes going on inside the brain that cause dementia can be studied.\n\nFor informatics we want to be bring together bas many different types of data as possible and make it easy as possible for scientists to use them\n\nFor stem cells we want to take cells form adults with and without dementia to find out how cells change as the dementias process begins and progresses.\n\nWe believe these proposals will raise standards, reduce costs, and deliver innovative and coordinated research, making the UK an internationally unique place to study dementia.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M009076/1","grantId":"MR/M009076/1","fundValue":"1882980","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  GallacherJulie  Williams","coPersons":["Emyr  Lloyd-Evans","Andrew David Lawrence","Christopher  Marshall","Kim  Graham","Vladimir L.
