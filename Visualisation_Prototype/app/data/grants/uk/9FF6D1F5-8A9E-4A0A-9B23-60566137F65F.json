{"id":"9FF6D1F5-8A9E-4A0A-9B23-60566137F65F","title":"SMALL ITEMS OF RESEARCH EQUIPMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL","abstractText":"The focus for this application is to support the research activity of more than 20 young early career research workers (ECRs) in the four cross-disciplinary fields of Energy, Catalysis, Manufacturing Technologies and Healthcare Technologies. These research themes were chosen for investment in new research staff on the basis of the University's existing cognate research strengths, the challenges that exist in these areas in terms of meeting future societal needs, their potential for world class research and for addressing issues of future national importance. Each of these research themes have active research programmes related to EPSRC research areas. The funds will support small items of equipment under &pound;10k for research programmes led by these ECRs, enhacing the research capabilities of these groups, enabling new strands of research and collaborations with other research groups both at Liverpool and in the wider UK academic community. \n\nAreas that will be supported within these themes include:\n\nEnergy - problems in renewable energy, reduction in energy demand and nuclear power, advances in new energy materials, including batteries and photovoltaics, environmental aspects of nuclear energy and materials modelling.\n\nCatalysis -fundamentals of catalytic and photocatalytic materials and processes, development of new materials and their application, particularly to advanced manufacturing for specific materials, development of cleaner, safer and cheaper routes to existing technologies and the development of new catalysts for bio-fuels and other energy applications.\n\nManufacturing Technologies - developing technologies for manufacturing industries by supporting new technology platforms that have broad application in high value manufacturing, developing precision control and data processing capability from strengths in engineering to both establish the platform itself and demonstrate how it can be applied to problems of industrial importance.\n\nHealthcare Technologies - spporting biomedical engineering as a fast growing area of research by equipping cross-disciplinary collaborations in the physical and life sciences, engineering and medicine to examine soft and hard tissue biomechanics, biomaterials and image processing, leading to development of new medical devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031511/1","grantId":"EP/K031511/1","fundValue":"392169","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Werner  Hofer","coPersons":["Andrew  Hodgson"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
