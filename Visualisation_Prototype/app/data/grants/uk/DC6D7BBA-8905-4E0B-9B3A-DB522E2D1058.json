Individual trajectories of personal mobility will then be constructed within a GIS environment and integrated with high resolution estimates of air pollution in order to derive personal levels of exposure to air pollution. A range of qualitative techniques will subsequently be employed to gain insight into relationships between perceived levels of health in relation to local environmental factors in space and time (and will include the interpretation of images and text entries captured en route to and from school by the children). The project is exploratory in nature and aims to assess the degree to which mobile phone technology may be exploited to generate richer forms of information. In this study, the emphasis is on a better understanding of personal mobility and exposure to air pollution. Ultimately, the technology may be used to gain a deeper and richer understanding of personal behaviour in many other areas of social sciences research.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E01139X/1","grantId":"ES/E01139X/1","fundValue":"76771","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James Duncan Whyatt","coPersons":["Colin Gilbert Pooley","Paul  Coulton"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
