Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will also be conducted as appropriate. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4157","grantId":"RES-000-22-4157","fundValue":"76952","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew Eric Engelke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
