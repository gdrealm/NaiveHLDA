{"id":"2EC225EA-88C9-4289-8FE5-EFF83A8A98E2","title":"Determining the role of kisspeptins in the peripheral control of ovarian physiology and pregnancy.","abstractText":"Puberty is an important developmental milestone for all mammals but until recently, very little was know about the molecules that initiated this event. We have shown that a novel protein (GPR54) and the molecules that bind to this protein (kisspeptins) are essential for puberty. Mice lacking these proteins fail to undergo puberty and are sterile. Kisspeptins and GPR54 are expressed in a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus, which is known to play a crucial role in regulating fertility. The expression pattern of these genes, however, suggest that they may also function outside the brain to regulate the function of the ovaries and in pregnancy. The aim of this project is to define these roles by comparative studies using mutant mice lacking kisspeptins or GPR54. The mutant mice will be given hormonal treatments to induce fertility and the physiological and molecular responses examined. These studies will establish the function of kisspeptin/GPR54 in ovary and uterine physiology and provide an insight into the role of these genes in reproductive disorders such as early gestational abortions and premature hypogonadism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F01936X/1","grantId":"BB/F01936X/1","fundValue":"480179","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  During this grant, we have generated a new transgenic mouse in which the CRE recombinase protein is specifically expressed by Kiss1 neurons. This mouse will be invaluable to study the activity of Kiss1 neurons to establish their role in many physiological processess such as the maintenance of pregnancy. The will be particularly useful in mapping neuronal networks that make contact with Kiss1 neurons.

Establishing a hormone replacement regime to induce sexual maturation in Gpr54 and Kiss1 mutant mice and to establish early pregnancy in the mutant mice.\n\n\n\n2. Determining a specific time point during pregnancy (E10.5) when implantation fails and embryo degeneration occurs in the mutant mice due to impared progesterone levels. Progesterone implants failed to maintain pregnancy. This suggests that there may be an intrinsic defect in placentation which is being studied further.\n\n\n\n3. Generation of transgenic mice with expression of CRE recombinase in Kiss1 neurons to provide a biological resource to study the central regulation of pregnancy in the mutant mice. Highlights the possible role that kisspeptin signalling might play in maintaining pregnancy. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
