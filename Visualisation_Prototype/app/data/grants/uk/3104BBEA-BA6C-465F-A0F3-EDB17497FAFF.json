A new observational array is being setup in the South Atlantic by teams from South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, France and the USA. This proposal seeks support for to establish collaboration between the RAPID team and those leading the South Atlantic array. The collaboration will ensure that NERC funded scientists remain at the forefront of the international research effort to monitor, understand, and develop the capability for prediction of the AMOC.\nThe collaboration will add value to the NERC funded RAPID 26N project (part of the RAPID-AMOC directed program), and also the newly funded OSNAP project (large grant NE/K010875/1), by \n1) linking observations of the AMOC in the North Atlantic with those in the South Atlantic to provide new insights to the AMOC that have not previously been possible.\n2) Inter-comparing array designs, data analysis techniques and methods to enable best practice to be shared amongst all teams observing the AMOC\nIt is proposed to hold a three-day workshop at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) in spring or summer 2015 with the title &quot;Monitoring the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: synergies between observations in North and South subtropical Atlantic&quot;.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M017575/1","grantId":"NE/M017575/1","fundValue":"28017","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"David Alexander Smeed","coPersons":["Elaine  McDonagh","Bengamin Ivan Moat"],"organisation":"National Oceanography Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
