{"id":"5AFC11E7-D95B-4994-8F31-8A76F6D96E04","title":"Statistical modelling for real-time spatial surveillance and forecasting","abstractText":"Public health outcomes are typically associated with both a specific place and a specific time, and therefore generate spatio-temporal data. Timely analysis of these data can assist in both the design and the prompt delivery of public health interventions. However, most currently available statistical methods for the analysis of such data operate off-line, and often with considerable delay between the occurrence of the events in question and completion of the analysis of the resulting data. \n\nIn this project, we propose to develop novel statistical methods that can be run in real-time, and to implement these in software systems that respond automatically to newly acquired data as they accrue in real-time.\n\nWe will embed the methodological developments within two contrasting applications. The first is to the forecasting and control of emerging meningitis epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa; Meningitis is a major public health problem in this part of the world, where between 3% and 30% of the population carries the infective agent, and the mortality rate amongst cases can be as high as 10%. Our second application is to the monitoring and reporting of calls to NHS Direct, classified by place, time and syndrome; the aim is to strengthen current surveillance systems based on NHS Direct data, by providing information at finer spatial and temporal resolutions than hitherto.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902153","grantId":"G0902153","fundValue":"402328","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Diggle","coPersons":["Barry Stephen Rowlingson"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
