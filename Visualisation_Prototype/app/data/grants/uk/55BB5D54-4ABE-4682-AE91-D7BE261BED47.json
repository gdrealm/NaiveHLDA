UK research has world class strengths and reputation in both these areas. This is an outstanding opportunity to showcase UK research and development at premier international forums, and an ideal event to benefit the broad training of young researchers. This proposal seeks funds to help run this international event. The grant will support researcher training by holding dedicated tutorials, enable us to invite four recognised international leaders (two industrialists and two academics) to present the plenary keynote addresses, and coordinate the development of the joint two-conference programme. Finally, a modest contribution is sought for travel, secretarial and technical support.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F029012/1","grantId":"EP/F029012/1","fundValue":"14172","fundStart":"2008-01-23","fundEnd":"2008-10-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexandre  Yakovlev","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
