Such high total linear polarisation is almost unheard of in extragalactic sources. We may have found a new class of galaxies that favour the production of radio sources with extremely ordered, strong magnetic field in a low density environment. We propose optical spectroscopy and imaging to study the nature of this new class of objects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H003185/1","grantId":"ST/H003185/1","fundValue":"650","fundStart":"2009-06-09","fundEnd":"2009-09-08","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The data we collected has been made available to the astronomy community.

This improved the statistics of the study of the nature of ultra high polarisation radio sources. The data is available publically and can be used for a variety of other astronomy projects.
