{"id":"6284F5A6-D590-47B3-94F2-60487C42D7AF","title":"Census Geographic Information Visualisation (Censusgiv)","abstractText":"<p>The objective of the Censusgiv project is to offer a geographic visualisation website of the most significant 2001 Census Aggregate Outputs (Key Statistics, Standard Tables, and Census Area Statistics) at the smallest level of geographical aggregation available. The website will be accessible by anybody in the general public (agreeing with the licence terms), and will be focussed on exploring the data geographically with very easy navigability, based on freely available mapping mashups. The interface will leverage upon the technologies developed at UCL as part of the NCeSS UCL node (GeoVUE) at the Centre of Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), which relate thematic maps with easy to understand &quot;real geography&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>There is a gap in the dissemination of Census outputs through meaningful geographic visualisations, within and outside the research community. Local authorities, NHS, NGOs and the general public are demanding this type of easily accessible geographic visualisations of the Census that are not sufficiently addressed by the ONS Neighbourhood Statistics website, or current ESRC Census Programme Websites. This proposal will render visualiation methods, Census data and intuitive mapping easily accessible to the social science research community and effect knowledge transfer to local government and public services, as well as to a lay audience, through an interactive geographic visualisation web service.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F035225/1","grantId":"ES/F035225/1","fundValue":"62963","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Pablo  Mateos","coPersons":["Paul Arthur Longley","Michael  Batty"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
