{"id":"F09778E4-2F28-4A5A-8106-0ED9B050E0A6","title":"Developing Innovative Methods for Configurative Capture of the Cultural Value of Arts and Humanities Research","abstractText":"The project aims to contribute a refined conceptual model of what constitutes cultural value of arts and humanities research (and what impact evaluation methods are attempting to capture), empirical evidence of how interpretations of cultural value play out in practice (via 35 case studies, 70-100 interviews, and over 20 maps of value networks), and an innovative, in-depth methodological approach to capturing cultural value. The project will engage with scholars from 10 groups of arts and humanities disciplines and from over 20 settings, to ensure that the methods for capturing and articulating value are conceptualized in their own terms, rather than imposing simplifying dichotomies. In addition, the study will explore the experiences, understandings and practices of a further 15 value actors, including public cultural institutions, third sector organizations, cultural engagement initiatives, and other partners, users and beneficiaries of arts and humanities research.\n\nThe study will draw on social scientific approaches to make a distinctive contribution to enhancing methodological capability to capture cultural value in its richness and diversity. The development and testing of a robust configurative approach (i.e., an approach that explores and maps a field in its depth and richness) to recognising and capturing research value in the arts and humanities will be a core contribution of the study. The in-depth case studies to be carried out will combine attention to institutional and individual experiences, with careful mapping and weighting of the networks within which value is enacted and recognized. \n\nThe conceptual model and innovative methods for capturing the value of research that will be refined and tested in the project were originally developed in Oancea (2011), drawing on Oancea and Furlong (2005, 2007a, 2008) and Oancea (2007b). This body of work has critiqued excessively instrumental interpretations of the value of research, but sought to move beyond dualist arguments about, for example, intrinsic vs. instrumental value, value vs. impact, articulating vs. measuring value, or social accountability vs. economic accounting. On this basis, the project proposes a textured notion of cultural value. The conceptual model identifies aspects of cultural value and suggests that the availability of evidence and the straightforwardness of the measures we use are in inverse proportion to the breadth and complexity of value realisation. \n\nThe methodology of the study is driven by concerns for texture, diversity, nuance and ecology. The configurative approach to capturing cultural value will complement the focus on breadth and precision (i.e. aggregative approaches) that has been common in recent efforts to measure cultural value from socio-economic perspectives. A multiple case-study design will ensure both breadth (through 35 case studies of research units, research initiatives, value-oriented programmes, partner and user or beneficiary organisations) and depth (through 70-100 interviews and network mapping methods &quot;drilling down&quot; into each case).\n\nThe project will pursue primary impacts on individual and organizational understanding and practices, and secondary impacts on public discourses about the cultural value of arts and humanities research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L005131/1","grantId":"AH/L005131/1","fundValue":"38291","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  It is still early days, but feedback from some of the 25 participant settings has pointed to the potential of this work to catalyze interest in the value of research and influence individual and organizational practices.

The conceptual, methodological and empirical (drawing on over 500k words worth of interview data) components of the study have furthered our understanding of cultural value as a contested notion, beset by philosophical, practical and political tensions. The conceptual model developed through the study suggests that interpretations of value - cultural or otherwise - underpin economies of description, prescription, inscription and ascription of value, while at the same time being part of complex ecologies of cultural life, creation and understanding. Meaning, expression, narrative and practice, combined and recombined in experience through the inter-action between self and others, sit at the core of our participants' description of the arts and the humanities. However, the economy of valuing and the ecologies of value seem to function in parallel and occasionally clash, particularly so in the mechanisms and measures for research performance currently shaping higher education activity. More needs to be done across all levels of the research governance system so that narratives in these terms are no longer perceived as a risk in accountability contexts.\n\nIn addition, the study developed an innovative methodological approach for articulating and communicating the impact and cultural value of research: qualitative network analysis using collaborative configuration tracing and visualisation. The approach uses co-constructed, case-centred network diagrams to enable the structured elicitation and visualization of information from participants (researchers, administrators, facilitators, partners, users and beneficiaries) and the assessment of the relative strength of different flows and relationships relevant to creating, articulating and demonstrating value. Unlike quantitative network studies, the emphasis here is on the process of construction and interpretation of qualitative network maps by the participants. Subject to further testing and refinement, the approach and tools that we have developed are amenable to use in research, evaluation, communication and developmental work in higher education institution and funding organisations. Following publication of two peer-reviewed articles and further communication in 2015, the substantive and conceptual findings will benefit scholars and research managers in the arts and humanities, particularly in their work on refined understandings of research value and on reporting the impact of research for research assessment purposes. Particularly important is the project's methodological contribution to the creation of robust configurative approaches to impact case study development, which can contribute to advances in the fields of research impact and evaluation, but also to practical developments in the creative sector, heritage, museums, and cultural policy. We have used the findings in research training and there is potential for further professional development use. The methodological tools developed can lead to digital developments and we have started exploring this possibility.\n\nCommunication about the project to date includes an extended report to the Cultural Value project, a blog entry, posters, talks and presentations, publicly-available Prezi, and Twitter. We are now working on a short film and on several conference talks. \n\nThe project is expected to have primary impacts on individual and organizational understanding and practices, and secondary impacts on public discourses about the cultural value of arts and humanities research. While it is still early days, feedback from some of the 25 participant settings has pointed to the potential of this work to catalyze interest in the value of research and influence individual and organizational practices.
