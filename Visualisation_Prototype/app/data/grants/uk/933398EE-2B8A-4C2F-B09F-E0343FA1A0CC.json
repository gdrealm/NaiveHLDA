{"id":"933398EE-2B8A-4C2F-B09F-E0343FA1A0CC","title":"Grant Balances 2010 - University of Bath","abstractText":"The University of Bath proposes to utilise its Unspent Balance funding to undertake 3 strands of activity\n\n1) Bridge funding to retain early career researchers and PDRAs - Talented research staff who have gained valuable experience and skills through EPSRC-funded projects are frequently lost to the University because of the lack of salary funds to bridge the gap between grants. This small fund should enable the retention of a small number of key research staff, to the benefit of the University, the researchers themselves and the UK research pool.\n\n2) Funds for research dissemination activities - Potential uses of this funding will be to support conference attendance to disseminate outputs from EPSRC funded projects, attend collaborative meetings to generate future proposals and public engagement.\n\n3) Follow-on studies to determine commercial viability - The final strand of activity will be to utilize part of the funding to enable follow-on projects with industrial partners to develop the outcomes of EPSRC funded projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J015504/1","grantId":"EP/J015504/1","fundValue":"131421","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Millar","coPersons":["Rob  Head"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
