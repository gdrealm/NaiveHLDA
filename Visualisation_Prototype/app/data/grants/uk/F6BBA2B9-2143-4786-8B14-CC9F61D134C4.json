Bringing together evidence from in-depth historical analyses, the re-use of existing quantitative data and new qualitative research on the detail, dynamics and significance of 'everyday participation', it will create new understandings of community formation, connectivity and capacity through participation. Orthodox models of the creative economy and ensuing cultural policy are based on a narrow definition of cultural participation; one that captures formal engagement with traditional cultural institutions, such as museums and galleries, but overlooks other activities, for instance community festivals and hobbies. This frame, founded historically on deficit based assumptions of the logics for state cultural support, misses opportunities to understand the variety of forms of participation and their (positive and negative) consequences. We argue that by creating new understandings of the relationships between everyday participation, community and cultural value, we will reveal evidence of hidden assets and resources that can be mobilised to promote better identification and more equitable resourcing of cultural opportunities, generate well-being and contribute to the development of creative local economies. \n\nThe central research questions are:\n\n- How, historically, did we arrive at the definitions, fields of knowledge and policy frames informing notions of cultural participation and value today?\n\n- What are the forms and practices of everyday participation - where do they take place? How are they valued? And how do these practices relate to formal participation?\n\n- How is participation shaped by space, place and locality?\n\n- How are communities made, unmade, divided and connected through participation?\n\n- How can broader understandings of value in and through participation be used to inform the development of vibrant communities and creative local economies?\n\n- How do we reconnect cultural policy and institutions with everyday participation?\n\nUsing a variety of methodologies, including historical analysis, qualitative work with communities of practice and use, and the reanalysis of existing data on participation and time-use, this project focuses on six contrasting 'cultural ecosystems' to investigate the connections between multiple understandings of community (geographical, elective, identity based etc), cultural value, 'cultural economy' and everyday participation. The findings from the situated case studies will inform four partnership-operated trials of new policy interventions or of professional or community practices. Throughout the project research will be integrated with key partners, stakeholder cultural and community organisations in order to evolve better, shared understandings of everyday cultural participation and the implications of this for policy makers and cultural organisations at national, local and community levels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J005401/1","grantId":"AH/J005401/1","fundValue":"1221680","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Graham Miles","coPersons":["Eleonora  Belfiore","Abigail  Gilmore","Jane  Milling","Felicity  James","Lisanne  Gibson","Kerrie Vanessa Schaefer"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
