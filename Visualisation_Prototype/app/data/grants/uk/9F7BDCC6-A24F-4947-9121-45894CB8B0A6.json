In essence, this is what happens when the genome of a new species is sequenced. Old fashioned technology used to &quot;sketch the outline of the streets&quot; first before filling in the gaps with the gene sequence. The new technology (so called &quot;Next Generation Sequencing&quot;) is much cheaper and quicker but is quite poor at sorting out where the genes are in relation to one another. Essentially, Next Generation Sequencing assemblies are little more than catalogues of genes with little structure of the overall genome apparent. Fortunately this problem can be rectified using a technique called &quot;FISH&quot; that can take the data from next generation sequencing projects and visualise directly the genes as they appear in their rightful place in the genome. In this project we intend to do this with 25-30 recently completed genome sequences from birds. Birds are among the most diverse animals with around 10,000 living species. Many are models for human disease and development and are critical to agriculture (both meat and eggs). Others are threatened or endangered and, with impending global warming, molecular tools for the study of ecology and conservation of birds are essential. It is also possible to compare the overall structure of one genome with another, somewhat like comparing the maps of towns with similar layouts. We have developed online tools that can directly visualize the similarities and differences between the genomes of several birds at a time. Of course the differences between these bird genomes came about through changes that happened during evolution. One of the main aims of this project is to find out how and why this occurred. We have a number of ideas such as we think there may be different &quot;gene signatures&quot; at the places in the genome where evolutionary rearrangements are more or less likely to occur. We think that the whole process may be related to the mechanisms by which our genes recombine in our germ cells. We also think there may be a role for small pieces of DNA that &quot;float around&quot; these bird genomes. Finally, we have received overwhelming support from numerous laboratories all over the world, all of whom are interested in bird genomics and who would wish to use our online resource to ask biological questions of their own. For this reason we feel that this project not only will help us understand evolution in birds but also establish the UK as a central international hub for work of this kind.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K008226/1","grantId":"BB/K008226/1","fundValue":"280392","fundStart":"2013-05-16","fundEnd":"2013-08-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Evolution Highway is a freely available from http://evolutionhighway.nsca.uiuc.edu/birds is used as an educational aid by Dr. Larkin and other groups to introduce students to ideas of comparative genomics during lectures and practicals, as well as develop tutorial student projects related to comparative and &quot;informatics-paleogenomics&quot;.

We aligned 21 avian genomes that were made available to us through the international avian genome project to chicken chromosomes and made results of these alignments available to our collaborators through the Avian Evolution Highway chromosome browser: http://eh-demo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/birds/\nWe further used this resource to contribute and lead the chromosome evolution section of the avian genomes comparative paper (Zhang et al., Science, in press) perform sequence-based comparison of chromosome evolution in birds (Farre et al., PNAS under review) and to reconstruct the ancestral avian chromosome structure (Romanov et al., BMC Genomics, under review). Together these papers formed a significant contribution to our knowledge of avian chromosome evolution: (i) showing that the rates of chromosomal rearrangements in birds are differing in evolutionary time, (ii) stability of avian karyotypes could be explained by low fraction and distribution of transposable elements in avian genomes, (iii) evolutionary stable regions of avian chromosomes are enriched for genes responsible for ancestral phenotypes, (iv) genes found in lineage-specific rearrangements of avian chromosomes are often connected to lineage-specific characteristics, such as forebrain development in parrots.\nFrom a technical perspective we were able to establish new computation resource: 6 node computer cluster at the RVC that is used by our group to achieve these and other deliverables of the grant. We attracted a talented Ph.D. student who is currently upgrading the Evolution Highway genome alignments to RACA predicted chromosome fragments. After this resource is built we are planning to use these long chromosome fragments to map them on avian chromosomes in collaboration with our grant partner Prof. Darren Griffin (University of Kent) in order to produce chromosome assemblies of several avian species.\nAs it follows from the text above we had a very successful first year and a half of this project: we developed the largest publically available resource of chromosome structures in birds, have contributed to a major comparative paper on avian genome evolution scheduled for publication in Science and have 2 other papers under review that have contributed to our knowledge of patterns of chromosome evolution in birds. We expect that our Avian Evolution Highway chromosome browser will become a widely used database to look for structures of chromosomes and synteny in different birds and reptiles. This information will facilitate search of chromosome intervals and scaffolds that contain orthologous genes in different species and therefore could be used to find signatures of selection in different avian lineages as well as to transfer the genome annotation from well-annotated avian genomes like chicken and zebra finch to other, &quot;poorly&quot; annotated genomes (17-18 genomes). By increasing the number of species and improving quality of assemblies we expect to increase the impact of this resource.\nAlso, Avian Evolution Highway is an excellent educational resource that could be used to teach students about the patterns and principles of chromosome evolution in birds and other reptiles in a visually appealing interactive way.
