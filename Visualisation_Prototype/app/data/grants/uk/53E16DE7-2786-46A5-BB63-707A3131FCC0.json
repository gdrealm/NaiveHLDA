{"id":"53E16DE7-2786-46A5-BB63-707A3131FCC0","title":"Susceptibility of catchments to INTense RAinfall and flooding (SINATRA)","abstractText":"Project SINATRA responds to the NERC call for research on flooding from intense rainfall (FFIR) with a programme of focused research designed to advance general scientific understanding of the processes determining the probability, incidence, and impacts of FFIR.\n\nSuch extreme rainfall events may only last for a few hours at most, but can generate terrifying and destructive floods. Their impact can be affected by a wide range factors (or processes) such as the location and intensity of the rainfall, the shape and steepness of the catchment it falls on, how much sediment is moved by the water and the vulnerability of the communities in the flood's path. Furthermore, FFIR are by their nature rapid, making it very difficult for researchers to 'capture' measurements during events. The complexity, speed and lack of field measurements on FFIR make it difficult to create computer models to predict flooding and often we are uncertain as to their accuracy. \n\nTo address these issues, NERC launched the FFIR research programme. It aims to reduce the risks from surface water and flash floods by improving our identification and prediction of the meteorological (weather), hydrological (flooding) and hydro-morphological (sediment and debris moved by floods) processes that lead to FFIR. A major requirement of the programme is identifying how particular catchments may be vulnerable to FFIR, due to factors such as catchment area, shape, geology and soil type as well as land-use. Additionally, the catchments most susceptible to FFIR are often small and ungauged.\n\nProject SINATRA will address these issues in three stages: Firstly increasing our understanding of what factors cause FFIR and gathering new, high resolution measurements of FFIR; Secondly using this new understanding and data to improve models of FFIR so we can predict where they may happen - nationwide and; Third to use these new findings and predictions to provide the Environment Agency and over professionals with information and software they can use to manage FFIR, reducing their damage and impact to communities. \nIn more detail, we will:\n1. Enhance scientific understanding of the processes controlling FFIR, by-\n(a) assembling an archive of past FFIR events in Britain and their impacts, as a prerequisite for improving our ability to predict future occurrences of FFIR.\n(b) making real time observations of flooding during flood events as well as post-event surveys and historical event reconstruction, using fieldwork and crowd-sourcing methods.\n(c) characterising the physical drivers for UK summer flooding events by identifying the large-scale atmospheric conditions associated with FFIR events, and linking them to catchment type.\n2. Develop improved computer modelling capability to predict FFIR processes, by-\n(a) employing an integrated catchment/urban scale modelling approach to FFIR at high spatial and temporal scales, modelling rapid catchment response to flash floods and their impacts in urban areas.\n(b) scaling up to larger catchments by improving the representation of fast riverine and surface water flooding and hydromorphic change (including debris flow) in regional scale models of FFIR.\n(c) improving the representation of FFIR in the JULES land surface model by integrating river routing and fast runoff processes, and performing assimilation of soil moisture and river discharge into the model run.\n3. Translate these improvements in science into practical tools to inform the public more effectively, by-\n(a) developing tools to enable prediction of future FFIR impacts to support the Flood Forecasting Centre in issuing new 'impacts-based' warnings about their occurrence.\n(b) developing a FFIR analysis tool to assess risks associated with rare events in complex situations involving incomplete knowledge, analogous to those developed for safety assessment in radioactive waste management.\n\nIn so doing SINATRA will achieve NERC's science goals for the FFIR programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K008781/1","grantId":"NE/K008781/1","fundValue":"846014","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2019-05-01","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  It is the early stages of the project and so limited results have been generated by the project to date.

Therefore we are constructing records of FFIR events and historical flash flood chronologies. To date we have prepared historical flash flood chronologies for NE England, NW England, and SW England. Furthermore, an approach is being developed to combine rain gauge data and radar data to better quantify sub-daily rainfall data nationally.\n\nEquipment has been installed to generate new sources of data, including fixed time-lapse cameras to provide non-invasive, remote monitoring during FFIR events. Real-time monitoring and geomorphological assessments of floodplain response to a previous FFIR event was undertaken. The event posed a considerable risk to the infrastructure of the downstream community (Hepple, Northumberland) and work conducted by the SINATRA team is providing evidence for consultation between the landowner and regulatory authorities. New data has also been gathered from a set of radar images of the Severn/Avon catchment between 2006-8. These have been processed to extract surface soil moisture information. This will feed into model developments that lead to a more realistic representation of surface water, river flow and soil moisture.\n\nWork has begun to quantify and characterise the physical drivers for summer flooding events in the UK through identification of atmospheric conditions preceding FFIR impacts. Initial results suggest that Atmospheric Rivers (large-scale transfers of moisture in the atmosphere) have a very weak link with summer flash floods. Analysis of intense hourly summer rainfall has however indicated a mechanism for increased intensities in a warming atmosphere and therefore greater potential for flash floods in the future.\n\nSINATRA is utilising a set of complementary cutting-edge modelling tools to better capture catchment FFIR processes and combine this with urban drainage models to simulate FFIR impacts in urban areas. High-performance computing has been further extended and initial flood model developments have been undertaken including making flood simulations more efficient.\n\nSINATRA is also advancing understanding of the underlying drivers of FFIR impacts, in terms of vulnerability and exposure, and translating that knowledge into practical tools. It is developing a knowledge system for FFIR, which will bring together data and knowledge about these events. Data sets on the incidence, location and timing of past FFIR events produced by the project have been already been incorporated into the FFIR database and provide the capability to share data on FFIR events. Although it is the early stages of project, SINATRA is now working very closely with the Met Office's Environmental Prediction team and the Natural Hazards Partnership, to ensure synergy with the science produced to maximise impact. The project team have also been routinely interacting with the Environment Agency, the Flood Forecasting Centre, the Scottish Flood Forecasting Service, the Health and Safety Lab and industry partners JBA and CH2M HILL. SINATRA is also strengthening links with DEFRA with a postdoc secondment in place. Several team members have also been appointed to the Joint DEFRA/EA FCERM Theme Advisory Groups. DEFRA and short term Met Office secondments will continue along with other partner and end user regular meetings.\n\nThe SINATRA team acted as flood experts during the recent winter flooding, providing advice to government and working with the Natural Hazards Partnership. The team also provided significant scientific opinions in the media in response to the flooding, including many media interviews and post-flood discussion on social media. It is envisaged that opportunities for such interaction will continue to be seized. Engagement on flood incidents in the North-East has been established with the Environment Agency, Northumberland County Council, Newcastle City Council, and Northumberland Communities Flood Partnership (NCFP).\n\nSINATRA will also now be supported by the NERC Impact Accelerator led by Dr Jo Clark at the University of Reading.
