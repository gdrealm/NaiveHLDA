What choices did they have and what disadvantages did they face? What strategies did women use to engage with courts and court officials? How did these vary according to national boundaries, language, ethnic identity, confessional identity and class? And how did they change over time? This project seeks to provide substantive answers to these questions, utilising evidence from cases heard in England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland between 1100 and 1750. \n\nAlthough the history of women's lives in medieval and early modern Britain and Ireland has formed the subject of numerous studies, necessitating some discussion of the legal frameworks (particularly pertaining to marriage and property) within which they lived, the subject of women's engagement with the law, and experience of justice within the multiple courts and jurisdictions in the regions under scrutiny, has been rather less well researched. When studies appear, they are either narrowly-focused on specific topics or archives, and thus of limited value for assessing women's broader experiences, or claim to take a broader view but in fact base their conclusions on extrapolations from those same, limited case studies. In addition, English cases have dominated the field: if Irish, Welsh or Scottish materials have been explored at all, it has been on rigidly national lines, with little or no comparison or consideration of points of contact and similarity between women's strategies in different judicial environments.\n\nThe research team aims to produce a study that can act both as a guide to methodology - critiquing previous work, highlighting gaps in archival resources and studies, and establishing frameworks for applying gender to legal history - and as a conceptual, practical demonstration of the power of comparative history to illustrate underlying structural and ideological constraints on women's agency before the law. That is not to say that we shall be treating women in isolation: we are not 'unmooring' them from the gendered, familial and local contexts within which they lived their daily lives. How they identified themselves, and how they were recorded in court proceedings, reveals for example how using a father's name took on a particular importance over a woman's marital identification in many of the contexts under scrutiny.\n\nThe resources for this study will include both records from secular and church courts, and will encompass civil and criminal cases. Samples will range from the Anglo-Norman state (where Jewish women will be considered alongside Christians), the English colony in Ireland, local courts in Wales and the Welsh use of central courts, and women in the legal landscape of Scotland before and after Union. The period studied reflects a time of significant political change and social upheaval in British and Irish history, when the state's physical boundaries, administrative structures and religious identity were all shifting and evolving. The law in some sense provided some continuity through this period, but the complexity of jurisdictions, overlapping, competing, local and central, religious and secular, meant that similar courts in different regions might differ a great deal (for example, there is a marked lack of regulation of sexuality in Irish church courts compared with those in Scotland and England). \n\nWe shall consider: the choice of court/s to which a case could be taken; whether male representation was required or requested; what languages were used by the courts and by the plaintiffs and defendants, and how these were recorded; whether women had to undertake lengthy journeys to attend; avenues of appeal; forms of petition; strategies (including absence) employed. True comparison can only be achieved by starting from the court user's perspective, seeking to understand her experience of the law, and applying a common set of questions to all of the samples.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L013568/1","grantId":"AH/L013568/1","fundValue":"702272","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Deborah  Youngs","coPersons":["Garthine  Walker","Alexandra  Shepard"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
