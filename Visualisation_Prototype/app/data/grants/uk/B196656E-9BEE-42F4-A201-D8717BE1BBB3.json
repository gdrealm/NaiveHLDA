The findings of the research were utilised by the group to secure &pound;3,500 from Belfast City Council to develop their arts programmes. This led to the production of a short performance about the local area. This production, entitled 'Days in the Bay' explored the importance of the local streetscape for community identity and directly addressed the impact of sectarianism and redevelopment. At each of the 3 performances the import and impact of the research journey was discussed with a broad range of community residents, community activists, academics and mental health practitioners. The impact of those conversations has been to stimulate research ideas that would use the project as a base for inter-disciplinary research projects. Three audience members have contacted us to discuss the use of the street-map methodology used in the performance project for wider community development programmes. One of the Community leaders in Duncairn also wants to develop their work with younger people in the area.\nThe funded project has fed into a separate but related cross-community photography project based at the 174 Centre in North Belfast, led by Kelly Morris, who has acknowledged the symbiotic relationship between the two. Our partners at the Lighthouse have also expanded their interest in drama-based interventions in their own work and have included the Men's Group work in lobbying activities with MLAs at Stormont. \nThe research project led to a further community development linkage led by David Grant who accompanied the group to a community development project in Dublin in July which also uses photography in their work. This proved to be a rich experience in which the impact of undertaking drama to present and discuss complex socio-economic and well-being issues was further disseminated. David Grant has also arranged for seven theatre visits for the group including community-based and professional theatre. \nProfessor Shirlow via funding from the British Embassy in Moldova undertook in April 2014 a 4 day tour of presentations at Moldovan universities. The applied drama and metal health project findings formed a significant part of his presentation entitled 'Northern Ireland: From the Intractable to the Negotiable?' He has also provided insights on the link between the project and its importance for civic repair in Northern Ireland when presenting at events such as Crows on the Wire (October 2014) and in a briefing to the US Consulate in Northern Ireland.

The main output was a performance addressing the importance of peer support for men with mental health issues. A relationship emerged between the image theatre techniques used in workshops and a paralleled photography project. The visibility of the project through live performances and related media coverage led to connections being made with intra and inter-community groups, youth, academics, practitioners and politicians. \n\nThe impact of the drama project was closely linked to a range of inter-related resources and activities such as training programmes and lobbying activities run by the Lighthouse Centre, which created a rich and fertile environment for effective exploitation of the drama-based work. The specific impacts of the drama programme are to be understood in the wider context of direct and indirect personal and community development/awareness.\n\nDIRECT\n\n• The opportunity collaboratively to explore issues and ideas around mental health (&quot;Nobody in this district talked about suicide at any time. The play brought it into the open, let people sort of face it.&quot;)\n\n• Enhanced social interaction and agency within and beyond the participants\n\n• Enhanced confidence and ability to share and express ideas (&quot;I've more confidence and a bit more willingness to try anything&quot;; &quot;Feeling better about yourself and doing more things&quot;.)\n\n• Recognition of the success of the project which gave the group a sense of authority to stand up to other influential organisations within the community (e.g. paramilitaries) &quot;They recognise that we are able to stand up to them, face them, so they do. But ex-members of paramilitary groups are saying well done, we should have been doing this years ago.&quot;\n\n• Participation in the play had led to a much wider engagement in cultural, educational and social activities. (&quot;Most of us have done our catering courses, food and hygiene.&quot;)\n\nINDIRECT\n\n• Participants reported that the play stimulated conversations and approaches from community members in relation to mental health issues. The project had a positive distributive effect in that it signalled the participants as a resource in which to disclose, confide and seek help. The men understood that they were not experts in mental health but guides who directed individuals to mental health service providers. (&quot;We can put them onto people. A wee go between&quot;; &quot;People open up more with people from their own community and they'd see the work we've done doing voluntary work in the community centre and all. They do find it easier to talk to people in their own centres now, than outsiders&quot;; &quot;The more knowledge you have the more you can give out to other people.&quot;)\n\n• One participant attributed enhanced employment prospects due to his involvement in the play\n\n• Participants spoke of healthier form of social interaction and engagement (&quot;Before I joined that men's group I rarely left the house. Now we're seeing plays and looking for other things&quot;).\n\n• Attendance at events at Queen's University had encouraged group members to seek out other accessible events such as free live broadcasts at the BBC. On an individual level, participants have begun to engage more actively with their immediate and wider communities, and as a group are now seen as a resource for both their own neighbourhood and for the Lighthouse. They regularly receive requests to perform their work in a variety of community contexts. Plans are being developed for a theatre production that would celebrate, but also critique the history of their area (Tiger's Bay) which has both a proud and often problematic reputation. The value of drama as a vehicle for exploring mental health issues is now understood better by the Lighthouse organisation, and the potential for dialogue between different arts interventions (e.g. photography) has added an exciting additional dimension to work. It is anticipated that more members will be attracted to the men's group and that the proposed theatre production will allow further links to be made with groups such as the Jennymount Youth Group and musical groups already based in Duncairn Arts Centre. This should serve to broaden the impact of the work in terms of both age and gender. There has also been some discussion of developing the work on a more cross-community basis with visits to venues in Catholic/Nationalist areas. The project team aim to write two academic papers. Paper 1 (Research in Drama and Education) will examine the cumulative impact of the project upon self-esteem, communicative ability, self-understanding and more reflexive attitudes to life stressors is positioned. It will evaluate manner in which theatre techniques depended and extended participants of the characters and themes they encountered. It will also analyse the impact of life-size paper puppet in terms of stimulating additional resource, and the groups experiences of improvisation and impact upon emotional intensity. \n\nA second paper (Journal of Arts and Communities) will evaluate the impact of the drama project as linked to a range of inter-related resources and activities such as training programmes and lobbying activities run by the Lighthouse Centre itself, which created a rich and fertile environment for effective exploitation of the drama-based work. This will relate to the context of agency and identification among the men who participated within the group. The specific impacts of the drama programme interpreted with regard to how drama based approaches stimulate qualitative-influenced and more appreciative understandings of mental health. \n\nIn late 2014/2015 2015 Professor Shirlow via the Institute for the Study of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice will be hosting an academic/practitioners workshop on mental health needs, linked to OFMDFM funding in Northern Ireland. This will include participants from Notre Dame, Queen's University Belfast and University of Ulster. The research findings will form a workshop related to drama, agency and mental health. \n\nProfessor Shirlow via funding from the British Embassy in Moldova will be undertaking in April 2014 a 4 day tour of presentations at Moldovan universities. The applied drama and metal health project findings will form part of his presentation entitled 'Northern Ireland: From the Intractable to the Negotiable?'
