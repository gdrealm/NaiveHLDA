Over this time interval, advances in the scientific understanding of earthquakes have been translated into impressive resilience in regions where the hazard is well understood (eg California, Chile, and Japan). Here, resilience is defined as the ability of a community to resist, accommodate, or adapt to the effects of an earthquake, to maintain critical basic functions, and to recover after the event. \n\nComparable advances have not, however, taken place in most parts of the continental interiors. Instead, many parts of the continental interiors, and particularly the Alpine-Himalayan belt, have seen a major increase in vulnerability to earthquakes in the last few decades, due to a wide range of social, economic, and governance issues. Increasing resilience to continental earthquakes and their related hazards is therfore an urgent scientific and societal priority. This goal requires a holistic view of earthquakes, and collaboration between physical scientists, social scientists, practitioners, and governments on a scale that has not yet been attempted. Our project knits together three groups with extensive and successful track records in (i) the science of earthquakes and related hazards [COMET+, the Dynamic Earth and Geohazards research group in the National Centre of Earth Observation, and the British Geological Survey Hazards Group] (ii) exploring the social science of resilience to emerging hazards and risks [Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience, University of Durham, and associated researchers] and (iii) the use of research to promote evidence-based policy [Overseas Development Institute].\n\nFirst, we shall establish a global partnership between researchers from six UK universities, two UK research centers, and representatives of a wide range of governmental and non-governmental organisations from countries across the Alpine-Himalayan belt. This partnership will be focused on communication and sharing of research needs and knowledge gaps, basic research findings and outputs, and new approaches for building resilience to earthquakes across the region.\n\nThis partnership will carry out coupled physical- and social-science research in three case-study areas (China, central Asia, and the Himalayan front). Our understanding of earthquake occurrence across this large region is currently too poor to provide detailed estimates of likely earthquake probabilities and effects at the sub-national scales needed by communities - let alone to provide forecasts of earthquake occurrence. \n\nOne component of the project involves research into the locations of active faults across the region, the rates at which they are currently deforming, and the ground shaking that they are likely to produce. This basic physical science research, which will also include the effects of secondary hazards such as landsliding, will provide baseline scenarios about the hazards in forms that are meaningful for, and usable by, the communities at risk.\n\nAt the same time, we shall map and identify the societal factors that help or hinder the creation of resilience to those physical hazards. This holistic approach to resilience will include investigation of cultural practices and adaptations, economic considerations, social mechanisms, and the role that governance at all scales plays in determining how resilience communities are to earthquakes.\n\nThe overall framework of this project, provided by the ODI's RAPID methodology, will allow us to draw upon the expertise of the partner organisations, and the research findings outlined above, to generate a set of evidence-based toolkits and policy recommendations that together will define the pathways by which resilience to earthquakes can best be increased, both in the case-study areas and across the entire partnership.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J019895/1","grantId":"NE/J019895/1","fundValue":"607348","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used to inform debates about earthquake hazard in vulnerable cities in Asia. In Iran, where our engagement has already been for more than 20 years, and where there is a strong bond of trust and understanding with local scientists, we were used to help reinforce the Geological Survey of Iran's (GSI) dialogue with the mayor of Tabriz and Governor of Azerbaijan province concerning the risk to Tabriz; a major city of 2M people that was destroyed twice in the 18th century. This dialogue led to adoption by GSI of a number of hard-hitting and uncompromising (and sensible) statements on their web site about the reality of the earthquake hazard in Iran. See:\nhttp://earthquake.conference.gsi.ir/en/contents/Closing-statements/Closing.statements.htm\nIn Kazakhstan, which is far less advanced than Iran in earthquake science, a productive dialogue has started between the scientists in our partnership and the mayor of Almaty, the former capital which was destroyed in 1887, 1889 and 1911, in which the example of progress in Iran was very helpful.

Some of this work has already been published, or is in press, in international journals, and represents the first real modern state-of-the-art earthquake science in Kazakhstan since the break-up of the former Soviet Union. It therefore has had considerable local impact already, and provides an incentive and impetus that we hope will encourage further collaboration and development of local capability in the future.\n(ii) Investigation of evidence for the uplift of the Rhodes coastline, leading to the conclusion that a major tsunami-generating earthquake was responsible about 3000 years ago. Analysis of that uplift has allowed the characterization of the likely earthquake and the better definition of the probable tsunami hazard associated with such events, which are quite rare. In an earlier study we demonstrated that a similar analysis in Crete allowed us to confirm the source of a tsunami that devastated the Nile delta in AD 365.\n(iii) New insights into the relationship between surface folding and 'blind' thrust earthquakes (which fail to rupture to the surface) in the Zagros mountains of Iran. This was made possible through the creative combined use of space-based radar interferometry, land-based seismology and field work, and has consequences for oil exploration in this part of the Middle East.\n(iv) Radar interferometric investigations of post-earthquake ground motions in Iran, leading to better understanding between earthquake motions and the generation of geological structures.\n(v) Discovery of major new earthquake-generating faults within peninsula India (i.e. away from the Himalaya, which is much better known).\n(vi) Various studies that use earthquake investigations to clarify the mechanical properties of plates and continental interiors. All our work that clarifies the nature and distribution of earthquake hazard in Asia has impact when transmitted to policy- and decision-makers. In the end this improved knowledge can be turned into increased resilience (the whole point of the project) through a trusted dialogue between scientists and politicians or the public. There is no doubt that trust is won through the demonstration that we are engaged in high-quality state-of-the-art research with local partners who are also well-connected to the global scientific community. That trust can then be used to encourage scientists, politicians, the construction industry and the public to all take responsibility for actions that can be taken to increase resilience.
