{"id":"C1362C72-4E9D-48B4-903D-B8E2AB28C2B8","title":"Instrumented Railway Current-Collecting Pantograph","abstractText":"City is proposing to develop an early warning system to monitor continuously the condition of the overhead wire of electric trains. This system will resolve one of the major technical challenges facing the rail industry today, improving the cost-effectiveness, safety and reliability of the electric train fleet operation.\nCity will build a prototype that will identify emerging overhead wire defects before they escalate and cause expensive system failure. The train pantograph, embedded with City?s novel sensors, will measure the critical strain and temperature parameters resulting from direct contact between the pantograph?s current collector and overhead wires when running under overhead power lines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J500781/1","grantId":"EP/J500781/1","fundValue":"94628","fundStart":"2012-05-31","fundEnd":"2013-05-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  In on-going research and development with the company concerned as part of the consortium.
