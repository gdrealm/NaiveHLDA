{"id":"C82B6676-CF89-4467-A0C0-8A5FA79F7EDE","title":"eScent: The Future of Fragrance","abstractText":"This is a Follow-on Fund (FOF) project to the previously funded AHRC Knowledge Transfer Fellowship (KTF), Smell the Colour of the Rainbow that explored opportunities resulting from the PI's patented work on the eScent concept in the 'wellbeing' arena.\n\neScent is a patented concept suitable for an item of jewellery or technology embedded clothing with the ability to deliver fragrance on demand and in the right quantities. It contains solvent-free scent and a dispenser activated electronically to deliver specified aliquots of fragrance depending on a sensor or timer if the application is for fashion, wellbeing, healthcare, or environmental in nature (such as insect repellent).\n\nThe project aims to determine the product feasibility of eScent to new audiences and users in the fine fragrance industry. It will address the latest legislation in the fragrance industry and demonstrate the commercial viability of a cartridge microchip that stores up to six fragrances that can be worn in jewellery or clothing.\n\nThe PI will position eScent in the fragrance industry and evaluate the impact it could have on the fashion industry as it shows signs of merging with wearable technology markets. The PI will verify the competitiveness of the eScent concept as a 'disruptive technology' and determine the commercial potential of a cartridge microchip that can be worn in jewellery and 'smart clothing' as a solution to store a palette of fragrance ingredients with 'high odour value', which can be used at 'low dosage' levels to give a powerful fragrance contribution. In addition the PI will seek expertise and the latest guidelines and knowledge on fragrance legislation/regulations to promote the safe and positive use of fragrances amongst consumers and the wider population.\n\nThe non-academic partners include the British Society of Perfumers and PANDORA fine fragrance experts who will ensure knowledge transfer through various activities. The team includes a commercialization and technology transfer expert, fashion designers from France and the UK, a film animator and student involvement. A University startup will be the vehicle to commercialise the research and they own patents that protect the eScent concept in UK, China and pending in the USA. \n\nThe specific targets to be achieved by the end of the award will include a commercial evaluation report supported by an animation film with interviews from perfumers and experts in the fragrance and fashion industries. \n\nThe beneficiaries will include the international fragrance industry, the fashion industry, the general public with an interest in the changing face of modern day perfumery and the sense of smell. \n\nThe project will be disseminated with the help of the network of the British Society of Perfumery and at international fragrance forums and academic symposia. A website will be produced to disseminate a short animation film that introduces eScent as the new 'perfume bottle', along with design work and professional interviews for the market studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L01405X/1","grantId":"AH/L01405X/1","fundValue":"23336","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jenny Ruth Tillotson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
