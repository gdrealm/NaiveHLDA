This proposal is characterise a particular type of immature tissue repair cell, termed mesenchymal progenitor cell (or ?MPC?), and then exploit them to repair damaged hearts and regenerate blood vessels. Not only do MPCs have great therapeutic potential, but they can be expanded and analysed in the laboratory. Although clinical trials of transplanted MPCs into damaged hearts have been encouraging, limited understanding of their underlying biology remains a major obstacle to realising their therapeutic potential. Our timely proposal is to define their ?molecular signatures? and generate a comprehensive (open access) database of MPC marker molecules, determine how they regulate cell fate, and test how MPCs repair damaged blood vessels and injured hearts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902170","grantId":"G0902170","fundValue":"741791","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Cay  Kielty","coPersons":["Ann  Canfield","Ludwig  Neyses","Catherine Louise Merry","Enrique  Amaya","Anthony David  Whetton"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
