While histories of missionary activity are matters of ongoing importance in these now strongly Christian parts of the world, attitudes to Christianity in Britain, and its history of missionary activity are increasingly ambivalent. However, a great deal of material heritage associated with early missionary encounters remains in Britain, where it is widely neglected. This material includes:\n\n* items collected as evidence of pre-Christian religious practices, many of which are now regarded as rare and major works of art\n* gifts received by missionaries from local people\n* the personal possessions and portraits of famous missionaries\n* relics of the ships used by missionaries to reach their destinations \n* material, such as collecting boxes, that were used to appeal to supporters in Britain\n\nThis project aims to create a conversation between academics, museum curators and representatives of missionary societies, as well as heritage organizations in Africa and the Pacific to establish who cares about this heritage in the present, and who should care for it in the future.\n\nThree workshops will be held during 2012 at the National Museum of Scotland, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, and the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in Norwich. The project is a partnership between researchers at these three organizations, as well as the Museum Ethnographers Group, a charity that exists to 'Make connections through world collections'. As a recognized 'Subject-Specialist Network' in the museum's sector, the Museum Ethnographers Group will use its connections to influence museum practice in relation to the cataloging, conservation and exhibition of collections of missionary material.\n\nEach of the workshops will include a presentation by an international academic researcher, as well as by knowledgeable museum curators and missionary organisations about their experiences of working with missionary material. These presentations will be the starting points for a series of structured conversations about the future of collections of missionary material in Britain, and the best ways of making them available for study by international researchers, as well as those in Britain and overseas for whom they have a significant value as items of heritage.\n\nThe National Museum of Scotland will be opening an exhibition on the life and legacy of the famous missionary David Livingstone towards the end of this project, organized in collaboration with colleagues from Museums of Malawi in Africa. We expect the opening of this exhibition to be an important moment when the conversations that begin during these workshops can receive a more public airing in the media.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J008494/1","grantId":"AH/J008494/1","fundValue":"33133","fundStart":"2012-10-23","fundEnd":"2013-07-22","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The main idea was to form a network of various stakeholders: academics, museum curators, representatives of heritage and missionary societies and African and Pacific stakeholders. Through the relatively open structure of the workshops, we encouraged interactions between these different parties. This means that research findings have been and will be used in a variety of ways. One publication was written for a clear academic audience, one for a museum curators audience and one for the general public. Discussions during the workshop led to an exhibition in Malawi, will lead to a new display in the Fiji Museum and led to an international conference on missionary heritage. Currently discussions are underway about a larger research project. These are actual and tangible projects. However, curators of smaller museums in the UK who look after missionary collections have reported that they now think differently about these collections and acknowledge the complexity of their nature. Indirectly, this will influence the way curators deal with these collections in the future.

During three workshops we worked with a core group of participants and asked the question 'Who cares?' for and about this material in the present, and who is likely to care most about it in the future. The variety of perspectives that came up during the keynote presentations and discussions were eye-opening. What became clear from all the discussions over the three workshops is that a great many people do care. Christians in Africa and the Pacific may care because material was associated with significant events in their history. Indigenous activists may care because some missionary collected material offers the best opportunity for reconstructing pre-Christian practices. Agnostic British people may care because they feel that this material represents a history of which they are faintly embarrassed. The issue seems not to be whether anyone cares, but whether the ways in which people care makes it difficult for them to find a way of talking to and understanding each other. We concluded that the way forward was to highlight the potential of missionary heritage to become a focus for reflections on shared histories by people from different parts of the world, with the attendant ambiguities and complexities that this involves. This project was timely because museums across the UK as well as elsewhere in Europe are reconsidering the significance of 'ethnographic' collections as 'world cultures'. The latter rubric may diminish the historical significance of the materials in question. Tangible outcomes of the project have been: three publications, an exhibition in Malawi, a future new display in Fiji, but, most of all, a network of specialists have been formed who have already organised an international conference and look forward to continuing collaboration. A very successful network of specialists was formed. Not only did the network meet during the workshops and everyone contributed to a publication, smaller collaborations have been formed between network participants. One important side project has been an exhibition in Malawi, another has been the planning of a new missionary display in the Fiji museum in Fiji. Many of the network participants participated in a larger scale conference held in Cambridge in September 2014, which was organised by the core team that organised the workshops for the networking grant. There, network participants were able to widen their network and some spin-off projects have been started. In South Africa, people are currently preparing a publication. The P-I, together with people who participated in the network workshops, is currently putting together a proposal for a larger project. These are actual and tangible projects. However, participants working in museums have reported that they now think differently about missionary collections. This might indirectly influence the way curators deal with these collections in the future.
