{"id":"15B39403-25BE-4D68-AE6E-A4F58F7CE728","title":"Mental Disorders from Childhood to Adulthood: The Dunedin Study","abstractText":"At present, very little information about a patient s developmental history is incorporated into making a psychiatric diagnosis. As a result, patients having different etiology and different prognosis are often mixed as apples and oranges with the same diagnosis. This unknown heterogeneity interferes when doctors make treatment choices and when scientists identify groups to take part in neuroscience and genetics research. Our research aims to identify developmental subtypes within mental disorders, based on age of onset (childhood, adolescence, adulthood) and subsequent course (persistent, recurrent, or time-limited). We study a 1000 men and women, born in 1972, who represent the general population. Their mental health has been measured at ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, and 32, when 96% of the original cohort took part. Mental health will be measured again at age 38. Identifying developmental subtypes to improve precision of psychiatric diagnoses should improve the quality of both treatment and research, and also reduce the costs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601483","grantId":"G0601483","fundValue":"1241040","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Terrie  Moffitt","coPersons":["Avshalom  Caspi"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
