On one hand, we know that farmers need abundant – but not excessive – rainfall, sunlight, and soil nutrients. As climate change may disturb these conditions, are we headed for trouble? After all, history is littered with examples of civilizations that collapsed because food supplies ran low. On the other hand, the environment has always changed and&nbsp;most of the time we adapt. That humans have set up camp in almost every type of ecosystem on the planet shows how resilient a species we are. </p> \n<p>This research will take on the question, “will we adapt to climate change?” and focus specifically on what climate change might do to the food we rely on. This is a critical issues as food represents the front line of our relationship with nature. Despite massive technological advances, food production has always been, and in all likelihood always will be, tied to the sun, the rain, and the soil. In a day and age when the availability of sun and rain seems to be changing quickly, understanding the nature of food production (and how it moves from farm to plate) may be vital to our survival.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-229-27-0002","grantId":"RES-229-27-0002","fundValue":"252036","fundStart":"2007-09-08","fundEnd":"2010-09-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Evan David Fraser","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
