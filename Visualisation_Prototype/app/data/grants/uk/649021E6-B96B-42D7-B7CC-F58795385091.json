In one in every twenty older people healing becomes so delayed that it fails, leading to chronic wounds (eg. diabetic foot ulcers or venous leg ulcers). These chronic wounds severely decrease quality of life and can even lead to death. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments for chronic wounds and their management poses a major financial problem for the world's healthcare economy, particularly as the global elderly population is rapidly expanding. This lack of treatments is mainly because there is little understanding of the gene changes in different wound cells that result in poor healing. Our recent studies have indentified a new gene that may be particularly important for healing, arginase (Arg1). Arginase has critical roles in repair of other tissues and has been linked to chronic diseases, such as asthma or psoriasis. Our new data shows that a number of cell types important for skin repair contain the arginase enzyme, and that it is strongly down-regulated in delayed healing. We believe that arginase in these other cells plays crucial, as yet unidentified, roles in wound repair. In this study we will test this hypothesis using a range of techniques in both mouse wounds and wound tissue from human volunteers.\n\nWe will use specially bred mice that lack arginase in each of these important wound repair cell types (cell-specific knockout). The effect on overall healing and a range of healing parameters will reveal the role of arginase in each cell type. We will also culture the cells and directly test the effect of arginase on cell function. In parallel we will measure arginase levels and activity in human tissue. Of particular note we will be able to compare arginase level over time in human chronic wounds that either do or do not heal. The final part of the project will test the possibility of using drugs that alter arginase activation to promote healing. We will do this in mouse models of human delayed healing and directly in human skin. Upon completion of this study we will be in a strong position to move into studies on human patients with chronic wounds. In addition, given the importance of arginase in other chronic diseases, our findings will potentially have wide reaching implications for the understanding and treatment of other chronic degenerative diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L010267/1","grantId":"MR/L010267/1","fundValue":"411266","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2017-04-17","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew James Hardman","coPersons":["Sheena Margaret Cruickshank"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
