{"id":"A5AE6C20-38DF-46A3-94F9-78D342842EED","title":"New Philanthropy, education policy and the State","abstractText":"The focus of this research is on the role of ‘new’ philanthropy, and corporate philanthropy in particular, in the processes of education policy and in relation to new modes of political governance. It addresses important new developments in public policy related to the increased emphasis being given to the role within policy of ‘giving’ and philanthropy and the participation of the ‘third sector’ in policy and service delivery. In various ways – Academies, Specialist schools, Teach First, Reading Recovery etc. – philanthropy is increasingly incorporated into education policy. Using network and document analysis and interviews with key philanthropists and philanthropic organisations the research aims to map and explore the significance of philanthropy ‘on’ and ‘in’ current education policymaking; through the deployment of new language and discourses and participation in policy communities. The motives, concerns and perspectives of the ‘new’ philanthropists will also be examined. The study builds upon previous research by the applicant on policy elites.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2682","grantId":"RES-000-22-2682","fundValue":"73191","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Ball","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
