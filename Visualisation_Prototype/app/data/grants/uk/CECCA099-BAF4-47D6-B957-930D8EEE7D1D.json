In three studies we will examine how these images effect men’s perception of ‘real’ women.</p>\n\n<p>In Study 1 we will experimentally manipulating men's exposure to sexualised images and examine the impact on interactions with a real woman. Men will be exposed to sexualised or non-sexualised images and then interact with a real woman. We predict that men exposed to sexualised images will objectify the real woman.</p>\n\n<p>In Study 2 we will examine whether the belief that these images are harmless is widespread.</p>\n\n<p>In Study 3 we will explore the role of information and perspective-taking in reducing these negative effects. Men will come to the lab and be exposed to sexualised images. Half the men will receive detailed information about the harmful effects; half will not. Then, half the men will engage in a perspective-taking activity; half will not. Men will then interact with a woman and we will measure objectification. This will tell us if information and perspective-taking reduce the effect of sexualised images.</p>\n\n<p>This research is relevant to the government's aim of reducing violence and mistreatment of women and girls. Sexualised media has been identified as a key contributor to such violence (DSCF Report, 2009). </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4431","grantId":"RES-000-22-4431","fundValue":"80489","fundStart":"2011-09-12","fundEnd":"2012-09-11","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  LoughnanUlrich Wolfgang Weger","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
