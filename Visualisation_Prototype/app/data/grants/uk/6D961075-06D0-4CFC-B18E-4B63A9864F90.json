Members of the Group have been working on the commissioning and analysis of data from the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC which has just finished its first full year of data taking from which over a 100 papers have been published. The ATLAS Group will continue the study of the top quark, started at the CDF experiment, at the LHC and the expertise gained will allow us to probe for new physics such as the discovery of the Higgs particle or Supersymmetry. We will also continue our study of proton structure at the highest possible energies. The QMUL Group is also involved in upgrades to the ATLAS detector for the higher luminosity by participating in the ATLAS Tracker Upgrade Level One Calorimeter Trigger upgrade programmes. At the other end of the mass scale the neutrino group is exploiting data from the T2K long baseline neutrino experiment in Japan which will continue the investigations of the recently discovered neutrino oscillations and participating in the rich programme at the SNO+ detector in Canada. In addition the Group is at the forefront of preparations for the SuperB collider project and will look to exploit new opportunities, such Dark Matter searches or Linear Colliders when they become available.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K001248/1","grantId":"ST/K001248/1","fundValue":"3212400","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Francesca  Di Lodovico","coPersons":["Stephen  Lloyd","Adrian John Bevan","Syed Eram Rizvi","Marcella  Bona","Lucio  Cerrito","Alex James Martin","Jeanne  Wilson","Jonathan Michael Hays"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
