Understanding the regulation of this process is important for developing therapeutic approaches because many diseases involve disruptions in the regulation programme. Much has been learned about the mechanisms controlling the production of messenger RNAs from genes. Recently an additional pathway has been found to be important, and this occurs after the messenger RNA has been produced. It involves a separate class of RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small RNAs of only about 22 nucleotides. miRNAs regulate gene expression by binding to homologous sequences in messenger RNAs and inhibiting their translation into protein. Regulation by miRNAs is essential for development because knocking out a critical gene (Dicer) required for miRNA synthesis results in death at an early embryonic stage. miRNAs are also important at later stages in the development of many tissue types. Furthermore, mis-regulation of miRNA expression has been found to be important in diseases such as cancer, and altered regulation may also be involved in ageing. Therefore, the role of miRNAs in the regulation of gene expression is important in the development of an organism and the maintenance of health during its lifetime. My interest has been in the regulation of gene expression during the development of the immune system, particularly in lymphocytes. In past work we examined the importance of miRNAs in the development of T cells, which are a specific class of lymphocytes. We knocked out the Dicer gene only in T cells and found a significant decrease in a class of T cells called regulatory T (Treg) cells. Treg cells are required for turning off the immune response and are important in diseases such as autoimmunity and cancer. Therefore, a large amount of work has been done to understand the mechanisms regulating the developmental choice between conventional T cells and Treg cells. Since miRNAs are critical, understanding how they function could lead to new therapeutic approaches in diseases involving the immune response. Therefore, in this application, I propose to identify the individual miRNAs important for Treg development and function then find and characterize the critical genes they regulate. To identify the important miRNAs in the development and function of Treg cells, we have begun by measuring the levels of miRNAs in Treg cells compared to conventional T cells. From these data we have identified 6 candidate miRNAs that are differentially and also abundantly expressed. We plan to overexpress and block these miRNAs in experiments utilizing both in vitro culture conditions we have developed and also in vivo mouse model systems that test the ability of the manipulated Treg cells to prevent autoimmunity. In these experiments only the manipulation of important miRNAs will affect Treg development and function To identify genes regulated by functional miRNAs, we will begin by using miRNA target prediction programs. The predicted targets will be verified using synthetic reporter genes containing the gene sequence of interest linked to a second gene encoding an easily measurable protein. These reporter genes will be expressed in cells and tested for regulation by a miRNA. Specificity of the regulation will be determined utilizing reporters containing a mutation in the miRNA target site. The relevance of this regulation on the endogenous gene will be tested by altered expression of the specific miRNA. To characterize target gene regulation in Treg development, we will overexpress and knockdown the expression of these genes utilizing the above in vitro and in vivo systems. The importance of signaling pathways in which these gene products function will also be analyzed. The experiments in this proposal will greatly add to our knowledge of how miRNAs function in development and disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H018573/1","grantId":"BB/H018573/1","fundValue":"432360","fundStart":"2011-02-21","fundEnd":"2014-02-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used to prepare two manuscripts that have been submitted for publication.

Because of their essential function in maintaining peripheral tolerance, they play important roles in many immunological disorders. Therefore, a significant interest exists in understanding their development and function in order to develop new therapeutic strategies for diseases involving the immune response.\n\n\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a critical regulator of Treg development and function. These are small double stranded RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides in length that negatively regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional stage. miRNAs are encoded in the genome within pol II transcripts. Their critical feature is a stem loop structure made up of the complementary strands of the miRNA, which is recognized and cleaved by protein complexes containing the RNases Drosha and Dicer to give the mature miRNA. This is incorporated into an effector complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Here, one strand is degraded, and the other can then target the complex to messages through imperfect base pairing, which typically occurs in the 3â€™-untranslated region of the gene. This results in inhibition of translation and the subsequent destabilization of the message. The loss of miRNAs at the double positive state of T cell development through a conditional knockout of drosha or dicer significantly inhibits the development of Tregs and ultimately leads to autoimmunity. In addition, the Treg specific deletion of either RNase disrupts Treg suppressor function and results in an acute autoimmune response that is as severe as the loss of Foxp3. Therefore, miRNAs are important both in the steps leading up to commitment to the Treg lineage and also downstream in mediating their suppressor function. Several studies have examined the roles of miRNAs in Treg function and have identified individual miRNAs that regulate key genes required for the function and stability of the lineage. However, this study examined the roles of miRNAs in the developmental steps leading to the Treg lineage. \n\n\n\nWe set about to examine this by first determining functional miRNAs then identifying critical genes they regulate and finally analyzing why this regulation is important for Treg development. We found three miRNAs (miR-15b/16, 24, and 29) that regulated the induction of Tregs from na&iuml;ve mature T cells with miR-15b/16 being the most important in overexpression and blocking experiments. An important target of miR-15b/16 was Rictor, which is a component of the MTOR pathway. Downregulation of the MTOR pathway is known to be important for the induction of iTregs. Therefore, miR-15b/16 appears to be a major factor in regulating this pathway. \n\n\n\nTwo manuscripts have been submitted to the Journal Immunology for publication, and reviewers have asked for a few additional experiments and some revisions. These should be completed by the end of 2014 or early 2015, and the revised manuscripts will be resubmitted. Since this work is basic science, its main use will be by other academics studying the regulation of the immune response. This research is basic science. It's impact will be primarily felt by researchers studying how the balance is maintained between the development of conventional T cells that react against pathogens and the development of regulatory T cells that prevent activation of conventional T cells against host. These studies will be important to develop novel therapies for diseases involving the immune response such as autoimmunity and cancer. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
