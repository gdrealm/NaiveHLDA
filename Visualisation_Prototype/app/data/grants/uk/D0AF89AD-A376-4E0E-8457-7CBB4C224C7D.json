Its biological role is therefore as an acid pump, a function which is fundamental to a large variety of processes such as maintaining the correct pH in the kidney, bone metabolism and recycling and transport of proteins within the cell. Despite the fundamental importance of the V-ATPase to biological systems, there remain many outstanding questions about its structure, particularly about the organisation of its many protein components, its operating mechanism and the control of that mechanism. The V-ATPase is essentially made up of two molecular-scale motors linked together- a three-step ATP-driven motor coupled to a second, membrane-bound motor which acts as the proton pump. Energy from ATP is transmitted to the proton pump part as rotational movement- ATP turnover causes rotation of a central 'shaft' protein in the V-ATPase which in turn is attached to a ring of small proteins within the membrane-embedded proton pump part. Rotation of the central shaft therefore also causes rotation of this ring, and its movement past a second fixed protein structure within the membrane is thought to be the key step in proton pumping. The whole process is fast, smooth and highly efficient, with virtually no losses from the energy conversion processes. The ring structure of the proton pump motor may contain as many as 10 or as few as 6 proton carrier units. This mismatch between the two motor parts presents a puzzle: how does the V-ATPase link the consumption of a fixed number of ATPs per cycle (3) to the transport of an apparently variable number of protons per cycle, whilst using the same basic structure and mechanism? A current theory suggests that this would be possible if the three ATP-requiring steps in one part of the ATPase are not synchronised with specific proton pumping steps in the membrane-embedded part, but instead the energy released at each ATP consuming step is 'buffered' by storage in an elastic spring or flexible rod structure. The energy stored in these structures would then drive the proton pump. Several of the protein components of the V-ATPase could be candidates for this structure, but direct observation of flexing or stretching has not been made, and the theory remains unproven. The aim of this project is to use state-of-the-art techniques in electron microscopy to capture images of individual molecules of the V-ATPase, and then to use computational methods to combine these images and produce the first complete, accurate and detailed 3-dimensional representation of this large and complex protein. By attaching antibody molecules that recognise specific polypeptide components of the V-ATPase we will be able to work out the position of each of these components, telling us more about their role within the whole protein complex. Using this approach we will be able to see the individual structures linking the two motor units. Developing this further, we can use inhibitor compounds and rapid freezing to lock the V-ATPase in a particular stage in its active cycle and look for differences in its structure that might suggest stretching or flexing of some component parts. This will allow us to test the validity of current theories about the V-ATPase mechanism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D016142/1","grantId":"BB/D016142/1","fundValue":"355584","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Andrew Harrison","coPersons":["John  Trinick"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" We produced the first complete 3-dimensional structural model of the V-ATPase, an essential membrane protein complex found in all eukaryotic cells. This provided important insights into how this complex protein operates and how it is controlled by the cell. We were able to show the rearrangements in structure that occur as the ATP-consuming 'motor' of this complex is switched off in response to a drop in cellular energy levels. The insight into the structure of the V-ATPase our work has provided underpins new approaches to blocking its activity.
