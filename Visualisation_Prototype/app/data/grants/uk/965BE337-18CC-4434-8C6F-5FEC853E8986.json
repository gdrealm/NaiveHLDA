The research focuses on the development of structural, load-bearing patterned design materials with a view to develop future sustainable solutions. It uses cellulose-based yarns and impregnates using recognised epoxies and new plant-derived oil-based resin systems to create new textile composite materials. The research is truly co-dependent in nature. Using 3D woven fabric as the lynchpin, the research combines aesthetic considerations within design with technical engineering approaches to create demonstrator samples. It specifies the necessary resources and methods required to design, weave and process the new composite materials. It intends to redirect the exclusivity of woven composite fabrics from niche market, stringent aerospace applications into less demanding yet accessible every-day design applications for public use. \\n\\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) Weave Design 1: To design, produce &amp; demonstrate that a range of 3D and multiple layer reinforced woven preforms can combine technical load-bearing properties with aesthetic design characteristics and be produced using both Dobby and Jacquard Weaving technologies, taking into account the constraints and parameters recommended by composite assigners\\n\\n2) Weave Design 2: To create attractive, dynamic composite preforms by integrating a range of aesthetic patterns, geometries and figurative imagery to the fabric surface through Dobby and Jacquard weaving, or applying digital print to the surface \\n\\n3) Resin Processing: To mould and impregnate fabrics using resin transfer moulding (RTM) and infusion techniques into modular composite parts. To optimise resin impregnation processes for 3D natural fibre woven fabrics with thermosetting epoxy and plant-derived liquid bio-resin. Also to draw comparisons between resin types in terms of compatibility with the fabric article and processing methods chosen.\\n\\n4) Material Testing: To establish initial mechanical properties for load-bearing natural fibre composites under laboratory test conditions \\n\\n5) Project: To liaise with project contributors to meet milestone objectives and produce stated deliverables and publications on conclusion of project\\n\\n6) Profile: To raise overall cross-discipline profile of textile composites for design by providing key demonstrator samples that reflect the main capabilities of eco-composites, and to filter these through appropriate networks for further debate.\\n\\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS\\nApplications: \\nInterior, moulded textile composite parts for use with tubular steel/aluminium frameworks for public seating, wall partitions, panels and fascias. Composite parts will available in variety of dimensions, with flat and basic curvature configurations. Weight range: 1200-2800 g/m2. Shared seating/ bench-styles are envisaged. Permanent fixing achieved through slot and slide apertures, or mechanical bracket/bolt system to steel frame. Steel/metal frames and edgings will enable quality finish at edges.\\n\\nAdded Benefits:\\n1) Performance advantages: By producing load-bearing materials that can compete in strength, reinforcement and appearance, proving structural superiority and versatility in comparison to the vast range of cosmetic laminates \\n2) Improved Design Appearance: From colourless, bland materials to contemporary, dynamic, patterned composite surfaces with built-in strength\\n3) Eco-Design: the need for far-reaching, combined involvement of agriculture, design and plastics engineering to produce an environmentally conscious, safe disposal material for the design community. \\n4) Corporate Branding: Woven and printed patterning enables brand logos and corporate styling to be integrated into the core design of the material at the pre-processing stage. (E.g. Gucci integrated into designer walls, or maps could be printed on seating to provide both chair and signpost).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E007953/1","grantId":"AH/E007953/1","fundValue":"391429","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie  Soden","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
