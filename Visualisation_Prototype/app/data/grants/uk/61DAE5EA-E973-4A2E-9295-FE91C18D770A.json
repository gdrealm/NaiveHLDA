{"id":"61DAE5EA-E973-4A2E-9295-FE91C18D770A","title":"Genetic control of TCR diversity within the natural regulatory T cell lineage","abstractText":"T cells are an essential component of the immune system crucial for fighting infection and to maintain a healthy organism. Their function is linked to the T cell receptor (TCR), a molecule expressed at the cell surface and through which T cells recognise pathogens. Although each T cell usually expresses only one type of TCR, the T cell population as a whole comprises a wide repertoire facilitating the detection of many different pathogens. T cells recognise fragments of pathogen-derived proteins when they are presented on the surface of infected cells in combination with specialised proteins called Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. It is the interaction between the TCR and these complexes that triggers the response. T cells are generated and their repertoire of TCRs determined in the thymus. Repertoires are selected which eliminate both 'useless' TCRs that do not interact with MHC and autoreactive TCRs that may cause autoimmunity. Thus, most T cells leaving the thymus express TCRs of intermediate affinity. However, some high-affinity TCRs escape the thymic elimination mechanism. To keep these potentially autoreactive T cells in check, the organism has a regulatory T cell subset that has suppressive activity (Treg). Like conventional T cells (Tconv), Tregs also depend on the TCR for their function. Thus Treg efficiency is very much dependent on their TCR repertoire. We have observed that in a mouse model of autoimmunity resembling human type I diabetes, the nTreg TCR repertoire has extremely low diversity. This will lead to a defective regulatory population which is likely to be related to development of disease. As reduced repertoire diversity is not observed in the conventional T cells, the defect appears to be Treg specific. The aim of this project is to identify the defective gene or genes in order to understand the genetic basis of TCR diversity in the Treg population. Several different approaches will be used and although part of the research rests on the study of a diabetes prone mouse strain, this will be used only as a model to unravel the biological mechanism underlying the phenotype. Identification of the genetic factors controlling TCR diversity in T regulatory cells would be an essential link in understanding how this population works and protects from autoimmune disease. This information could be applied to manipulate the TCR repertoire and will be potentially useful for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for autoimmunity, cancer and infectious disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F020732/1","grantId":"BB/F020732/1","fundValue":"340108","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The impact of our findings is evident as the first paper (2009) has been cited 25 times by investigators working in the field.

Ferreira C, Singh Y, Furmanski AL, Wong FS, Garden OA, Dyson J. Non-obese diabetic mice select a low-diversity repertoire of natural regulatory T cells. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 106:8320.\n\n2. Ferreira C, Palmer D, Blake K, Garden OA, Dyson J. Reduced regulatory T cell diversity in NOD mice is linked to early events in the thymus. J. Immunol. 2014 192:4145.\n\nAutoimmunity is caused by the autoreactive T and B lymphocytes whose activity is usually suppressed by multiple regulatory mechanisms. One important mechanism of regulation is mediated by a dedicated T cell population called regulatory T cells (Tregs). Our work focused on the composition and development of this population in a spontaneous mouse model (Non-Obese Diabetic/NOD) of type 1 diabetes (T1D). \n\nIn the first publication, we found the receptor composition of Tregs in the NOD strain is less diverse than control strains although the number of Tregs is similar. This has important consequences for the ability of the Treg population to suppress autoreactive lymphocytes and is likely to contribute to development of T1D. Detailed analysis of the receptors suggested the NOD Treg repertoire is under more stringent selection pressure.\n\nThe second publication extended the work to characterise the early development of the NOD Treg compartment which occurs in the thymus. We showed that development was partially blocked but that this was compensated by increased Treg proliferation accounting for recovery of cellularity accompanied by loss of TCR diversity. The NOD defect was also associated with attenuated ERK-MAPK signalling which may preferentially disadvantage nTreg selection. Our work increases understanding of Treg development in health and disease. Immunotherapies which manipulate Treg activity is an attractive approach to reverse autoimmune conditions and boost tumour immunity but requires identification of drug targets. Understanding of the biology of Treg development and function will identify potential targets. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
