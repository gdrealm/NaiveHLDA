{"id":"A35D6FA4-FC7F-472B-9106-9C4345C2C14E","title":"Baudri de Bourgueil","abstractText":"The planned project is closely associated with a doctoral thesis, to be supervised by the principal applicant and co-applicant, and completed by the proposed Research Assistant (Frau Jennifer Gabel). The thesis will consist essentially of a critical edition together with a comprehensive analysis of the lexis of the edited work. \nThe text itself is written In Anglo-Noman. i.e. the form of French used in medieval England. The text is a rhymed chronicle, in alexandrines, about the First book, written at the beginning of the thirteenth century. It is linguistically particularly interesting and promises to deliver a rich lexicological harvest. \nThe results of the lexical analysis of this text will be incorporated directly, as part of the research project, in the two dictionaries directed by the applicants, namely the DEAF and the AND. \nAt the outset of the funded research period, an initial transcription of the text due to be edited will have been produced, thereby ensuring that the project will be well focused and able to proceed without any loss of time.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H500103/1","grantId":"AH/H500103/1","fundValue":"66353","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David Andrew Trotter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
