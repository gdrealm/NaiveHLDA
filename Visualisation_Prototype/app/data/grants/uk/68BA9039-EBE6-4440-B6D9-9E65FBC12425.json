Methacrylic acid is the most widely used starting material to produce methylmethacrylate (MMA) for the manufacture of Perspex (also known as Lucite). MMA is a primary building block for the methacrylates industry and supports an extensive supply chain globally. All of this material is currently produced from petrochemical feedstocks. As a major player in the production of MMA (24% of total global production) one of the participating companies in this project, Lucite, is committed to developing a route based on renewable feedstocks. This project aims to engineer an industrial microbe to produce commercially viable amounts of a methacrylate precursor. The diversion of a large proportion of a microbe's resources to the generation of a product of no benefit to itself generally involves extensive realignment of its metabolic network. Scientists at the University of Cambridge will construct a computer model of the microbe's metabolism and use this in simulations to guide the engineering of the microbe by the third partner in this grouping, Ingenza. Together the three partners will optimise and scale-up the process. \n\nBoth the general methodologies followed and specific results obtained will be of interest to biotechnologists, since they will be applicable to develop routes to many other bulk and speciality chemicals using renewable feedstocks. Success in a bulk chemical-based project of this type will help to promote the UK's aim to be at the leading edge of a Bio-based economy. Success in this project will also give impetus, where needed, to other chemical producers to engage in industrial biotechnology and the development of Bio-based processes. Furthermore, there will be extensive benefits throughout the supply chain associated with Lucite's activities, thus providing more general benefits across the UK economy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L004437/1","grantId":"BB/L004437/1","fundValue":"194216","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen George Oliver","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
