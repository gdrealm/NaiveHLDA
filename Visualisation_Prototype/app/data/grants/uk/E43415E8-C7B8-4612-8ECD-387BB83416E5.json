These include the development of new Institutes in our Faculty of Science and Engineering, supporting gender initiatives for our STEM areas, and enhancing our strategic partnership with the University of Warwick. Queen Mary's Institute for Bioengineering will provide the most appropriate environment for multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research. It will accelerate progress, catalyse new research strategies and enhance research training by coordinating existing research activities in a number of areas.\n\nSupport the development of a new Materials Research Institute (MRI) will bring together a range of activities within several Schools (Materials Science, Physics, Chemistry, Dentistry) located on the Mile End campus to create a coherent interdisciplinary activity that will have a critical mass. Increasingly materials-based research has potential to feed into many areas that have been identified by governments worldwide as &quot;grand challenges&quot;. These include energy, digital economy, security, healthcare and environment. In many of these areas there are significant challenges concerning the physics and chemistry of materials. For example, in energy some of the key questions concern security of energy supply, reduction in the use of carbon-based fuels for large-scale energy supply, the need to develop mobile energy sources (batteries, hydrogen fuel storage) to reduce the reliance on internal combustion engines for transport, materials for next-generation nuclear energy, and materials to deal with the legacy of nuclear waste.\n\nCentre for Discrete Mathematics has become a focal point for collaborative working with the University of Warwick and has led to the appointment of four postdoctoral research fellows who will work between the two institutions to develop research. The collaboration is built on two existing centres of excellence at each site. Electronics,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
