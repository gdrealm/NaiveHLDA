Invitation to museums and archives representatives to the seminars were intended to build relationships that would enable future collaboration and wider audiences for academic research on this topic. The seminar series was completed four years ago and six Phds have been awarded, extending capacity amongst young researchers, not all of whom will work in academia. The research outputs section demonstrates that publications that were generated by the seminar series are now coming into the public domain. Of particular note in crossing the academic / wider audience are books by Carol Dyhouse and Claire Langhamer which have received wider media attention. Stephanie Spencer has been invited to speak to a range of local history and women's groups in the South East. As research from individual members of the seminar reaches the public domain so we anticipate that the capacity for better understanding of women's lives in the post war period will be recognised and used by the wider public in the next few years. Our immediate audience is likely to be museums and archive services but longer term it is anticipated that understanding post war social change might also be used to inform policy makers or incorporated into the school history curriculum.

The range of material presented demonstrated that the often overlooked 1950s was a time of profound social, political and economic change for women of all ages. Day long events were held in Manchester, Sussex, Winchester and London and each attracted between 25 and 30 national and international participants working in academia, the media, museums and archives at all stages of their career. Papers presented crossed disciplinary boundaries using a wide range of visual, written and oral evidence. Topics of the seminars were: Glamour, The Housewife, the Teenager, and the Women in Love. They were complemented by two sensory workshops; one working with photographs and one on sound and material artefacts. These workshops generated extensive discussion over the use of these sources within traditional history writing and suggested new ways of working. Each seminar included five to eight presentations by established academics and professionals and post-graduate researchers. The final seminar was held at the Women's Library in London and included a presentation by the archivist highlighting a wealth of as yet untapped material as well as introducing the publications and archives used by members of the seminar. Over the course of the series five postgraduates were awarded their PhDs. The main aims were to: identify where research on women in the 1950s is underway and on what topics, gaps in the field and available archives; build capacity amongst new researchers in the field. \nSeminars were advertised directly by email and through the Women's History Network, Gender and Education Association and the History of Education Society (UK). Notices were also posted on H-Women. \nAn initial core of twenty participants grew to an email list of over 80 including librarians, archivists, museum educators and members of U3A and at least fourteen postgraduates. \n Invited guest speakers included experts on photography, film and material culture. \n At least fifteen delegates attended four or more seminars resulting in a combination of continuity of discussion and fresh insights as experts brought new members to the series. Where possible each seminar included presentations from both academics and archivists/ museum /media professionals. Each venue had facilities for film and visual presentations allowing for discussion of a range of evidence at each seminar. The title of each event ensured that the experience of women of all ages and classes were explored. The convenors were mindful of the lack of research on non-white women's experience in the 1950s. Although every effort was made to ameliorate this and race/ ethnicity was the focus of papers within two of the seminars, this series highlighted the considerable need for more research in this area. We did not attract delegates from Wales despite our best efforts, suggesting that there is a gap in the research on this topic in this region.\nThe focus of the seminar brought together delegates (in addition to Manchester, Sussex and Winchester) from London South Bank, Staffordshire, Oxford, Oxford Brookes, Institute of Education London, Newcastle, Stirling, Warwick, Cambridge, Leicester, Open, Royal Holloway, UWE, Leeds Met, Lancaster, KCL, Keele, Nottingham, Rose Bruford, Sheffield, Derby, BBC, Victoria and Albert Museum, Women's Library, Israel, USA, Spain and independent researchers. As those working on this area are so scattered it was particularly valuable to have the opportunity to spend time in face-to- face discussion and to be made aware of where research into the 1950s is taking place. Four men also attended the seminars and one was a regular core member The main purpose of the seminar series was to provide a forum for established academics and an opportunity for postgraduate students to share their work and develop wider networks, Additionally speakers from the V and A museum and archives as well as the Women's Library enabled further and ongoing discussion as to the wider use of research into women in the 1950s beyond academia. Workshops on using visual sources broadened expertise in this area. Contacts made with those working outside academia built a range of relationships which have resulted in calls for advice on tv and radio programmes and talks to women's groups in the community.
