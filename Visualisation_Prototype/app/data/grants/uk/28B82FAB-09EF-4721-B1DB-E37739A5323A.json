{"id":"28B82FAB-09EF-4721-B1DB-E37739A5323A","title":"Elucidating the molecular and epigenetic basis of cancer initiation","abstractText":"Changes in gene function, which are not caused by alterations within the gene sequence, are referred to as &quot;modulation of gene function by epigenetic mechanisms&quot;. Epigenetic mechanisms involve addition and removal of tiny chemical groups attached to DNA and proteins. These epigenetic modifications play a key role in helping cells within the body perform the correct function. For example, brain cells and skin cells have essentially the same genes and genetic sequence, but they are fundamentally different both in structure and function, and their distinct identities need to be maintained throughout their lifetime. During development, the fertilised egg gives rise to over 200 different types of cells in the body, which accumulate epigenetic modifications and together confer an identity or signature to each cell type - these alterations are defined as their epigenetic information. \n\nCancer cells have in essence &quot;forgotten&quot; their identity, and epigenetic mechanisms are thought to be involved in erasing this memory. Generally, cancer cells evolve from a so-called &quot;cancer stem cell&quot; into more mature cancer cells, accumulating both genetic and epigenetic mutations, which eventually confer a survival advantage to the cancer cells in response to the body's normal defences. The fundamental question is how such cancer stem cells with this &quot;forgotten identity&quot; arise in the first place, and to what extent epigenetic modifications contribute to this process. Recently scientists have demonstrated that tumours can be induced in the absence of genetic changes, confirming that at least in some instances only epigenetic changes, such as &quot;forgetting identity&quot;, are sufficient to initiate cancer.\n\nWe aim to identify the aberrant epigenetic changes, which can trigger a normal cell to become cancerous. Technological advances in the last couple of years have offered unprecedented potential in addressing this question. Scientists have developed a novel tool called &quot;CRISPR/Cas9 based gene editing&quot;. With this tool we can induce a cut in the cell's DNA in essentially any region with the help of a &quot;guide&quot; RNA. This guide finds the sequence of interest, and recruits the enzyme Cas9 to this site to induce a cut in the DNA and generate a genetic modification. Our unique approach in inducing epigenetic mutations is that we use an inactive Cas9 enzyme which is fused to a DNA methylating (gene silencing) enzyme. In this way, wherever the guide attracts the inactive Cas9 to a DNA site, it will hypermethylate (silence) that specific DNA sequence, inducing an epigenetic change rather than a cut. Following this, we can assess the cancerous potential of cells harbouring such epigenetic changes.\n\nCancer is associated not only with aberrant hypermethylation and silencing of some genes (as described above) but also with general loss of methylation in the cell's DNA, therefore loss of epigenetic information. Recently, I have discovered a link between signalling pathways and widespread loss of DNA methylation in mouse embryonic stem cells (which often have common features with cancer cells). In this proposal, I aim to find proteins/enzymes involved in this process. Using an embryonic stem cell model system for DNA demethylation will allow identification of factors that might play a role in general loss of methylation in cancer. As a result, we hope to find new targets which can be used in developing novel cancer drugs.\n\nUltimately, by understanding the epigenetic basis of cancer stem-cell production, our aim is to stop cancer before it starts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M01892X/1","grantId":"MR/M01892X/1","fundValue":"679059","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gabriella  Ficz","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
