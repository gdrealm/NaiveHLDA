(TOMQML)","abstractText":"Fruits are an immensely important part of the human diet. Low fruit and vegetable intake is recognised as a major factor for increased risk of heart disease and certain cancers. Encouraging people to consume more fruit in their diet is not necessarily straight forward and depends on factors including cost and product quality. Some of the most important changes in fruit quality related to ripening involve the accumulation of primary metabolites such as sugars and acids which influence taste. Also alterations in the levels of secondary metabolites such as carotenoids and phenylpropanoids can have a significant impact on nutritional quality. The challenge is to understand how these individual ripening changes are controlled /modulated and develop commercially viable strategies for breeding novel and better fruit products. This project focuses on tomato as it is the most widely consumed fleshy fruit in the human diet, with a global value in excess of $10 bn. It has become the model for studying the development and ripening of fleshy fruits and a wealth of genetic and genomic resources are available. We will use a range of well characterised publicly available tomato lines and novel tomato genetic resources combined with a range of genetic and molecular approaches to identify the genes controlling tomato taste and the accumulation of health enhancing phytochemicals. In concert with these approaches, we will identify the links between major regulators of ripening and their associated metabolite changes. The project will make an important contribution to fundamental knowledge about the molecular basis of fruit ripening. The consortium consists of internationally recognized groups from universities and research institutes in Europe and the USA as well as a global supplier of vegetable seeds, collectively ensuring a framework for innovative excellence.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G02491X/1","grantId":"BB/G02491X/1","fundValue":"369814","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The outputs will influence breeding programmes for fruit and vegetables.

It involved a consortium of 8 partners from 6 countries.\n The Main objective was to identify candidate genes under a range of metabolite QTL. This has been achieved. Several candidate genes need to be validated in transgenic plants and this is being undertaken in a subsequent project due to the success of TomQML, RHUL and UoN have a follow on LINK grant from Syngenta that will allow selected experiments to be completed. \nAchievements for UoN led tasks within context of larger consortium:\n 1. 113 Chr 2 and 41 Chr 3 marker defined QTL-NILs generated and fruits analysed for metabolomics by other partners. These resources facilitated UoN / Syngenta fruit quality patent (WO2011/051120 AI) and resolution of an important quality QTL Chapman et al, (2012).\n 2. With RHUL, novel lycopene QTL on Chr 2 resolved to 111 kb and candidate gene identified by expression analysis. With Max Planck malate QTL resolved on Chr 3 and metabolite analysis being completed for candidate gene nomination. \n3. Substantially enhanced pigment composition of transgenic fruits over expressing regulatory gene from UoN validated by RHUL and linked to an S.pennellii QTL on Chr 8. A pepper ortholog was also identified with Syngenta. Joint outputs with RHUL partner were an international patent application WO2012041856 and building on ERANET resources a follow on BBSRC / Syngenta LINK project. Also a manuscript published in Plant Physiology\n4. With the RHUL partner identification of candidate genes under QTLs for tocopherol and _-carotene and generation of a comprehensive metabolite database for the S.pennellii ILs including construction of correlation network across metabolism and examples focussing on health related isoprenoids formed in tomato fruit by RHUL and UoN partners (Perez-Fons et al, 2014).\n Additional major achievements of the whole consortium \n 1. A sugar transporter gene underlying a fructose / glucose ratio QTL on Chr 4 was identified by the Volcani partner. They also fine mapped further fructose glucose ratio QTL on Chr 6 and a sucrose accumulator on Chr 12 using alleles from various tomato wild species (Publications in preparation). \n 2. The tomato branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) transferase gene family was characterised by the Max Planck partner. They identified and functionally validated an isopropylmalate dehydrogenase underlying a BCAA QTL (Kochevenko and Fernie, 2011; J. Exp. Bot; Kochevenko, et al, 2012. J. Plant Phys; Kochevenko, et al, 2012; Mol Plant). \n 4. The role of the AP2 transcription factor and its effect on metabolism has been established by the Wageningen partner working also with RHUL and Max Planck (Karlova et al, 2011. Plant Cell). UoN, RHUL, Syngenta GRN now being used by UoN and Wageningen to link AP2 to other major ripening Tfs (In preparation).\n 5. Project has facilitated development of Micro-Tom mutant collection and TILLING platform belonging to INRA partner. TILLING identified mutant lines in 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-phosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase 1 and 2, Lin5, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, AP2, FUL1, FUL2 and HFP.\nThere are still a number of additional publications and patents to be delivered from this project and these are in preparation. Will enable the production of better tasting and more nutritious fruit crops, especially tomato. The industrial partner will exploit the IP for crop improvement where appropriate Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
