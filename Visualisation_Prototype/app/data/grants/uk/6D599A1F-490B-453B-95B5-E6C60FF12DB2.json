These infections are widespread in the NHS and are particularly prevelant in newborns and the elderly. Our project seeks to reduce these infections through a new approach that uses a light source and a new class of catheter. This catheter has embedded dye molecules that under the action of light produce species that are toxic to bacteria. These catheters are self sterilising and most importantly show the ability to resist the biofilm formation that is the precursor to infection. It has been determined that catheter born infections are the most common cause of hospital acquired infection in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902208","grantId":"G0902208","fundValue":"770721","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ivan Paul Parkin","coPersons":["Christopher William Kay","Alexander John MacRobert","Michael  Wilson","C A  Sandy  Mosse"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" We have developed a new prototype antimicrobial catheter. We have done extensive studies that shw that the new catheter works well to kill bacteria. We are in discussions about commercialisation. We have also made 7 other antimicrobial surfaces and further demonstrator products potential widespread use in hospitals and nursing homes. Chemicals,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
