We will ask, in particular: </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Will the existing level of representation of the <u>siloviki </u>be maintained, or even increased? </li>\n\n <li>How will the <u>siloviki</u> and other strategic groups be distributed across the presidential administration, within a government that will be chaired by a more influential prime minister, within the newly-elected legislature, and in the eighty-odd regions?</li>\n\n <li>How will these strategic groups be represented within the informal 'court' where the most crucial of all decisions are made? </li>\n\n <li>What are the implications of their representation and known opinions for Russia's domestic and foreign/security policy? </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We propose to examine such matters on an annual basis in successive cross-sections, from January 2008 to January 2011 inclusive. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G011362/1","grantId":"ES/G011362/1","fundValue":"136955","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Leonard White","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
