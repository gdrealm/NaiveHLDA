{"id":"DA95160B-1D50-4711-9BB0-0647CAF51BDC","title":"DECAF - Delivering Electronic Circuitry with Aligned layers by Foil stamping","abstractText":"This proposal describes basic research directed toward the delivery of plastic electronic components, specifically transistors, to a flexible substrate in a roll-to-roll fashion. The work encompasses research into novel materials and processes to obtain multiple thin film layers which may then be transferred to prepatterned electrodes through foil stamping. In this manner, the semiconductor, dielectric and gate of a transistor may be located with automatic registration, obviating the need for resists and multiple printing steps, which are costly and wasteful. The method will enable the economic production of flexible circuitry with high throughput, reducing costs and offering novel, valuable features for printing industries. The project will focus on circuitry suitable for security features and will be exploited by De La Rue. The project aims to translate basic research into a process which will be suitable for subsequent scale up","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F006144/1","grantId":"DT/F006144/1","fundValue":"192910","fundStart":"2008-05-19","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Natalie  Stingelin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
