{"id":"B5B0C8E1-4C88-4C86-85FD-778ABC356285","title":"Schooling and unequal outcomes in youth and adulthood","abstractText":"<p>The role of schooling in determining educational attainment, occupational outcomes and social mobility remains high on the policy agenda. Are certain types of schools or schools with certain characteristics more successful than others and why? Do some types of school suit some pupils better than others? To what extent is schooling implicated in social and&nbsp;educational inequalities in Britain? In a time of increasing school diversity, selectivity and marketisation, these questions are more salient than ever.</p>\n\n<p>The 1970 British Cohort Study should be a prime data source for addressing these and related questions. This dataset provides a rich range of family background and ability measures, providing a substantial advantage in dealing with the issue of selectivity into the different types of school. However, work using the 1970 cohort has previously been hampered by the absence of secondary school data for the majority of the cohort members.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This project will repair the 1986 schooling data using a range of sources, and will also retrieve and deposit new cognitive scores from 1986. The project will use the newly enhanced data to conduct a programme of multidisciplinary research addressing the short and long term consequences of different school contexts.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K007238/1","grantId":"ES/K007238/1","fundValue":"298631","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alice  Sullivan","coPersons":["Richard Donovan Wiggins","Samantha Jayne Parsons","Francis  Green"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
