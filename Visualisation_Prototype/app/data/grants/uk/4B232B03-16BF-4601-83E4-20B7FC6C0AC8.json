{"id":"4B232B03-16BF-4601-83E4-20B7FC6C0AC8","title":"Post-Combustion Carbon Capture Using MOFs: Materials and Process Development","abstractText":"The proposal aims to develop an international collaborative research programme under Topic 4 of the FENCO-NET call: New innovative CO2\ncapture technologies. \nThe specific issues addressed in the proposal are:\n1. Overall evaluation of new innovative CO2 capture processes based on Metal Organic Framework (MOF) materials;\n2. To synthesise (scale-up to kg quantities), characterise,, formulate and evaluate selected MOFs for vacuum swing (VSA) post-combustion capture;\n3. To investigate and address adsorbent stability and efficiency in post-combustion carbon capture processes;\n4. To investigate and model mass and heat transfer kinetics to enable accurate dynamic process simulations needed for the optimization of the\ncarbon capture units with respect to energy efficiency and operational and capital costs.\nThe FENCO-NET call gives the unique opportunity of coordinating the significant research efforts in the partner institutions. SINTEF has the\ncapability of preparing advanced MOFs which can also be scaled-up to produce formed materials for bench scale process testing. The UoE has\ndeveloped new rapid screening techniques, specifically for post-combustion carbon capture and the close collaboration with SINTEF will accelerate\nfurther developments and provide essential stability data to direct novel material synthesis. Significant advances in this field can only be achieved if\nmaterial and process development are combined. CERTH brings significant expertise in Vacuum Swing Adsorption (VSA) modelling, simulation, design\nand optimization and both the UoE and SINTEF have the capability of evaluating the integration of the novel carbon capture systems in power plants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L021064/1","grantId":"EP/L021064/1","fundValue":"197691","fundStart":"2014-03-28","fundEnd":"2016-03-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stefano  Brandani","coPersons":["Maria-Chiara  Ferrari"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
