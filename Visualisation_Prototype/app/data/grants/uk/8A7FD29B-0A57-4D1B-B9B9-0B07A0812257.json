These include insufficient expressiveness, suboptimal complexity, over specialisation and incomplete formal treatment. All these are serious issues which need to be tackled and overcome if such systems are to form the backbone ontology reasoning for the semantic web. Concerning reasoning within and about multi-agent systems, in the form of intelligent decision making by agent and the formal specification and verification of agent systems, there exists a plethora of agent logics which have been proposed for this purpose, but almost no implemented reasoning systems for solving satisfiability and validity problems in these logics. This lack of system support is a serious problem.We will use techniques from first-order logic and resolution to develop a resolution framework for reasoning about expressive ontological languages and expressive agent logics. A series of tools will be developed to provide automated support for reasoning tasks in these areas. Principles of benchmarking will be studied, designed and used for empirical investigations of developed technologies and tools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D056152/1","grantId":"EP/D056152/1","fundValue":"184464","fundStart":"2007-01-15","fundEnd":"2010-01-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The developed tableau synthesis framework has provided a brand new and automatic way of developing tableau algorithms. Combined with the new blocking technique it gives us a methodology for solving problems in expressive logics, for which so far it has not been known how to use tableau methods as decision procedures.\n\nAs a consequence, for the first time non-specialists are able to easily devise reasoning algorithms for applications requiring logical reasoning. This is useful in all scientific disciplines and commercial applications where practical reasoning algorithms are needed.\n\nThe results have provided the foundation for research on automatic prover generation (a completely new and promising research direction).
