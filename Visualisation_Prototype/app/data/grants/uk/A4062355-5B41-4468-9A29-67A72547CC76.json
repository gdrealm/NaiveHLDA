Their ability to continue to sequester carbon dioxide and their botanical composition under future global warming scenarios is uncertain, but research into their ability to store carbon during former periods of climate change can provide clues to their potential future response. It has already been shown that changes in the rate of carbon accumulation during the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age in raised peat bogs was dependent upon the botanical composition of the peat forming plants. It is therefore vital to reconstruct the local peat forming vegetation when investigating long-term records of carbon accumulation, but this, unfortunately is not always possible, as plant macrofossils do not preserve well in blanket peat bogs and other boreal and subarctic peatland ecosystems. Given this, there is a pressing need to develop alternative techniques to reconstruct peat forming plants from extensive peat bog archive deposits which contain millennial records of carbon accumulation rate changes, and in this way reconstruct the spatial and temporal variability of carbon sequestration. This research seeks to redress this problem by testing the suitability of 'molecular fossils' preserved in peat profiles from UK blanket peat profiles (preservation of macrofossils is frequently poor in these deposits) to reconstruct the former vegetation components. If successful, the reward of this project will be improved understanding of species dependent carbon sequestration during previous periods of climate change, which could prove highly beneficial to inform future carbon management, both internationally and nationally (peat deposits in moorland areas represent the largest terrestrial carbon pool in the UK). Improved long-term base line data for the origin and nature of vegetation changes in peat bogs would also serve to guide and aid conservation of these threatened ecosystems, particularly blanket peat bogs. This would be highly beneficial to stakeholders charged with water collection, agriculture, sport, leisure, and tourism in moorland habitats where peat bog habitats occur. The techniques have excellent promise since their application in a PhD pilot project offered species level identification (of heather) in a buried soil deposit. Testing the value of plant wax biochemical markers as a proxy for peat-bog vegetation will involve three stages. The first stage will be to determine the chemical markers of living, reference material collected from a range of raised/blanket peat bog habitats. This will be followed by analyses of sub-fossil samples of known botanical composition and age from an extensively radiocarbon dated raised peat bog profile with excellent macrofossil preservation. These samples were investigated as part of a major EU 6th Framework funded project ('Accrotelm') and their timely availability represent an excellent opportunity to investigate the fossil plant wax biochemical signatures of samples of known botanical composition. Data on the modern/sub-fossil plant wax biochemical markers from known plant species will then be used in the final proof of concept stage to reconstruct the potential former local vegetation of a blanket peat sample of imperfectly known botanical composition. Peat bog deposits contain detailed records of carbon sequestration rate changes, and also provide proxy-climate data and long-term ecological records to inform conservation policies. UK scientists are world leaders in the analyses of these deposits, and this small project is closely aligned with three of NERC's current strategic science themes on Biodiversity, Sustainable Use of Natural Resources, and Knowledge Exchange to stakeholders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H012362/1","grantId":"NE/H012362/1","fundValue":"25249","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Dmitri  Mauquoy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" The first and second aims of the research project were to: 1. Determine the plant wax biochemical compounds of modern peat forming vegetation (graminoids, dwarf shrubs and mosses), collected from raised and blanket peat bog ecosystems using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). 2. To determine the plant wax biochemical compounds of well-preserved sub-fossil samples of known botanical composition and age. Both of these objectives have been met and the range of biomarkers which can be used in the understanding of past vegetation histories of peat bogs has expanded and now allows us to characterise past vegetation communities from past millennia in relation to both blanket and raised peat bog deposits. We have successfully shown that biomarkers can be quantified using as little as 15mg of organic sample. We are also developing methods to examine other marker compounds such as ketones and aldehydes, which are extracted at the same time as n-alkanes, long chain fatty alcohols, sterols and stanols. A data set is currently under construction, consisting of biomarker characterisation of a wide range of plant species both in terms of their modern and sub-fossil biomarker signatures. The range of plant species now includes the majority of graminoids, dwarf shrubs and mosses growing in raised and blanket peat bog ecosystems. The third objective of our research is currently ongoing. This involves the charecterisation of the former peat forming vegetation based on the record of plant wax biochemical compounds from a blanket peat-bog profile where botanical preservation is poor. This reconstruction has yet to be compared with the results of conventional palaeoecological analyses (local pollen and non- pollen microfossils) of the same samples to assess the value of the molecular fossil techniques to reconstruct the former local vegetation. The pollen and non-pollen microfossil analyses have been completed for a blanket peat profile from Withens Moor, the Peak District, which records a substantial change from dwarf-shrub dominated vegetation to communities dominated by grasses during the late nineteenth century. All biomarker analyses are now complete and we aim to compare the results of the two techniques to ascertain whether or not they are complimentary. The final objective of the research project was to undertake knowledge exchange using online resources and public events. This has been achieved through the provision of a webpage, attendance at an open day and presentation of a poster at the 3rd International Workshop on Criminal and Environmental Soil Forensics.
