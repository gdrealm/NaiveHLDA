Instead one has to rely either on approximate or numerical methods. For a certain type of systems, called integrable, there exist particular mathematical structures and symmetries which facilitate the exact and explicit description. Most integrable systems are low-dimensional, for instance a one-dimensional chain of coupled atoms with magnetic spin. Physicists are interested in computing correlations between these spins. One particular example is the probability to find two spins separated by a certain distance to be aligned. This information allows one to make predictions about magnetic or transport properties of low-dimensional quantum systems. Spin-chains serve also as toy models for quantum information and the study of quantum entanglement.In recent years there has been remarkable progress in the understanding of the mathematical structure of correlation functions for spin-chains. This proposal aims at bringing one of the international leading experts in this area to the UK to disseminate these new developments, initiate collaborations and new research projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D065518/1","grantId":"EP/D065518/1","fundValue":"5233","fundStart":"2006-03-10","fundEnd":"2006-06-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christian  Korff","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
