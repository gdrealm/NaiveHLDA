We prepared a 69-page 'practitioner report', with an executive summary that was translated into German, French, Italian, and Polish. These were sent to all interviewees. We launched the report at a 1-day Final Project Conference at LSE on 23 May, 2013. In 4 sessions, the research team presented project findings, followed by presentations and panel discussions by practitioners. All individuals interviewed for the study were invited, as well as academic colleagues. The practitioner report was sent to all research participants. \n\nWe received positive feedback from participants in the conference and recipients of the report. To give a few examples: Employee representatives at TDC used project findings to argue for increased skill investments. Representatives from a German union and from a French union wrote articles summarizing project findings in union newsletters. A management representative from France Telecom presented project findings to a team planning work reorganization in their technician workplaces. A works councillor from A1 presented project findings at a works council conference in Austria.\n\nThe PI was also invited to present project findings at several practitioner conferences, including an LSE HR Conference 2013 [~100 attendees]; the UNI-ICTS World Committee Meeting [~50 attendees]; a seminar at Communication Workers of America in Washington DC, USA [~30 attendees]; and a Global Call Center Conference in Orlando, FL, USA [~200 attendees from 20+ countries]. \n\nIn addition, members of the project team have presented research findings from this study at several EU-level public policy and social dialogue meetings. The project Research Officer presented our findings at a meeting of the &quot;EU Telecom Social Dialogue&quot; in Brussels, which brought together major telecommunications employers and representatives from national and international labor unions. A PhD student working as a research assistant on the project, presented findings at the European Employment Research Dialogue meeting, 'Can product and labour market reforms encourage competitiveness and job creation in Europe?' - organized by the European Employment Policy Observatory on behalf of the Directorate General Employment of the European Commission (EC). Policy recommendations generated from our study were integrated into a report prepared for the EC at the conclusion of the meeting, as part of their consultation process on the employment effects of product and labor market liberalization policies. The PhD student also presented our research findings at a workshop on MNCs organized by the European Trade Union Institute. The workshop launched an interdisciplinary network of researchers established by the ETUI as a means to &quot;monitor and coordinate research in this area&quot; as well as to support the ETUI's &quot;research, education and consulting activities.&quot; The PI is currently contributing two chapters to a research volume commissioned by the ETUI on the topic 'Outsourcing across borders: Working conditions and organizing strategies in highly fragmented production networks': she participated in a workshop in November 2014 in Brussels to present draft chapters for this volume (based on research findings from this project).\n\nA publication based on case study findings from Deutsche Telekom was written for WSI-Mitteilungen, a practitioner journal of the German trade union research institute. This is forthcoming in December 2014.\n\nThe PI was invited by UNI-ICTS to prepare a report on the health and performance impacts of performance management practices in call centres in 2012, during the period when research was being conducted for this study. The report was used by unions in over 20 countries as the basis for campaigning and organizing efforts to improve job quality. \n\nScientific impact\nThe study is distinctive in producing in-depth, comparative research across similar organizational settings in a large number of countries. Findings contribute to debates on the institutional factors associated with restructuring and HRM practices; the impact of these approaches on patterns of inequality and job quality; as well as the role of employer strategies in driving institutional change. Draft papers based on research findings were presented at 4 invited seminars and 5 international conferences between 2012-2014 -- with plans to present further papers at 3 conferences in 2015. The practitioner report and draft papers were circulated to colleagues attending research presentations. \n\nTwo of these papers are currently under review at journals: one paper was resubmitted (R&amp;amp;R) in October 2014 to Industrial and Labor Relations Review (Cornell University); another was submitted to the same journal in September 2014. Three further papers are in draft stage, and will be submitted to leading international journals over the next year. In the longer term, a book that brings together the broader project findings is planned.\n\nTeaching impact: The PI has incorporated case studies from this project into lectures and seminar classes at LSE. Carrying out qualitative research in 10 countries has enhanced her ability to convey the details of alternative employment regulations and industrial relations institutions in different 'national models' covered in employment relations courses.

The study was motivated by a concern with the conditions under which mutual gains that benefit both employers and employees can be achieved when management is under increased pressure to reduce labour costs and downsize employment. In an industry where markets are rapidly becoming more competitive and internationalized, have incumbent firms adopted different restructuring strategies - and if so, what explains these differences? Under what conditions are employers more likely to adopt 'high road' practices, investing in high pay, skills, and opportunities for employees to participate in decision-making? To what extent do these kinds of high road practices benefit both a broad cross-section of employees and their employers - and what factors make it more difficult to realize mutual gains? Is there any evidence to suggest that certain best practice models can be sustained or replicated in other settings? \nTo answer these questions, we compared approaches to employment restructuring in ten major incumbent telecommunications firms in Europe and the USA. Case study companies were chosen from countries representing different national 'models', recognized for having distinctive sets of labour market and corporate governance institutions. These included: \n1) Nordic: TDC (Denmark) and TeliaSonera (Sweden)\n2) Centre European: Deutsche Telekom (Germany) and Telekom Austria/ A1 (Austria)\n3) Mediterranean: France Telecom/ Orange (France) and Telecom Italia (Italy)\n4) Anglo-American: BT (UK) and AT&amp;amp;T (USA)\n5) Central and Eastern European (CEE): Telekomunikacja Polska/ Orange Polska (Poland) and ?esk? Telecom/ O2 Telef?nica Czech Republic (Czech Republic)\n\nIn order to trace differences in employment practices and outcomes, we focused on two major employee groups: technicians and call centre employees. These two groups were chosen because they represent a large share of service employment at our case study companies, and have been the target of restructuring and work reorganization.\n\n1. The context of restructuring: markets, ownership structures, and institutions\nThe liberalization of telecommunications markets occurred between the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the USA, UK, and Sweden, in the late 1990s in Denmark, Austria, Germany, France, and Italy, and in the early 2000s in the Czech Republic and Poland. As a result, most incumbent firms experienced a steep fall in market share between 1999 and 2005, but in most countries, the drop stabilized between 2005 and 2010. \nThe case study firms also experienced changes in ownership and finance. AT&amp;amp;T, BT, O2 Telef?nica CR, Orange Polska, TDC, and Telecom Italia are fully privatized, while TeliaSonera has the highest state ownership. The companies with the lowest foreign ownership in 2010 were France Telecom, BT, and TeliaSonera. The companies with the highest foreign ownership were TDC, Orange Polska, and O2 Telef?nica CR. The percentage of a company's assets provided via debt (compared to equity) increased at most incumbents between 1995 and 2010, with the largest increases at TDC and BT. These differences may influence pressures on management to maximize cash flow and reduce costs, as well as shaping objectives pursued through restructuring.\nRestructuring strategies can also be influenced by institutions at the national and company or corporate group level. First, national- and industry-level collective bargaining institutions differed across the countries: \no Structure of collective agreements: In Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, and the Czech Republic, employers' associations negotiate sectoral collective agreements with peak union confederations that cover almost all of the telecommunications workforce. In Germany, most large telecommunications firms are covered by different company agreements. In the UK, USA, and Poland, collective agreements primarily cover the incumbent firm or firms. \no Union structure and competition: In Denmark, Austria, and Germany there is one major union in the incumbent, while other telecommunications employers negotiate with other unions. In the Czech Republic there is one major union responsible for the incumbent and the telecommunications industry. In Sweden, the UK, and USA multiple unions represent clearly delineated groups, with no or minimal competition. In France, Italy, and Poland, multiple unions compete within the incumbent and in the industry. \no Bargaining rights and structures at company level: Works councils in Germany and Austria have among the strongest co-determination rights, giving them a veto over management decisions in areas such as the implementation of new technology. In Denmark and Sweden, elected workplace representatives are more closely tied to the unions and have weaker formal rights - and so are heavily dependent on union bargaining power as well as management's willingness to cooperate. Formal bargaining rights are weakest in the UK, USA, Poland, and the Czech Republic.\no Union membership density and bargaining coverage: in Denmark and Sweden, the telecommunications industry has both high union density and high bargaining coverage. Germany, Austria, France, and Italy have low to moderate density but high coverage; and the UK, USA, Poland, and the Czech Republic have low coverage with low density. \nSecond, firm- and company-level collective bargaining structures at the incumbents differed: \no Bargaining centralization and coordination: Telecom Italia and France Telecom have the highest centralization and coordination, with small differences in agreements for subsidiaries. TDC and Deutsche Telekom have moderate centralization and coordination, with separate agreements and pay structures for subsidiaries. AT&amp;amp;T has the most highly decentralized and weakly coordinated bargaining, with a large number of different collective agreements across regions and subsidiaries.\no Labour-management cooperation: Responses by union officials indicate a deterioration in the degree of labour-management cooperation at TDC, TeliaSonera, A1, Deutsche Telekom, and France Telecom. BT shows an improvement over time while Telecom Italia, O2 Telef?nica, and Orange Polska all experienced a decline in the period 2000-2004, followed by an improvement in recent years.\nThird, employment protections varied across countries and within the incumbent firms: \no Job security: Employment protections in Denmark and the Czech Republic are among the weakest in Europe, while in Sweden, employers can negotiate exemptions to stronger employment protections with unions. In Austria, Germany, France, and Italy, employees on contingent contracts have weaker protections relative to permanent contracts. National employment protections are weak in Poland, the USA, and the UK, but unions negotiated stronger job security agreements with incumbents. \no Transfer of undertakings rules in EU member states require employers to adhere to collective agreements for a period after outsourcing or spinning off an establishment to a new owner. Firms in the USA do not face these restrictions. \no Civil servants: TDC, TeliaSonera, A1, Deutsche Telekom, and France Telecom all had a large proportion of the workforce at the time of privatization who were civil servants, with distinctive employment rights. These companies negotiated different arrangements for transitioning these employees to private contracts or allowing them to retain their status. \n\n2. Downsizing and employment adjustment\n\nChanging ownership structures, the emergence and intensification of competition, as well as technological advances that rationalised many work processes together created strong pressures to reduce employment. These trends led to massive downsizing, with incumbent firms shedding between 38% and 72% of their workforce between 1995 and 2010. Different redundancy policies were adopted to manage the downsizing process:\no Compulsory vs. voluntary redundancies: Compulsory redundancies were used from the mid-1990s at AT&amp;amp;T and O2 Telef?nica CR and in later periods by TDC. A1 and Deutsche Telekom transferred redundant employees to leasing firms that could hire them out back to the respective firm and to other firms. The other firms relied on incentives, natural attrition, and outsourcing or spin-offs to downsize.\no Voluntary retirement and redundancy packages: In most firms, redundancy payments were relatively generous throughout the 1990s and early 2000s but were reduced by the late 2010s. Exceptions include Telecom Italia, which did not make any major changes to redundancy policies after 1995, and O2 Telef?nica Czech Republic, where redundancy payments increased over time.\no Labour conflict over downsizing: Conflict was most severe at France Telecom and Orange Polska, which both experienced major strike waves and organized labour opposition to downsizing. TeliaSonera, TDC, A1, and Telecom Italia had a high level of conflict during certain periods but maintained a tradition of labour management cooperation. Negotiations over downsizing were most cooperative at BT, AT&amp;amp;T, O2 Telef?nica CR, and Deutsche Telekom. This is due to the gradual nature of downsizing, strong job security protections against compulsory redundancies, as well as relatively generous social packages. \nConsolidation measures, or a concentration of jobs in a smaller number of locations, were related to downsizing, as they were often accompanied by some form of redundancy: \no Consolidation trends: Consolidation affected a range of jobs and activities. However, call centres were a major target of these measures. Most incumbents reduced the number of call centres by two-thirds or more, although over different time periods. Most firms compensated employees through generous relocation packages or some form of assistance in commuting or moving to a new location. \no Labour conflict over consolidation: Unions in several incumbents responded to planned consolidation measures with strikes and demonstrations. At BT, Deutsche Telekom, and France Telecom, unions succeeded in negotiating agreements to keep certain locations open or modify consolidation plans.\nThe incumbent firms also negotiated a range of alternatives to redundancies with labour unions:\no Reduced working hours: Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom both negotiated agreements to reduce working hours, which followed announcements of job cuts and associated labour conflict. \no Retraining: Most companies offered retraining opportunities to move existing employees into areas of job growth. Training policies at TeliaSonera and BT constituted particularly innovative solutions to changing skill demands and were designed and implemented in close cooperation with unions.\nLabour unions have played a central role at all of the case study firms in negotiating over measures to downsize employment, consolidate locations, and adjust workforce skills. Differences in the generosity of redundancy and retraining plans, as well as the degree of labour-management cooperation over these measures, can be attributed to variation in employment security protections, government support, ownership structures, and employer strategies. \n\n3. Diversifying employment contracts\nA second category of restructuring encompasses measures that result in diversification of employment contracts for certain employee groups, typically as a means of enhancing flexibility in increasingly differentiated and cost-conscious markets. We observed four categories of these measures across the case study firms.\nFirst, employers introduced new job titles with different pay and conditions from the existing workforce. Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, and A1 had separate structures of pay and conditions for private law employees and civil servants, while at TDC, former civil servants retained a more generous pension and redundancy terms. At AT&amp;amp;T, BT, TDC, Deutsche Telekom, and Telecom Italia, new employees in certain areas entered on a lower pay scale and/or with different employment terms and conditions than existing employees in similar jobs. \nSecond, incumbents diversified contracts across their corporate group through acquiring or establishing subsidiaries covered by separate collective agreements or with different pay scales. TDC and Telecom Italia acquired new companies and continued to operate them as independent subsidiaries, preserving some differences in pay and conditions between core and subsidiary employees. Many incumbents established new subsidiaries for mobile and internet markets as well as for call centre services. The resulting differentiation in terms and conditions across subsidiaries was largest at AT&amp;amp;T and Deutsche Telekom. At France Telecom and Telecom Italia, subsidiary agreements were increasingly harmonized over time, decreasing inequality. At TeliaSonera and Orange Polska, collective agreements were transferred with employees to subsidiaries, resulting in no contractual changes. \nThird, incumbents have transferred employees to different collective agreements through the sale of subsidiaries or establishments to third party firms. Most major incumbent firms spun off or outsourced different business services and support services, including IT services and call centres. Typically, transferred employees maintained their pay and conditions for a transition period, but then were moved to new agreements or no longer covered by collective bargaining. These measures affected the largest proportion of employees at Deutsche Telekom, which outsourced major areas of call centre and technician services through subsidiary sales. A1 and France Telecom are the only case study firms that did not use this strategy. \nFourth, incumbents have differentiated employment contracts through use of subcontractors and temporary agencies. All of the incumbents outsourced or used temporary agencies for some portion of their call centre and technician work. France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, and TeliaSonera appeared to be the highest users of subcontracting and temporary agency work for call centres, while the highest users of subcontracting for technician services were TeliaSonera, Telefonica CR and Orange Polska.\nFindings demonstrate that all incumbent firms examined in this study have adopted different combinations of these four measures to accomplish broadly similar goals: reducing costs while offering more differentiated products and services. Differences in strategies can be explained by constraints from national and firm-level institutions, as well as negotiations with employee representatives. The outcome of these negotiations is influenced to some degree by pay and conditions for similar jobs in the telecommunications and subcontractor industries of each country. We found the least differentiation in pay and conditions within the incumbent and across subcontractors or temporary agency employees at TeliaSonera and A1, both of which are distinctive in having relatively compressed pay structures and encompassing collective agreements for a range of contract types, with strong enforcement mechanisms for those agreements. \n\n4. Work organization and human resource management\nIn the final section of the report, we compare approaches to work organization and human resource management for call centre and technician jobs at TDC, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, BT, and Orange Polska. Although there were differences in management practices for these two groups of employees, we observed broad similarities in the overall employment model adopted by each case study firm. \nFirst, approaches to work organization and skills differed. TDC, BT, and Orange Polska adopted a 'multi-skilled' approach to work organization: most field technicians were generalists and call centre employees used less customer segmentation and specialization by call type. Deutsche Telekom was implementing strategies that increased specialization in both areas; while France Telecom was moving in the opposite direction through investing in 'multi-skilled teams'. France Telecom and BT invested most heavily in formal training with associated promotion opportunities. \nSecond, the case study firms adopted different models of performance management. At all of the firms, employee representatives sought to encourage use of performance information for purposes of employee training and development rather than sanctions. However, Deutsche Telekom and TDC had the strongest negotiated limits on how information gathered through performance monitoring was collected and used. Another important difference concerned the consequences and incentives attached to performance results. At TDC, BT, and Orange Polska, employees could be dismissed if they consistently failed to meet performance targets. All three companies also relied on variable pay above base pay for call centre employees, although this was restricted to sales at BT. At France Telecom, management relied on regular performance reviews attached to a promotion and pay increase, as well as variable pay above base pay for sales employees. Deutsche Telekom was distinctive in having a variable pay model for both call centre and technician employees in which their base pay was dependent on meeting performance goals. \nThese findings show that similar incumbent firms took different approaches to investing in skills, organizing work, monitoring performance, and designing sanctions and rewards. They also show recent changes in practices. For example, France Telecom was moving toward a more 'high involvement' employment model relying on multi-skilled teams and strengthened employee participation, while other companies were increasing specialization, reducing training investments, and intensifying monitoring and sanctions. Across the incumbent firms, unions and works councils sought to encourage employment models that invested in skills and employee participation. Differences in practices as well as change over time were influenced by constraints on management, such as job security rules, and resources that allowed employee representatives to negotiate improvements in working conditions, such as formal participation or co-determination rights. \n\nConclusions and policy implications\nBased on our case study findings, we identify a series of 'best practices' that produced mutual gains for employers and employees. These include: a) downsizing policies that involved labour-management cooperation over employment adjustment, investing in employee skills and internal transfers while offering targeted incentives for voluntary redundancy; b) strategies to diversify employment contracts that did not result in substantial reduction in pay and employment conditions for existing employees, and that resulted in low levels of inequality across similar employee groups; and c) high involvement models of work organization and human resource management that invested in employee skills, placed limits on monitoring, focused on developing rather than disciplining employees, and involved some degree of employee control over work pace and content.\nComparative findings suggest that best practices were most likely where: a) ownership and finance arrangements protected employers from pressure to produce short-term cost reduction; b) collective agreements established similar pay structures for a majority of employees in similar jobs; c) employees enjoyed strong participation rights across different areas of management decision-making; and d) employment protections limited employers' ability to unilaterally downsize, transfer, or dismiss employees. We conclude that these collective bargaining and labour market institutions played an important role in encouraging alternative approaches to restructuring associated with mutual gains and enhanced job quality. - research on restructuring in incumbent firms could be replicated in other national and industry settings\n\n- surveys could be conducted across the telecommunications sector and in related subcontracting industries, to examine patterns of pay, working conditions, and HRM across 'networked' organizations Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Healthcare,Retail,Transport,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
