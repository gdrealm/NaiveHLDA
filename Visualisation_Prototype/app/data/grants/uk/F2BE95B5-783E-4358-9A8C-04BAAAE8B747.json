Using these data, the study looks at whether firms and locations that experienced large changes in accessibility (to workers and other firms) as a result of transport improvements, experienced correspondingly large changes in employment, wages and productivity.</p>\n\n<p>The study therefore aims to shed light on the ex-post benefits of transport improvements to firms, workers and the local economy. A second part of the analysis estimates the effects of these transport improvements on road network performance, including congestion and journey times, and identifies which types of investment generate the biggest increases in performance.This will allow a better understanding of the channels through which increased connectivity between places affects economic performance.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J007382/1","grantId":"ES/J007382/1","fundValue":"217167","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Gibbons","coPersons":["Henry George Overman","Daniel Joseph Graham","Stephen Jonathan Machin"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":" The project provides empirical analyses of the effects of transport infrastructure improvement on economic performance, in Britain and international settings. The British strand of the work is the first to provide evidence on the overall impact of the recent road transport programme on economic performance. It links data on all new major roads constructed in Britain between 1998 and 2008 to firm and worker data, and examines to what extent roads affected employment, productivity work hours and wages. We find that new roads, which increase the accessibility of workplaces, boost local employment through entry of firms into an area, and raise wages and work hours. Looking further at road transport, we study the relationships between urban road infrastructure investment, traffic volumes, delays and economic output in US urban areas. The study shows that increases in road capacity induce increased traffic volume and congestion, but that these higher traffic volumes enable higher output. In other words, new roads do not relieve congestion, but do stimulate economic output. Accessibility by road in urban areas in the US is also found to be associated with greater productivity, potentially due to the 'agglomeration' benefits arising from close connection between firms and between firms and workers. In contrast, a study of the impact of new High Speed rail lines in Spain after 2005 finds no evidence that expansion of the high speed rail network had any effect on output (value added per capita) of regions that received new rail lines, relative to regions in Portugal and elsewhere in Spain that did not. All the results from this project have implications for transport policy, by providing guidance on the economic benefits of transport infrastructure to local economies. In particular the reports on the effects of road transport improvements in Britain and high speed rail in Spain have clear messages on the economics benefits (or not) of transport infrastructure policy. The other work provides more nuanced lessons on the potential role of transport in improving regional economic performance. The work will be generally relevant to organisations involved in the evaluation and implementation of transport policy including Department of Local Authorities, Network Rail, Highways Agency, Transport Scotland, Welsh Assembly Government and private sector transport planning consultants.
