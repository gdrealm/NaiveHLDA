{"id":"E79020AB-9761-49F3-B536-474580CAD95B","title":"The Economics of Health and Family","abstractText":"<p>It is well-known that cohabitation is correlated with health. Empirical studies from various countries have identified this link for different measures of health. Yet, there is little knowledge, concerning the mechanisms behind this correlation. It is the objective of this research project to shed light on this issue, theoretically and empirically.</p>\n\n<p>The first aim is to develop a theoretical model for the relationship between cohabitation and health, using a matching model. A matching model explains how partnerships are formed and dissolved, and how an individual’s behaviour depends on their traits, and on the parameters of the matching process. The appeal of a matching model is that it can decompose to what extent observed inequalities in health depend on an individual’s choices as opposed to random events or the functioning of the matching process.</p>\n\n<p>The second aim is to estimate an empirical model of the relationship between marriage and health. Longitudinal datasets such as the BHPS are being used in an empirical investigation into the determinants of health and marriage. A particular aim is to assess whether benefits from a relationship work primarily through the relationship itself or whether the effects depend on the traits of the individuals in the relationships.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0149","grantId":"RES-061-25-0149","fundValue":"139848","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Karlsson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
