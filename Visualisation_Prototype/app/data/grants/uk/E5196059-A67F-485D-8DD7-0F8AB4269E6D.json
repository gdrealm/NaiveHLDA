As many as 50 million young Chinese have become urban residents or moved away from their hometowns as a result of seeking higher education, while Chinese students constitute the largest single group of international students in the richer OECD countries of the world, making up 20 percent of the total student migration to these countries. A growing proportion of these students are heading to Europe. Yet systematic research on a representative sample of these student migrants is lacking, and theoretical frameworks for migration more generally may not always apply to students moving for higher education.\n\nThis research project aims to investigate key dimensions of this educational mobility, and its imports for students and their families, through conducting exploratory interviews and survey research in China, the UK and Germany. We explore this phenomenon in two related aspects: the migration of students from the People's Republic of China to the UK and Germany for higher education, and internal migration for studies within China. This research design enables a fascinating and unusual set of comparisons, between those who stay and those who migrate, both within China and beyond its borders. We also plan to compare Chinese students in the UK and Germany with domestic students in the two countries. Differences and similarities in these groups of students will enable us to identify which types of students choose migration and how this affects their expectations about the impact of such a decision on the course of their lives. Interviews with students' parents will enable answering questions about family strategies and educational migration.\n\nOur research will produce a valuable data set on Chinese student migrants that will be available for future researchers with new sets of questions. By generating innovative data and analytical perspectives on education as a form of migration generally and on Chinese educational migration in particular, this project will open up scholarly questions around who migrates and the effects of migration on these individuals and their families. As well as being presented at academic conferences, and circulated among networks of academic researchers focusing on education and migration, our findings will be published in a number of scholarly journal articles and monographs, in English, Chinese and German languages.\n\nThis research will benefit a range of non-academic stakeholders, allowing for more informed policy-making; university recruitment and integration of international students; and parental and student choices. We plan to produce a policy-oriented report containing a summary of our main research findings aimed at governments, tertiary institutions, think-tanks and organizations involved in providing information and support to international students. We will reach key stakeholders through targeted dissemination activities, including half-day conferences for higher education administrators, education agents and educational organizations in London, Brussels and Beijing. Our study will provide important baseline data on gaps between student expectations and experience, thus potentially providing universities in the UK and Germany with information on how better to integrate Chinese students in the future. We plan to write articles on this specific angle for publications aimed at a broad audience in the higher education sector. Some of our findings will be of broad general interest, especially to students and parents in China considering momentous migration decisions. We plan to provide media briefings for journalists who cover education in all three countries, but particularly focused on China and Hong Kong, highlighting elements of our study that address information gaps our data has identified.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L015633/1","grantId":"ES/L015633/1","fundValue":"395707","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Yasemin  Soysal","coPersons":["Sophia  Woodman","Hector  Cebolla Boado"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
