This work entails making detailed quantitative observational predictions which can be used to distinguish between different inflation models, as well as those involving cosmic superstrings and textures. In particular, we wish to study cosmologies emerging from higher dimensional models in fundamental theory, and discover ways in which to differentiate these from conventional four-dimensional models. We will also use data from the late universe to develop probes of the cosmological constant, dark energy and the variation of the fundamental constants of nature. In addition, we will embark on a new project in gravitational physics, studying the existence, formation and consequences of black holes. We will consider the distinctive signatures of extra dimensions which the experimental study of black holes may be able to uncover.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F002998/1","grantId":"ST/F002998/1","fundValue":"1666240","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Hawking","coPersons":["Gary  Gibbons","Edward Paul Shellard","Harvey  Reall","John David  Barrow","Neil  Turok","Anthony  Challinor","John  Stewart"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
