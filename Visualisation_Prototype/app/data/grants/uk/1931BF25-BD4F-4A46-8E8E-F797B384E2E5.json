{"id":"1931BF25-BD4F-4A46-8E8E-F797B384E2E5","title":"A lifetime perspective on the distributional and incentive effects of the tax system","abstractText":"<p>Modern tax (and benefits) systems affect the intertemporal incentives to work and invest in human capital over the lifecourse by, eg, changing the income-age profile, insuring against adversities or altering the returns to human capital through redistribution. But most existing work on the effects of the tax system ignores any dynamic considerations.</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to provide a richer understanding of the UK tax system and its effects on individuals' decisions to invest in human capital and work, lifetime income and wellbeing. The following questions are addressed: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>How do financial incentives to work change over the lifecourse?&nbsp;</li>\n\n <li>How is the tax burden shared over the population and over the lifecourse?</li>\n\n <li>What are the effects of changes in taxes/benefits on the distribution of lifetime income, incentives to work and invest in human capital? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research is based on the analysis of simulated lifetimes of individuals whose characteristics are taken from survey data, and whose decisions are based on a lifecycle model of human capital accumulation, work and family formation representing the real lifecourse. The model includes a detailed description of the UK tax system to fully capture its effect on the incentives to work and invest in human capital.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I028021/1","grantId":"ES/I028021/1","fundValue":"87310","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Monica Costa Dias","coPersons":["Jonathan Mark Shaw","Mike  Brewer"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
