{"id":"A42CC08D-4202-47A7-AB0D-5E39EB2EB34B","title":"Making an Impact Phase 2 - Wiltshire's meteorite comes home","abstractText":"The primary aim is to provide wide public access to the meteorite from Lake House, Wiltshire in a major Museum near to where it was most recently known to have rested. Whilst the meteorite remains in private ownership, this route will ensure that its inspirational value can best be exploited. By virtue of its size and weight (almost 100 kg) it certainly has a wow factor on seeing it for the first time. Coupled with the intriguing - and as yet unfinished - detective trail being followed to find out where it has been for the 30,000 years it has been on Earth, it makes a great talking piece as an introduction to space science, planets and extraterrestrial exploration in general. Because the historic trail is still incomplete, there are opportunities for visitors to assist with our research, a compelling reason for engaging fully with the exhibit and its context. Thus the public display of an important meteorite, which is likely to be confirmed as the largest British meteorite, in a robust and pleasing setting in a museum and geographical location which does not have any such object on show to the public, is a powerful combination: an aim which must be fulfilled. \n\nBy focussing a series of events (including STFC lunar and meteorite loan package) around the opening of the display in Salisbury in September, different audiences will be catered for. Lectures and talks will be aimed at the general public and other professionals such as local archaeologists. \n\nThe Museum will use meteorites as a way of reaching harder to engage audiences, the 14-16 year old students and +16s, age groups which currently have a low take-up of the Museum services. The Learning and Outreach Officer of the Museum has not yet put together the specifics of an education programme but plans to put on special sessions during the two weeks of the STFC sample loan. \n\nThe series of events offers an ideal opportunity for our new research students to gain experience of talking about their research and outreach methods in general.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K002430/1","grantId":"ST/K002430/1","fundValue":"3700","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Judith  Pillinger","coPersons":["Colin Trevor Pillinger"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
