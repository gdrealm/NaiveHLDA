The funds will be used on a series of mini-projects, that are of both strategic importance to EPSRC and to the University of Birmingham. The mini-projects will be used to fund: bridging funding to retain key staff; follow on studies to determine commercial viability; public engagement; collaborative meetings for future multi-disciplinary, international or industry collaborations; pilot projects to determine feasibility of future EPSRC applications.\n\nThe mini-projects will come from the following priority research areas:\n\n1.

This included:\n\n\n\nIn collaboration with Prof. Xiang Zhang's group at University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Antoinette Taylor's group at Los Alamos National Lab, we achieved the first demonstration of handedness switching chiral metamaterials, whose responses to left and right handed circularly polarized terahertz waves can be reversed under optical irradiation. The handedness switching effect can be many orders of magnitudes stronger than that of natural materials, and it was directly observed in the form of reversed circular dichroism and optical rotator dispersion measurements. This result will have broad impact in the areas of optics, material science and fundamental physics, since it offers the opportunity of experimental investigation of many extraordinary phenomena associated with chirality switching, such as switchable negative refraction, as well as important applications in terahertz devices. Benefitting from the strong switching effect in comparison to the natural materials, the handedness switching metamaterials may find important applications in THz circular dichroism spectroscopy where dynamic modulation of the handedness of the circular polarization of the electromagnetic waves is required.\n\n\n\n The result from this project was accepted for publication by Nature Communications (will appear in about 4 weeks). EPSRC is acknowledged in this paper. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlso:\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of what has been done\n\n\n\nExperiments have been carried out to measure the underbody flow characteristics of a model train using the TRAIN Rig - a unique moving model facility that enables model vehicles to be propelled along a 150m long test track at speeds of up to 80m/s. A novel experimental arrangement was used with the train model mounted upside down on the rig with a false ground suspended above it. Pressures on the track surface and velocities in the gap between the train underbody and the track were measured concurrently. This data is now being analysed, specifically to investigate the correlations between underbody pressure and near track velocities. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nKey findings\n\n\n\nNature of correlation of aerodynamic pressure transients and flow velocities in train underbody flow\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPapers\n\n\n\nOne paper for Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit in preparation \n\n\n\n \n\nAlso:\n\n\n\nThe workshop `Probabilistic and analytic methods in Graph Theory' was very successful. There were 42 participants overall, with 12 from overseas. There was a mix of advanced and more junior researchers, with about half of the participants being PhD students or postdocs, mostly from the UK. These benefitted from the talks which described recent progress on major questions in the area.\n\n\n\nThe focussed nature of the workshop allowed for lively interaction between the researchers. In particular, 9 collaborations were initiated or further developed during the workshop (as reported by the participants so far), including: \n\n- Gerke (Royal Holloway) &amp;amp;amp; Pikhurko (Warwick) on random planar graphs;\n\n- Mycroft (Birmingham), Allen (LSE), Boettcher (LSE) &amp;amp;amp; Cooley (Munich) on hypergraph regularity;\n\n- Pikhurko (Warwick) &amp;amp;amp; Kral (Prague) on Quasirandom permutations;\n\n- Hladky (Warwick), Patel (Durham)&amp;amp;amp; Pikhurko (Warwick) on poset limits;\n\n- Allen (LSE), Boettcher (LSE), Han (Sao Paulo) &amp;amp;amp; Person (Berlin) on powers of cycles;\n\n- Piguet (Birmingham), Hladky (Warwick), Taraz (Munich), Boettcher (LSE) on tree packings.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, two significant problems discussed at the problem session have been solved since the conclusion of the workshop. More generally, feedback from the participants was excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso:\n\n\n\nWe have obtained the following research outcomes:\n\nPublications:\n\n1. T. White and S. He. &quot;An Empirical Comparison of Several Recent Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms&quot;. Submitted to Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations Conference (AIAI) 2012.\n\n2. Q.

We have make the software package and source code available online at: http://cs.bham.ac.uk/~szh/software.xhtml\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso:\n\n\n\nWe have initiated a collaboration between Profs Herman Terryn, Johan Deconinck and Annick Hubin of VUB (Brussels), Prof Trevor Rayment (Diamond) and Drs Melanie Britton and Sarah Horswell (Chemistry) and myself concerning electrochemistry in concentrated salt solutions (in relation to corrosion and ionic liquids (in relation to electropolishing and deposition) to be pursued with MRI, synchrotron X-ray methods, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and modelling.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso:\n\n\n\n Employed a research associate who completed simulations for a collaborative project with Dr Anja Geitmann, University of Montreal, and Dr Leah Band, University of Nottingham. A publication entitled &amp;amp;quot; Intracellular dynamics of secretory vesicles in the tips of growing pollen tubes&amp;amp;quot; is currently in preparation, intended for submission to Journal of Theoretical Biology.\n\n\n\nHosted an interdisciplinary meeting to showcase current research at the interface between mathematics, computer science, engineering and plant sciences. Participants from the Schools of Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering and Biosciences from the University of Birmingham, and the Schools of Mathematics, Computer Science, Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering, and the Centre for Plant Integrative Biology from the University of Nottingham. This served to disseminate the range of research applied to plant sciences currently undertaken within the two Universities, as well as spark collaborations within the subfields of image analysis and plant biomechanics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso:\n\n\n\nThe journal paper in preparation is:\n\n \n\nC.

On the basis of the experience gained, the technique is also proposed for use in a major collaborative bid between five or six universities on the development of slab track, which will be submitted to EPSRC in the next few months.)\n\n\n\nAlso:\n\n\n\nThe above mentioned collaborations in graph theory are being acted upon with new research created as a result of these collaborations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso: Collaboration with British Waterways\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso: Exploitation possible on one mini-project arising from two patents submitted Chemicals,Environment,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
