The twin purposes are to provide hard evidence of crime reduction and, by developing procedures and protocols, to boost the generic capacity of designers and crime scientists jointly to create and implement solutions.\n\nA successful pilot study (Grippa 2004-5), funded by AHRB, concept-proofed and tested anti-theft furniture and accessories. Additional evaluative work funded by the police revealed the need to develop procedures for bridging the gap between designers and those who evaluate the impact of Design Against Crime (OAC). To pursue this an interdisciplinary project will be created by a unique collaboration between London-based researchers from the DAC Research Centre at Central Saint Martins, at University of the Arts, and those from the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science, at University College. A major strength of this collaboration is that it brings together teams with internationally renowned reputations, to work on a common set of problems, and to create a strategic partnership. But there is a further ambition. The appointment in June 2005 of Prof Ekblom from the Home Office to the practice-led DAC Research Centre at CSM brings an intention to integrate the diverse practical, methodological and theoretical discourses in design and crime prevention.\n\nDesigners have started applying their skills to prevent crime. However, evaluation issues were not closely addressed in the Design Council Professional Guidance for Crime Prevention, and the associated design case studies provided evidence that was plausible but not 'hard'. Despite the fact that Situational Crime Prevention (SCP) has well-developed methodology no criminological evaluation procedures have been created specifically for DAC. Likewise for manufacturers of security products, demonstrating crime impact has been less important than securing market share.\n\nObtaining hard evidence of effectiveness is important because government crime reduction strategy is evidence-based. Research is needed for proof of principle of DAC at a policy level, and so designers, crime prevention practitioners and consumers can know which methods/makes/models of security product are cost effective in which contexts.\n\nEvidence is important in the design process because impact on crime is the ultimate fitness test for products designed with that function. Crime prevention has been described as an arms race where preventers struggle to keep up with social/ technical change and adaptive criminals. Building the capacity to innovate productively is a long-term strategy reliant on empowerment of designers/crime-preventers to out-innovate offenders. Developing the capacity for impact evaluation of DAC products is part of this empowerment.\n\nOur project will help researchers undertake and utilise research beyond usual academic specialisms and also strengthen the CSM/JDI growing partnership. The intention is to maximise the value of research outcomes by aiming to facilitate/promote dissemination to research/practitioner and policymaking communities; also to the general public. We wish to foster a strong climate of understanding that design should/could be used cost-effectively and acceptably to reduce crime.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D504023/1","grantId":"AH/D504023/1","fundValue":"366060","fundStart":"2006-11-06","fundEnd":"2010-02-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The Grippa clips have been used in exhibitions, demonstrations and websites (incl Design Council Case Studies and guidance) to highlight the contribution of product design to crime prevention.
