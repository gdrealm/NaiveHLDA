This achievement will open the way for the development of truly compact ultrafast optical systems. Our device is a surface-emitting laser, optically pumped using the cheap and rugged technology developed for diode-pumped solid state lasers, with perfect beam quality enforced by an extended cavity. It emits a periodic train of ultrashort pulses at a repetition rate of a few GHz using the optical Stark effect passive mode-locking technique introduced by the Southampton group. Recent proof-of-principle experiments have shown that these lasers can generate stable 260-fs pulse trains. We have shown, moreover, by modelling and by experiment, that the optical Stark mechanism can shorten pulses down to durations around 70 fs, comparable with the quantum well carrier-carrier scattering time. Our proposal is to build on these world-leading results with a systematic exploration of the physics of lasers operating in this regime. The key is to grow quantum well gain and saturable absorber mirror structures in which dispersion, filtering and the placing of the quantum wells under the laser mode are controlled to tight tolerances. We shall achieve this using molecular beam epitaxy to realise structure designs that are developed with the aid of rigorous numerical modelling of the optical Stark pulse-forming mechanism. We shall also use femtosecond pump and probe spectroscopy to determine the dynamical behaviour of our structures in this regime directly. For these pioneering studies, the compressively-strained InGaAs/GaAs quantum well system operating around 1 micron is most suitable; and this is where we shall work; however, the devices that we develop can in principle in future be realised in other material systems in different wavelength regions. We shall also make a first study of incorporating quantum dot gain and absorber material into optical Stark mode-locked lasers, aiming to exploit the intrinsically fast carrier dynamics of these structures. In summary, this proposal aims to shrink femtosecond technology from shoebox-size to credit-card size, and in the process explore a regime of ultrafast semiconductor dynamics that has never before now been exploited to produce light pulses.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G061548/1","grantId":"EP/G061548/1","fundValue":"96402","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  They have stimulated considerable further academic research.

The funding of the Femtosecond Semiconductor Laser grant enabled us to set a world record for the shortest pulse ever emitted by a semiconductor laser, reported in Nature Photonics in December 2009. Subsequent work established a secure understanding of the pulse-forming process in these lasers, based on spectroscopic measurements and numerical simulations supported by this grant. These insights enabled us to define further performance benchmarks, including a new record for the highest peak optical power, in excess of 4 kW, that has been demonstrated to date from any ultrashort pulse semiconductor laser oscillator without subsequent amplification (publication in press). An unforeseen success of the grant was that we were able to demonstrate an ultrashort pulse laser in which, uniquely, the cavity length could be varied by a factor of almost 300% without disrupting the formation of optical pulses. For comparison, the cavity length variation available to conventional femtosecond lasers is more typically around 10%. This result is important because the ultrashort pulse bouncing to and fro inside the laser cavity is essentially the pendulum of a clock that 'ticks' at a highly stable frequency in the microwave spectrum. Our femtosecond semiconductor lasers are thus tunable microwave oscillators of a novel kind, opening new applications in metrology, nonlinear optics and spectroscopy. They operate with ease, moreover, at pulse repetition frequencies in the multi-gigahertz regime, highly desirable for application areas that include metrology, optical and microwave pulse shaping and signal processing, where conventional femtosecond lasers struggle against q-switching instabilities. With this funding we have also been able to investigate pulse repetition frequencies up to 175 GHz (another record) achieved with multiple equally spaced mutually coherent pulses in the laser cavity simultaneously. Femtosecond optical pulse sources underpin optical and microwave metrology, materials processing, biomedical imaging and much else; but commercial femtosecond lasers are currently bulky and expensive systems based on impurity-doped dielectric crystal and glass fibre gain media. One of our aims is to develop miniature all-semiconductor femtosecond lasers, and push their performance towards fundamental limits in the search for disruptive new optical technologies.
