Many retail outlets currently use a system of tagging and detection developed by Checkpoint Systems Inc. for the protection of merchandise. The conventional planar tag is activated by an 8.2 MHz frequency alternating magnetic field applied perpendicular to its plane, rendering it ineffective on metallic surfaces due to eddy current shielding. The new tag is instead activated by an in-plane magnetic field. It will safeguard an important business sector for Crown Packaging UK, a leading manufacturer of metal packaging.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I500219/1","grantId":"EP/I500219/1","fundValue":"100154","fundStart":"2010-09-09","fundEnd":"2011-09-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Hicken","coPersons":["Alastair Paul Hibbins"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
