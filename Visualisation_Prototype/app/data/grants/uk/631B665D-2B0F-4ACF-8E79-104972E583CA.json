{"id":"631B665D-2B0F-4ACF-8E79-104972E583CA","title":"Advancing the Application of Magnetic Resonance in Cancer: Structural, Functional and Molecular Studies of Tumours and","abstractText":"This proposal aims to establish a leading edge 3T magnetic resonance facility to support major\nprogrammes of research in cancer imaging that focus on tumour detection, assessment of\ndisease extent and aggressiveness, and evaluation of new cancer therapies. The proposal will\nbuild on 20 years of experience in applying magnetic resonance to cancer at The Institute of\nCancer Research and the Royal Marsden Hospital enhancing major research programmes\nfunded through Cancer Research UK and through NHS research and development activities.\nThe increased signal available at 3T allows high-resolution images for improved tumour\ndetection, but also enables functional information to be acquired, which may not be possible at\nconventional field strengths. Much of the planned research uses functional images, where the\nbehaviour and characteristics of tumour are measured, in addition to their extent. The higher\nfield strength provides increased sensitivity to signals from MR contrast agents, allowing more\naccurate assessment of tumour blood supply. The water composition and viability of cells within\na tumour will also be assessed more easily and the detailed interrogation of biochemical\npathways will be made possible using multi-nuclear MR spectroscopy. This will enable\nassessment of the action of new anti-cancer drugs on specific processes in cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701533","grantId":"G0701533","fundValue":"615228","fundStart":"2009-10-26","fundEnd":"2012-10-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"  The facility has advanced our methods for small field of view imaging in the prostate and cervix, aiding the identification of higher risk patients and leading to new potential treatment options.\nWe have been able to perform a range of spectroscopy studies, supporting the clinical trial of a new MCT1 inhibitor.\nWe have been able to perform pilot measurements using the new technique of hyperpolarisation in tumour models.\nWe have improved our visualisation of disease in the head and neck and supported a range of innovative head and neck cancer research studies.\nWe have implemented a clinical MR guided HIFU system, commencing clinical evaluation of this promising technique in bone metastases Healthcare Societal","person":"Martin  Leach","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
