{"id":"7DD0C8B7-1626-43B9-9017-9C55CED5774B","title":"GLOBAL - QM-CHINA","abstractText":"The context of the research\n\nAs China is set to be the major source of global economic growth for the next decades, it is clearly essential that the UK is linked into and can benefit both from the excellent research that is being fostered in China (China's engineering research is already in the world top three for impact, for example, and second in Physics, with nearly 20% of world papers), and from the potential for the exploitation and implementation of that research. \nQueen Mary has an outstanding track record of working in collaboration with Chinese partners. Our ability to collaborate successfully with China HEI's is best evidenced in our long-term award-winning partnership with China in teaching providing IET-accredited joint (dual) degree programmes in telecommunications with BUPT, but also through institutional partnerships and research centres, and through numerous individual research collaborations. Our track record of working with industrial partners in China builds on the Innovation China UK (ICUK) programme which was the first UK-China collaboration to promote joint innovation and knowledge transfer. Launched in 2007, the &pound;4.9 million HEFCE and BIS-funded initiative, was led by Queen Mary and with the end of the original funding ICUK has been embedded into Queen Mary's business development unit.\n\nProjects aims and objectives\n\nThe overarching aim of the project is to develop sustainable research collaborations with key and significant Chinese partners. We will build on the strengths of both traditions and of the partner organisations to ensure long-term sustainability through appropriate funding streams, while recognising the significant barriers (both cultural and operational) that exist on both sides. \n\nThe project has two major strands:\n\nThe expansion of strong existing links with the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) into significant research collaborations on wireless, Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, software-defined netwrking, content-aware network infrastructures, and social media, leading to a sustainable laboratory with legal status capable of participating in mainstream Chinese research.\n\nThe development of significant, long-term collaborations in Materials with China, centred on a Sino-British Materials Research Institute to be established in 2012 with Sichuan University (SCU), initially focussing on functional materials, including organic electronics and spintronic materials, computational physics, polymer science, materials chemistry and biomaterials.\n\nKey features of our strategy for long-term engagement with Chinese partners are:\n\n1) a focus on the next generation of research leaders in China, through engagement with postgraduate Chinese researchers;\n2) close engagement of end users, technology community and policy makers in China for developing industry focused applications and influencing technology strategy development for UK;\n3) developing understanding of academic culture and practice in both UK and China for the Chinese and UK academic participants, respectively \n\n\nProjects potential applications and benefits\n\nWe believe that there will be very significant benefits to both academic and non-academic communities (detailed in the 'academic beneficiaries' and 'impact' summaries) in:\n\n1) developing sustainable models for research collaboration with Chinese universities;\n2) developing a deeper understanding of, and solutions to, the cultural and operational barriers to such research collaborations;\n3) significant new outputs in the general areas of telecommunications and materials research;\n4) developing and promoting knowledge transfer opportunities for Queen Mary's and UK research in China.\n\nWe fully expect to apply the approaches we develop through this project to further our collaborations with other key and high quality HEI partners in China.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K004484/1","grantId":"EP/K004484/1","fundValue":"499420","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Developing experience of partnering with China and fostering strong long-term relationships there (primarily in teaching and research), and understanding of potential routes into the Chinese market for the outputs of research (via QM's ICUK: Innovation China-UK). \n- The project involved establishment of a legal entity in China which will allow QM to employ staff in China, and charge research consultancy and contract income in China that might develop from the research collaborations.

A number of events were held in China to link researchers with industry partners and potential government and other public funders who might fund outputs of the research (eg for application in China's 'smart-city' pilot cities.) Joint laboratories in China will allow QM researchers to develop research close to the Chinese market, and moves to jointly supervise PhD students will allow us to continue to work closely together on joint research projects, allowing the UK to capitalise on significant Chinese investment in R&amp;D.
