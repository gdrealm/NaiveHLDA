{"id":"E373293D-BE7B-4D71-8FAE-E128C7AAD5AF","title":"Music Communities","abstractText":"Both scholarly and popular discourse recognise that the production and consumption of music tends to be organised within 'scenes' or 'worlds', and that these are formed of social networks. From the brass band movement of the nineteenth century to the latest virtual 'happening', to participate in a music community is to participate in a network. While network ties may be competitive and antagonistic as well as co-operative, music scholars generally recognise that networks are beneficial for those involved. Art, as Howard Becker famously put it, is collective action. Artists rely upon the contribution of others to make their mark, and the vitality of a musical world is partly a function of the relationships between participants. They may share moral or financial support, or organisational expertise. Musicians in particular may share skills and techniques, collectively determine musical status, and, most importantly, generate new musical ideas through collaboration and exchange of knowledge.\n\nThese observations on music networks overlap significantly with research into social capital. Social capital theorists have consistently found that dense networks foster reciprocity and trustworthiness, facilitating action impossible in their absence. They may also sustain esoteric and specialised cultural forms, by supporting those with interests discouraged in wider society, as is echoed in cultural sociological research on taste. However, this overlap remains largely unnoticed by both music scholars and social capital researchers. We propose to make it explicit, exploring the significance of social networks for music and the arts. We wish to do so, moreover, with specific reference to formal social network analysis (SNA), a methodological approach relatively common in the social capital literature but almost absent in music research. While the term 'network' is often used as a metaphor, and communities described qualitatively, the sociology of music and musicology fields are at a very early stage of applying the mathematically-based techniques of network analysis used in disciplines as diverse as innovation research, security and terrorism studies, and financial regulation. A small number of studies of music have been published, including work on punk scenes by Nick Crossley at the University of Manchester. We wish to contribute further by applying these techniques ourselves, and encouraging their adoption by music and arts scholars more broadly.\n\nSNA has great potential for arts and humanities research. Many music historians recognise the importance of networks, and compile vast data on relationships, particularly with the explosion of online social network data. SNA intersects quantitative, qualitative and computational methods, and allows us to map and analyse musical worlds in precise, systematic ways. Given a list of music scene participants, and their links within the group and to other organisations or resources, SNA generates measures of connectivity: not simply the number of ties each member has, but also measures of their position within the music world, and further measures of the network as a whole. We can then examine questions such as whether originality and movement against the mainstream is sustained amongst a denser, more cohesive community; or whether it is associated with weak links to other worlds and a diversity of social and financial resources. We aim to investigate such questions by examining network data in detail from the following music worlds: classical, punk, folk and jazz, both by analysing data we have already collected on punk, classical and folk scenes, and by collecting further data from directories, discographies, interviews, biographies and journals of record for these scenes and for the international jazz world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J006807/1","grantId":"AH/J006807/1","fundValue":"79991","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Siobhan  McAndrew","coPersons":["Roberta  Comunian","Nick  Crossley","Graham Paul Crow"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
