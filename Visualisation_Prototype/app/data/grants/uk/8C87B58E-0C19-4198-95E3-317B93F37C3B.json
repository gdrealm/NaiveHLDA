However, because used fuel is intensely radioactive, this requires very complex processes. These processes can also be adapted to the separation of high hazard materials from the residual radioactive wastes, to simplify radioactive waste management. However, industrial reprocessing of used fuel primarily relies on a 50 year old solvent extraction process (Purex), which was originally developed for much simpler fuels. As a result, modern fuels can prove difficult to reprocess. We will therefore explore two different approaches to nuclear fuel separation in parallel, one based on the established Purex technology and the other on a much more recent development, ion selective membranes (ISMs). ISMs are porous, chemically reactive membranes which can bind metals from solutions then release them again, depending on conditions, thus allowing highly selective separations.In the solvent extraction system, we will focus on a common problem in solvent extraction, third phase formation, and on separation of a group of long lived, high hazard waste isotopes (the fission product technetium and the minor actinides). With the ISMs, we will first prove their utility in uranium/plutonium separation, then extend these studies to the minor actinides. Throughout, we will work with the elements of interest, rather than analogues or low activity models and in realistic radiation environments. In both strands of the project, we will explore the underlying physical and chemical processes then, building on this understanding, we will develop a series of quantitative models, building from phase behaviour to unit operations and finally to process flowsheet models. We wil use the resulting models to explore different options for fuel reprocessing, based on scenarios defined with our industrial partners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I002855/1","grantId":"EP/I002855/1","fundValue":"683653","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  All researchers associated with this project have gone on to careers in the nuclear sector, an area of critical skills shortage. \nThe work has informed development of the UK Nuclear R&amp;D Roadmap and the work of the UK Government Nuclear R&amp;D Advisory Board Energy,Environment,Security and Diplomacy Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Francis  Livens","coPersons":["Sven Lars Schroeder","Andrew John Masters","Sven Philipp Koehler","Simon Martin Pimblott","Megan  Jobson"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" Through new, interdisciplinary, international research collaborations, this project is exploring two approaches to nuclear fuel separation, one based on established solvent extraction technology and the other on innovative ion selective membranes (ISMs). In solvent extraction, we are focusing on third phase formation and minor actinide separation and, in the ISM studies, we are focusing on minor actinide separation. We emphasise the use of authentic elements of interest, rather than simulants or low activity species, and also behaviour in realistic radiation environments. We are generating molecular-scale data to underpin a hierarchy of phase-behaviour, unit operation and finally integrated flowsheet models for both solvent extraction and membrane-based separations, and are using these models to explore different reprocessing scenarios, developed in conjunction with industry partners. This research will support maintenance of a UK capability in advanced and future nuclear fuel recycling These findings are being exploited through close collaboration with the National Nuclear Laboratory and underpin strategic plans to support critical UK capabilities, currently being made as a result of the Nuclear R&amp;D Advisory Board, chaired by the Government Chief Scientific Adviser Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
