From global changes in the composition of the atmosphere, through the emission of greenhouse gases and aerosols, to more localised land use and land cover (LULC) changes due to an expanding population with an increasing ecological footprint, human activity has a considerable impact on the processes controlling rainfall. This is of particular importance for environmentally vulnerable regions such as many of those in the tropics. Here, widespread poverty, an extensive disease burden and pockets of political instability has resulted in a low resilience and limited adaptative capacity to climate related shocks and stresses. The CALM project has the overarching aims of: (i) furthering our understanding of how the interactions between tropical rainfall and the land surface are represented in the latest climate model simulations from the 5th Climate Modelling Intercomparison Project (CMIP5); and (ii) how these interactions relate to abrupt climate changes such as those which occurred over the Sahara thousands of years ago or, more recently, the prolonged Sahelian drought.\n\nAs recent climate disasters (such as flooding in Pakistan, heat waves in India and droughts in China) demonstrate, society is particularly vulnerable to extremes related to tropical rainfall. The overall objective of this project is to better understand both present day and future tropical rainfall variability and associated controlling processes. In particular, recent work has suggested that the atmosphere-land surface feedback is going to be increasing important for any possible abrupt climate changes, thus this project will focus on model simulations of this process over a location where such changes have already taken place. The research addresses the interconnected themes of water cycle drivers, the water cycle-human interface, society and the changing water cycle, and interactions between water at the land surface and in the sub-surface. \n\nLand use (and related types of land cover) is rapidly changing, as an increasing population migrates to urban areas, large tracts of land are deforested, agriculture is intensified and increasing use is made of groundwater resources through irrigation. These changes influence the climate through the release of greenhouse gases and aerosols and by changing the flows of mass and energy from the surface to the atmosphere. Currently the climate influence of variations in concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols (induced by LULC change) is simulated for the past and projected into the future using bio-geochemical modelling, measurements of changes in atmospheric composition, or by building greenhouse gas emission scenarios driven by different future socio-economic changes. A recent project, CMIP5, has run a number of state-of-the-art climate models using various present-day and future emission scenarios of greenhouse gases, and therefore provides an unprecedented amount of simulated model data. This project aims to compare the data from all of these models, as well as observational, satellite-derived and blended observational-satellite data, to see how the interactions between rainfall and the land surface differs (or agrees) between the models and reality. By following a process-based methodology, which is already well established and widely used in other funded projects, the project will enable a better understanding of how present-day and future rainfall is associated with the surrounding environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J005088/1","grantId":"NE/J005088/1","fundValue":"83777","fundStart":"2011-04-18","fundEnd":"2012-09-17","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Results have been disseminated at the EGU conference to a general academic audience and at focused CMIP5 workshops which included policy users.

Feedback loops involving the land surface and the atmosphere can potentially amplify climate change regionally and it is therefore vital that such processes are correctly represented within detailed computer simulations, the only means of predicting future changes in the regional water cycle. In the CALM project we have quantified these key links between daily precipitation, soil moisture and temperature in the latest climate simulations (CMIP5) and evaluated these against observationally-based datasets. No evidence for positive (amplifying) feedback was identified at the daily-scale although models appear to overestimate the lag between precipitation and soil moisture compared to observationally-based reanalysis simulations. The following mechanisms was proposed: precipitation leads to increased soil moisture which cools temperature over the next few days and reduces the occurrence of precipitation afterwards - a negative feedback. This work is being extended to establish at what time-scale positive feedback becomes important. The research is useful for the Met Office and other modelling centres in evaluating the realism of their computer simulations and products. The work is also of importance in informing government departments and non-govenment organisations into the importance of processes governing regional climate change. \n This work has been widely disseminated internationally at the European Geophysical Union conferences in 2012 and 2013 (both poster and oral presentations) and at focused meetings aimed at researchers and Met Office scientists. This work has also been disseminated at stakeholder meetings, aimed at government departments (DFID), the insurance industry (Zurich) and non-government organisations (Oxfam).
