But an obvious feature of second language use is that it can be perfectly grammatical and very odd, indicating that the learner has grammatical knowledge but does not know about how, when,&nbsp;where words are most naturally used. Performance testing, or judgement exercises, show how well learners recognise what is and isn't grammatical, but it is rare to test how well learners can distinguish the native-like from the unnative-like. </p>\n\n<p>This study proposes to explore the development of this knowledge, and whether it is related to age of first exposure (Critical Period effects); breadth and depth of exposure (acculturation and motivation effects); pattern detection ability and memory (language aptitude effects). Two groups of adult learners of English sharing a first language will be studied: those resident within the UK, and those outside. They will be given a questionnaire about their English learning and use, a grammaticality judgement test, a language aptitude test, and a test of their ability to detect unnative-like selections. Correlation analyses will be run to cast light on which profile features are associated with the development of such knowledge.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2645","grantId":"RES-000-22-2645","fundValue":"43959","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Pauline  Foster","coPersons":[],"organisation":"St Marys University Twickenham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
