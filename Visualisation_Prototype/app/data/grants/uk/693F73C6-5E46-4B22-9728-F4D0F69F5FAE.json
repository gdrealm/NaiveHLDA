In the UK it causes an estimated 1,500 deaths and 74,000 emergency hospital admissions a year in the UK (It is the commonest reason for admission of children to hospital). According to the WHO, it is predicted that, without urgent action, asthma deaths will rise a 20% in the next 10 years in the whole planet. Despise of these facts, asthma has received little research investment, compared to other malignancies, which may be the underlying reason for this unmet clinical challenge.\nIn the proposed project, we intend to contribute to both clinical and basic science at the same time. We bring expertise in the one of the most novel basic fields in research (Dr Tilman Sanchez-Elsner) together with a deep understanding of the disease from the clinical and basic science point of view (Professor Donna E. Davies and Dr Peter Howarth). Our understanding is that asthma has to be studied employing relevant sources of material and this is why we intend to use human samples from asthmatics and non-asthmatics volunteers. This will be done observing the ethical recommendations already in place in our Hospital. The access to this kind of samples will help us unravel a novel and intricate molecular mechanism, under high basic science standards, which has consequences on a clinical problem with obvious social impact as asthma. This molecular mechanism, the role of small RNAs (microRNAs), hasn?t been studied in depth yet in the clinical field, due to its relatively recent discovery (Nobel Prize award in 2006). According to our preliminary data, microRNAs could be behind several symptoms suffered by asthmatics, as the asthmatic inflammation and the fibrotic airway remodelling. This is because microRNAs can act as master switches, controlling more than one process at the same time. If our initial results and our hypothesis are confirmed, we could unveil many unknown aspects that could help find out new therapies and be used to diagnose patients and monitor how they are responding to a given treatment. If successful, the consequences of this study could help improve the control of asthma in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801984","grantId":"G0801984","fundValue":"394928","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tilman  Sanchez-Elsner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
