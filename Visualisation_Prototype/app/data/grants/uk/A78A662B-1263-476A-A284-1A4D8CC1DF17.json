{"id":"A78A662B-1263-476A-A284-1A4D8CC1DF17","title":"Evaluating and Supporting the Reduction of Offending Through Public Value Partnership","abstractText":"<p>This project evaluates and supports Public Value Partnerships that exist between criminal justice agencies and voluntary sector organisations. Against the background of the Offender Management Act 2007 it is clear that developing successful and productive partnerships of this sort will be crucial to ensuring effective offender management, and the subsequent reduction of (re)offending.</p>\n\n<p>The project will embed a researcher within the National Probation Service (Cumbria) and the Cumbria Reducing Offending Partnership (CROP). The researcher will act as a knowledge transfer broker, conducting research that will lead to the development of tools and training material for use by the National Probation Service (Cumbria) and its voluntary sector partners within the Cumbria Reducing Offending Partnership. By combining expertise in ethics, law and systems based methodologies the project will develop tools for evaluating existing partnership relationships. This will involve innovative training needs analysis and process maturity modelling. Subsequently, the project team will identify and publicise a number of case studies which will demonstrate the impact that Public Value Partnerships have had on agencies within the criminal justice system and their voluntary sector partners. These case studies will be used to identify and promote best practice and best value approaches to collaboration and partnership within the criminal justice arena.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-172-25-0050","grantId":"RES-172-25-0050","fundValue":"42646","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Mark Cutter","coPersons":["Alan Cameron Gillies"],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
