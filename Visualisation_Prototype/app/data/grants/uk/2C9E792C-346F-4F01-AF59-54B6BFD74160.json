Even though science has gained a broader understanding of most human diseases, many unanswered questions remain and the genetic basis of the majority of human common diseases and most human traits is only partly understood. \n\nThis project aims to construct a new online tool to help researchers infer the functions of unknown genes as well as identify candidate new players for roles in diseases and in biological processes. This tool will be based on data obtained from the state-of-the-art RNA sequencing technology (RNA-seq). This technology allows researchers to measure the activity of genes in a given sample with greater accuracy than previous methods and is capable of measuring genes that to not encode proteins. A growing number of researchers currently employ RNA-seq, yet many genes associated with diseases and processes have unknown functions, which impedes understanding the mechanisms involved. To address this issue, our proposed tool, entitled GeneFriends, employs a guilt-by-association methodology to the analysis of genes. This approach identifies which genes tend to be activated simultaneously across multiple samples. Based on the idea that genes that are activated at the same time are functionally related, it is possible to predict the functions of previously unstudied genes based on the functions of the known genes they are co-activated with. To determine how genes tend to be co-activated, thousands of publicly available samples of previously measured gene levels using RNA-seq will be combined. This way a map will be generated that describes which genes generally tend to act together. \n\nGeneFriends will allow scientists and clinicians to infer the function of unknown genes. Additionally, GeneFriends can be used to associate new genes with diseases and processes based on the fact that they were active at the same time as other genes previously identified as important for that disease or process. The corresponding tool created in this project will then allow researchers to relate new factors to diseases, identify candidate drug targets, potentially leading to new types of diagnosis and treatments. GeneFriends will be initially created for humans and mice and will be made freely available online for researchers, clinicians and commercial companies to use.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K016741/1","grantId":"BB/K016741/1","fundValue":"94323","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This ongoing project has thus far not had any measurable impact.  ","person":"Joao  De Magalhaes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" In this project, we have expanded GeneFriends, an online database that allows users to identify co-expressed genes with one or more user-defined genes. This expansion entails an RNA-seq-based co-expression map that includes genes and transcripts that are not present in the microarray-based co-expression maps, including over 10,000 non-coding RNAs. The results users obtain from GeneFriends include a co-expression network as well as a summary of the functional enrichment among the co-expressed genes. Novel insights can be gathered from this database for different splice variants and ncRNAs, such as microRNAs and lincRNAs. Furthermore, our updated tool allows candidate transcripts to be linked to diseases and processes using a guilt-by-association approach. GeneFriends is freely available from http://www.GeneFriends.org and can be used to quickly identify and rank candidate targets relevant to the process or disease under study.\n\nA paper describing GeneFriends is currently in press:\n\nvan Dam S, Craig T, de Magalh?es JP (in press) &quot;GeneFriends: A human RNAseq-based gene and transcript co-expression database&quot;.
