{"id":"80EA8B9C-3F57-412A-B5FD-D8084D7144EF","title":"International Initiative in the History of Evolutionary Views of Human Nature","abstractText":"This project takes stock of the emergence, character, scope, and import of contemporary collaborations between scientists and artists found working together in laboratories, studios, and in the field. As a score of exhibitions and installations over the past ten years have testified, these have emerged to both engage public interest in the vital scientific, political, and ethical issues of our day and challenge long held divisions between art and science. These 'hybrid' projects have sought to raise awareness of how we modify and use human and non-human bodies, interact with and change our environment, and conceptualise humanity within the broader cosmos. Our project responds to these developments. \nWe focus on five examples of collaboration spanning, on the one hand, space exploration, computer visualization, landscape ecology, climate change, and biotechnology, and, on the other hand, dance, film, music, sculpture, and painting. At the most basic level, the project uses in depth interviewing and participant observation to determine what the collaborators are producing, why they decided to work together, and what impediments they encountered along the way. But, as ethnographic research into their day-to-day interactions progresses, questions are answered in regard to: what institutional issues had to be faced; what political questions motivated or arose in the effort; and what philosophical currents link the collaborations. And not lastly: what lessons can be learned about how to best link the arts and sciences in educating diverse publics about these critical issues?\n\nIntellectual merit. The work we propose is important for many, if not all, disciplines. Not the least among these is geography, a field that straddles a continuum from the humanities to the natural sciences. Its practitioners are concerned with critical environmental regimes, the role of social and cultural matrices in shaping scientific understandings, and the role of geo technologies in the representations and analyses of the earth's surface. Our work on art-science border crossers probes the very boundaries that comprise this venerable field of study.\nSecond, as a project informed by methods and questions in STS, we contribute new insights to on-going work on the spatial settings of laboratory practices, as well as to the institutional, political, and epistemic contexts within which these take place. We add richness and a comparative angle to these studies by addressing collaborations in the sites of production: field sites, studios, laboratories, museums, and universities. \nThird, scientists across a variety of disciplines - even those not represented in our case study sites (chemistry and optics, among others) - should be interested in the outcomes of our research, particularly insofar as it promises to shed light on new approaches to representing scientific problems, and possibly even new ways to think through them. And fourth, as artists gain insights into a range of scientific problems and tools, as well as an understanding of how scientists in diverse contexts think through the ethical and political import of their work, our research offers them opportunity to reflect on the longstanding divisions between art and science, as well as to consider new avenues of engagement.\n\nBroader Impacts. Our project draws explicit attention to the wider public reception of art-science collaborations. As such, the project will make a substantial contribution toward an understanding of how 'lessons learned' can be transposed to other contexts, thereby developing and realising models for public outreach at different sites. Insofar as the remit of these collaborations entails the advancement of public knowledge about a number of contemporary world-wide crises and discoveries, our in-depth engagements in field sites serve as a study of the development of innovative strategies for the delivery of popular education and knowledge transfer devoted to timely, policy-related issues of the larger public interest. In its final form, this project's outcomes can serve as resources for both researchers and funding agencies seeking to develop new directions in research collaboration. \nOur work addresses how collaboration is currently being re-theorised and negotiated in a handful of highly significant cases. Can a deeper thread running through all these projects be discerned, one that portends a new phase in science-art relations that has the ability to transform the way we train students, organize universities and funding agencies, and disseminate knowledge?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I500014/1","grantId":"AH/I500014/1","fundValue":"757940","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Evolutionary controversies of the nineteenth century continue to be at the centre of public debate. The resources created provide new understandings of the role of evolutionary discussions around the world. Correspondence provides a model in which relations between different religious and cultural groups can be seen in terms of exchange and interaction, rather than as confrontation, and the research carried out in the course of this award has had a profound impact on public understanding of science as a cooperative, collaborative enterprise involving men and women from different backgrounds. Articles based on the work have appeared in the New York Times, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal, Nature, Science, Sunday Telegraph, Guardian and many other periodicals. Professor Secord and other members of the Darwin Correspondence Project staff feature regularly on television and radio programs in many different countries. Among many others, in Britain these have included In Our Time, Women's Hour, the Today Program, Bang Goes the Theory, and The Story of Science. The Project's research is consulted by documentary producers and feature filmmakers, and has served as the basis for several dramas. Resources specifically for use in university teaching and secondary school teaching are already in use, and resources for primary teaching are planned.

These were the crucial years that saw the publication of Darwin's long anticipated books, Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871), and Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). \n\nThree volumes of the award-winning edition of The Correspondence of Charles Darwin (Burkhardt et al. Cambridge University Press, vols. 18-20), covering the years 1870 to 1872, were published, with a fourth volume (vol. 21) delivered to press in May 2013. They contain the complete texts of 2377 letters, representing all known surviving letters that Darwin wrote and received in those years. Letters played a central role in Darwin's research in this period as he expanded his network of correspondents in order to gather information on human behaviour and sexual selection across the globe. Letters also played a crucial part in, and now provide a record of, Darwin's discussion of the implications of his theory for the origins of language and emotional expression, the operation of the moral sense, and the progress of human civilization. \n\nWeb resources make the texts of Darwin's letters, and the scholarly material developed to interpret them, more accessible to a wider audience (http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/). A total of 7537 letter texts are now available online with unrestricted access. Resources include selected letters on the themes of ethics, progress, language, and emotion. Key letters are arranged with explanatory and visual material, and with suggestions for further reading to aid in university course work or independent study. \n\nThe Darwin Correspondence Project organised two international conferences, one on the broad cross-disciplinary theme of Darwin and Human Nature, and one with the Digital History and Philosophy of Science Consortium on the techniques and challenges of making material such as Darwin's correspondence accessible and available in the long term. At the 'Human Nature' conference, scholars in history, history of science, philosophy, English literature, and gender studies explored the legacy of Darwinian frameworks of the 'human' today. Other collaborations have linked Darwin's work on emotional expression to current research in neuroscience, autism, and the development of artificial intelligence. \n\nA mentoring program was established to train early career researchers in the skills of teamwork and careful scholarship essential to modern research in both the humanities and the sciences, for the creation of web-based educational resources, and the preparation of texts to publication standard. \n\nThe simultaneous publication on both the Project's website and the Cambridge Digital Library site of the texts of a significant body of letters together with images of the originals, and contextual notes, is part of a strategic initiative to provide a long-term, publicly accessible, institutional repository for Darwin's correspondence and associated research. By making possible a definitive edition of Charles Darwin's correspondence about human nature and descent, the AHRC grant has provided the foundations for future scholarship in this very active field. The letter texts, available both online for free and in print, will encourage new work on a key episode of intellectual, cultural and scientific history. They open up key insights for a range of scholarly work that is likely to extend over many decades. Work by the Project team has opened up new horizons particularly in the study of science and gender, where Darwin's correspondence is especially revealing. It has also been important in the growing interest in science and empire and global studies of science, as the correspondence's international character invites questions about communication, circulation and exchange. Finally, the correspondence is proving a key resource for studies of the emotions in relation to science, a topic of great interest to historians, psychologists and the public at large.
