{"id":"59CE500F-4324-41F9-BCA1-BEA9957FA219","title":"Information-Rich Photon Imaging of Cells","abstractText":"Cells and tissue are complex materials whose heterogeneity and dynamic changes are principally driven at the micron and sub-micron size scales, with underlying events ranging upwards from microsecond time scales, and measurement also based upon faster photo-electronic events of molecules (eg fluorescent and Raman emission from picosecond to nanosecond timescales). Advances in high energy physics and space research have made possible a fast photon imaging detector with &gt;1000 channels each measuring individual photon arrivals to picosecond temporal sensitivity. We aim to develop and use this imaging detector to capture the high spatial and temporal complexity of cells and tissue. In particular, our objectives concern maximising the photon information available to unravel complex multi-component signals, including within background noise, below the visibility of present measurement and automated platforms, which underlie challenges in quantitative imaging and bioassays of live cells and tissue.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E002846/1","grantId":"BB/E002846/1","fundValue":"328168","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The photon correlation image analysis software developed has been made available to researchers.\nAn array detector and associated electronics for photon correlation suitable for capturing such image data has been developed into a beta testing product by Photek, collaborating in the wider project with CERN and the University of Leicester.

The arrival times of the individual photons contributing to the light intensities in each pixel are now also seen to analyse the movement and photon emission cycle time of particles or molecules within the pixel. The photon correlation image analysis software is available for use in confocal microscopy and multi-photon biomaging. \nA photon counting detector array developed by collaborators to detect arrival times of single photons is now available from Photek as a beta test product.\nThe ability to detect the arrival times of multiple photons at each pixel would improve on the speed and information available from such detectors.
