This was given, in recognition of ISVR's outstandingachievements as Europe's leading centre for research, teaching, andconsultancy in sound and vibration, and for broader contributions to businessand the wider community. To commemorate this event, the ISVR has set up anannual invited `Queen's Anniversary Prize' lecture series in the areas ofparticular interest to the institute. The first lecture in 2006 will be givenby Professor Philip J Morris from Penn State University on September19th. We have planned to hold a workshop on the 20th September, to follow the `Queens Anniversary Prize' lecture. This will providea forum for the discussion of key issues specifically related to aircraft jetnoise and fan-broadband noise. The objective of this workshop will be toassess the current and future prospects for accurate modelling, computationand prediction of broadband noise. We hope to attract a significant group ofleading researchers from the UK, Europe, and North America to participate inthis discussion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E033709/1","grantId":"EP/E033709/1","fundValue":"12267","fundStart":"2006-10-23","fundEnd":"2007-01-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Phillip  Joseph","coPersons":["Anurag  Agarwal","Rodney Harold Self","R  Astley"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
