This will combine the functionalities of a high-efficiency cooking stove, an electricity generator and a refrigerator (cool box), referred to as SCORE, and may be fuelled by burning a range of biomass products. The partnership brings together four UK universities, a leading US research centre (Los Alamos National Laboratory), a multi-national electrical goods manufacturer (GP Acoustics), an international charitable organisation (Practical Action), and numerous universities in Africa and Asia. It will also collaborate to ensure that the devices are acceptable at a technological, economic and social level and that there is sufficient scope for the communities to develop numerous businesses from the manufacture, repair and innovative applications of SCORE.The operation of the electricity generating and refrigerator parts of the proposed device will be based on a novel application of thermoacoustic processes. Fundamentally, these rely on the interaction between an acoustic field and solid boundaries, leading to a range of fluid- and thermo-dynamic processes, which do not require harmful working fluids or moving parts in the traditional sense; the electrical power extraction is accomplished by a linear alternator.The concept of the device is based on the proven thermoacoustic Stirling engines and refrigerators developed by Los Alamos, NASA and the US military for applications including: cooling of satellite systems and radar arrays, gas liquefaction and cryogenics, use of waste heat for air conditioning, separation of binary gas mixtures and many others. There is a significant level of innovation in the proposed work in three respects: 1) research into the combination of the thermoacoustic engine, linear alternator and cool box in a single device, powered by a biomass stove, which has not been attempted before,2) design of a rugged and inexpensive linear alternator that could be easily mass-produced, 3) the overall system design from the viewpoint of low cost, application of indigenous materials, use of local manufacturing skills and simplicity of assembly, which are major research issues compared to the high-cost and high-tech thermoacoustic systems produced so far. These challenges form the backbone of the proposed scientific and technological work programme.Within the overall 5-year duration, there will be two stages to this project: the first 3 years will mainly focus on conducting the necessary social and scientific research, while the last 2 years will broadly focus on technology hand-over, including representative field trials and a wide dissemination among target communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E04462X/1","grantId":"EP/E04462X/1","fundValue":"300073","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Lawn","coPersons":["Theodosios  Alexander"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" This was part of a collaborative project with the Universities of Nottingham and Manchester, City University, Los Alamos National Laboratories and the charity, Practical Action. The objective was to develop a special kind of electricity generator that would be cheap to purchase and maintain and could utilize the heat of a wood-burning stove during the cooking process. The generator, which is a 'linear alternator', is driven by a 'thermoacoustic' engine in which a small fraction of the flow of thermal energy from the surfaces heated by the burning wood to a heat sink is converted to high-intensity sound waves. These acoustic waves drive the diaphragm of a linear alternator that vibrates a coil within a magnetic field and produces the electricity.\n\n\n\nSeveral prototype arrangements of a looped-tube engine in which the acoustic energy is circulated and fed back to the regenerator to be amplified have been built and examined in the laboratory, using a methane-burner as the heat-source. These loops were not pressurised and the principle that there were no moving parts, other than the diaphragm, was upheld by having a water-cooled heat exchanger that was cooled by the natural circulation of water in a drum. This provided hot water, which could be used for space-heating and cooking. To minimize costs, the hot-end heat exchanger was purely radiative, through a plate forming the top of the combustion chamber.\n\n\n\nThe maximum power generated on this equipment was only 9.6 W, considerably less than the target. However, a great deal of fundamental data has been acquired and incorporated in a calculation procedure for the performance of the whole loop. The performance is very sensitive to a number of acoustic parameters, and possible means of constructing an improved loop have been identified. Alternative routes to achieving a viable design have been pursued by two of the other collaborators in the Project. A network of academic partners in target countries has been established by the Project Director. It is hoped that they will be able to promote the SCORE device in those countries. Possible industrial suppliers have also been identified and may contribute when the device has been satisfactorily demonstrated in the laboratory. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
