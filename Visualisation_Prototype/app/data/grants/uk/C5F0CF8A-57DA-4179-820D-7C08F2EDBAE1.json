{"id":"C5F0CF8A-57DA-4179-820D-7C08F2EDBAE1","title":"Long-term effects of divorce legislation on children","abstractText":"<p>A growing number of marriages across Europe since 1960’s have ended in divorce (OECD, 2005). While economic literature on divorce has largely focused on the adult consequences, many researchers and policy makers worry that the high divorce rates result in negative consequences for children. </p> \n<p>The causal effect of divorce is estimated in a quasi-experimental setting where comparison is made between adult outcomes of individuals who were raised in an environment where divorce was banned versus allowed under no-fault grounds. This accounts for the possibility that the divorced and intact families might have been different in ways that might have affected the likelihood of divorce and hence biasing estimates that account only for observable factors such as family size. Specifically, outcomes of interest include marital status, fertility, education and labour supply of individuals whose parents divorced during their childhood. This research exploits the fact that divorce was introduced at different times in four European countries who share a similar catholic background.</p> \n<p>The results of this research are valuable, not only to academics and policy makers, but also to the general public who are concerned about the future of Europe – its children – and how to improve their chances of success in life.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2210","grantId":"RES-000-22-2210","fundValue":"74354","fundStart":"2007-02-12","fundEnd":"2008-09-11","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tarja Kyllikki Viitanen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
