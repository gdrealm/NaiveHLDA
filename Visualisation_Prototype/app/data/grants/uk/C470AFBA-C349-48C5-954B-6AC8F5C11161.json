The project will do this via i) increasing Level 1 sociology teaching staff’s familiarity with QM to support ii) integrating substantive and QM teaching across the Level 1 programme.

An interactive online tool, to reinforce the messages from the 'traditional' lectures and seminars, incorporating revision notes, worked examples, definitions of key terms, revision questions and 'quizzes' (at different levels of difficulty), data sets and a range of other resources including relevant readings and videos was developed. \n\n\n\nStudent views on learning QM and substantive sociology: Whilst it is generally accepted that sociology students have limited skills in mathematics, little interest in QM and are fearful of learning it, we found mixed results. Whilst minorities of students were highly positive and confident or negative and lacking in confidence, most students exhibited what might be best termed as 'ambivalence' towards QM. Students do see the potential value of QM, most clearly for their careers. However, most were not looking forward to studying QM, probably would not have selected it and do not seem to see their future careers in jobs that call for QMs.\n\n\n\nStudents understanding of the interaction between sociology and QM: Students did not on the whole see a strong interaction between substantive sociology and QM. The overriding message was that students saw the substantive and QM modules as quite separate and distinct. However, our students differed in the extent to which links between substantive sociology and QM were made, the strength and nature of these links and the role of our teaching practices within that. Whilst we cannot 'know' whether students were better able to see the links after being exposed to the project do know that the perception persisted that QM and substantive sociology were somewhat distinct.\n\n\n\nStudent views of the online resources: The online tool was well used (generating 1662 hits) and the students reported it to be useful in terms functionality, looks and the nature and depth of the content assembled. We found that the students used the website in 'instrumental' ways. They used it when they were directed to in seminars; as an aid to revision and course work; and as a repository for lecture notes. They differed in respect to how useful the tool was in meeting these objectives. \n\n\n\nImplications and recommendations: Our findings suggest that (i) Online resources need to account for a range of abilities (ii) The level of feedback given to students on their use of the online tool needs to be considered early on (iii) raising awareness and exposure to the online tools and what they offer in terms of breadth and depth of content might help students move from using the tools in simply instrumental ways (iv) online tool might well be used to support 'learning through doing' (v) Promoting the use of QM - or research methods more generally - in forms of assessment might well help to bridge the gap which remains when fundamentally QM and substantive courses are taught separately. This would be facilitated by making available datasets that students can use and which are linked to the substantive topics, as we did in this project. As a project that focused on raising capacity for university students, it is difficult to see that the outputs of this project would be easily extrapolated into non-academic contexts. \n\n\n\nIn this sense our 'users' are those teaching QM in the university sector and students themselves. We hope that we have added to the evidence base about teaching QM in universities, on which others can draw. We also hope that the outputs of the project will be widely used within the university sector. This is especially so of the web resources that we have made available. These are readily transferable into university settings, are available and are easy to use. We believe then that the project has raised capacity for teaching QM by bringing together resources in new and innovative ways. In this sense the project outputs will help the university sector meet the challenge of raising the technical skills of students. \n\n\n\nAs a consequence of development in QM teaching, such as our own project, we hope that more students will have the skills, courage and enthusiasm to apply for jobs in the QM sector, go on to post graduate study in quantitative programmes or otherwise use their skills to fill positions in the job market. As governments seek solutions to the social and economic challenges of the day, specialist QM knowledge becomes ever more valuable. Through adding to the evidence base and providing resources aimed at developing the QM skills of undergraduate students we hope that sociology students will be able to understand and ultimately respond to these challenges. \n\n\n\n\n A primary aim was for others to learn from our experiences and we plan for our findings to have impact within the field of teaching QM and sociology and the fields of blended learning and the use of technology in higher education teaching. We hope in short that we will modestly advance pedagogical understanding of innovation in teaching QM. In so doing we will disseminate information of practical interest to teachers in respect to the operation of the initiative. We would also hope to contribute to and inform theoretical debates about teaching in higher education. We have concentrated on two areas to achieve this. First, we have made available our primary project outputs. Our website is available for others working in the field to utilise in their teaching. Second, we have publicized the outputs and outcomes of the project in a number of ways. We held a seminar on 5th September 2013 to disseminate findings and encourage debate and exchange of information between interested parties. We have submitted one paper describing the theoretical background, implementation and outcomes of the project to the scholarly journal 'Enhancing Learning in the Social Sciences'. We are further contributing to events which seek to highlight innovation in teaching. For example, we are presented our findings at 'Surrey ExciTeS 2014' an event to highlight innovation in teaching within the University of Surrey community. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
