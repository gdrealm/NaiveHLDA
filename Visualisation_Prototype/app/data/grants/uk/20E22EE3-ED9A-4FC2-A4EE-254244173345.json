Working closely with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and world-leading research institutions in North America and mainland Europe, the project will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Synthesise existing evidence on barriers and enablers affecting the implementation of Animal Health and Welfare (AHW) best practice</li>\n\n <li>Identify and examine successful examples of best practice co-production, communication and adoption (including state-sponsored advice, private advisory agencies and extension services) focussing on transferrable lessons from other sectors, international case studies and specific examples from individual livestock sectors in the UK&nbsp;</li>\n\n <li>Undertake a programme of empirical work to 'follow' the chain of best practice from the issuer of guidance/regulation (public, private or third sector organisation), via key actors in the information supply chain, to individual on-farm practice. Bovine tuberculosis will be used as the focus for the research</li>\n\n <li>Communicate the findings to a wide range of stakeholders in government and the farming industry, informing policy and practical interventions to enhance AHW management.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009753/1","grantId":"ES/K009753/1","fundValue":"248107","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ruth  Little","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
