As the seaweed aquaculture industry grows exponentially worldwide, their economic importance is increasing rapidly. In the UK and other Western countries, algae are being considered as a potential sustainable biofuel source. The development of experimental aquaculture facilities is currently attracting considerable investment in the context of the ongoing transition towards a low carbon economy. \nLike any other living organism, brown algae are plagued by diseases caused by fungi, bacteria or viruses. Among them, Eurychasma dicksonii - the parasite that I am studying - is very common and widespread. However, very little is known about its biology, or indeed the biology of similar algal pathogens. This lack of information hampers our capacity to comprehend the impact of diseases in natural algal populations, and more broadly, on marine ecosystem functioning. Additionally, the interplay between natural populations, crops and their pathogens, which are central to the design of management policies concerning any agricultural production, remain entirely unknown for marine seaweeds. \nFor these reasons, I have developed a laboratory model between Eurychasma and the filamentous brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus, which I suggest to use in GenoMAP to help tackle these questions.\n\nPATHOGENICITY AND IMMUNITY, THE YIN AND YANG OF DISEASE\nIn GenoMAP, I propose to apply cutting-edge genomics techniques to identify the gene repertoire of Eurychasma and elucidate the molecular basis of its pathogenicity. Since Eurychasma is also related to many other pathogens that have a devastating effect in agriculture (e.g. potato blight, grape mildew), aquaculture (fish saprolegniosis, crayfish plague), and on natural populations (sudden oak death), a cross-species comparative genomic analysis will have wide-ranging implications for understanding the biology and evolution of this group of pathogens (so-called oomycetes). \nSecondly, I propose to conduct a large scale transcriptomic experiment to follow the expression of Ectocarpus and Eurychasma genes in infected disease-susceptible and disease resistant algal strains. This will give us information on the molecular basis of disease resistance in the brown alga Ectocarpus, whilst also shedding light on the strategies used by Eurychasma to defeat the immune system of its host. Indeed, and although not always successful, algae actually do have an immune system and try to defend themselves against pathogens. My results so far show that some of them indeed resist Eurychasma infection attempts by inducing the early death of infected cells, which prevents reproduction of the pathogen and subsequently, the spread of infection. \nFinally, this dataset will provide a first insight on the natural variation between disease-susceptible and disease-resistant algal strains. In particular, In particular, I will investigate the variation in the so-called LRR-ROCO and NB-ARC-TPR gene families. Both display striking structural and evolutionary features that make them excellent candidates for being involved in pathogen perception. \n\nOverall, GenoMAP will help us understand some of the fundamental biological mechanisms underpinning algal-host pathogen interactions. In the future, this new knowledge will be invaluable to address ecologically-relevant questions from a position of strength and novelty. Thus, in conjunction with ongoing parallel work, GenoMAP will go one step further towards the development of new evidence-based concepts on the fundamental - yet largely overlooked - impact of eukaryotic algal pathogens in marine ecosystems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J00460X/1","grantId":"NE/J00460X/1","fundValue":"62304","fundStart":"2011-09-06","fundEnd":"2015-03-05","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  At present, and in line with the strong blue-sky emphasis of this grant, our finding are being used as a support to further research work.
