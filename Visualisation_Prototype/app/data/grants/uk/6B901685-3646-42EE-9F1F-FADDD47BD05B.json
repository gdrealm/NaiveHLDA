{"id":"6B901685-3646-42EE-9F1F-FADDD47BD05B","title":"Colposuspension or TVT with anterior repair for urinary incontinence and prolapse: a pilot study","abstractText":"Almost half of women over 40 suffer with bladder weakness (incontinence of urine). Incontinence is a miserable condition, and many women suffer in silence for many years, unable to take exercise, or enjoy a full social life. The cost of pads is very expensive. Half of women with incontinence can be treated with a surgical operation. The established operations for bladder weakness in women are called colposuspension and TVT. Colposuspension is a major operation requiring general anaesthesia. TVT is a newer operation which can be done under local anaesthetic, and as a day case. It is as effective as a colposuspension in the first 5 years, but has the benefits of a more rapid return to work and full activity. It is also less expensive for the Health Service.\nSome women have prolapse (dropping) of the vagina as well as bladder weakness, and we are not sure of the best way to treat women with both problems. A colposuspension will treat both conditions, but some surgeons offer TVT together with surgery to repair the prolapse as an alternative treatment. There is no good evidence that this is an effective thing to do. We wish to compare these two options (colposuspension and TVT with prolapse repair) in a trial. At the moment, we need more information on whether such a trial can be completed in a reasonable time, and whether women will agree to take part. We also need some early information on how successful each treatment will be. This application is to support a pilot study to obtain that information. We will treat all the women with incontinence and prolapse who we see in one year, and follow them for one year to collect information on the success of each operation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500251","grantId":"G0500251","fundValue":"129792","fundStart":"2006-01-04","fundEnd":"2009-01-03","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Douglas Gordon Tincello","coPersons":["Christopher John Mayne","D  Taylor","David  Jones","Mark  Slack","Philip Milton Toozs-Hobson"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
