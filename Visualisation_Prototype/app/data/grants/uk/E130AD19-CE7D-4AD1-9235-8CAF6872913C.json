Flowers are excellent systems to address this question since they are tremendously diverse, and one of the best examples of co-evolution, shaped by interplay between plants and pollinators. Indeed, understanding the underlying mechanisms that create diverse flower morphologies has a big potential impact on our ability to improve/restrict pollination, to alter crops and to sustain important biodiversity into the future. Diverse flower forms can be categorized as either radial (actinomorphic) or bilateral (zygomorphic). A radial flower has more than one plane of symmetry, whereas a bilateral flower has a single plane of symmetry. This floral zygomorphy is one of the key innovations for specialized flower-pollinator interactions, which has led to a rapid plant species radiation. The Asteraceae family (sunflower family, Compositea) is one of the largest flowering plant families and one of the most economically important crops and weeds. The evolutionary success of the Asteraceae family is mainly due to its flower head (capitulum), a key trait that defines the Asteraceae family taxonomically. Even though the flower head resembles a solitary flower, it is in fact an inflorescence with many small flowers (florets). The most common flower head form has marginal ray florets (bilateral) and a central dome of disc florets (radial). The mechanism that determines distinct symmetries of these two floret forms within a single flower head remains unclear. The aim of the project is to elucidate the underlying genetic mechanism(s) that establish the two floral symmetries within a single flower head and to identify and characterize novel genetic components which establish the position and identity of florets. For this study, Senecio vulgaris, an Asteraceae species, in which we have developed an easy transformation system, has been chosen. To understand the mechanism establishing the distinct floret symmetries, expression and functional analyses of the key regulators will be performed. We will determine genetic interactions and protein-protein interactions among these key regulators to understand the regulatory interactions among these regulators. To identify novel genetic components controlling the position and the identity of florets, we will generate and screen a GUS enhancer line collection and a T-DNA activation tagging line collection in S. vulgaris. This project will provide the first insight into the molecular mechanism of flower head pattern formation and its role in evolution, and, in particular, the parallel evolution of analogous structures (flower head vs. solitary flower). This will make a significant contribution to our understanding of how a complex form evolves and how the pre-existing genetic pathway is reinvented in the process. This project also includes developing GUS enhancer lines and T-DNA activation tagging lines in an Asteraceae model system. This will have enormous potential impact on plant research and agriculture (e.g., crop yield/quality and environmental sustainability). The Asteraceae family is one of the most economically important plant families (it includes lettuce and sunflower). However, the major limitation for Asteraceae research species has been the lack of feasible genetic tools for functional analysis. This availability of the transformation method in S. vulgaris provides a genuine and exciting opportunity to study S. vulgaris as an attractive Asteraceae model system, and to explore biological questions unique to Asteraceae and to broaden our knowledge to broader spectrum of species. It will allow us to study the economically important trait and genes in Asteraceae, which will improve crop yield and production of industrial biochemicals and medicinal chemicals from Asteraceae.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I012982/1","grantId":"BB/I012982/1","fundValue":"367109","fundStart":"2012-01-03","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  the grant is not terminated and it is too soon to comment on this.
