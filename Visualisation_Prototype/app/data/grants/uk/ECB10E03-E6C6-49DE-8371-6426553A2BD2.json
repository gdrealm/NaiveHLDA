{"id":"ECB10E03-E6C6-49DE-8371-6426553A2BD2","title":"Short-term Visitors Programme for Astrophysical Research at the University of Exeter","abstractText":"There are two groups at the University of Exeter that conduct astrophysical research, the Astrophysics Group in the School of Physics and the Centre for Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics (CGAFD) within the School of Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics. The primary areas of research of the Astrophysics Group are star formation, one of the current priority areas for astronomical research in the UK, planet formation, and exoplanets. CGAFD conducts research into astrophysical fluid dynamics, in particular dynamo theory and planetary atmospheres. Research on exoplanets provides a clear link between the groups. Together, these groups collaborate with many researchers both across the UK and overseas. However, Exeter is relatively geographically isolated. In order that these collaborations continue to flourish and that new links be formed it is essential that a short-term visitors programme be maintained at Exeter. This grant application is intended to fund our visitors programme over the next three years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G001812/1","grantId":"ST/G001812/1","fundValue":"23506","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Findings were published in refereed journal papers.
