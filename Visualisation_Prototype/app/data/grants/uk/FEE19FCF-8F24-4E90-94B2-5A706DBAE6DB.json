{"id":"FEE19FCF-8F24-4E90-94B2-5A706DBAE6DB","title":"The Other Side of Proportionality: the Problem with a 'Suspect Classifications' Approach to Justifying Discrimination","abstractText":"This project seeks to expose the inadequacy of a 'suspect classifications' approach to justifying discriminatory acts or measures under Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and to propose an approach that is more effective, robust, and consistent with the requirements of Article 14. 'Suspect classifications' is a phrase developed by the United States Supreme Court in its jurisprudence under the Equal Protection Clause of the 141 Amendment to the USConstitution--the provision that guarantees the 'equal protection of the laws' in the US--to refer to a process of standardising the degree to which challenged measures or acts must advance legitimate state aims to justify discrimination on specific grounds. The UK House of Lords in R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, [2005] UKHL 37, has recently signaled its inclination to adopt this approach in justifying discrimination under Article 14. This research project will evaluate UK and Strasbourg treatment of Article 14 justification, in light of comparisons to US Equal Protection Clause decisions and the application of justification defenses under UK and European Community anti&shy; discrimination legislation, to demonstrate the unsuitability of this model not only for Article 14 cases, but for the justification of discrimination in general. This research will produce a series of three articles comprising a critique of the emerging approach, a proposed alternative model for assessing the extent of a challenged measure's discriminatory impact, and an illustration of how this model would apply to control the use of racial and religious profiling in counter-terrorism efforts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E505309/1","grantId":"AH/E505309/1","fundValue":"17994","fundStart":"2007-01-22","fundEnd":"2007-04-21","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Aaron  Baker","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
