{"id":"0D8CD768-01A9-4CD2-9EF6-787ED9966CC2","title":"Behaviour Change and Psychological Governance","abstractText":"<p>Drawing on insights from research disciplines such as behavioural economics, neuroscience and psychology, ‘Behaviour Change’ policies have been the subject of much media commentary, exploring charges of the 'nanny state' and psychological manipulation.</p>\n\n<p>This seminar series investigates the uses of psychology in techniques of governing, providing a forum for researchers to consider the effects of psychological forms of governance on national populations and specific social groups. Potential alternatives to Behaviour Change informed by participatory, observational or interpretive social science methods will be elaborated as a rejoinder to economistic or behavioural science approaches.</p>\n\n<p>The seminars will develop new approaches to evaluating the Behaviour Change agenda in its wider context - in relation to how our cultural ideas about the brain, mind, behaviour and self are changing. International and UK based academic participants at a range of career stages from political science, social policy, critical psychology, critical neuroscience, philosophy and human geography will engage with non-academic policy makers and practitioners working on various Behaviour Change initiatives. They will identify the practical, political and research challenges posed by the current policy enthusiasm for particular branches of positive psychology, wellbeing, happiness, flourishing and 'mindfulness'.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000296/1","grantId":"ES/L000296/1","fundValue":"23870","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2015-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings of this seminar series are research seminars.

The research has engaged an international and interdisciplinary audience on the topics of behavioural change and psychological governance. The findings may be used to encourage public dialogue, critique existing forms of governance and develop alternative perspectives on the applications and uses of neuroscience and behavioural science in public policy and beyond.
