MP (1829 1900), who exerted a remarkable influence over national and international affairs. He was renowned for his revolutionary republicanism, his uncompromising defense of Irish nationalism and Home Rule, and his controversial opposition to Gladstone's imperial policies. He was a charismatic leader who wielded a powerful hold over the loyalties and affections of the Tyneside electorate; even after he was deselected by his local party they overwhelmingly supported his return to parliament as an independent member. On the international stage he was actively engaged in the American Civil War, Italian unification, and Polish and Hungarian liberation. These campaigns were personalised through his close friendship with Garibaldi, Mazzini, Kossuth and other prominent republicans. His powerbase was uniquely strengthened by his press empire. His newspapers attained a global distribution which served to anchor his local hegemony and enhance his profile in the United States and Europe.\n\nA study of Cowen's life and political career will advance the wider understanding of those who espoused radical beliefs and their working relationship 'other members of the Liberal Party. Although many studies of nineteenth century Liberal politics have been produced, significant gaps in our k, knowledge remain, particularly in the realm of regional politics. Equally, British radicalism has attracted a good deal of scholarly interest, particularly in the last decade or so when important new research was undertaken. Some of this work was biographical but has tended to focus upon the Chartist generation of radicals. Rather less is known about those activists, such as Cowen, whose political ideas were informed by late Chartism but who exerted their greatest influence during the Gladstonian era. Alone among comparable nineteenth century radicals Cowen has no substantial Presence in the historiography. The two biographies that were written in his lifetime were heroic accounts that lacked the requisite objectivity. A more recent biography suffers from the same emotional subjectivity and, while the author makes a valuable contribution to our knowledge of local radicalism, his treatment of Liberal party politics lacks depth and rigour. The proposed biography adopts an altogether more critical stance which will expose the many weaknesses and ambiguities in his character, particularly his Russophobia and later slide into imperialism.\nJoseph Cowen left behind a formidable collection of nineteenth century letters and documents which provide rare insights into the world of nineteenth century popular politics at home and abroad. Studied in conjunction with other important British political collections and relevant papers held in international archives, the intricate relationship between the various factions within the Gladstonian Liberal Party can be more perfectly evaluated. In addition, collections of Cowen's own newspapers will be exhaustively scrutinized alongside other regional and national journals to contribute to the wider understanding of the role of the press in brokering and sustaining nineteenth century political affiliations. Cowen's politics will be analysed comparatively with reference to other centres of radical activity, contemporary politicians and other proprietors of provincial newspapers. The emergence of an independent Irish nationalist press after 1884, published in Newcastle and circulated nationally, represents an untapped source for scrutinizing the Home Rule campaign which galvanlsed Cowen during the 1870s and 1880s, and later divided the Liberal party. The relative demise of radicalism on Tyneside after Cowen's retirement after 1886 will be explained in terms of the newfound independence of the large Irish minority whose political support for the Liberal Party thereafter became negotiable rather than automatic.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D501008/1","grantId":"AH/D501008/1","fundValue":"23103","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Joan  Allen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
