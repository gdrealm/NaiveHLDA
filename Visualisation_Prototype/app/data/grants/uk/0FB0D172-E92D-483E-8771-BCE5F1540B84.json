Watts and transformations in late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century sculpture","abstractText":"Recent research confirms Watts's importance to Victorian painting. His lesser sculptural production remains marginalised. My project will examine the sculpture's unique but undervalued position in British art. Developing independently-conceived public monuments and non-naturalistic form/ surface, Watts's sculpture rejected contemporary norms. I advance new evidence and arguments explaining his unconventional approach, epitomised by Physical Energy- a colossal un-commissioned monument of contested ideological and aesthetic\nidentity, sited in three locations- including Kensington Gardens.(1907).A single-authored book, exhibition and other projected outputs will examine this work in detail, relating it to current issues in public sculpture and the problematic status of monuments in a multi-cultural context.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113135/1","grantId":"113135/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-28","fundEnd":"2006-05-27","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephanie  Brown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
