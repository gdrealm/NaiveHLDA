However, while this change has been widely documented in the literature our knowledge of it remains sketchy. Little is known about why employers are making increased use of agency contracts. There are also questions regarding the costs and benefits (both direct and indirect) of agency working for public services. Finally is the issue of how public employers are responding to change and what (if any) policies have been introduced? </p>\n\n<p>This research addresses these questions focusing on the role of agencies in two key areas of the English public sector: the National Health Service (NHS) and local authority run social services. Phase one will involve interviews with representatives of peak organisations, including unions, professional associations and management in health and social care. Information obtained will then inform phase two: a series of more structured interviews with senior managers responsible for human resources in acute hospital trusts and local authorities. The final phase involves more detailed comparative case studies of two local authorities responsible for social services and two health trusts. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2000","grantId":"RES-000-22-2000","fundValue":"67866","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Kirkpatrick","coPersons":["Alex  De Ruyter","Kim  Hoque","Chris Martin Lonsdale"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
