By understanding how global temperatures and levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere have naturally fluctuated throughout the earth's history, and the interaction with living organisms, we can take important steps towards predicting the changes that may lie ahead. It is undoubtedly a complex puzzle and there are many ways of trying to solve it. \n \nMy part of the story involves deep-sea sponges and silicon, the chemical element they use to build their glass-like opal skeletons. Sponge skeletons, or spicules, are helping me to piece together the links between the supply of vital nutrients in different parts of the ocean and the crucial role other marine organisms play in absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and locking it away in deep sea sediments as organic carbon. \nMarine sponges are one of the simplest groups of animals, living on the seafloor and feeding by filtering particles from seawater. They themselves don't play a central role in changing climates, but they do share a common need for silicon with another group of marine inhabitants that we think are vitally important to the global climate. Diatoms, a type of microscopic marine algae that live and photosynthesise at the sea surface, are responsible for sequestering nearly half the CO2 that is converted into organic carbon and sinks to the seafloor. By investigating sponges I can learn a lot about the changing availability of silicon that also makes life possible for diatoms. \n \nStudies of ice-cores and ocean sediments tell us that over the past million years the earth's climate has cycled every 100 thousand years or so between cold ice ages, with low levels of atmospheric CO2, and warmer periods, with higher CO2 levels. My studies focus on the climate changes that took place since the end of the last ice age, around 15 thousand years ago. I can step back in time by combining analysis of living sponges brought up from the deep during research cruises at sea with fossil sponges taken from seafloor sediment samples. \n \nI was amongst the first to show that the chemical fingerprints of sponges, in particular their silicon isotope composition, gives an accurate record of how much silicon was dissolved in the water they grew in. This opens up a unique archive stretching back millennia of the silicon levels in ocean waters down to as much as 4 km beneath the waves - the realm of sea sponges. In general, the more silicon there is supplied to the sea surface, the more diatoms can grow, and the more carbon dioxide they absorb and lock away in the seafloor sediments when they die. Building a picture of past levels of silicon in the oceans means I can test the crucial links between carbon dioxide uptake by diatoms and climate change. \nHere, I plan to study key geographical areas, which have been sensitive to rapid climate change since the last ice age. \nMy work will provide essential insights into the dynamics of the carbon cycle and hence climate, and point to possible future scenarios and changes in ocean circulation patterns.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J00474X/2","grantId":"NE/J00474X/2","fundValue":"12498","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Katharine Rosemary Hendry","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" Sedimentary and ice-core records show that the past 800 thousand years of earthâ€™s climate has cycled between cold glacials, characterized by low atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (pCO2 ~ 200 ppmV) and warmer interglacials, with higher pCO2 (~ 280 ppmV) on a timescale of approximately 100 thousand years. The same records show that previous glacial cycles were punctuated by abrupt (millennial) climate change events. The Southern Ocean is linked with these climatic events, in part because it exerts a primary control on the distribution of nutrients to a large portion of the modern ocean, which in turn regulates algal population structure and carbon uptake. \nMy overall aim was to investigate changes in the flow of Southern Ocean water into the Atlantic over the last glacial cycle. I addressed a number of outstanding questions:\nQuestion 1: What was the geographical extent of Southern Ocean intermediate waters in the Atlantic over the last glacial cycle?\nI have found evidence that the concentration of silicic acid (likely sourced from the Southern Ocean) at intermediate depths was similar in the glacial compared to today; however there were higher concentrations in the North Atlantic during millennial scale climate events (Hendry et al., 2014; Hendry et al., in prep). \nQuestion 2: To what extent did high silicic acid waters reach the surface of the North Atlantic, and important upwelling regions of the Equatorial Atlantic over the last glacial cycle, and to what extent was the silicic acid utilised by diatoms? \nI have found that there were significant near surface ecological changes in different regions of the North Atlantic during millennial scale climate events, according to algal assemblages and geochemical archives (Hendry et al., 2014; Pike, Hendry &amp;amp; Eastwood, in prep). \nUnderstanding how the ocean has responded to deglacial warming, and abrupt climate change, in the past will elucidate how ocean nutrient cycling may respond in the future. Further research into the ecological impacts of abrupt climate change (palaeoclimate, modern observations and future projections), with implications for environment and fisheries.\nPotential investigation of carbon sequestration and marine biological uptake of carbon during climate change (so-called 'ocean fertilization').
