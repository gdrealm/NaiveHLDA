{"id":"7DC9A50B-7EFC-4F3A-ADAB-C742F93549D9","title":"The Spice of Life: Migrating Foods and the Sensual Experience of Diasporic Culture","abstractText":"The project will develop theoretical guidelines for studying food practices that migrate across borders, becoming material resources for diasporic communities, and offering new experiences for the receiving culture. As sensual culture, food can delight and disgust, and connect you materially to places and memories. Food practices will be treated as dynamic agents in cultural migration: they help and hinder our bodies' ability to change, to accommodate new sensual environments and make them palatable. This theoretical work will be demonstrated by using the example of Indian cuisine in the UK in the postwar and contemporary period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119497/1","grantId":"119497/1","fundValue":"5806","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The work I produced for Spice of Life has regularly been cited by other researchers working in the field.
