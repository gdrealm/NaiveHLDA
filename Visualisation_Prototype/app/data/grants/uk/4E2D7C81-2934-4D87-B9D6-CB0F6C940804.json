Her analysis and interpretation of RCAHMS work in this area has stimulated and informed RCAHMS to further develop the concept of a participative 21st Century Inventory of the built heritage of Scotland. \\n\\nThe project will create, evaluate and disseminate findings on a discrete set of online demonstrator applications that will provide facilities using live data to test the capacity of the public, professionals and academics to collaborate in 'making' and 'unmaking' the inventory of the built heritage of Scotland.\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I026324/1","grantId":"AH/I026324/1","fundValue":"23816","fundStart":"2011-02-14","fundEnd":"2012-02-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca Mary Bailey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"RCAHMS","findingsText":" The developments which RCAHMS explored in the context of the follow-on Beyond Text project have represented, for RCAHMS, an opportunity to take a positive step towards a more active engagement with digital innovation, a change from the more typical instrumental approaches of the past.\n\n\n\nThe integration of a new tagging function, tested in the project, will allow future Canmore users to engage with images in the archive at a more granular level, in ways which allow for new interpretation and re-organisation of the material from different perspectives. If this development is pursued, users will have new opportunities to act as ‘commentators’ as well as contributors, ideally also interacting with curatorial staff in new ways. The opportunity for online users to develop new interactive resources using RCAHMS data, the second development explored in the project, further enhances opportunities for active collaboration between RCAHMS and online users. Here, conditions may be created where the institution could, at last, step away from a traditional role of organiser/producer to one of participant/learner, as potentially new ideas and creative departures are identified by users making use of RCAHMS data in innovative ways; ways which the institutions might not have anticipated itself. \n\n\n\nOverall, the project represented a welcome natural progression for RCAHMS, as it shows a new willingness to experiment with practices which recognise the value of digital innovation not merely in relation to short-term outcomes but also, importantly, in terms of the value of the engagement process for users and the institution alike. The research findings demonstrate that there is clearly an interest in widening access to RCAHMS data, as well as enhancing the ability to interact with images in the Canmore database more actively through crowdsourcing, eg image tagging. As well as professional and academic audiences, the wider public can make use of the findings of this research once they have been integrated into forthcoming developments to the RCAHMS database Canmore, which will greatly enhance the capacity for interaction.\n\n\n\nThe results of this research support the general move towards a more flexible approach to data, particularly that of public bodies. Enabling other organisations, communities and the wider public to experiment with this and other data and to create innovative new applications is an objective which this research has positively emphasised. Further public consultation as part of ongoing developments at RCAHMS would enable these outcomes to be explored further.
