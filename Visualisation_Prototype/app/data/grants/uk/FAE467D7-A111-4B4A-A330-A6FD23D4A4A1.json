{"id":"FAE467D7-A111-4B4A-A330-A6FD23D4A4A1","title":"Automatic Proof Procedures for Polynomials and Special Functions","abstractText":"An engineering design is expected to satisfy safety constraints, many of which can be expressed as mathematical and logical formulas. Computer software exists that can check some such formulas automatically, but although they can have a large and complicated logical structure, the mathematical component currently has to be linear: in other words, involving nothing more complicated than addition. Real-world engineering problems involve sophisticated mathematical concepts, such as polynomials and transcendental functions.The investigators have developed software (called MetiTarski and RAHD) that can solve such problems in many cases. The current project will extend the scope of this software, increasing its power and targeting it at specific real-world application areas. One such application is analogue circuitry, which is widespread in consumer electronics. The project will investigate many other potential applications In engineering and the mathematical sciences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I010335/1","grantId":"EP/I010335/1","fundValue":"518444","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  not applicable this year (grant end extended to 28/2/15).
