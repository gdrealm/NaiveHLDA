While there has been considerable\nprogress with understanding the biology of the virus and improvements in healthcare\nprovision, many issues relevant to the characteristics of HCV infection in the UK remain\nunresolved, such as the factors that contribute to development of serious liver disease\nand failure to respond to treatment. To address these issues, this proposal aims to create\nthe infrastructure that will allow recruitment of a national cohort of at least 10,000\npatients. Assembling a cohort of this size is necessary to generate a representative but\nsufficiently diverse collection of patient characteristics and clinical samples to explore in\ndetail the determinants that may contribute to HCV pathogenesis and response to\ntreatment. The key components of the national resource that will be created are a clinical\nresearch database for retaining details of patient characteristics, a biobank of clinical\nsamples, which will form a UK repository, and a sequence and bioinformatics database to\nhold viral and host genetic information. The infrastructure will be supported by and build\nupon existing knowledge and expertise at national agencies (Health Protection Agency\nand Health Protection Scotland), the Gastroenterology and Liver Disease Biomedical\nResearch Unit at Nottingham and the MRC Virology Unit in Glasgow. Patients will be\nrecruited from clinical centres across most of the UK who provide care for HCV-infected\npatients. To provide proof of principle for the utility of clinical research and sequence\ndatabases combined with the availability of a biobank of clinical samples, a limited series\nof research projects will be performed. The projects will focus on examining whether\nthere is a correlation between patient genetic markers and treatment outcome. In\naddition, the viral sequences of a large number of isolates for HCV genotypes 1 and 3 in\ndifferent ethnic groups will be determined. These studies will provide the foundation for\nthe information that will be deposited in the sequence and bioinformatics database. The\navailability of such a well-structured resource is highly likely to stimulate greater clinical\nand fundamental research into HCV infection in the UK and will also form the basis for\nlongitudinal studies into the natural history of chronic infection in a large cohort of\npatients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_EX_G1000717","grantId":"MC_EX_G1000717","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  McLauchlan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"MRC Virology Unit","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
