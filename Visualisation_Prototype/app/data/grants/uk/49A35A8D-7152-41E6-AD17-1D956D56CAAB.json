Each of these compounds can have distinct properties chemical and physical but also biological and medical. Our ability to understand these compounds is dependent upon the instrumentation available to us. New advances in instrumentation (high resolution GC-TOF systems) allow us to investigate the composition of the atmosphere in unprecedented detail. However, these new instruments provide a deluge of data that needs to be stored and process. By storing all of the data, rather than throwing away the data that is not yet understood we will create a virtual air archive which can be exploited into the future as our ability to understand the complex instrumentation and chemistry involved becomes more refined. BACCUS provides hardware to deal with this data deluge, provide software and computers to support to analyse and visualise the data and provides some computation to initially interpret the results.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L01291X/1","grantId":"NE/L01291X/1","fundValue":"213816","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  At this point the storage system has not been in place long enough for us to provide this answer  ","person":"Mathew John Evans","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" The grant was designed to provide long term storage and processing for new atmospheric chemistry observational instrumentation.
