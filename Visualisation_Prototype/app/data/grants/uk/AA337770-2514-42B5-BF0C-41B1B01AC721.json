The Old World cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is a global crop pest, causing &gt;US$2 billion of damage annually. Recently, it was found that this voracious pest had finally arrived in Brazil and is now established across the country. The aims of this partnership are:\n- To convene a workshop of stakeholders to undertake a risk assessment of the potential impact of bollworm spread in Brazil.\n- To collect field samples of bollworms for analysis of genetic diversity, beneficial microbes and natural enemies.\n- To assess the potential for microbial symbionts to modulate biopesticide efficacy. \n- To determine the role of phenotypic plasticity in modulating susceptibility to biopesticides.\nThe longer-term goal is to establish a consortium of stakeholders equipped to identify, monitor and control the spread of this invasive species and to minimize its environmental impact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M029263/1","grantId":"BB/M029263/1","fundValue":"49392","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kenneth  Wilson","coPersons":["David  Grzywacz","Robert  Graham"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
