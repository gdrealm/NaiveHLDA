This involved planning future observations, making sure the correct commands are sent to the instrument and carried out in a safe way, and looking after the health and safety of the instrument. We also process the data so that our team and other Cassni teams are able to analyse it to understand the physics of the Saturn system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D000912/1","grantId":"PP/D000912/1","fundValue":"1249580","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Michele K Dougherty","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
