However many details, particularly those concerned with complex variations of speech sound production in words and sentences (or coarticulation), continue to develop during childhood. Previous research by the team has suggested that subtle developmental changes are likely to be found into preadolescence.</p>\n\n<p>This study will focus on these subtle changes, aiming to provide articulatory and acoustic data on the maturation of lingual coarticulatory patterns and tongue differentiation from three years old, when the phonological system of the native language has been mostly acquired, to early adolescence, when adult-like extent of tongue differentiation is present. There will be ten speakers in each of the six age groups, with two years between successive groups. For the first time, the ability to differentiate between parts of the tongue will be systematically studied in tightly spaced age groups throughout childhood, using ultrasound imaging data on tongue position and shape in speech. In addition to established analytical techniques, a new method of comparing tongue curves will be used, which does not require head-to-transducer stabilisation, making it possible to analyse data from three- and five-year-olds.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002597/1","grantId":"ES/K002597/1","fundValue":"303764","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Natalia  Zharkova","coPersons":["Nigel  Hewlett","Robin  Lickley","Fiona  Gibbon"],"organisation":"Queen Margaret University Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
