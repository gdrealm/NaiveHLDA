{"id":"7DF2F8C2-33EC-4022-9C9A-05FC4A56CB6B","title":"IXO collaboration Travel","abstractText":"IXO - the International X-ray Observatory - is a proposed joint ESA-JAXA-NASA mission which will address fundamental astrophysics questions through observations at X-ray wavelengths. IXO is the next major international X-ray astronomy mission which is shortlisted within ESA's Cosmic Vision programme as an L-class mission and currently under review in the US Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey (Astro2010). IXO is the result of the merger of the ESA/JAXA XEUS and NASA Con-X mission concepts in July 2008. Both mission concepts had been under study by their respective agencies for more than a decade. XEUS originated as the natural successor to ESA's highly successful XMM-Newton project, building on four decades of X-ray astronomy success within the UK and the rest of Europe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H004424/1","grantId":"ST/H004424/1","fundValue":"8000","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Hepburn","coPersons":["A  Smith","Mathew James Page"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
