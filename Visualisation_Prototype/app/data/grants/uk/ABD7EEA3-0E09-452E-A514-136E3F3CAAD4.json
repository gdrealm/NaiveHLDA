{"id":"ABD7EEA3-0E09-452E-A514-136E3F3CAAD4","title":"Governing Through Anti-Social Behaviour","abstractText":"<p>Anti-social behaviour has become a major focus of political concern and public debate. The last decade has seen an unprecedented period of intensive activity and regulatory reform designed to tackle anti-social behaviour, which has seen the introduction of various new powers, tools and initiatives. Yet there has been little engagement and dialogue between practitioners and researchers about the evidence base for, and effectiveness of, many of the recent reforms. In this light, a research seminar series with international contributors, held between November 2007 and April 2009 brought together researchers, policy-makers and practitioners to explore the evidence relating to the anti-social behaviour agenda, to discuss and exchange views on research findings and their implications for good practice.</p>\n\n<p>The seminar series comprised five themed seminars and a final national conference at which a Findings document was published and launched. The themes included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>housing and residential areas</li>\n\n <li>families and young people</li>\n\n <li>the night-time economy</li>\n\n <li>gender, ethnicity and diversity</li>\n\n <li>comparative European experiences. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The series was oversee by a national steering committee and benefited from the involvement and support of the National Community Safety Network.</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0356","grantId":"RES-451-26-0356","fundValue":"18351","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Adam  Crawford","coPersons":["David Martin Prior"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
