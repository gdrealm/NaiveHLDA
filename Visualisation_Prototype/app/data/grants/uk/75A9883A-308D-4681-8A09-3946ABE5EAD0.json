{"id":"75A9883A-308D-4681-8A09-3946ABE5EAD0","title":"Spatial Control of Semiconductor Band Gaps: A Feasibility Study","abstractText":"This proposal aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel process for monolithic integration of semiconductor optical components. Epitaxial growth on pre-patterned GaAs substrates, with well defined mesa sizes and shapes, will be used to produce arrays of discrete and integrated quantum well (QW) emitters based on the dilute nitride semiconductor material, GaInNAs. The geometry and structure of the mesas will govern the band gap of the QW and it is the ability to spatially control the band gap via patterning that will facilitate integration in a single growth run. This project has the potential to deliver an innovative approach that will ultimately be exploited for the integration of different optical components for a range of technologies including communications and sensing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E01657X/1","grantId":"EP/E01657X/1","fundValue":"80997","fundStart":"2006-06-19","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy S Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
