{"id":"F8F2C7CE-4CDE-49B3-9DF2-8A1543D14CE3","title":"Ultra-thin Zeolite Films: A New Generation of Model Catalysts","abstractText":"Zeolites powders have been used for many years as industrial catalysts. The structure of these materials resembles that of a domestic sponge i.e. zeolites are solids that contain pores extending throughout their interior regions. However, unlike a sponge, the pores in zeolites are uniform, where a single pore diameter exists for an individual zeolite sample. The pores in these materials are typically the size of a small molecule e.g. water. As a result, zeolites are capable of acting as molecular sieves and can be used to separate molecules of different sizes. This property of zeolites is responsible for their ability to efficiently transform molecular reactants to useful products e.g. reforming of petroleum to increase its energy output for transportation.In order to further develop and improve the performance of zeolites, it is necessary that the chemical processes occurring within the pores are fully understood. However, this is very difficult to study in a systematic manner since zeolite powders are not suitable for a detailed analysis. Therefore, an ultra-thin smooth zeolite film will be formed by dispersing zeolite particles at the molecular level onto a solid surface. A film of this structure and magnitude is appropriate for a detailed study in vacuum using powerful electronic analysis methods. This will significantly improve our understanding of zeolite chemistry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D50645X/1","grantId":"EP/D50645X/1","fundValue":"130884","fundStart":"2006-02-15","fundEnd":"2008-02-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Aidan M  Doyle","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
