These periods of worsened symptoms (exacerbations) can be severe enough to cause an increase in the need for medications, and may result in hospitalisation and even death. The most common trigger for these serious exacerbations is a virus infection, such as the common cold. Recently, we have made progress in addressing this problem by demonstrating that the cells that line the airways (epithelial cells) which are the primary target for infection by the common cold virus fail to mount an effective anti-viral response if they are derived from an asthmatic donor. This means that cold viruses are able to replicate more efficiently resulting in lingering lower respiratory tract problems. The purpose of our study is to investigate this defect with a view to identifying novel targets for development of new and effective therapies for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma where there is an unmet clinical need. We also propose to examine the anti-viral response of cells from wheezy and asthmatic children because a defective response in early life may explain the link between viral infections and the onset of asthma.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501506","grantId":"G0501506","fundValue":"649412","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Donna Elizabeth Davies","coPersons":["Graham  Roberts","John  Warner","Stephen  Holgate"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
