Initially it was used to provide structural information about the body\nand the brain but it was the introduction of functional MRI (fMRI) that had the most profound impact on\nneuroscience and basic cognitive research. Although fMRI is widely used in clinical and experimental\nneurology, the fundamental cellular mechanism of fMRI remains poorly understood. This limits the value of\nthe information generated by this exciting technology. Brain is a highly complex organ and signals measured\nby fMRI are indirect and although they do reflect activation and de-activation of nerve cells in various parts\nof the brain. This research will look at the cellular basis of fMRI using a new technology called\n&quot;optogenetics&quot; voted &quot;Method of year 2010&quot;. Optogenetics allows us to make certain cells light sensitive,\nsuch that we can switch them 'on' and 'off' using light. Quite simple we will be able to control the brain\nvia light and watch this happen in real time using the MRI scanner. Our results should not only shine a light\non how fMRI works, but also have wider implications for human brain research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J013110/1","grantId":"MR/J013110/1","fundValue":"709590","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sergey  Kasparov","coPersons":["Mark  Lythgoe","Alexander  Gourine"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
