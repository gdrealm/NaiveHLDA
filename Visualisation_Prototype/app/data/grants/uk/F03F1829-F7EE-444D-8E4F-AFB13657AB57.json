{"id":"F03F1829-F7EE-444D-8E4F-AFB13657AB57","title":"NACNet: New Applications for Cement-type materials Network - Cementing the Future","abstractText":"A new cross-sector network is proposed with the aim of discovering novel, high-value applications for cements and related materials (CTMs) outside the construction sector. It will promote interdisciplinary research collaborations, monitor and disseminate relevant advances in physical, biomedical, social and engineering sciences and work with industrial partners to develop new products. Outputs will include state-of-the-art reports, strategic discussion documents, and feasibility studies. The network will operate via a series of workshops, symposia, collaborator visits and summer schools. Stakeholders will be drawn from CTM scientists and engineers, cutting edge scientific disciplines and innovative industrial partners, while proactive links will be established with scientific/engineering institutions, media organisations and the general public. The network will be managed by Dr Phil Purnell during the funding period, with responsibility for day-to-day management transferring to dedicated post-doctoral staff as the network becomes self-sustaining. In the document, cement-type materials are introduced and their embryonic 'functional' uses outside the construction sector are reviewed, such as immobilisation of nuclear waste and their varied medical uses. Some speculative applications, such as ballistic protection and sustainable refrigeration, are advanced along with the interdisciplinary science required to realise their potential. The aims, outputs, mechanisms, stakeholders and management of the network are then explained and the relevance to beneficiaries detailed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F040288/1","grantId":"EP/F040288/1","fundValue":"98717","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Phil  Purnell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
