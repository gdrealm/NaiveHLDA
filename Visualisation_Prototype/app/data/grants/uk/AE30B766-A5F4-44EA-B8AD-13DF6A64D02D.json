These signals travel from a GPS satellite at an altitude of about 20,000 km and travel through the ionosphere before arriving at a GPS receiver, typically near the surface of the Earth. The GPS receiver maintains a phase lock on the signal transmitted from the satellite in order to accurately determine the time it has taken the signal to travel from the satellite to the receiver and thus the distance between them. This enables the receiver to find its position from the determined distance to 4 or more GPS satellites. Just as we see stars twinkle due to the effect of the atmosphere so radio signals passing through the ionosphere scintillate . This means that they can show amplitude fades and phase perturbations. When the amplitude becomes very small or when the phase of the signal changes very rapidly and particularly when both occur together, loss of lock of the signal can result which means that the distance of the receiver from the satellite cannot be found. This is particularly the case for 3 specific latitude regions of the Earth: polar, auroral and equatorial. The polar ionosphere has fast moving patches of ionisation, the auroral ionosphere has field aligned sheets extended in longitude ( like an onion skin) and field-aligned cigar-shaped irregularities and the equatorial ionosphere has bubbles of considerably reduced electron density which form and travel upwards after sunset. In this project we will investigate this effect by constructing a model of the propagation path through the background ionosphere with these imbedded irregularities so that we can evaluate their effect for the different regions on the received signal at the GPS receiver for various different conditions, in particular when there is strong scintillation. We will also consider the effect of the scintillation of the received signal on the receiver phase locking and see what conditions have the most severe effect. We will also assess the effect of these scintillations on future satellite positioning systems which will transmit extra frequencies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D056187/1","grantId":"EP/D056187/1","fundValue":"134813","fundStart":"2006-08-21","fundEnd":"2007-08-20","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our transionospheric scintillation simulator has been used in the connection with the high latitude ionosphere and scintillation model UAF EPPIM (Eulerian Parallel Polar Ionosphere Model) where it is adapted for the different mesoscale structures (high latitude patches) found at high latitudes rather than the plasma bubbles found at low latitude bubbles.

I presume that they do not require repeating here. Since then there has been further funding related to this project in the EPSRC award EP/H004637/1. In this the previously developed transionospheric simulator was further extended to determine the phase correlation between different frequency signals from the same GNSS satellite (important for 3 frequency correction schemes) as well as the range error in GNSS positioning due to moderate and strong scintillation conditions. The simulator has also been used to generate time series of the amplitude and phase for particular scintillation conditions as a &quot;test bed&quot; for the effectiveness of different hardware/firmware scintillation mitigation methods for GNSS receivers as real scintillation data is not repeatable and cannot easily be directly linked in practice with the contemporaneous ionosphere and irregularity conditions from which it arose and which are rather difficult to measure. We received interest in our modelling of scintillation by equatorial bubbles from both the US Air force laboratories (AFRL) and also the US Navy laboratoroies.
