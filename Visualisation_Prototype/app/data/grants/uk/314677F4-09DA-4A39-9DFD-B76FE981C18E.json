This suggests these foodstuffs keep major blood vessels in a good state. Fruit and particularly Brassica vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and Brussel sprouts) are important components of a healthy diet because they have high levels of compounds linked to low risk of heart disease. The key to their benefit is probably their ability to induce and increase endogenous defences against blood vessel damage and counter the development of high cholesterol and lipids in the body. Good health of blood vessels is associated with a high production of proteins encoded by a battery of genes associated with maintenance of good blood vessel structural and function. The protective genes are regulated through interactions with at a section of their DNA called an 'antioxidant response element (ARE)'. Increased production of protective proteins is achieved by stimulating a protein called 'nrf2' that normally residues in the cell but outside of the cell nucleus to move into the nucleus. In the normal state, nrf2 is held predominantly outside the nucleus; on stimulation, it moves into the nucleus, bunds protective genes and makes them produce more of their encoded protein. Increased levels of ARE-linked gene proteins provide for increased protection against spontaneous damage in the blood vessels / by reactions with oxygen, reactive nitrogen species and sugars - preserving the structure and functions of proteins and lipids within the blood vessels. A further remarkable property of nrf2 is its ability to switch off certain ARE-linked genes / particularly those associated with the excessive production of cholesterol and lipids. Minor components in fruit and vegetables can stimulate nrf2 to do this. We think the most important components are: products derived from so-called 'omega-3 fatty acids' found in vegetables oils ('Canola'), carotenoids / compounds traditionally found in carrots but also in other vegetables, glucosinolates / compounds found in Brassica vegetables and also in increasingly popular 'Rocket' salad, polyphenols / compounds found in grape juice and also in onions, and alkyl disulphides / compounds found in onions and garlic. It is not clear currently which of these groups of compounds and members thereof are most effective in enhancing the ARE-linked protective responses in blood vessels. The aim of this project is to use two human cell lines / cells originating from human tissue but now grow continuously in culture, a cell typical of those found in blood vessels and one typical of liver cells (where cholesterol and lipids are made) / that have been genetically modified to produce nrf2 with a green fluorescence. We can them study nrf2 movement into the nucleus in responsive to compounds from fruit and vegetable under the microscope and make a time-lapsed video. Compounds from fruit and vegetables will be studied for their ability to produce strong and prolonged activation of nrf2 and associated cell protection from damage and accumulation of lipids. Compounds from many plant varieties will be studied to fine the plants best for enhancing cell health. Mathematical models of the nrf2 effects will be refined to predict health benefits from fruit and vegetable consumption. Finally, we will study the health of blood vessels in healthy human volunteers during periods when we supplement their diet successively with vegetable oil, tomato juice/paste, broccoli and Rocket salad. Successful completion of this project will reveal the varieties of common fruit and vegetables that are likely most beneficial in maintaining blood vessels in a good state and also which fruit and vegetables have the ability to decrease bad cholesterol and lipids and raise good cholesterol, and likely beneficial if include in our diets for current and future generations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G005699/1","grantId":"BB/G005699/1","fundValue":"654256","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  They have guided further research for healthier food design.

We found Nrf2 proteins works like an engineering sensor to continually sense and respond to threats to our health. To do this it continually moves in and out of the cell nucleus by movement oscillations. More effective methods for dietary substance screening to discover improved ingredients in functional foods may be achieved and healthier foods produced.
