{"id":"7B35834B-E8ED-4B9C-9F45-43664A1745C2","title":"Irish Bilateral: A Comparative Investigation of the Risk Management of Legal Liability in Public Services in Scotland an","abstractText":"There is considerable anxiety about the development of a compensation culture in the UK and Ireland, and the adverse effects that spiralling claims for compensation are having on the financial health of public service providers and on their capacity to deliver public services efficiently and effectively. There is a perception that some activities are too risky for local authorities to undertake, and that others must be managed defensively. This comparative research project will investigate the growth in claims against local authorities in Scotland and Ireland and examine how local authorities respond through the management of liability risks in one aspect of their activities - the maintenance of roads and pavements. The objective is to secure a better understanding of the level of liability risk to which local authorities are exposed and how the management of risks might impact positively or negatively on their performance in delivery of public services.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E018580/1","grantId":"ES/E018580/1","fundValue":"95567","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Halliday","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
