In one project, we will be investigating how galaxies are affected by the environment in which they are found, a cosmological 'nature' vs 'nurture' problem. In other projects we will be searching for local remnants of the first generation of stars in the Universe, how cosmological structures grow and how massive stars live.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N001788/1","grantId":"ST/N001788/1","fundValue":"11538","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Sean Liam McGee","coPersons":["Ian Robert Stevens","Graham Peter Smith"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
