Edition if the 'Breviere' and 'Registre delphinal'","abstractText":"Mathiew Thomassin (c. 1391 - after 1463), servent of Charles VII and the future Louis XI as dauphins, is still relatively unknown to historians of France rather than the Dauphine proper, because only fragments of his historical works have been published. My edition of his 'Breviere' and 'Registre delphinal' will allow historians to explore how national and local sentiment was experienced in the Dauphine, a 'frontier province' straddling France and the Empire. It will trace the professional and cultural development of this example of an officer-historian, and the evolution of his ideas on government during Louis's reign as dauphin.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112948/1","grantId":"112948/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2006-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kathleen  Daly","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
