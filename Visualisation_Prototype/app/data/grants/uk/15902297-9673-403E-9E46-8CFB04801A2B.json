Its core theoretical contribution will be to understanding the relationships between attitudes and health-related behaviours, focussing particularly on how people evaluate their health system, their trust in doctors, clinics and hospitals, and their utilisation of preventive and curative health services.</p>\n\n<p>Previous research in China has concentrated on the impact on utilisation of age and gender, incomes, insurance protection, distance to health service providers and perceived health care needs. But attitudes, including performance evaluations and trust, also can affect people's decisions about when and where to use health services. Indeed some qualitative studies in China have suggested that people are often critical of performance and that there is a crisis of trust in doctors and the health care system.</p>\n\n<p>Our project will be the first systematic study of these attitudes and how they influence utilisation, but we will also assess the implications of health-related attitudes for government support and legitimacy. Central to the project is close collaboration with the Research Centre on Contemporary China at Peking University to conduct focus groups and a nationally-representative social survey. The results will be of relevance to scholars, policy makers and businesses.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J011487/1","grantId":"ES/J011487/1","fundValue":"429637","fundStart":"2012-02-25","fundEnd":"2015-08-24","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Duckett","coPersons":["Matt Adam Sutton","Neil Mallory Munro","Kathryn  Hunt"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
