Through a series of challenging readings of Holocaust films, it engages with questions about representation, testimony and trauma, and forges new connections between the phenomenology of cinema and recent currents in ethical thought. In so doing, it seeks to correct a perceived reticence in film scholarship to view cinema and spectatorship in explicitly ethical terms, and thereby to establish the parameters of an encounter between theory and practice which moves thinking on the medium into productive territory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113157/1","grantId":"113157/1","fundValue":"11476","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Libby  Saxton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
