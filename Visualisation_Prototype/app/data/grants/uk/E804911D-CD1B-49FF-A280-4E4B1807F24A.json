Studies on thin films and single crystals have demonstrated the advantages of soft x-ray diffraction for studies of both charge and magnetic scattering as well as direct observation of orbital ordering. To date world leading research has been conducted at Daresbury using a simple two-circle diffractometer modified with a nitrogen cooling stage. The current diffractometer has a number of limitations and cannot be upgraded. We propose to build a new dedicated in-vacuum soft x-ray diffractometer with enhanced cryogenic capabilities, multiaxis capability and equipped with a number of new detectors including a high resolution CCD. The diffractometer will also be equipped with a high field magnet for reflectivity studies at ambient temperature. The new diffractometer will be designed at Daresbury to be used on a branchline of the soft x-ray Nanoscience beamline (I06) at Diamond and eventually on the polarized beamline for advanced dichroism experiments ( BLADE, I10) after 2010. The new diffractometer will provide a migration route for an existing wide community of users for fundamental studies and device applications of technologically important materials who currently use 1.1 and 5U1 at the SRS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=CC/D000025/1","grantId":"CC/D000025/1","fundValue":"749979","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter David Hatton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
