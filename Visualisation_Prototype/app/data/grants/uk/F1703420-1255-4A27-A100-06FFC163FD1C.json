Its primary activity is to make harmonised household microdata available to researchers in many countries, thus enabling a wide variety of primary research. </p>\n\n<p>The LIS data archive now contains two databases: the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) database, which includes income data, and the Luxembourg Wealth Study (LWS) database, which focuses on wealth data. The LIS database now includes microdata from 30 countries, mostly in Europe and North America, but also including Australia, Israel and Taiwan.&nbsp;It contains nearly 200 datasets, organised into six waves spanning the years 1968 to 2005.</p>\n\n<p>LIS has begun the process of adding seven new countries not previously in LIS, including Japan, South Korea and five Latin American countries. </p>\n\n<p>The newer LWS database (released in December 2007) contains 13 wealth datasets from 10 countries (including the UK), and covers the period 1994 to 2004. Social scientists and practitioners in many countries use email to access the two databases. Extensive documentation, for both LIS and LWS, concerning technical aspects of the survey data, the harmonisation process, and the social institutions of income and wealth provision in participating countries is also provided to users. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G023352/1","grantId":"ES/G023352/1","fundValue":"118715","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank Alan Cowell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
