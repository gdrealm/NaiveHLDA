However water quality failures do occur and there are associated health risks. The analysis of water samples, taken at the customers tap by the UK Water Industry to meet regulatory requirements, has shown that for three consecutive years approximately 1 in every 200 samples failed to meet the standards for coliforms, an indicator of faecal contamination. The few epidemiologic studies in the area confirm that there is a problem and that it is related to the pipe infrastructure. This pipe infrastructure, used to deliver this basic human resource, is an extremely complicated mix of materials, pipe sizes and structures and appurtenances that are connected in a network, usually in loops, developed in a piecemeal manner over considerable time. This infrastructure is integral to our towns and cities and widespread replacement is unfeasible due to the associated costs and disruption. Whi1e there is existing knowledge and tools for understanding and making some predictions of the structural performance of these assets, the knowledge and applicable understanding of their water quality related performance is extremely poor.This system of buried infrastructure acts as a dynamic physical, microbiological and chemical reactor, with high surface area and with highly variable residence times. As a consequence there are a number of major and interacting physical and bio-chemical processes that degrade the quality of drinking water as it is transported. The situation is further complicated by the unknown, but deteriorating, internal condition of the infrastructure. This Challenging Engineering vision will enable the applicant to establish a world leading multidisciplinary team to derive new knowledge of the physical bio-chemical reactions and interactions occurring within water distribution systems, dominated by the aging infrastructure. The team will integrate across engineering and microbiological, chemical and computer science. Extensive use will be made of the latest instrumentation and measurement techniques from the different disciplines, applied to experimental studies on the internationally unique, 600m long temperature controlled pipe test loop facility at the University of Sheffield and ambitious live field trials with UK water companies (both areas of particular expertise of the applicant). The new understanding and knowledge gained will be applied to develop a suite of analysis and predictive tools to drive a paradigm shift in the way in which water distribution systems are operated, managed, rehabilitated and maintained for water quality with a move towards proactive management operating in near real time.The project is extremely ambitious, but presents the opportunity for the UK to establish an area of international expertise and to lead the world in an expanding research area of public interest and significance. The most apparent output will be superior water quality at least cost, consistent with the demands of an increasingly well informed society, leading to enhanced public health and well being. In the longer term, the multidisciplinary team will evolve by seeking to further develop the multidisciplinary approach for the even more complex environments of the complete urban water cycle and seek to stimulate further change for integrated, holistic and sustainable management across the cycle.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G029946/1","grantId":"EP/G029946/1","fundValue":"904118","fundStart":"2009-06-27","fundEnd":"2014-12-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The active and continued engagement with the water sector has led to substantial impact.

In particular we have changed the perception of water distribution systems from inert transport systems, to highly complex, highly variable, high surface area ecosystems.\n\nThe work was based on the development of a multidisciplinary team that derived knowledge of the physical and bio-chemical reactions and interactions occurring within water distribution systems, dominated by the internal condition of the ageing infrastructure. The resulting new knowledge, tools and techniques are applicable and sufficiently flexible to maximise the performance of existing ageing buried pipe infrastructure. This is helping to ensure that it is possible to meet the varied operating conditions likely to results from climate change, increasing population densities and society demands for the 21st Century and beyond and hence to deliver safe and secure drinking water, ensuring public health and well being.\n\nSpecific objectives met are:\n1. Established an international, multidisciplinary centre of excellence in research addressing all aspects of the continued delivery of clean, safe and wholesome potable water.\n2. Integration of microbiological, chemical and computing science with engineering within a multidisciplinary team leading to better understand the complex physical, chemical and biological interactions that occur within water distribution systems.\n3. We have delivered better understanding of the processes and mechanisms of potable water infrastructure deterioration and quantified the water quality related processes associated with such deterioration.\n4. We have develop techniques, tools and models that quantify the interactions between the physical, chemical and biological processes that occur within distribution systems and hence can assess how water quality changes.\n5. We have developed artificial intelligence and modelling tools to integrate structural and water quality performance in a suite of operation and management tools.\n6. We have promoted new remedial strategies, in particular operational approaches that result in substantial financial savings and water quality benefits. \n7. We have engaged with and disseminated results to the worldwide water industry, academia and the public.\n\nIn addition to these original objectives the flexibility, scale and prestige of the challenging engineering award has been used to stimulate a variety of further associated research and activity as listed in the various outputs and further funding. The various tools and techniques developed have been widely and freely disseminated to the water sector internationally, and many have been taken up and adopted by professional practitioners from water companies, consultants and associated supply chain. As an example of policy change, Northumbrian Water engaged Prof. Boxall and Dr. Husband as expert advisers and reviewers of their complete set of distribution system operational practice documentation. And as an example of economic impact, Wessex Water have reported multi-million pound savings from initial implementation of new operational procedures for trunk mains on pipe lengths representing less than 5% of their total system.
