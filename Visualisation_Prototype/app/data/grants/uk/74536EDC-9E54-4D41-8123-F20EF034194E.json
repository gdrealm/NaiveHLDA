{"id":"74536EDC-9E54-4D41-8123-F20EF034194E","title":"Calcium Regulation of Plant Productivity (CROPP)","abstractText":"Plants, in common with us and other organisms, require the ability to sense conditions in the environment e.g. what temperature it is, how bright it is etc. Most of our own senses operate through nerves. We have specific receptors in our skin, which are able to detect, for instance, temperature, and this information is relayed to the brain through our nerves. Pretty much all our senses start life with an increase in the concentration of the metal ion, calcium, in the cells very close to where the stimulus is perceived e.g. skin for touch and tongue for taste. It is this calcium elevation which actually triggers the nervous impulse, which finally leads to the brain, and tell us what we are feeling. Obviously, plants do not have nerves, but very interestingly, this increase in calcium upon sensing something happens in plants too, and is also extremely quick! So if plants don't have nerves, what is this calcium increase for? Well in the case of plants, the calcium triggers changes in the physiology of the plant to make it better able to cope with the change in the environmental conditions e.g. in response to low temperature, the plant will produce proteins which will allow it to tolerate freezing better. There are obviously many questions to answer on this important topic, but the three key ones are: (1) What genes/proteins does calcium switch on/off to make the plant able to tolerate the stress? (2) What mechanism does calcium use to do this? (3) How does the information from calcium encode specific information e.g. cold as compared to heat in plants (in humans we have different nerves for different stimuli: plants don't). It is to answer these fundamental questions that the research proposed here is addressed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G025029/1","grantId":"BB/G025029/1","fundValue":"315488","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are not aware of our finding being used by industry or other stakeholders.

We identified promoter motif/transcription factors systems regulated by calcium in Arabidopsis;\n\n2. We identified potential transducers of calcium signals in the nucleus;\n\n3. We established a system to comprehensively map the calcium responses at different locations of the plant cell.\n\nThis knowledge allows us to &quot;program&quot; plant gene expression to allow plants/crops to be better able to tolerate stress responses and so have higher productivity. Rational design of calcium signalling pathways, and transcription factor activity, through breeding could lead to crops with enhanced stress tolerance. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
