It is therefore very important to be able to rapidly detect and measure MRSA, especially when people are admitted to hospital through the accident &amp; emergency route, so as to avoid any chance of infection. The PROMPT feasibility project funded in 2011-2012 by the TSB successfully demonstrated a new type of biosensor based system could specifically detect MRSA under field conditions. This success has led to the PROMPT-Plus project that aims to further develop the biosensor system to fully operational point-of-care prototypes that will be tested in NHS trust laboratories. The concept for the biosensor system was conceived by ELISHA Systems Ltd with support from the Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA) and will be commercialised in the future by British Biocell International Ltd (BBI).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_13032","grantId":"MC_PC_13032","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Harvey Wilcox","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
