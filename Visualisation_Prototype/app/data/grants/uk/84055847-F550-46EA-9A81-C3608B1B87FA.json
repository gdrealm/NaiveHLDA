A comparative study of Brazil and South Africa","abstractText":"<p>This study examines the impacts of individual ageing on the wellbeing of older people and their households in Brazil and South Africa, with a view to informing appropriate policies to address the challenges of accelerated population ageing in developing countries. The main hypothesis organizing the research is that the contribution of older people to social and economic development is a primary factor determining the dynamics of their, and their households', wellbeing. A core feature of the research will be to undertake a longitudinal comparative study of wellbeing among older persons and their households in South Africa and Brazil, by re-visiting a sample of households with older people from these two countries which participated in a 2002 household survey. The longitudinal dataset combined with in depth interviews will enable the analysis of the dynamics of household income and livelihoods in the two countries, including intergenerational relations and care. Comparison of South Africa and Brazil, two countries with rich social policy environments and recent innovations, will help identify the impact of old age support and existing anti-poverty programmes on the wellbeing of older people and their households.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-352-25-0028","grantId":"RES-352-25-0028","fundValue":"270345","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Armando  Barrientos","coPersons":["Peter Geoffrey Lloyd-Sherlock"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
