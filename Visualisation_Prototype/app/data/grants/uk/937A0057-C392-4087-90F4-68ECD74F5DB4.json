Through the lens of policy language, this project examines how perceptions of insecurity are created and maintained, and how depictions of enmity foster public acceptance of threat scenarios and security policy agendas.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the project investigates the US preoccupation with security threats after the Cold War and how the redefinition of the post-Cold War landscape as dangerous and uncertain has locked the US into perpetuating high-cost security practices - even in times of severe economic crisis.</p>\n\n<p>The project employs a novel multidisciplinary mixed-methods research design that helps to link security discourse to policy formulation, political strategy, and security policy consequences.</p>\n\n<p>The project casts new light on persistent and timely concerns in international security, such as the extent to which security policy is a reaction to 'objective' changes in the international structure, the role played by policy language in marginalizing political resistance, and how 'speaking' international security differently changes security policy practices.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K008684/1","grantId":"ES/K008684/1","fundValue":"238640","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Nothing to report at this stage  ","person":"Alexandra  Homolar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" A core aim of the ESRC Future Research Leaders scheme is to foster the award holderâ€™s professional development. This has thus far been the main focus of project year one. Specifically, I undertook specialist training in two main areas: (1) increasing my methodological skill set, with a focus on research techniques that are compatible with - and foster - interdisciplinary research approaches; and (2) enhancing my public engagement capability to better communicate research findings to non-academic audiences. Courses taken in project year 1 included: Cognitive Interviewing, Advanced Process Tracing, Access, NVivo (1-3); ATLAS.ti (1-2); Visual Analysis with qualitative software, media communications, and public engagement, as well as research project management. The professional development activities strengthen my ability to both effectively conduct and promote problem-driven research and to share this expertise with the next generation of social scientists. They also serve as a pathway to engage end-users beyond academia. Education,Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
