Remarkably, these internal timing mechanisms, which are normally found in the brains of animals, continue to work even when the organism is separated from cues, such as cycles of night and day. Biological clocks are extremely important because organisms can prepare in advance for bouts of activity, growth, mating and other necessary activity at the most appropriate part of the day to avoid predators, find food or mates. Therefore they contribute significantly to the survival and success of all organisms. We now know that the clock mechanisms in different plants and animals that have been studied share striking similarities in the molecules that drive them but, most of our understanding comes from work on a very few 'model organisms' such as the fruit fly. The fruit fly, and nearly all terrestrial organisms, uses the night and day light cycles to synchronise their clocks to local conditions. Consequently their rhythmic behaviour and physiology recurs on a cycle of about 24h. However, marine plants and animals are exposed to many different cyclic events such as the tide coming in and out (tidal clocks; every 12.4h), lunidian (cycles of tidal height; 12.8h) and even changes in tidal range (spring and neap tides) caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun (semilunar clocks; 14d). Although it is well known that many marine species time their behaviour and physiology to these different events, we know very little about their how their internal clocks work. For instance, do they have the same molecular 'cogs' as daily clocks but 'run' at a different speed, or do they have dedicated 'tidal', 'lunidian' or 'semilunar' clocks? This project will decipher the genetic and biochemical basis of cyclic behaviours in the sand-hopper, Talitrus saltator. In the UK this small crustacean emerges from its burrow in the sand at night to feed. It navigates up and down the shore by moving towards the light of the sea horizon in the night but just before dawn it turns back and is drawn to the dark of the land. The emergence and light/dark preferences of the sand-hopper are under clock control and continue to be expressed even if they are kept artificially in total darkness. In the Mediterranean the same species navigate in a different way- by using the position of the sun and moon as their guide. This must also require a sense of time because as the Earth rotates, the sun and the moon appear to move across the sky and the sand-hopper must compensate for this to keep on course. I will compare the UK sand-hoppers to those of the Mediterranean to determine whether their clocks are geared differently or even if they have multiple clocks in their brains. The outcomes of this work could have important impacts on our understanding of biological clocks, how they have evolved and adapted to suit the prevailing environmental conditions and how they contribute to the success of the organism and their interactions with other species.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K000594/1","grantId":"NE/K000594/1","fundValue":"75125","fundStart":"2013-02-08","fundEnd":"2015-02-07","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The original proposal for this work was explicit in its declaration that the work was in the realms of pure science and it would be disingenuous to pretend we have made massive contributions to non-academic beneficiaries.

Timing of this activity is governed by an internal clock mechanism so that Talitrus is not exposed to daytime predation and desiccation. Moreover, sand-hoppers use a ‘sun and separate moon compass’ to navigate appropriately up and down shore but must compensate for the apparent movement of these bodies by keeping track of time. We have recently gathered experimental evidence that regular activity cycles (these animals are active at night and buried in the sand at night) are controlled in a similar way to other terrestrial animals such as fruit flies, and their clock mechanism comprises many of the same genes and proteins as these other organisms. We have used a suite of modern molecular tools to sequence and trace the activity of ‘clock genes’ in hoppers and shown them to cycle in a circadian fashion, echoing their circadian lifestyle. Moreover, we have teamed up with a group in Italy who are expert in monitoring hopper orientation and have shown that clock gene activity can be shifted in time by altering the light/dark cycles under which the animals are kept. This shifted molecular clock mechanism is mirrored with a corresponding shift in orientation angle demonstrated by the hoppers when exposed to altered light cycles. Thus we believe we have shown the molecular correlates of timing and orientation behavior. Very recently we have data to suggest that the ‘moon compass’ mechanism is housed in the antennae, whilst the sun compass is not. Work is now ongoing to fully characterize each system by visualizing the cells of each system. To do this we have generated reagents (antibodies) that recognise proteins we think are involved in the timing and orientation mechanisms.\nTo date we have generated a high quality database of all genes expressed in the heads of Talitrus throughout a day-night cycle using new ‘Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) strategies. We are currently applying RNA samples taken from multiuple time-course experiments to establish all expressed genes that are expressed in a cyclic fashion. Our database will be made available on the public domain on completion of key manuscripts that are in preparation. Our sera, should they prove suitable, will be made available to the scientific community; antisera for clock proteins in non-model systems are rare and our will will expand the current inventory of these.\nOur transcriptome data will be publicly available and be of benefit to arthropod biologists world-wide as a source of sequence information on a crustacean system. Indeed I have been approached by the Decapod Crustacean Transcriptome (DCT) Research Colloboration Network (hosted in the US), that aims to create an international network for crustacean biologists with access to a secure wiki space for asking questions, sharing solutions and discussing results in pursuit of various Decpod RNA-Seq studies.
