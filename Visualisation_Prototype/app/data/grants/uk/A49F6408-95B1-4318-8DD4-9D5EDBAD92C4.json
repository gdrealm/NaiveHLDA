The case of the 'new' London squares","abstractText":"<p>It is not uncommon for urban policy instruments to emphasise the potential of public spaces as weapons in the arsenal of global and local inter-city competition, as catalysts for urban renewal, and as arenas for community revitalisation and participatory local democracy. Yet the academic literature across a range of very different scholarly traditions is replete with critiques of public space. Most are dominated by a narrow North American experience that may or may not have wider application elsewhere. On the face of it, the critiques are damming of contemporary public space, although some argue that they are much exaggerated. London represents an ideal context in which to study these contested critiques, not least because of the very obvious pressures that the global property market brings to bear on the city. At the same time, the resurgence of the urban square in London as a morphological type offers a valuable focus for such a study. Using the phenomenon of the 'new' London squares, this project aims to achieve a better understanding of the dominant critiques of public space by gauging if and how they relate to the design, development and subsequent use and management of new public spaces in London. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F042639/1","grantId":"ES/F042639/1","fundValue":"144266","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Following early presentations of the research (see below) Professor Carmona was asked to present at The Mayor's Design Discussion at City Hall in 2009, a conference of London 'movers and shakers' to consider design and public space issues in the context of a Mayor who (at the time) was seeking to establish a distinctive policy approach. \n\nOn the strength of this, Professor Carmona was commissioned by the Mayor's Design Advisory Panel in 2010 (at a time of widespread austerity cuts) to write a paper on the future of design governance in the capital as a feed into discussions about the Mayor's future role in design and public space agendas. Although not publically available, this paper was published in an edited form in both Town &amp;amp; Country Planning (the journal of the TCPA) and Urban Design (the journal of the Urban Design Group) (see below) and helped to make the argument for the retention of the Mayor's design advisory arm, Design for London.\n\nThe research also encouraged the London Assembly to launch an enquiry into the management of publically accessible space in London, with Professor Carmona acting as advisor to the enquiry, helping to establish its remit and evidence base. His work was extensively quoted in background papers and he appeared as a key witness in the public sessions that were reported in the professional press. The final report was published in 2011 in which views based on findings from the research are extensively quoted (see http://www.london.gov.uk/publication/public-life-private-hands) Environment Policy & public services","person":"Matthew Peter Carmona","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
