This is thought to create a sense of relatedness between them, which, in turn, is considered to enhance vitality. </p>\n\n<p>In order to explore how people generate synchronicity through (1) the use of vague and/or polysemous concepts during the therepeutic encounter and (2) tactility, the researchers will carry out language-competent ethnographic field research in Southwest China. The field results will be complemented with a seminar series and a conference on the broader theme of &quot;Blood, Vitality and Relatedness in Eastern Medicines and Religions&quot;.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1408","grantId":"RES-000-23-1408","fundValue":"185419","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elisabeth  Hsu","coPersons":["Charles  Ramble"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
