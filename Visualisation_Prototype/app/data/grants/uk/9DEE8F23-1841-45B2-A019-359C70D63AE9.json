Several such molecules have been found and one of these, called Foxg1, is the subject of this research. In mutant mice that are unable to make Foxg1, important regions of the brain do not develop normally but we do not understand exactly why this happens. Our aim is to identify the brain cells that need Foxg1 within themselves and why they need it. For example, Foxg1 might be needed to make particular sets of cells multiply at a normal rate, to make immature cells mature properly, to make cells connect correctly with other cells and to make cells send appropriate molecular instructions to other cells. To find out where Foxg1 acts to influence these processes we aim to make animals that are a mixture of mutant cells lacking Foxg1 and normal cells. If cells need Foxg1 within themselves, then mutant cells that do not have Foxg1 should not develop normally even if they are able to interact with cells that do have Foxg1. If a group of cells relies on molecules produced under the control of Foxg1 by another group of cells, then cells in the first group should develop normally (even if they lack Foxg1 themselves) provided they are able to interact with cells that do have Foxg1 and are, therefore, able to produce the important molecules. We plan to make chimaeric mice, containing a mixture of mutant and normal cells, to discover which mutant cells do not develop normally, and in what ways they fail to develop, even when normal cells are present for them to interact with. Defects that persist will indicate processes that require the actions of Foxg1 within the defective cells. In new mutant mice that we plan to make, we shall remove Foxg1 from subsets of the cells that normally express it, to find whether it has primary actions in those subsets and whether it has knock-on effects on other subsets. The results will contribute basic knowledge on the control of early brain development, which is poorly understood. In the long-term this will be relevant for attempts to understand and eventually treat neurological diseases thought to have their origin during early brain development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401376","grantId":"G0401376","fundValue":"414115","fundStart":"2005-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Price","coPersons":["John Douglas West","John Orr Mason"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
