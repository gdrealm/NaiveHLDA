The Research Network comprises research teams from the Population Research Centre, University of Groningen, The Netherlands, the Population Research Centre, Institute of Social and Economic Change, Bangalore, India, the Centre for Research on Ageing and ESRC Centre for Population Change University of Southampton, United Kingdom and the Centre for Development Studies, Trivandrum.</p>\n\n<p>The Network will use both quantitative and qualitative data to investigate ageing and well-being in a globalised world through the comparison of the situation of older people living in India, UK and Netherlands. A particular focus of the research will be on the role of public versus private transfers and the well-being of older people and the extent of intergenerational exchanges. It will provide state of the art reviews of existing research in order to identify knowledge gaps and new research areas, as well as providing opportunities for exchange of research expertise and capacity building.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005979/1","grantId":"ES/K005979/1","fundValue":"107370","fundStart":"2012-10-31","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Evandrou","coPersons":["Aravinda Meera Guntupalli","Sabu  Padmadas","Victoria  Hosegood","Athina  Vlachantoni"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
