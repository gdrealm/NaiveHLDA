{"id":"85C7EB89-973C-4C31-BA9A-FE530877FD77","title":"Revitalising the Health Equity Agenda","abstractText":"The potential to enjoy a healthy and secure life is core to human flourishing. Health services, health status and the future for health and social care continue to be a top priority for the public and political parties. Differences in health experiences and outcomes are well documented, whilst debates continue as to how best to address these. Given that recent evidence suggests that both economic inequalities and inequalities in health are widening, this series is a timely opportunity to bring together research and action. \n\nOur health status is based upon a range of biological, social, economic and geographical factors. Where we are born and the health status of our parents matters a lot. For most of the population household incomes, education and employment opportunities, along with any inheritance, dictate our social class and life chances. These opportunities differ across regions and localities too. Such is the concern of the public and the importance of health to our everyday lives that there are daily reports in the media on people's experiences of using health services and the implications of age, gender, social class and location on health outcomes. \n\nThe aim of this seminar series is to reinvigorate debates along with potential actions to address inequalities in health. We will work towards these goals through bringing together researchers, practitioners and policy makers from early to later career, to share and gain knowledge and insights. Debates will encourage wider thinking and ideas on how to best address the many factors which promote health and wellbeing. \n\nThe series comprises three one day conferences bringing together a wide audience and six seminars for focused discussion on specific case studies and policies. \n\nWe will use the framework provided by the World Health Organisation's Commission on Social Determinants of Health to organise the content of the series programme and bring debates alive through a case study of the North East of England, where health is generally worse in the North East than other regions in the UK and there are major disparities in health even within local boundaries. The series will produce a number of outputs for a range of audiences. There will be short briefing papers for the public and service providers; longer pieces for research and policy audiences; and social media and web based materials and debates. After 36 months of activity we will have established a strong network that will sustain long-term research programmes and engagement with public policy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M003027/1","grantId":"ES/M003027/1","fundValue":"27697","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Linda  McKie","coPersons":["Clare Louise Bambra","Kayleigh Ann Garthwaite","Katherine  Smith","Ann Marie  Connolly","Eugene Michael Milne","Theodore  Schrecker","Nancy  Cartwright","Kate Elizabeth Pickett"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
