Classifiers and role shift have traditionally been difficult to characterise linguistically because they share many characteristics with gesture, perhaps more than any other type of construction in the language. By examining these constructions within native signers and early and late learners, both adults and children, we hope to gain more insight into the visual-spatial language modality and also the relationship between sign language and gesture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119360/2","grantId":"119360/2","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kearsy Annette Cormier","coPersons":["Sandra Diane  Smith"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
