One way to treat patients would be to reduce the levels of the molecules on nerve cells that the immune system recognises. We have shown in cells grown in culture in the laboratory that this approach works. We now aim to find out whether similar benefit can be achieved in a living mouse with this type of disease. If this is successful, which we expect it to be, this will pave the way for testing this approach in patients affected by these paralytic nerve disorders. One advantage to our plan is that the drugs we intend to use are already available for use in patients with other diseases, but have never been tried in autoimmune nerve paralysis. Before this can be done, they must be thoroughly tested in an animal model of the disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700969","grantId":"G0700969","fundValue":"603652","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frances  Platt","coPersons":["Hugh John Willison"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
