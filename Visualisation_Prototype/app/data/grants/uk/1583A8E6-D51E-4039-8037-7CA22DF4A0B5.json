They are particularly significant in middle and old age, since this is the phase of life in which serious diseases such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers develop. We therefore need to understand what factors determine healthy behaviour choices. These activities are typically studied in isolation, but looking at multiple behaviours will help us understand the factors underlying broader healthy lifestyles. This proposal is for a series of analyses of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), a longitudinal study of more than 11,000 men and women from all regions of England who were aged between 50 and 100 when the study began in 2002. Our analysis will investigate whether smoking, alcohol misuse, physical activity, and fruit and vegetable intake cluster together in middle-aged and older adults, and if so, how these patterns of behaviour relate to socioeconomic position and geographical location. We will also investigate how patterns of health behaviour change over an 8 to 10 year period, and what role is played by economic, social and personal factors such as changing wealth, work and family situation, social support and physical and mental health. Our third aim is understand how these health behaviours are related to measures of biological function and mobility in older adults. The results will give us vital knowledge about the barriers to healthy lifestyles, and levers for change that operate for multiple health behaviours. They will help us develop new methods of encouraging lifestyle changes, particularly in socially disadvantaged sectors of the population, so as to maintain health in older people. This will also aid the promotion of active ageing and enhanced quality of life in later years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701830","grantId":"G0701830","fundValue":"193372","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Patrick Steptoe","coPersons":["Mary  Pierce","James  Banks","Michael Gideon Marmot","Anne Marie McMunn"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
