{"id":"C762E846-B072-4A95-9D59-5C1BE747CD05","title":"Feasibility Studies - Energy, People, Buildings and Systems","abstractText":"New knowledge, inventions and insights begin with an idea, but without further research and, very often funding, ideas can remain just that: they are not examined critically, their potential value in not tested, and thus their benefits to society are not realised. This Feasibility Account will provide researchers, technicians and academics with a forum for bringing forward their bright ideas together with the opportunity to access the support, time and funding needed to explore their ideas more fully. The Feasibility Account will fund ideas from three theme areas. The low carbon society: energy use for all purposes, buildings, transport, industry etc; alternative energy sources, especially renewable energy technologies; government policy, social attitudes and motivations, and the role of the media and other information vehicles.People, systems and buildings: reducing energy demand and increased energy efficiency for providing heat, cooling and light to building occupants, building design and construction and performance monitoring and maintenance - with the emphasis on meeting occupant needs through innovation, ICT applications, and novel people-centred design.Comfort, climate and demographics: the implications of the combined effects of climate change and shifts in demographics and lifestyles, such as the aging society, obesity and home working, on resource demands, health and well-being.Clearly, these areas are major concerns for humanity and yet solutions to these global problems still require new academic research - often research that combines academics from different disciplines, especially engineers and scientists working alongside social scientists and economists. Together they can address the complete pathway from technical potential through to financial viability and social acceptability.This Feasibility Account will support researchers who work across the many departments at Loughborough University. Through their previous joint projects, which are often co-ordinated through the Sustainability Research School, they have a track record of constructive collaboration. The Feasibility Account will build on and strengthen this culture of working, enable new and innovative ideas to be developed and identify those with clear potential. The strong links that the University has with industry and other stakeholders increases the likelihood that the ideas will ultimately be taken up for the wiser benefit of the society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I01652X/1","grantId":"EP/I01652X/1","fundValue":"202529","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kevin  Lomas","coPersons":["Dennis  Loveday"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
