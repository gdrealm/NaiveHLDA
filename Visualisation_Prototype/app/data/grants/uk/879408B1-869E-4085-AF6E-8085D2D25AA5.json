Detailed understanding and quantification of EA processes in isolated molecules and condensed environments is therefore essential to model radiation effects on the nanoscale. My EPSRC CAF probes EA resonances and reactive pathways in Stark-selected biomolecular clusters, building on recent advances such as the observation of electron driven proton transfer in Watson Crick pairs [Bowen et al. ChemPhysChem 11 (2010) 880]. However, relatively little is known about how clustering modifies EA absolute cross sections. While theoretical calculations by my collaborators Fabrikant and Gorfinkiel [J. Chem. Phys. 136 (2012) 184301] have provided evidence for strong enhancements in specific cluster configurations, experimental cross sections for EA to clusters are extremely rare. This project is centered on developing an original technique to produce neutral mass-selected beams with known target density for EA experiments. The method involves neutralization of quadrupole-selected cluster anions by electron photo-detachment from specific weakly-bound anionic states, with minimal change in stability and hence dissociation. The project will provide a breakthrough in quantifying the effects of the local chemical environment on electron attachment processes.\nThe project is at the experimental proof of principle stage. Detailed simulations have been carried out and independent parts of the experiment (notably the cluster source and the quadrupole selector) have been tested (revealing some intriguing data related to stable cluster configurations aside from the main goals of the project). We are currently assembling the entire system to verify the approach and optimize the performance. Complementary experiments (multi-photon ionization and electron impact experiments) have been carried out within the framework of the project on some of the target systems that we intend study (notably hydrated DNA bases). This has led to two publications in international journals as well as a number of conference outputs. The project is expected to deliver advances linked to the EPSRC's grand challenges: Understanding the Physics of Life and Novel treatment and therapeutic technologies. This will particularly relate to developments in simulating radiation damage and nano-scale dosimetry in aqueous environments with applications in radiotherapy treatment planning. Notwithstanding the recognized role of dissociative electron attachment in radiation damage to DNA17 (both direct damage and through DEA to water molecules producing local OH radicals), low-energy electron interactions are not accounted for in radiotherapy treatment planning. Advancing the efficacy of cancer therapy methods is essential in view of the UK's aging population and the resultant increasing pressure on the healthcare system. Moreover, computing power no longer prohibits the practical applications of the most accurate Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these effects. Therefore, the development of optimized radiation track simulations applying the most reliable EA and DEA cross sections possible will have real benefits for society. The absolute cross sections for water clusters measured during this project will be integrated into Garcia's simulations [Garcia et al. IJMS 277 (2008) 175] (LEPTS, currently based on gas-phase cross sections) as part of a new strategy to account for the hydrogen-bonded environment. Garcia has strong connections with oncologists who are currently carrying out trials comparing clinical radiotherapy treatment plans with damage distributions derived using LEPTS.\n\nFurthermore, the project will impact on society through its contribution to understanding environmental chemistries. The small neutral and charged water clusters studied in this project are prevalent in the atmosphere. Furthermore, they can provide model systems to help us understand processes in larger clusters, ice crystals, and droplets. Evidently the diverse phases of water play key roles in atmospheric dynamical processes and simulations of their interactions with low energy electrons (the most abundant secondary products of ionizing radiation) require absolute cross sections. Currently available experimental cross sections for electron attachment to selected water clusters are limited to non-dissociative electron attachment. Absolute experimental data is not available for DEA to any doped water clusters. Our choices of doped cluster targets (hydrated CF3Cl) are partially motivated by the suitability of these species for Gorfinkiel and Fabrikant's calculations [Fabrikant, Gorfinkiel et al. J. Chem. Phys. 136 (2012) 184301] and partially by their role in ozone depletion chemistries in polar stratospheric clouds [Tachikawa et al. PCCP 10 (2008) 2200]. While the specific complexes studied in this project are not expected to have a significant presence in these environments, they can have a major impact on the residence time of CF3Cl at lower altitudes and hence on the molecule's transport to polar stratospheric clouds. Enhanced DEA cross sections for CF3Cl in hydrated clusters can therefore have significant implications for modeling ozone depletion. Chemicals,Environment,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
