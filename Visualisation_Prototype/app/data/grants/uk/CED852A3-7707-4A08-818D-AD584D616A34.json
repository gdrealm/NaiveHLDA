Glaucoma is an eye disease characterized by damage to specialized neurons of the retina (known as ganglion cells) and the optic nerve (the part that connects the eye to the brain). This disease constitutes a common cause of severe vision impairment and blindness. This investigation stems from our previous demonstration that a population of adult human retinal stem cells discovered in our laboratory and known as Muller stem cells, have the ability to differentiate into ganglion cells and to restore the visual response to very dim light in animals depleted of ganglion cells. To advance our work towards the development of human therapies, we aim to validate our previous findings using an experimental eye model that is close to humans. We will therefore investigate whether transplantation of Muller stem cells differentiated into ganglion cells are able to restore visual function in the feline retina after chemical depletion of these cells. We have isolated and characterized Muller stem cells from the cat retina and can propagate these cells for transplantation. The main objectives of our proposed research are i) to isolate and propagate Muller stem cells from the cat retina and to differentiate these cells into ganglion cells for transplantation, ii) to induce ganglion cell depletion in the cat retina by intraocular injection of neurotoxins, and to repopulate these cells with differentiated ganglion cells iii) to assess retinal function in the transplanted animals by examination of their visual function in response to light, and iv) to examine the localization of transplanted cells into the retina, as well as to assess the long term survival of these cells. On this basis, our ultimate aim is to advance this research into an immediate translational stage towards the development of human therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900002","grantId":"G0900002","fundValue":"714368","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gloria Astrid Limb","coPersons":["Matteo  Carandini","Peng Tee  Khaw"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
