Much is known about the structures of functional states and how they are reached from newly synthesised proteins, but incorrect assembly has proven to be challenging to understand and control. Such questions lie at the heart of the nature of polypeptides and proteins as the molecules of life, but are also of crucial importance for problems of great practical value. Indeed, disorders resulting from aberrant assembly of proteins include Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, conditions which are increasingly prevalent and problematic in an ageing society. One of the key unknowns in protein aggregation phenomena concerns the nature of the first events that trigger proteins to undergo aberrant assembly from their normal soluble states. These processes are difficult to probe as the initial stages of aggregation phenomena involve only a few misfolded proteins amongst millions of soluble proteins, and such nucleation events are therefore very challenging to locate within the relatively large volumes that are used in traditional biochemical experiments. The proposed work addresses this challenge by devising strategies for performing measurements directly in volumes small enough to contain a single nucleation event. Through this approach, we will be able to probe directly the manner in which the conversion of proteins into insoluble structures propagates from the initial nucleation stage and eventually leads to significant loss of solubility of proteins. The practical strategy for enabling measurements in such small volumes will be through the creation of a large number of miniature water droplets within an inert oil. Using this approach, it is possible to study simultaneously under a microscope thousands of individual aggregation reactions in different microdroplets. The ability to perform large numbers of such experiments is particularly valuable for the systematic search for different compounds which have the potential to stop of reverse the pathological aggregation of proteins of the type associated with protein deposition diseases. The most prevalent class of such disorders includes Alzheimer's disease, and together with related forms of dementia, is rapidly becoming one of the greatest strains on the healthcare system. Indeed in the UK alone, the costs associated with these conditions reach tens of billions of pounds per year and are expected to rise sharply in the next few years. The basic technology required for large scale studies of protein solubility is therefore of increasing practical importance, and the microdroplet-based approach developed in this project has the potential to increase the throughput of such studies by many orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J002119/1","grantId":"BB/J002119/1","fundValue":"320429","fundStart":"2012-03-31","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The microfluidic methods that we have developed in the context of the grant &quot;New approaches for microscopic analysis of macromolecular assemblies&quot; have already resulted in four filed patents, and a startup company, Fluidic Analytics has been spun out of our research group to take these methods forwards.

We have used microdroplets as a platform for this new assay. We have shown its applicability for the proteins insulin and lysozyme (Mueller et al, Lab on a chip 2014). Moreover, we have demonstrated acquisition of structural information from such miniature compartments, and have shown that we can follow the conversion of proteins from their normal soluble states into pathological amyloid forms by measuring directly their infra-red spectra by using nanoIR methods for the first time in microdroplets. Moreover, we have been able to fabricate devices for measuring the diffusion and movement in an electric field (Herling et al, APL 2013); we demonstrated this method for small molecules as a test system, but have results on proteins and their aggregates and two manuscripts on this work are being prepared for publication. The microfluidic methods that we have developed for probing protein aggregation have received interest in the context of characterising proteins more generally. We have already been able to found a company to take forward these methods and transform them into a format which will alow their routine use by the wider biological community. This company (http://www.fluidicanalytics.com/) has already received support from the commercial arm of the University, Cambridge Enterprise as well as from the Technology Strategy Board.
