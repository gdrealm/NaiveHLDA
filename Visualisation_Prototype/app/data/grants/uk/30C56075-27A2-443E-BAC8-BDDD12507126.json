There are many factors that can influence how people cope with the loss of a loved one, including level of family support, financial resources, stress, and the circumstances surrounding death.<br /><br />By studying use of prescription medications to help with mental health, we can get a better understanding of how factors such as age, gender, family support, employment and religion affect how people cope after bereavement. By looking at circumstances of bereavement this study will also discover if the factors that help people cope - such as family support - are more or less important depending on how they lost their loved ones.<br /><br />The Grief Study is based on data from the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study, this holds information on around 500,000 people. By linking this data with the Northern Ireland Mortality Study and Health and Social care information on prescriptions, the Grief Study aims to learn more about bereavement, mental health, complicated grief, and longer term outcomes for people who have lost a loved one.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00428X/1","grantId":"ES/K00428X/1","fundValue":"152263","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  McCann","coPersons":["Dermot  O'Reilly"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" This study looked at the factors that influence poor mental health after bereavement. People who were bereaved due to suicide were around twice as likely to take antidepressants than those who were not bereaved. People bereaved due to a sudden death also had poorer mental health than those bereaved following illness.\n\nThe study also looked at mental health among informal carers, and at how factors such as affluence and deprivation, and education influence mental health after bereavement. The findings are being used by members of the Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Bereavement network to better inform their work, and their efforts in training Health and Social Care workers in how to deal with bereaved people in contact with these services.
