{"id":"C23A729A-4B95-41D9-86EB-2736821FC500","title":"Translating Music","abstractText":"As a mode of artistic communication, music is translation by essence. It 'transmutates' aesthetics sensibilities (Jakobson), transcends and translates cultures, enabling interactions across communities. Yet the phenomenon of translation in music is complex. Does a famous song like Guantanamera, sung and translated in a wide range of languages, strongly evoke Cuba, or just exoticise it in the imagination of the listeners? Can Frank Sinatra's 'If you go away' be considered a translation of Jacques Brel's original song? Music from all countries and cultures can be listened to easily, but can it be understood? While the largest awards and music talent shows, largely driven by the US and UK who still hold more than 40% of the music market value, are still dominated by English, music featuring foreign languages is promoted through a range of sites (e.g. Music Alliance Pact), genres (opera, world music, film music) and platforms (radio, internet, digital juke-boxes, cinema, television, particularly music television channels, live performances). Yet the interconnections of translation and music have not been widely explored and verbal language, often part of musical texts, remains a barrier to social cohesion as words are frequently left untranslated or are poorly suited to a multimodal context. \n\nThis network brings together an interdisciplinary network of academics, music and translation professionals, and industry providers to foster new developments in the mediation of musical texts and engage in a debate on the complexities and the challenges of music mediation in the 21st century. Exploring the interpersonal, intercultural, intralinguistic and interlinguistic bridges on which music and translation intersect, it examines how words linked to music are currently translated. It will also map out current practices to identify how to improve the provision of such translation to make music more widely accessible, and multicultural forms of expression both more visible and more valued. In particular, contemporary translation and accessibility models provided for opera will be examined with the aim of considering them in other musical contexts. Opera houses, under criticism for being elitist and therefore under pressure to provide access to a wide public, are successful pioneers in the provision of intralinguistic and interlinguistic translation. They are also successful in adapting past works into representations that are meaningful to present audiences. Besides, opera and its contemporary new forms are offered in translation in several formats from film to radio broadcast or live performance and actively engage with new technologies in order to connect with audiences.\n\nTranslation strategies and technologies pioneered in opera, still the leader in successful translation provision, can be useful models for other musical forms and genres in film, television and multimedia. This network will chart the most important developments to be considered so that the art that 'hears cultures' (Erlman) can also translate them. A range of events to promote the development of the translation of musical texts will take place, fostering interaction between translators working in the field of music, translation and accessibility managers and different music providers. Partners with expertise in translating and making music accessible to contemporary audiences are keen to develop new technologies, undertake research in the mediation of music and exchange ideas across different sectors of the music industry. National accessibility organisations are also offering expertise and cooperation, involving end users to take part in applied research on accessibility and music.\n\nWhen surtitles were introduced in opera, audiences unanimously claimed how much they enhanced their enjoyment of music. The ultimate role of this international network is to make similar enhancements possible across all musical audiences and performances.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J012653/1","grantId":"AH/J012653/1","fundValue":"22389","fundStart":"2013-06-03","fundEnd":"2014-02-02","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The Translating Music Network is a reference network in the field and has established important communications internationally Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural,Societal,Policy & public services","person":"Lucile Anne Desblache","coPersons":["Helen Julia  Minors"],"organisation":"Roehampton University","findingsText":" This network project was instrumental in several respects:\n\n1) Finding out the broad range of contexts in which the translation of musical texts is taking place, from opera houses to the film industry;\n\n2) Mapping out the different texts types in which music translation is determinant;\n\n3) Identifying key priorities for the visually impaired and the blind in accessing live music events; \n\n4) Determining how music is able to translate the sense of other art forms;\n\n5) Building a website with a wide variety of resources which has become the only substantial reference in this field.\n\n\n\nThe investigators have already submitted a number of articles and chapters on topics relating to the network. Most will be published at the end of 2014 or in 2015 and therefore cannot be entered at this stage on to the Outcomes section. They include:\n\n\n\nAH/J012653/1 Helen Julia Minors, Book Chapter &quot;Translating Music and Text: an intercultural new performance of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;, to be published in Pam Burnard, Elizabeth McKinley and Kimberley Powell (eds), The Routledge Handbook of Intercultural Arts Theory, Research and Practice.

Presses Sorbonne Nouvelle, Paris. Estimated date of publication June 2015 This network's aim was primarily to bring together academic researchers, third sector workers, members of the media industry and a wide range of audiences to raise awareness, discuss and cross-fertilize ideas about how music is, should and could be translated. \n\n\n\nThis network has offered twelve public events: 3 seminars, 1 symposium, 3 workshops, 1 touch tour for the blind, 1 touch tour for children, plenary meetings with third sector organisations and disabled audience members and 1 public concert.\n\n\n\nThe wide ranging impact of this work is evidenced by the response of academic and non-academic participants asking to take part in this network. The network investigators have also been invited to give talks to universities in the UK (University of Cambridge, Imperial College, London, University College London, University of London, Cardiff University, Liverpool Hope University) , abroad (University of Paris III Sorbonne Nouvelle, Voldva University, Norway, University of the Basque Country, Victoria), to artistic institutions (Gallery Studio, Rose Theatre, Kingston), and at the European Commission (Lucile Desblache, plenary lecture for the annual Translation Forum given at the Directorate General for Translation in Brussels and Luxembourg in April 2014). \n\nA number of accessible concerts and performances (with Helen Julia Minor's Soundpainting Ensemble for instance) have also taken place and generated further engagements for the future. \n\n\n\nNew material is still being added to the Translating Music website and their subscribers (to date around 700) are informed of these additions, which generate responses and further suggestions for the general public, from scholars and from various institutions (theatres, musical venues...).\n\n\n\nStepping stones for further work on how to broaden music accessibility have been laid, with strong links established with media multilingual content providers (such as Media Deluxe) and musical institutions (Royal Opera House) leading to plans to engage in further developments.
