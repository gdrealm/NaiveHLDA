{"id":"BF97002D-FCD9-4A55-9A6F-750355ADCE4C","title":"Transcostal High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Cancer","abstractText":"The efficacy of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the non-invasive treatment of cancer has been clearly demonstrated for a range of different cancers including those of the liver, prostate and breast. As a non-invasive focal therapy, HIFU offers considerable advantages over other techniques such as chemotherapy and surgery, in terms of invasiveness and risk of harmful side-effects. Despite its advantages, however, there are a number of significant challenges currently hindering its widespread clinical application, specifically: the need to transmit energy through the rib cage and the associated risk of skin burns and damage to the rib surface, the effects of organ motion on treatment accuracy, a poor understanding of cavitation processes in vivo and, finally, the lack of effective techniques for real-time image guidance and treatment monitoring. The overall objective of the research programme described in this document is to develop practical solutions for these issues. Successful completion of this proposal will result in a prototype clinical device for the safe and effective HIFU treatment of tumours of the liver, kidney and pancreas that has undergone preclinical testing and conforms to the necessary safety standards for patient use.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F02617X/1","grantId":"EP/F02617X/1","fundValue":"589916","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Constantin  Coussios","coPersons":["Peter  Friend"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
