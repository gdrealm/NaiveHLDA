It forms part of the core population census resources which form the basis for census related research , teaching and learning.The aim is to enhance the productivity of researchers, staff and students by providing&nbsp; centrally what would be impossible or needlessly wasteful to be done locally.</p>\n\n<p>The interim funding year 2011-2012 will, under direction from ESRC, focus on a 'care and maintenance' role only. Work will cover activities that are integral to the core function of providing ongoing access to the UK&nbsp; census geography outputs and does not cover any activities related to the development of new services, resources, training or outreach activities.</p>\n\n<p>However, the core aims of UKBORDERS remain unchanged as: <br /><br /></p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to continue to provide those in UK education and research with cost-effective access to a resource of digitised&nbsp; boundary data, ancillary look-up tables and supporting materials for thematic mapping and GIS operations</li>\n\n <li>to continue to provide support and assistance to that community in the exploitation of these resources</li>\n\n <li>to continue to support the development and then realisation of the ESRC national data strategy.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The key objectives for the service are: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>To continue as the ESRC's Geography Data Unit for census related geographical data outputs and to provide advice, support and assistance to other census units with issues relating to geographic data. UKBORDERS will continue to&nbsp; assume primary responsibility within the Census Programme for the delivery, maintenance and support of the core&nbsp; census geography outputs.</li>\n\n <li>To maintain the existing UKBORDERS facilities and to continue to provide direct support (via a Help Desk)&nbsp; to the existing user base.</li>\n\n <li>To continue to support the core programme via engagement with data providers and external stakeholders, and to&nbsp; ensure that academic interests are adequately represented in the preparations for, and aftermath of, the 2011 census.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-348-25-0008-01","grantId":"RES-348-25-0008-01","fundValue":"91121","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Michael Burnhill","coPersons":["James  Reid"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
