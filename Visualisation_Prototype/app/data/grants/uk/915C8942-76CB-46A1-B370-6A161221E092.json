Topo IV crosses one DNA helix through another allowing the separation of topologically interlocked chromosomes. It does this by an unusual mechanism: it makes a transient double-stranded DNA break (often called a 'gate') in one molecule through which the second DNA molecule is passed. Antibacterial quinolone drugs act by stabilising the open DNA gate which interferes with DNA replication causing cell death. Indeed, quinolones are now important drugs for the treatment of pneumonia and other infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and othe Gram-positive pathogens. Despite it scientific interest and medical importance, little is known about the mechanism of topo IV and its drug interactions. In this study, we aim to examine (i)how S. pneumoniae topo IV recognises and opens potential gate sequences in DNA, and (ii) how quinolones stabilize such gates. The work will make use of synthetic and altered versions of a known topo IV gate which we identified on the S. pneumoniae chromosome. We shall also study the binding of mutant topo IV complexes to identify key protein residues that function to contact and open the DNA gate. Progress on topo IV and its DNA gates will advance fundamental understanding of chromosome biology and will aid the future design of more effective quinolones.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D014484/1","grantId":"BB/D014484/1","fundValue":"264537","fundStart":"2006-08-21","fundEnd":"2010-02-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The main impact of our work has been two-fold: academic and pharmaceutical. First, it has provided a breakthrough in understanding the mechanism of topoisomerase action and how quinolone drugs capture the enzyme-DNA complex to exert their antibacterial effects. Second, access to the crystal structures we have generated has provided key information to pharmaceutical companies in aiding their efforts to design new topoisomerase-targeting therapeutics including those that exploit novel binding sites on the enzyme-DNA complex. Our Nature paper resulting from this work has consequently been highly cited in the field.

The main achievements were:\n\n1. A novel DNA cleavage assay has been developed that allows the rapid identification of the DNA cleavage requirements. The assay will be widely applicable to all type II topoisomerases that act via a double-stranded DNA break.\n2. By using the assay in concert with site-directed mutagenesis, we have for the first time established the DNA, drug and protein requirements for quinolone-induced DNA cleavage by topo IV (Arnoldi E, Pan X-S and Fisher LM (2013) Nucleic Acids Res 41, 9411-9424, 2013.\n3. Using DNA recognition data and subunit domains generated during this study, we have solved the crystal structures of quinolone-DNA cleavage complexes of topo IV, the first for any type II topoisomerase (Laponogov I et al Nat Struct Mol Biol 16, 667, 2009). These structures provide a molecular insight into quinolone action and resistance and constitute a valuable framework for drug development Our work provides the first crystal structures to reveal how quinolones-a clinically important group of antimicrobial agents- interact with their clinical target, the enzyme topoisomerase IV. These structural insights not only explain the mode of action of known drugs, but will guide attempts by pharmaceutical companies to develop new agents that act to circumvent resistance. These key structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank-entries 3FOE and 3FOF. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
