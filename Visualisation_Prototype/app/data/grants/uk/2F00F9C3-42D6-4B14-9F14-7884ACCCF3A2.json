{"id":"2F00F9C3-42D6-4B14-9F14-7884ACCCF3A2","title":"How is the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint turned off?","abstractText":"When a cell divides it is essential that the two daughter cells inherit an equal and identical copy of the chromosomes. When this goes wrong it can be lethal for the cell, or even lead to cancer. To prevent such errors the cell is able to stop and wait in the middle of dividing if it detects that any of its chromosomes are not being pulled to the middle of the cell by a machine called the mitotic spindle. It is only when all the chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle that the cell goes on to divide its chromosomes. We are investigating this process and in particular the mechanism that links how the cell detects whether chromosomes are attached to the spindle to the engine that drives cells through mitosis. We would like work out how the 'brake' on the engine is removed when all the chromosomes are attached. This mechanism is the target of a number of anti-cancer drugs, therefore, a better understanding of how this mechanism works should help to design better drugs with fewer side-effects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I022376/1","grantId":"BB/I022376/1","fundValue":"293249","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our work has been cited 12 (web of science) or 22 (Google scholar) times in the 12 months since it was published.

We have found that binding to this site in the absence of the APC15 subunit 'locks' the checkpoint complex onto the APC/C and prevents its disassembly. More specifically we think that this is because the Mad2 subunit cannot leave the complex. We are currently attempting to elucidate the pathway by which this complex is disassembled.\n\n\n\nIn parallel, we have developed an assay to measure the 'strength' of the spindle assembly checkpoint and have correlated this with the numbers of kinetochores that recruit Mad2, and are using these findings to generate a computational model for the checkpoint. These results were published as Collin et al., 2013 in Nature Cell Biology. This work has implications for understanding the therapeutic effect of spindle poisons.
