{"id":"E1CEC6AB-E0B7-40CB-8E27-C851508D8997","title":"The 2010 Federated Logic Conference","abstractText":"FLoC (Federated Logic Conference) is a quadrennial two-week event that brings together eight top conferencesapplying methods of logic in computer science, and about 60 workshops. The area is of great importance to computing research: logic provides computer science with both a unifying foundational framework and a tool for modelling computing systems; it has been called ``the calculus of computer science,'' and played a crucial role in diverse areas such as artificial intelligence, computational complexity, distributed computing, database systems, hardware design, programming languages, and software engineering. The research of just over 20% of Turing award winners has been on the application of logic to computer science; in the UK, five of the current eight UKCRC grand challenges are in FLoC areas.The proposal is to enable us to invite top-level researchers to deliver plenaries and tutorials at FLoC, to makeFLoC particularly attractive to students and to make it easier for researchers from the UK and elsewhereto attend FLoC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H043055/1","grantId":"EP/H043055/1","fundValue":"31980","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  FLoC, one of the largest and most prestigious computer science conferences ever to be held in the UK, attracted about 1200 participants. It provided a unique opportunity for UK-based researchers, students, and industry to be exposed to cutting edge research in an area that is often described as the &quot;calculus of computer science&quot;.\n\nThe impact of FLoC will be felt for a number of years to come. As well as learning the most recent developments, UK academics and industrialists had the opportunity to network with each other and their international colleagues, thereby providing great opportunity to strengthen current links and start new projects. Again, UK students are now better prepared for their research and for the challenges they will face after graduating, be it in academia or industry.\n\n\nRunning a successful conference of such high visibility was very positive for the international reputation of the UK in this area. It made the UK a more attractive place for other important conferences in computer science. Furthermore, the conference gave people from home and abroad, whether students, researchers or others, the chance to see Edinburgh Informatics and help attract them to study and work there.\n\nThe repetitional gain to the UK will have had an indirect economic benefit. Further, FLoC was of direct economic significance: the Edinburgh Convention Bureau estimated the UK economic benefit at ?4.7M.
