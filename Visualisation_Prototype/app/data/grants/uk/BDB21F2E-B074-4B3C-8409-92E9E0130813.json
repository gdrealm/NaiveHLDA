To win observing time on a world-class telescope is no mean feat, as astronomers often propose so many ideas to use these telescopes that there should be more than 5 times more nights in a year than there actually are to execute these ideas. In practice, only the best proposals will be granted time. This proposal requests funding for Leeds astronomers to travel to these world-class facilities and conduct their observations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M002160/1","grantId":"ST/M002160/1","fundValue":"20243","fundStart":"2014-11-11","fundEnd":"2017-04-10","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Rene  Oudmaijer","coPersons":["Melvin  Hoare","Stuart Leonard  Lumsden"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
