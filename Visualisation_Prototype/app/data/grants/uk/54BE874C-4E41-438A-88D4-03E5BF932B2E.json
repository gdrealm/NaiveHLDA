{"id":"54BE874C-4E41-438A-88D4-03E5BF932B2E","title":"Artificial Ligament with Bioactive Nanostructure (ALBioN)","abstractText":"This project will develop a medical device for the regenerative repair of torn ligaments using a platform technology for the production of smart, nanocomposite materials based on collagen, glycosaminoglycans and a bioactive calcium phosphate. The aim is to develop a graft which is capable of replacing the full anterior cruciate ligament. The technology will also be appropriate for the much less demanding application of ligament donor site repair. The effects of collagen fibril length, process parameters and cross-link density on the stucture and properties of the materials will be studied, allowing tailored design of the graft.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F006977/1","grantId":"DT/F006977/1","fundValue":"627945","fundStart":"2008-04-14","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Novel treatments for rotator cuff injury are indicated by this research. \n\nResearch has also extended into the development of related scaffolds for\n\n - heart patches and vascular grafts (funded by British Heart Foundation)\n\n - in vitro mammary gland for screening of breast cancer treatments and personalised medicine initiatives\n\n - culture and differentiation of megakaryocytes for platelet production Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Ruth Elizabeth Cameron","coPersons":["Serena  Best","Neil  Rushton"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The project was extremely worthwhile.
