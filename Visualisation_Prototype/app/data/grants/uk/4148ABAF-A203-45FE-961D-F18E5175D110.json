{"id":"4148ABAF-A203-45FE-961D-F18E5175D110","title":"Interactions between HIV-1 and iron","abstractText":"Infection with HIV-1 leads to AIDS. Around the world, the number of people infected with HIV-1 is increasing, and current forms of medicine do not adequately control the spread of the virus. There are clues in previous scientific studies suggesting that HIV-1 needs iron to grow efficiently, and we have found evidence that HIV-1 itself manipulates people?s cells in order to obtain this iron. The research proposal has two parts; the first is to find out how HIV-1 affects the handling of iron by infected cells. The second is to find out if deliberately altering how infected cells obtain iron can reduce the spread of HIV-1. Together the two sections should increase our understanding of the HIV-1/AIDS problem and may suggest more effective methods of controlling the virus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700844","grantId":"G0700844","fundValue":"247690","fundStart":"2008-02-12","fundEnd":"2011-02-11","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Hal  Drakesmith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
