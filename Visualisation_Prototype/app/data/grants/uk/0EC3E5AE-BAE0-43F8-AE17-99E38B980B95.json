In PD, structures called ?Lewy bodies? are found inside nerve cells in affected regions of the brain. Lewy bodies contain abnormal fibres made out of a protein called alpha-synuclein and the formation of these alpha-synuclein deposits inside Lewy bodies is an important step in the development of PD. Interestingly, we have found that alpha-synuclein is also present in human blood. Furthermore, the levels of this protein appear to be altered in blood samples from patients with PD. We now propose to set up an extensive study to determine if alpha-synuclein in blood can be used as a diagnostic marker to help to discriminate PD from other movement disorders, or to follow the clinical progression of the disease. We will also run a clinical trial on a potential new drug for PD and as part of this trial we will monitor the effects of this drug on alpha-synuclein levels in blood. This will help us to determine if alpha-synuclein can be used as a marker in many future drug trials. Ultimately, it is hoped that a blood test can be developed to allow detection of PD during its early stages, when treatment is likely to be most effective. The development of alpha-synuclein as a biological marker would be expected to lead to major improvements in the treatment and quality of life of people with PD.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601364","grantId":"G0601364","fundValue":"393109","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Allsop","coPersons":["David Michael Mann","John Douglas Mitchell","Peter John Diggle"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
