{"id":"671C591A-31AF-44B2-9F54-8F74C0C5E99C","title":"Elizabeth Taylor: From Child to Adult Star","abstractText":"Voted seventh greatest female screen legend by the American Film Institute, Elizabeth Taylor is widely regarded as one of the major film stars of the twentieth century. Yet while she seems to epitomize the glamour and allure of movie stardom (as something that extends well beyond the boundaries of the films themselves), the intense scrutiny that her off-screen life has received in the press has often had the effect, along with the media's preoccupation with her beauty and changing physical appearance, of deflecting attention away from her achievements as an actress. This project seeks to remedy this neglect by offering the first sustained academic study of Elizabeth Taylor's work in film. In doing so, it will examine the distinctive nature of her performing style and the traditions of acting on which it draws, the ways in which her performance style evolved - along with her star persona - during the course of her career, the creative effects arising from her collaborations with particular directors and stars, the importance of certain films as star vehicles for Taylor, and the contribution made by these and other elements to the formation of her overall star identity. The value of studying Taylor also derives from the fact that she offers a fascinatingly rare instance of a performer who managed to make the successful transition from child to adult star and in researching the complex dynamics underpinning this trajectory, this project aims to shed light on the issues arising from such a process. While advocating the importance of assessing Taylor's film work on its own terms, the study will at the same time consider the often complex and tension-ridden interactions that emerged between her on and off-screen personae and the impact of her broader star and celebrity image on the development and reception of her work. In tackling such areas, this research aims to make a major contribution to our understanding of Elizabeth Taylor's cultural significance as both child and adult star while also demonstrating the value of making performance central to the study of stardom as a whole.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H004726/1","grantId":"AH/H004726/1","fundValue":"38353","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Within academia and beyond, my Elizabeth Taylor research has been recognised for its role both in redressing the long-standing neglect of this star's acting achievements and in demonstrating the value, more broadly, of a performance-based approach to the study of stars (in particular, by combining close analysis of Taylor's movie performances with an historical study of the factors that influenced her development as an actress). In an online, open access article, performance studies specialist Sharon Marie Carnicke contemplates the reasons for the habitual devaluation of Taylor's acting before observing that 'A respectful and insightful study of her craft finally appeared in 2012, one year after her death, when Susan Smith carefully interrogated &quot;some of the influences that helped shape her professional development&quot;' (The Cine-Files 6, Dossier on Film Performance, Spring 2014, pp.1-2). Quotes from my Taylor book featured positively in Christine Geraghty's keynote paper at the Inaugural Celebrity Studies Journal Conference in Melbourne, Australia in December 2012 and I've been invited to give talks on this funded research at various prestigious events in the UK and overseas. 'Total Film', one of the best-selling movie magazines (available in print/online and via iTunes and Amazon kindle) gave my book an enthusastic review, observing that: 'Smith packs her volume with telling detail and a vivid re-evaluation of the actress's incredible flair for engaging with audiences' while the eyeforfilm website recommended it as 'a first rate piece of analysis that will interest fans and budding performers alike'. As one of the books that launched the BFI's Film Stars series (which I coedit) in 2012, my Taylor study has contributed to the impact of this major publishing venture which has a wide readership that extends beyond academia. The series has generated a diverse range of book launch events (attended by members of the general public), inspired growing interest from scholars wanting to write for the series and informed various conferences. \n\nIn uncovering the importance of Taylor's early career, moreover, my research project has helped forge new research into the underexplored realm of child stardom and performance, most notably through the Child Actors/Child Stars conference that I co-organised in 2011 and the dossier on Child Performance that I coedited for Screen in 2012. The conference was the first of its kind to focus exclusively on the contribution made by child actors to the history of international film and television and brought together leading international experts in the field along with former child actors and film archivists. One of the special events involved an interview that I co-hosted with Jon Whiteley who talked about his experiences as a child actor making films with directors Fritz Lang and Philip Leacock and movie star Dirk Bogarde. The conference (which featured my tribute by video essay to Elizabeth Taylor) enjoyed substantial media coverage in the local and regional press and was attended by members of the general public as well as academics. The project's focus on Taylor's later career (including her work in television) means that its findings have also informed current debates in the media about female celebrity and ageing, most notably through my role as invited speaker at the Age Spots and Spotlights: Celebrity, Performance and Ageing symposium held at Birkbeck College, University of London in December 2011 and my contribution to a Celebrity Studies journal special issue on female celebrity and ageing in 2012. The symposium attracted significant national press coverage, prompting an article by Janet Street Porter in her Daily Mail column in which she commented: 'A group of academics last week held a symposium at Birkbeck College at the University of London to discuss the impact of ageing and celebrity, and their findings are fascinating.' In a journal review of this event, David Lusted observes: 'If ever a conference could be considered timely and local, here it was'; he notes the relevance of this topic 'just as celebrities were finishing their scene-stealing evidence to the Leveson Enquiry, and but the day before a leading Government minister attributed recent widespread civil unrest on British high streets to &quot;celebrity culture&quot; before pointing out, 'However, [that] in the conjunction of celebrity and ageing, this conference had an intriguingly finer focus'. The panel I was part of culminated in discussion with an audience consisting not only of academics but artists, teachers, study skills tutors, writers, researchers, psychotherapists and representatives from the older women's network, Growing Old Disgracefully. Routledge's decision to republish the Celebrity Studies special issue (including my Taylor piece) in extended book form is another indication of increasing awareness of the importance of these debates. On the death of Elizabeth Taylor in March 2011, I was interviewed widely by the local and regional press and, as a result, helped inform debates about the actress's cultural significance and legacy, especially regarding the need to reappraise her acting career and the importance of compassion in connecting her work as screen performer and humanitarian. In 2014, I was invited to write the entry on Dame Elizabeth Taylor for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and on 2nd December 2014 I'm participating in an event organized by the University of Sunderland for World AIDS Day. In June 2015, I'm giving a public lecture on Elizabeth Taylor at the Maulds Meaburn Village Institute in Cumbria as part of that community's programme of events (run in conjunction with Eden Arts' REMOTE: Rural Touring Cinema scheme).
