CO2 is available in cylinders or bulk tanks however these create a price 'bottle neck' that has not yet been overcome in any sustainable way to date. Gas supply severely limits the nature of large scale experimentation to investigate and predict climate change. Predictions may have a profound impact on global commodity prices in the future and are therefore important to many organisations. To meet the need for cost effective CO2 gas supply, Aberystwyth University researchers are developing a sustainable, carbon neutral device for concentrating and controlling high levels of carbon dioxide gas. \n\nUnder this Pathfinder an assessment of the commercial need and intellectual property position will define the specific market opportunity in research experimentation. An additional application, for the scale up of the device in horticulture, will be evaluated as existing CO2 supply costs currently limit the benefits to using this gas to accelerate crop yield. Essential to the market review is the calculation of a competitive, estimated Cost of Goods for a manufactured device. This calculation will inform the evaluation of the most appropriate route to market for the technology. Technical work under the Pathfinder, in the form of a high risk technical milestone, is required to confirm that the device (in its optimised design) will meet defined industry requirements for controlled CO2 flow and concentration. This technical requirement is essential to progress the technology towards a product of high commercial interest.\n\nFindings would underpin an application for Follow on Funding. Under the Follow on Fund it is envisaged that the commercial design specification for a research scale device would be finalised, built and field tested. Scale up of the technology for horticulture use would be specified. In parallel, Follow on Funding would support the determination of the final manufactured Cost of Goods for the field unit and the horticulture system, the identification of possible manufacturers and the formalising of the route to market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J016446/1","grantId":"NE/J016446/1","fundValue":"15853","fundStart":"2012-07-30","fundEnd":"2013-01-29","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Findings have not as yet been taken forward in terms of societal impacts (engagement) but potential for economic impact is being pursued via further funding application.

CO2 is gas and resource used for photosynthesis. Plants can photosynthesise and grow more at elevated levels of CO2. We targeted the capacity of compost bins to supply CO2 and measured highly elevated concentrations of CO2 within them. We used a small DC electric pump to transfer this enriched CO2 air from the compost bin into a glasshouse environment and were able to locally elevate CO2 near pot grown plants. We looked at substrate quality and its manipulation with the aim of maximising CO2 output. \n\nWe investigated pump systems, power supplies and CO2 control with the aim of developing a system that elevated CO2 to at least 600 ppm, and maintained within 20 % of the target concentration for at least 80 % of the time. A device using decomposition of organic material was trialled and such a system would be achievable and could be operational.\n\nTwo areas for market research were considered including relevant horticulture applications and applications for use in scientific research. For horticulture, we market tested a product pitched as ‘CO2 Crop Enhancer’ built around a compost bin. We identified that there was a consumer need for this ‘new’ product but that the consumer would need to be convinced of the product benefits. A further barrier to potentially success was that it would have to retro fit to existing compost bin models and retail at under &pound;20 (2013). Whilst a potential sizeable market exists it was believed that this product was very niche and likely adopted by very keen gardeners, organic gardeners and those interested in Permaculture. Promotion and marketing should therefore target specific markets. This concept and design was taken forward by Aberystwyth University Technology Transfer and was part of successful application to the UK Design Council to further develop this project. \n\nWe also estimated whether there was a commercial market for a product that could be used for research purposes based on the same principles (i.e. producing CO2 enriched air from waste). This potential market is significantly smaller but research that looks at future elevated CO2 impacts or improving crop yield via CO2 relies on expensive bottled gas (costing &pound;4-5 Kg-1). Such a device would facilitate new research but would have to be developed in collaboration with a supplier of CO2 measuring systems and remote power supplies.\n\n Summary of key outcomes: i) We have shown that it is possible to produce and deliver CO2 from a standard compost bin with potential benefits to glasshouse grown plants; ii) We have tested and shown that this approach could also be used for research purposes; iii) Market testing has revealed that there is scope to further develop a horticultural / gardening product but that a research product would attract a limited and very specific market; iv) Further funding has been pursued and commercial partnerships have been established. The elements developed in this research highlight that there is an untapped market in CO2 research. Whilst society sees CO2 as a global problem plant biologists see this gas as a resource and opportunity. Hence this research has both societal and academic interests. \n\nThis research highlights some of the commonly ignored sources of CO2 and shows how this resource could be exploited and potentially used for promoting plant growth in horticulture / gardening and has applications for scientific research. The simple approaches developed represent a near carbon neutral approach of sequestration of CO2 from common waste materials. We believe that this knowledge can be tapped to reconsider what we do with wastes and whether there is scope for linking waste producers with potential users (agriculture and horticulture). For example, green/food waste is currently anaerobically digested for biogas but such waste could also be used via slow composting produce to produce useful CO2 source gas. This project and its outputs therefore has wider significance in terms of waste management with a focus on CO2 emissions. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
