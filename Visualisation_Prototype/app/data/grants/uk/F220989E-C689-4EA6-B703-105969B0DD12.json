{"id":"F220989E-C689-4EA6-B703-105969B0DD12","title":"Electrical Screening of Novel Organic Semiconductors for Photovoltaic Devices","abstractText":"This proposal represents a proposed collaboration between Prof. Peter J. Skabara from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, and Dr. Paul A. Lane of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington D.C. We request funds for Dr Lane to spend a three-week period at the University of Strathclyde to rapidly establish expertise in the fabrication and characterisation of organic solar cell devices. The proposal takes advantage of the synthetic capabilities of the Skabara group and the experience of Dr. Lane in the characterisation of organic opto-electronic devices. Due to the high number of available compounds and polymers developed in the Skabara group, it has become important to perform in-house screening of materials for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications. The Strathclyde group has established a device fabrication facility consisting of two modular glove boxes, which house a spin coater, evaporator system and solar simulator. Establishing a good track record in device fabrication and testing would be greatly accelerated by the visit of Dr Paul Lane. In the proposed programme of work, Dr Lane would work alongside key members of the Skabara group, studying a range of new materials and training the researchers in OPV device work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J007005/1","grantId":"EP/J007005/1","fundValue":"13807","fundStart":"2012-02-10","fundEnd":"2012-08-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Skabara","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
