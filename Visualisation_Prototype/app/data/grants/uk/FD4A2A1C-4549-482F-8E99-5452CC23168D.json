This network will be organised around four meetings that will take place at six month intervals over a two year period in two institutions. The workshops will be delivered by a combination of Irish, UK and international researchers and will focus on current issues in linguistic theory, and its relevance for the areas of Language Acquisition, Language Disorders and Bilingualism and Language Variation. They will bring Irish researchers into regular contact with each other, and with international researchers who are leading the field in the area. Our goals are: \n To provide a form for the exchange of information and ideas in this important research area, strengthening the development of the field in Ireland, North and South, and benefiting researchers and postgraduate students of linguistics across the island. \n To build research capacity at national level in the field of theoretical linguistics. \n To strengthen collaborative research links between researchers and institutions in the area. \n To strengthen the links between theoretical linguistics and related fields in Ireland. \n To encourage and develop research on the linguistics of Irish and Irish varieties of English.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G500207/1","grantId":"AH/G500207/1","fundValue":"10735","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Margaret Henry","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
