Because of the problem complexity, computer simulations are the only available tool that can capture the mechanisms of binding at the required resolution level. Indeed, in many cases the processes are very short lived which makes them hardly detectable by experiment. Intermediate complexes that may be rate limiting can change the rates by orders of magnitudes rendering potential drug candidates inactive (or vice versa). Currently this can be checked only by expensive and time consuming experimental tests. Thus, the possibility of calculating the rates using computer simulation can make very significant impact on drug design studies.\nAttempts of incorporating a group of classical atoms into a continuum solvent (implicit solvent) are known for a long time. However, the most consistent approach describing a structured continuum, the hydrodynamics, is a direction that becomes active only very recently. Conceptually, modelling the MD particles in the 'transfer' region where the MD and CH domains overlap (the 'runaway' MD particles) remains the most pressing problem of essentially all approaches of this type.\nWe propose a fundamentally new hybrid model that aims at solving this problem. It is based on a generalised description of the MD and CH components within the flux coupling approach. The proposed framework will ensure that the transition between the CH and MD representations is smooth and characterised by (i) the absence of numerical &quot;fixes&quot; such as artificial repulsive barriers between the atomistic and continuum parts or adding new particles, (ii) unified treatment of the solution parts using the same equations throughout the system's volume, (iii) the full control by a single empirical function that can be of arbitrary form both in space and time. The new method will lead to a large reduction of the simulation cost due to a large truncation of the MD domain, achieved without loosing either the detailed atomistic simulation in the MD zone or the macroscopic conservation laws for both mass and momentum.\nThe project is a well balanced combination of state of the art computer hardware development, advanced numerical modelling (the triad of molecular dynamics, continuum fluid mechanics, and numerical methods) and cutting edge investigation of biomedically important molecular system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J004308/1","grantId":"EP/J004308/1","fundValue":"257519","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our finding have been used in further implementation of the multicale method we developed in popular open-source software packages such as GROMACS.

Possible applications of the new method range from computational chemistry and multi-phase modelling to life sciences. In the first part of the INGENIOUS project, for the proof-of-concept work, the method has been implemented in several in-house codes. We have been aiming to develop a new computational framework as an effective boundary condition for atomistic simulations devoid of deficiencies of the previous approaches. These plans have now been partially materialised by implementing our tools in a popular open-source GROMACS package used by many researchers in industry and academia for bio-molecular dynamics simulations.
