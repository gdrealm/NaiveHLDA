{"id":"6D42CD02-A02C-4A02-A77D-62C920DE93B1","title":"Beta Defensins and Immunological Homeostasis in the Mouse","abstractText":"Defensins are a group of proteins produced by some white blood cells, skin cells and the cells lining mucosal surfaces of the body. They have the unique ability to directly kill harmful bacteria and thus are a first line of defence of the organism. Based on their structure defensins are grouped in three families: alpha, beta, and theta defensins. Several defensin molecules have been well characterised, but there are many others whose existence was recently discovered, and whose role for the preservation of organism's defensive equilibrium (immunological homeostasis) remains unclear. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that defensins may have additional, diverse functions in addition to the ability to kill bacteria. Using an advanced technology for gene manipulation called oligo targeting, we were recently able to 'switch off' the MBD14 gene and created a new mouse model for beta-defensin deficiency. In this proposal we would like to refine this technology further and apply it for the inactivation of two other beta defensin genes with unknown functions. In addition, we would like to investigate the generated MBD14 mutant and the newly generated mice and describe the effects of these manipulations on organism's defence systems. The outcome of this project will increase our understanding about the role of beta defensins in immunological homeostasis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G018839/1","grantId":"BB/G018839/1","fundValue":"476457","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The role of the beta 14 defensine in the immune system and in skin barrier function is now much clearer.
