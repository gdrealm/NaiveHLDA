{"id":"D8D8A35F-C75D-4D8D-8E1A-227D317407AC","title":"Feasibility study for quantum gravimeters","abstractText":"ColdQuanta proposes a collaboration with Dr. Kai Bongs of the University of Birmingham and M-Squared Lasers to develop\ncold-atom-based gravimeters and gravity gradiometers as a replacement for current instruments that are based on\nclassical technologies. In the initial phase of this work, our objective is to develop a roadmap for commercializing this next\ngeneration of quantum-based gravity meters and identifying a viable path for transitioning the relevant quantum\ntechnologies out of academic settings and into commercial venues.\nGravity sensors are used in a wide variety of markets, including oil, gas, and mineral exploration; positioning, navigation,\nand timekeeping; cave and tunnel detection; geology and volcanology; and archaeology. Each of these applications comes\nwith its own set of performance specifications, risks, and market opportunities. Our roadmap will analyze all of these\nfactors, identifying which applications should be targeted for the greatest likelihood of success.\nBy the end of this initial work effort, we will have assembled an appropriate set of stakeholders, including end-users and\npotential customers. With this groundwork laid, the next steps will focus on system design and R&amp;D, including prototype\ndemonstrations and breadboard-level tests that fully demonstrate the feasibility of our technical approach.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M508317/1","grantId":"EP/M508317/1","fundValue":"24000","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vincent  Boyer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
