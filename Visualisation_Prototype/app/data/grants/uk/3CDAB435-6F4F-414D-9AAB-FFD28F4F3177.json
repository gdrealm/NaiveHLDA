The collections consist of over 13,000 hand-written pages of transcriptions of Gaelic folklore from the fieldwork of the late Calum Maclean, being primarily tale-texts together with full-length autobiographies from two major storytellers. The material will be re-keyed and marked up and held in an online and searchable XML database. The resulting enhancement will provide a powerful and adaptable contemporary resource for folktale research developed with a major Gaelic language corpus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=19209/1","grantId":"19209/1","fundValue":"306085","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Shaw","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
