Our immune system forms during foetal development and the early neonatal period and is made up of many types of cells including the white blood cells. These are continuously replenished throughout the life-course from specialised stem cells called haematopoietic stem cells that are found in the bone marrow. The white blood cells can be further divided into lymphocytes and non lymphocytes. Amongst the lymphocytes are B cells which produce antibodies and specialised cells that kill virally infected cells. A class of lymphocyte that develops in an organ called the thymus is called the T cell and this cell co-ordinates the function of antibody producing and killer lymphocytes. One important feature of lymphocytes is that they hold a memory of previous encounters with infections. This has been used to create vaccines which make us immune to diseases without having to suffer the disease. While vaccines work well in young individuals they work poorly, or not at all, in the elderly. Because of the importance of lymphocytes they have been much studied and we have plenty of information on the different stages of development the cells go through as they mature and become stimulated by encounter with antigen (the technical term immunologists use for anything that stimulates the immune system). We know much about the signalling processes that take place inside the cell when receptors on the surface of lymphocytes are triggered. We also know much about a class of genes that encode proteins, called transcription factors, which act as on/off switches for genes in the DNA. Transcription factors convert the information encoded in the DNA sequence of genes into a message, called mRNA, which specifies the order in which amino acids are incorporated into proteins. Our project is aimed at understanding how the mRNA is regulated subsequent to its production. We suspect special proteins, called mRNA binding proteins, physically interact with the mRNA and control how long it remains in the cell and the rate at which it can give rise to new proteins. This type of regulation is called post-transcriptional control and is far less well understood. Our study will ask what the function of these mRNA binding proteins is in lymphocytes and will reveal how they work. Our gaol is to understand how mRNA binding proteins interact with signalling pathways and ultimately with transcription factors to control lymphocytes and the immune response.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J001457/1","grantId":"BB/J001457/1","fundValue":"64092","fundStart":"2012-05-11","fundEnd":"2017-05-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  N/A The award is ongoing.

Before this RNA can be used to direct the synthesis of a particular protein, various things have to happen to the RNA. Non-coding &quot;intervening sequences&quot; have to be removed and the correct protein-coding sequences joined together by a &quot;splicing&quot; process. The RNA has to be transported to the correct cellular location where it is used as a set of instructions to manufacture a particular type of protein. Most human genes undergo &quot;alternative splicing&quot;, in which different combinations of intervening sequences can be removed. This allows individual genes to encode more than one functionally distinct protein. This is an important process -- some human diseases occur when alternative splicing is not properly controlled. The choice between different alternative splicing patterns is controlled by numerous RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that recognise particular sequences in the RNA, usually in the non-coding regions. We have been investigating how one of these proteins -- polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) -- recognises RNA. PTB has four separate protein domains, each of which can recognise a short RNA sequence such as UCU. Because the RNA binding domains (RBDs) of PTB are connected by flexible linkers it has been very difficult to determine the arrangement of the individual RBDs when they bind to RNA. We have used an approach that allows us to analyze, one at a time, where each of the RBDs of PTB contacts an RNA. We engineer forms of PTB in which a chemical probe is attached to just one of the RBDs. When we switch on the chemical probe, nearby RNA is cut; so by looking at the locations where the RNA is cut when the probe is placed on different RBDs, we can work out the arrangement of the four RBDs on the RNA. We also engineered other forms of the protein in which individual RBDs were altered to prevent them from binding RNA. We also combined these RNA binding mutations with the chemical probes, so that we could observe whether the ability of one RBD to contact RNA affected the ability of other RBDs to do the same. We used this set of proteins to investigate how PTB controls alternative splicing in the human FAS gene. This was an interesting example, because this alternative splicing event influences whether cells live or die. Previous investigations suggested that only a single molecule of PTB contacted the FAS exon. Our results showed that three PTB molecules bound. We also found that the four RBDs are not equal; the third and fourth RBDs are the most important. RBD3 strongly contacts a protein-coding sequence in FAS RNA, while RBD4 contacts the RNA in a number of locations in the intervening sequences, all of them containing a UC or a CC sequence. If we altered the RNA sequence where RBD3 binds, then PTB could no longer control splicing. However, if we altered the sequences where RBD4 usually binds, the PTB could still control splicing. Our results provide a detailed picture of how a protein with multiple RBDs can recognise RNA and control splicing. The &quot;toolkit&quot; of PTB proteins that we have created can also be used by scientists investigating other functions of PTB.
