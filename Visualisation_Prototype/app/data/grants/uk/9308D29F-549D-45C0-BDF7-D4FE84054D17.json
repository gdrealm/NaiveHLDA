{"id":"9308D29F-549D-45C0-BDF7-D4FE84054D17","title":"Connected Communities: Diaspora and transnationality","abstractText":"This research review critically explores the idea of 'connected communities' in relation to diaspora and transnationality across the humanities and social sciences. It develops the idea of 'connectivity' within and across communities that are transnational and diasporic, focusing on four key areas: community histories; home, community and migration; cities, communities and connections; and faith communities and religious diasporas. As an integral part of the research review (see Bonnerjee et al., 2011, for the full report), four one-day workshops on these themes were held in partnership with The Royal Geographical Society (with Institute of British Geographers) and The Geffrye Museum of the Home. These workshops (two at the RGS-IBG, one at The Geffrye and one at The City Centre, QMUL) brought together more than 70 participants from across the academic, arts/cultural and community sectors and involved a range of presentations, workshop activities and discussions about future collaborative research priorities. The full report reviews key academic debates on community, diaspora and transnationality; highlights key projects across the academic, arts/cultural and community sectors in a series of boxes; includes workshop summaries and evaluations; and identifies key areas for future collaborative research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J50062X/1","grantId":"AH/J50062X/1","fundValue":"29114","fundStart":"2011-02-15","fundEnd":"2011-10-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Mary Blunt","coPersons":["Catherine  Mcilwaine"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
