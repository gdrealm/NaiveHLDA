{"id":"DF80406D-DBCC-4B00-BA40-65E7D7C34C1A","title":"Quadratic and Linear Knapsack Problems with Scheduling Applications","abstractText":"Scheduling Theory is a problem area within Operational Research which studies optimisation problems, normally arising in production and service planning. Typically, scheduling problems are formulated in terms of jobs processed on machines, and it is required to create a schedule that optimises a certain objective function. Most of the problems of practical relevance studied in Scheduling Theory are among the hardest optimisation problems, so that it is unlikely that an exact solution to any of those problems can be obtained in reasonable computation time. Therefore, one of the main focuses of scheduling research has been that of design and analysis of approximation algorithms. Some of these algorithms are purpose-built and explore specific features of the structure of the problem under consideration. On the other hand, for various scheduling problems approximation algorithms can be developed based on reformulations of the original problems in terms of Integer Mathematical Programming. In particular, if a problem is reformulated as a version of the knapsack problem, then either the design of approximation algorithms will benefit from a well-studied area of knapsack problem approximation or such a reformulation may initiate studies of new knapsack models which are likely to advance both areas of Combinatorial Optimisation, i.e., Scheduling and Mathematical Programming. The knapsack problem is the most known and most studied Integer Programming problem. Simple as it is in the classical setting of maximizing a linear function with a single linear constraint and binary decision variables, this problem is traditionally seen as the main testing ground of algorithmic ideas in discrete optimisation. Besides, the family of knapsack problems goes far beyond a single constraint model, and includes various versions and extensions such as bounded and unbounded knapsack problems, multidimensional, multi-choice and multiple knapsack problems, multicriteria knapsack problems, the problems with non-linear, e.g., quadratic, objective functions and many more. Within this project we intend to identify scheduling problems that allow a reformulation in terms of a knapsack problem, including its non-linear versions and extended linear versions. For the relevant knapsack models we will develop algorithms for solving their continuous relaxations, design fixed ratio approximation algorithms and approximation schemes. We expect that this project will result in numerous examples of effective applications of various knapsack models to scheduling approximation algorithms. We see as an especially promising the study on the link between the scheduling problems with multi-sum objective functions and quadratic knapsack problems of a special structure. The results to be obtained will establish a closer interaction between Integer Programming and Scheduling, and will make a considerable impact on both fields. The total record of the collaborators exceeds 150 papers published in peer-reviewed journals. The project team will take advantage of mutually complementary skills: the expertise of Prof Strusevich in design of approximation algorithms for various scheduling models and deep knowledge of Prof Kellerer in all aspects of research on the knapsack problems, as well as in related areas of Combinatorial Optimisation, including scheduling and bin packing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I018441/1","grantId":"EP/I018441/1","fundValue":"23306","fundStart":"2011-01-10","fundEnd":"2013-01-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This was a small grant scheme project.

For the Symmetric Quadratic Knapsack problem (SQKP) with a convex objective the techniques for developing a fully-polynomial approximation scheme (FPTAS) have been developed.\n\n\n\n2. The continuous relaxation of SQKP with a convex objective function has been reduced to the min-cost flow with a quadratic convex cost function to become solvable by a version of Tamir's algorithm.\n\n\n\n3. For SQKP and a relevant Half-Product problem several scheduling applications have been identified, leading to FPTASs for these scheduling problems.\n\n\n\n4. Key findings 1-3 make the content of an invited survey paper of more than 50 pages, published in 4OR in 2012.\n\n\n\n5. An efficient FPTAS for the positive Half-Product problem with a convex objective function and for its variant with a linear knapsack constraint has been developed, and scheduling applications of the models have been identified. The findings of the project have a potential to be applied to delivering solutions to problems that arise in production, supply chain management, transport and finance. In particular, one of the models studied in the project can serve as a basis for creating low risk flight schedules of helicopter transportation of employees in the off-shore oil/gas mining sector, which we currently are pursuing. This project is methodological in nature. Although the addressed problems do have a wide range of applications to production, supply chain management, transport and finance, the immediate consequence of the project is a further contribution to designing a toolkit for handling non-linear problems of discrete optimisation. The project's findings will motivate colleagues to continue this line of research. Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
