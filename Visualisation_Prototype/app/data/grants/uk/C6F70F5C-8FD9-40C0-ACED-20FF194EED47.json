Current anti-inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids, are ineffective in COPD and poorly effective in a considerable proportion of chronic asthma patients, and new therapeutic strategies are urgently required. We believe that redressing imbalances of gene transcription in the cells of affected airways tissues can be achieved with inhibitors of a group of enzymes called histone acetyl transferases (HATs) in order to alleviate disease and to restore sensitivity to corticosteroids. We will identify HAT inhibitors using an interdisciplinary approach that brings together expertise in transcription regulation biology, respiratory medicine and cell biology, natural products screening, and medicinal chemistry at the University of Nottingham and the Strathclyde Institute for Drug Research. Using appropriate biochemical and cellular test systems, we shall screen an extensive, chemically diverse, and biodiverse natural products extract collection. Natural products have traditionally been a rich treasure trove for biologically active molecules. Starting from promising compounds identified in these screens, medicinal chemistry will then be used to develop drug candidate compounds with the desired properties in terms of potency, specificity, and pharmacological action.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700218","grantId":"G0700218","fundValue":"570058","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Martin Fischer","coPersons":["Alan John  Knox","David Michael Heery","Alan  Harvey"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
