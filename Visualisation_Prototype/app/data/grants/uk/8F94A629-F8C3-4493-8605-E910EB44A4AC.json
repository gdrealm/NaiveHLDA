{"id":"8F94A629-F8C3-4493-8605-E910EB44A4AC","title":"Upside","abstractText":"Our research will have three parts. First we will perform state of the art statistical modelling of CO2 intensity in UK\nelectricity generation. This will provide powerful statistical representations of daily variation in the use of CO2 intensive\nfuels (principally coal and gas), taking into account both seasonal and within-day fluctuations.\nSecond, we will develop a method to generate daily carbon intensity profile predictions (for both average level and\nstatistical variation).\nThird, we will produce a control algorithm to generate UPS recharging schedules optimised for the lowest carbon intensity.\nThis will provide day-ahead schedules which aim to minimise the CO2 produced in recharging the UPS fleet, by taking into\naccount the abovementioned statistical models.\nThe above statistical models and generated control policies will also be published by Upside as part of their open source\napproach, adding to the rich real-time UK grid data available to the public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507155/1","grantId":"EP/M507155/1","fundValue":"47463","fundStart":"2014-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  MoriartyGoran  Peskir","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
