They argue that 'the calorie Engel curve', which plots per capita total calories or cereal calories and household per capita expenditure, has shifted consistently downwards during 1983-2005, based on National Sample Survey (NSS) data. </p>\n\n<p>However, if we focus on the rural wage earners, the possibility of poverty nutrition trap exists, that is the labour productivity and wage rates are affected by nutritional intakes and thus those undernourished tend to be trapped in poverty. </p>\n\n<p>We will investigate why calorie intake declined over time (and why the improvement of anthropometric indicators has been slow) and whether it is largely due to decline of the calorie requirement. Also examined are the effects of activity intensities, poverty interventions, such as, Rural Public Works, and other determinants of calorie requirements, on calorie intakes by linking three different survey data, that is, NSS, NFHS and NCAER data in the recent three rounds, in 1992-4, 1998-2000 and 2004-6. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H036830/1","grantId":"ES/H036830/1","fundValue":"51299","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Katsushi  Imai","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
