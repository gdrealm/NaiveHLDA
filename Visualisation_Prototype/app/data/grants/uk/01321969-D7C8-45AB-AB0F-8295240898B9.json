They are important regulators of the immune response. Not surprisingly, deregulation of miRNA function has been linked with malignant transformation and autoimmunity. The knowledge obtained in this project will provide insights into a new mechanism of cell regulation which in the long term may impact in the design of more effective vaccines or for treatment of human diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001781","grantId":"G1001781","fundValue":"624702","fundStart":"2011-09-12","fundEnd":"2015-03-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Elena  Vigorito","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Babraham Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
