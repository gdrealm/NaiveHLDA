{"id":"BFC8C3D1-C21F-45EF-B173-4B6E2AD6F3C5","title":"Logic-directed evolution of new biosensor molecules in vivo","abstractText":"The ability to rapidly and accurately detect small molecules has widespread use within security and defence contexts such as detection of explosives, biological agents or pathogens. This project will develop a new platform for the development of novel sensors. Sensors require highly specific detection of molecules in very low concentrations. The use of biological approaches for this purpose is attractive since many biological systems have evolved for precisely this purpose. While biological diversity offers a rich source of variety, it is ultimately limited to what can be isolated and characterised. In vitro methods for evolving new biological functionality and diversity have proven useful but are ultimately limited in the range of biological diversity that can be sampled. This project will develop a prototype for the evolution of new biological specificity in vivo, with feedback bio-'logic' circuitry that will enable end-point evolution of biological systems to new specificities. The isolation of new proteins with altered specificity will be essential for the creation of a new generation of biosensors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J020036/1","grantId":"BB/J020036/1","fundValue":"127393","fundStart":"2012-11-12","fundEnd":"2014-01-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey  Baldwin","coPersons":["Richard  Kitney"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
