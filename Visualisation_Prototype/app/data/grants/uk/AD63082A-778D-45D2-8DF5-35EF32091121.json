It contributes significantly to the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases and is a key cause of infertility and preventable blindness. Unlike many other types of bacteria, chlamydia cannot replicate outside of a cell. It is obligated to enter a cell in order to reproduce. As a result, it has evolved the ability to manipulate the environment of the host cell to keep the cell alive for the appropriate length of time; because if the host cell dies too quickly, the chlamydia will also die. In order to develop strategies to tackle this major public health problem, we will need to have a better understanding of what happens to the host cell and to the chlamydia during the infection process. Thus we will use a powerful new technique, which will allow us to accurately determine what happens to host cell and chlamydia proteins, as well as how they interact with each other, over the course of the infectious life cycle. In addition, we want to identify whether the chlamydia prevents the body's immune system or defence mechanisms working properly We think that the chlamydia may influence the types of proteins on the surface of the cell, and change the way the immune system cells react to an infection, so that the bacteria can persist. In order to study this, we will compare the proteins on the cell surface before and after infection. Both these approaches will help us better understand how chlamydia successfully enters cells, replicates and manipulates its environment. This knowledge is critical if we are to devise strategies to prevent humans succumbing to the infection and most importantly, the irreversible damage to the body that results in blindness and infertility.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M020134/1","grantId":"MR/M020134/1","fundValue":"358210","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Caroline Goodall","coPersons":["Michael Paul  Weekes","Hill  Gaston"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
