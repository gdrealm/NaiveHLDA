{"id":"9582C713-204B-46FC-8BB6-314F08B6A8C1","title":"Analysis of Longitudinal Data with Varying Numbers of Measurements","abstractText":"Patients with chronic conditions have tests taken periodically to assess their health, as part of their routine clinical care. For example HIV patients have tests of their immune function. These tests may be used to identify for example when a treatment could be started or changed. The data from many patients together can be analysed to see in general when treatments are applied, and how the disease changes over time in response to therapy. \n\nThe number of measurements obtained often varies between patients, sometimes because patients miss clinic appointments. Alternatively this might be inherent, such as when each measurement concerns a clinical episode (e.g. an infection or hospital stay) which patients may experience repeatedly during study follow-up. The distinction is important and should influence how the data are analysed. \n\nIf patients with more measurements have a different disease profile over time to those with fewer measurements then this will likely cause a bias when the data are analysed, so that the research findings may be misleading. Many people have suggested modifications of the methods used to analyse the data so as to avoid such bias caused by death or some patients ?dropping-out? (i.e. attending consistently for a period but then stopping their care). However little research has been done into how to deal with data where patients are measured sporadically. Furthermore there is little research into how to deal with data where the number of measurements varies inherently. One of the key approaches suggested may not use the data efficiently, i.e. the results of the analysis will not be as precise as they could be.\n \nWe aim to adapt the existing methods of data analysis to longitudinal data, and where appropriate improve the efficiency. \n\nWe will implement the various possible approaches to data from the largest cohort of HIV patients in the UK to assess their impact. We will also develop a set of practical recommendations for researchers to help them to assess how to analyse their data.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600657","grantId":"G0600657","fundValue":"323381","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Copas","coPersons":["Caroline Anne Sabin","Vern  Farewell","Abdel Ghayoum Babiker"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
