Of these, 95% (89,817) occurred in people over the age of fifty-five. The cost of health care was estimated at 3.2 billion (50 per capita), the additional economic cost due to lost working days has been estimated at 3.9 billion, and the cost of informal care of patients, at 1.8 billion.Coronary heart disease is an expensive killer. It places a huge burden on the taxpayer, costing nearly 9 billion per year which, with the acknowledged and inexorable trend toward an ageing population, will continue to grow year by year.The term CHD is one of a number that refer to the disease of atherosclerosis, wherein atheromatous plaques (fat and calcium deposits) accumulate in an artery wall to form a partial blockage and thereby cause myocardial ischaemia (inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle). In time, so-called vulnerable plaques undergo a sudden rupture and activate the body's blood-clotting mechanism. This occludes the artery and leads to (the most common form of) myocardial infarction: a 'heart attack'.There is currently no 'standard' screening tool for CHD. Patients who consult their doctor are already in some discomfort and the subsequent diagnosis requires the intervention of, and examination by, highly specialized medical practitioners.We propose a proof-of-concept investigation which connects computational applied mathematics to biotechnology. A successful outcome would provide a relatively cheap screening and diagnosis tool for CHD which could be targeted towards 'at-risk' population groups.An arterial stenosis has an acoustic signature (bruit) which is triggered by the resulting turbulent blood flow impacting on the artery walls. This causes low amplitude displacement waves (shear waves) to travel through the chest, which then manifest themselves as disturbances on the chest surface. These disturbances can be measured non-invasively by placing sensors on the skin.The generation of waves at the artery wall, their transmission through the chest, and their appearance at the chest surface, can all be described by a detailed mathematical model which describes the viscoelastic nature of human tissue (heart, lungs, muscle etc). The entire model can be simulated in software as a virtual chest thus obviating the need, in the early proof-of-concept development stage, for clinical tests on real people.We propose to develop and implement this virtual chest in theory and in software and to validate it by experiment in order to evaluate this approach in terms of an effective 'early days screening process' for an at-risk population. This task consists of two parts (the direct and inverse solver) both of which will be calibrated and tested by experiments on a realistic mechanical model of the chest.Specifically, the virtual chest will be formulated mathematically, implemented computationally and tested experimentally. An initial guess at the arterial disturbance will, via the direct problem, predict the surface disturbances at the chest wall. The difference between these and measured values will form an iterative inverse solver procedure which will modify the arterial disturbance until the difference between the measured and computed values is minimised.Once this direct-inverse solution iteration has finished, the surface measurements have been decoded by the mathematics and software into the arterial impacts. These can, potentially, be used to indicate the presence, size, location and morphology of the stenosis. It is this potential for diagnosis that this project seeks to investigate and evaluate through a fundamental study involving mathematical modelling and analysis, computational simulation, and validation through experimentation on chest phantoms filled with tissue-mimicking gel.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H011285/1","grantId":"EP/H011285/1","fundValue":"368862","fundStart":"2010-05-17","fundEnd":"2013-11-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  So far no impact beyond academic publications.

Currently there are no methods available for the routine screening of this disease and, given its widespread occurrence, a simple screening device would greatly help to reduce the financial and social burden resulting the disease. We set out to exploit the observation that flow through partly blocked arteries can become turbulent and form fast moving jets. When these hit the wall of the artery in which they are travelling they can cause it to ‘flutter’ and this movement can be transmitted through the tissue in the chest resulting in similar although weaker movements of the skin, which can be detected by sensors placed on the skin. The first part of the work was to construct a simplified model of the chest wall using a gel like material and to measure its viscous and elastic properties in the range of frequencies known to be associated with disturbed flow through narrowed blood vessels. These simple experiments were successfully completed and the results published. At the same time our co-workers on the computational arm of the study developed a numerical simulation of these visco-elastic properties. The next step was to generate mechanically within the gels, disturbances of the same magnitude as those seen in real blood vessels and to measure the resulting movement at the surface. In these experiments the position and the magnitude of the disturbance, as well as the frequency of the waves generated by it was accurately known. At the same time the mathematical model was developed to describe the way in which the waves propagate through the gel so that, given a known disturbance at a known position, the movement of the surface at various positions resulting from the disturbance could be predicted and compared to our experimental measurements. This part of the study has been completed and the mathematical model is able, within limits, to produce a result which corresponds to the known position of the disturbance. At the same time, a second group of collaborators have been tackling the so called inverse problem. That is, given a pattern of disturbances at the surface of the gel, can one predict the position of their source? They too have shown that this is in principle possible and their methods will be used on the data that we are still gathering. The final part of the work, carried out during the tenure of the grant, was to produce a more realistic experimental model of a partially blocked coronary artery by embedding a tube (either with no obstruction therein or with partial blockages of varying severity) in the gel and measuring the pattern of movement at the surface caused by the flow (at various speeds) of a blood mimicking fluid within the tube. We were able to prove the principle that the disturbances can be detected by low cost sensors placed at its surface and by using a laser interferometer (an optical device able to detect minute movement) were able to verify that these disturbances gave rise to movements in the plane of the gel surface as well as at right angles to it. We had originally intended to carry out more extensive measurements of this type on progressively more realistic models of the chest but the tenure of the grant expired before we were able to complete this. However, we have secured further funding to carry out these measurements and to extend them to models of the carotid artery in the neck (also subject to atherosclerotic blockages) as well as to detect the movement of the carotid artery due to the pulse travelling within it. From this information we can determine the stiffness of the artery whether or not it is free of blockages. Arterial stiffness is now recognised as an effective indicator of the general health of the circulation and a reliable measure of the risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Continuing measurements of the strain field at the surface of the gels using an array of miniature accelerometers are about to start. These will be augmented by direct measurement of the surface displacement using laser interferometry. Funding for this work, which will start in early 2015, has been secured through a Horizon 2020 grant (call H2020-ICT-2014-1). Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
