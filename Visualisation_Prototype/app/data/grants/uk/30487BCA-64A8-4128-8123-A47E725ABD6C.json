{"id":"30487BCA-64A8-4128-8123-A47E725ABD6C","title":"Scalable Quantum Logic using Microfabricated Ion Traps: Visiting Researcher Funding","abstractText":"A quantum computer is a device that stores and manipulates information according to the laws of quantum mechanics, the physical theory that describes the physical world at the scale of atoms and smaller. If it could be built, it would be exponentially more powerful than today's normal classical computers, and would revolutionize fields such as cryptography. It could also simulate other quantum systems much more efficiently than classical computers can, which could ultimately help understand the structure of large molecules and impact areas such as molecular analysis and design. While theoretically well-understood, the technical challenges of building such a machine are enormous, and at the limits of today's technology. One of the most advanced technologies for building a quantum computer are ion traps, where individual (charged) atoms held in electrostatic traps in high vacuum are used to store quantum information. The focus of this project is to develop methods to scale up an ion trap computer from the current state of the art (a few atoms) to many atoms. This will be achieved through the fabrication of a surface electrode ion trap (easier to scale to deal with large numbers of ions than other designs), which includes microwave transmission lines. The microwaves will be used to implement quantum logic gates between pairs of ions, the essential resource for manipulating quantum information.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I028978/1","grantId":"EP/I028978/1","fundValue":"70629","fundStart":"2011-03-08","fundEnd":"2012-03-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Lucas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
