The foamability of a primary surfactantin admixture with co-surfactants, polymers and fatty soildrops/particles will be measured, and correlated with interfacialtransport properties of foam films. Formulations which foam well willbe targeted. Optical, drainage and rheological properties of the bulkfoams formed during sudsing will be measured and characterised.Bubble scale modelling will be used to describe bubble shapes andstability. Finally continuum level mathematical models of sudsing,described in terms of average foam properties (foam volume, averagebubble size, average liquid content), will be developed incorporatingthe key research findings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F000286/1","grantId":"EP/F000286/1","fundValue":"191667","fundStart":"2008-03-26","fundEnd":"2011-03-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Johan Neethling","coPersons":["Jan  Cilliers"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
