It follows the pattern of applying the physical intuition and ideas to solving mathematical problems which has been a characteristic feature of many groundbreaking developments in algebra in geometry in the last two decades.\n\nThe project has two closely related themes. One purports to link two deep algebraic constructions which have been extensively studied in their own right. The first is the calculation of the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of infinite matrices with values in an algebra and the second is the calculation of the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of the infinite-dimensional algebra of noncommutative hamiltonians. One conjectural application is the construction of an algebraic version of chain level Gromov-Witten invariants.\n\nThe second theme derives its motivation from the general problem of quantizing field theories defined classically, i.e. in terms of an action functional. More precisely, a classical field theory is modelled as a certain algebraic structure, called L-infinity algebra which is determined by a certain polynomial or power series function, and one studies other algebraic structures derived by integrating this function. The application will include topological theories of Chern-Simons type and Poisson sigma-models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J00877X/1","grantId":"EP/J00877X/1","fundValue":"240901","fundStart":"2012-07-18","fundEnd":"2015-07-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The proposed research project belongs to the realm of pure mathematics.

It follows the pattern of applying the physical intuition and ideas to solving mathematical problems which has been a characteristic feature of many groundbreaking developments in algebra in geometry in the last two decades. \n\nThe main discovery thus far has been a theory of derived localisation for algebras developed with A Lazarev and C Braun. The theory has applications in diverse areas, e.g. topology, homotopical algebra and geometry. \n\nAnother thread of the project has focused on developing the homotopy theory of coalgebras. Two papers with A Lazarev and W Mannan have been written on the subject, submitted for publication and are currently available on the ArXiv preprint server.\n\nA projected started long ago with A King on free resolutions of algebras was completed, with help from the insight gained from the homotopy theory of coalgebras. The theory of derived localisation of algebras will be generalised to categories. It will then have further applications, e.g. to derived Riemann-Hilbert correspondence and to fusion systems over finite p-groups. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
