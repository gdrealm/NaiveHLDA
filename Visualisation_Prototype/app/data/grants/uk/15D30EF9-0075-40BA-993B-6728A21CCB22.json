{"id":"15D30EF9-0075-40BA-993B-6728A21CCB22","title":"Identification of genetic variants underlying Type 2 Diabetes in UK Indian Asians","abstractText":"Diabetes is a leading cause of death world-wide. Indian Asians are almost 4 times more likely to develop diabetes than Europeans. This is thought to be genetic, but no specific genetic factors have been identified so far. We have assembled a large population study of Indian Asians and Europeans in West London (LOLIPOP), and will have complete high density genetic (?genome wide association?) data on 5200 Indian Asians, including 1600 with diabetes, by the end of 2007. We will capitalise on this unique Indian Asian genetic data, to complete the first well-powered genetic investigation of diabetes in Asians. We will integrate our genetic datasets to produce an Indian specific genetic map, then perform three rounds of further genetic testing in a progressively focused way. In total, we will be looking at genetic variants in over 20,000 Indian Asians, and a similar number of Europeans. With these large numbers we will be able to detect even small genetic effects. The results of our study will allow us to identify the genetic factors underlying diabetes in Indian Asians, and to identify which are specifc to Asians, and which are shared with Europeans. Our findings will advance our understanding of diabetes, and in the future may enable risk prediction in Indian Asians, allowing early intervention to prevent diabetes and its complications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700931","grantId":"G0700931","fundValue":"600006","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jaspal S Kooner","coPersons":["Mark Ian McCarthy","James  Scott","John  Chambers","David J Balding","Paul  Elliott","Philippe  Froguel"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
