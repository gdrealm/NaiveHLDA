Leishmaniasis is found in 88 countries and some 15M people are infected at any given time. One form of the disease, in which internal organs are affected (visceral leishmaniasis), accounts for approx 100,000 deaths annually, mainly in children. Visceral leishmaniasis occurs predominantly in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, The Sudan and Brazil, but it also occurs in many countries bordering the Mediterranean. The spread of HIV makes visceral leishmaniasis an increasingly important infection. Visceral leishmaniasis is also a severe disease of dogs, with 2-3M dogs infected in Europe alone. Infected dogs help maintain transmission of the disease to man. To understand why people die from this infection, and to help develop new vaccines and drugs for human and veterinary use, it is essential to understand more about how the infection attacks our organs and undermines the immune responses that normally protect us from infection. By studying the nature of the disease in experimental models and how it affects immunity, we shall be able to suggest novel approaches to treatment and aid in effective vaccine design. In addition to publication in peer-reviewed public access journals, the results from this study will be communicated via Outreach activities and by active public relations to disseminate news of important breakthroughs via the local and national press.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400786","grantId":"G0400786","fundValue":"1040380","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Martin Kaye","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
