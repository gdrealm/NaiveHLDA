Ice crystallisation in the atmosphere strongly influences cloud properties and climate, but our quantitative understanding of this process is extremely poor. Similar processes to those occurring in the atmosphere are of critical importance to the pharmaceutical and other industries. We propose here to bring these two communities together, the atmospheric and the industrial (represented by the British Association of Crystal Growth, BACG), at the 2008 annual meeting of the BACG, in order to promote collaboration and the transfer of ideas and expertise. A central aim is to for NERC knowledge transfer proposals to result from this meeting.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G523363/1","grantId":"NE/G523363/1","fundValue":"3154","fundStart":"2008-08-20","fundEnd":"2009-03-19","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Benjamin John Murray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
