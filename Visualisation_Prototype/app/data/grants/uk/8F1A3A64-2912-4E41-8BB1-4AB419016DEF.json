{"id":"8F1A3A64-2912-4E41-8BB1-4AB419016DEF","title":"UKLIGHT Monitoring and Analysis at many Scales","abstractText":"This proposal is to develop, set-up and exploit a monitoring system for the UKLIGHT international high capacity experimental network. The system will record data flow and topological information at a range of time-scales (from micro-second to years). Along with the monitoring of this data, this project proposes to make this information available to the community as a web service and will develop advanced monitoring and analysis algorithms.UKLIGHT will provide Points of Prescences at three key international points (Amsterdam, Chicago and London) linking together the National Research Networks to provide high bandwidth network capability, with switched (optical) circuit emulation. This will provide the research environment required to develop, what is in effect, the backplane of the World Wide Grid.In the worst case, monitoring such a system can generate 1TB of data a day; thus posing substantial challenges regarding; real time analysis and compression, data storage and science analysis. This project thus has substantial intrinsic research challenges.UKLIGHT will be used by a wide range of researchers involved with; applications, communications, networking, control and management. In all these cases understanding the perfomance of the network is a key issue. This project will thus provide important information, in real time, to a wide range of other users of the UKLIGHT facility - thus substantially adding to the value of the initiative.The accquired &amp; archived data from the monitoring system will be made available to the research community through grid &amp; web-services; providing data at a range of granularities and analysis levels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=GR/T10510/02","grantId":"GR/T10510/02","fundValue":"241925","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew William Moore","coPersons":["Ian  Pratt","Jon  Crowcroft","Jonathan Michael Pitts","Richard  Gibbens"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
