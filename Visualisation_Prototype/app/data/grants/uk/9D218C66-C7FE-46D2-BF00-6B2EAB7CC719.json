Cloud properties can be perturbed through the addition of aerosol particles into the atmosphere from anthropogenic and natural processes. This addition influences cloud microphysical properties, and subsequently affects cloud dynamics and thermodynamics, and the way the cloud interacts with radiation. The Earth's radiation budget is very greatly affected by clouds, and human-induced changes to the particle loading affecting them, known as indirect effects, are large and highly uncertain. A large part of this uncertainty is the result of poor knowledge of the fundamental aerosol and cloud properties and processes, leading to their poor representation in models. A programme of research is proposed here to i) directly investigate these processes in the laboratory, ii) evaluate the sensitivity of climate relevant parameters to the studied processes, iii) interpret the laboratory studies with detailed model investigations and iv) to incorporate and test new descriptions of the studied processes in cloud-scale and, where possible, global scale models. The programme will thereby reduce the uncertainty in estimates of radiative forcing and climate feedbacks relating to aerosol and cloud processes. The studies are split into those affecting warm clouds (those containing only liquid droplets) and those affecting clouds containing ice particles. The programme brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in 'warm' and 'cold' cloud and aerosol processes combining laboratory and multiscale modelling activities to deliver the improved predictive capability. The 'warm' laboratory work focuses on two major aspects i) the rate at which water is taken up by growing aerosol particles as they become cloud droplets (or 'activate) and ii) the ability of aerosol particles of various compositions to act as seeds for cloud droplets. These studies use a number of techniques including single particle optical levitation and investigations in a large photochemical chamber coupled to a large number of chemical and physical probes of ensembles of particles formed in simulated atmospheric chemical processes. The 'cold' work uses a similar coupling of a large, well-instrumented cloud chamber experiments and single particle levitation studies. The chambers used in both aspects will be coupled to investigate the impacts of aerosol transformation conditions on warm and cold cloud formation, using the instrumental payload from both chambers. A range of detailed models will be used to explicitly describe the processes by which aerosol particles interact with increasing relative humidity and reducing temperature to form cloud droplet and ice crystals and to their properties. The processes and properties will be represented in dynamical frameworks to predict the interactions between aerosols and clouds and their radiative effects at cloud resolving scales and radiative forcing of some of the investigated properties on global radiative forcing and feedbacks. The sensitivity of climate relevant parameters to the fundamental parameters investigated in the laboratory programme and their improved quantification will be evaluated using a simplified model 'emulator'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I020121/1","grantId":"NE/I020121/1","fundValue":"864099","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The findings related to improved treatments of aerosol and cloud processes are making their way through into the Met Office models.

We have injected these particles into a cloud chamber to reproduce the conditions for &amp;quot;warm&amp;quot; (low level) and &amp;quot;cold&amp;quot; (higher) cloud formation. The way they form clouds and their properties will enable us to understand the differences between clouds formed under clean and polluted conditions and the effect these clouds will likely have on reflecting sunlight and affecting climate. \n\nii) Published water uptake and molecular diffusion rate measurements by consortium partners allow direct interpretation of warm cloud formation for model inclusion: to accurately calculate the formation of cloud droplets and hence to accurately reproduce clouds in weather and climate models, these physical constants (which determine the rate of condensation of water) must be known. We have accurately made these measurements and hence will be able to better describe water condensation and warm cloud formation.\n\niii) An active ingredient enabling mineral dust to form ice has been identified, enabling process interpretation: it is important to know how many ice crystals there are in &amp;quot;cold&amp;quot; (upper level) clouds to be able to predict how much sunlight they reflect. In order to know how many ice crystals are formed, it is important to know how efficiently the particles that get sufficiently high will act as seeds for ice formation. We therefore need to identify the important ingredients of atmospheric dust that will act as efficient ice seeds.\n\nMeasurement Highlights:\n\nMeasurements of key fundamental physical and chemical properties related to both liquid droplets and ice crystals have been made possible and in many cases completed. To better represent real atmospheric droplet behaviour, the evaporation coefficient of water from aqueous droplets with mixed organic film coatings has been quantitatively related to the single component film evaporation coefficients, in turn determined by the aqueous solubility of the film species. Measured water uptake by aerosol particles has been shown to depend on both the vapour pressure and the solubility of the compounds of which they are made. This supports the recent high profile theoretical calculations of the effects of semi-volatile vapours. Contact nucleation of ice on dust is now being investigated on a new experimental setup (EDB) that has been extensively tested on pollen and water droplets. Immersion mode ice chamber studies of minerals suggest that ice nucleation efficiency is underestimated at high temperatures by other techniques with implications for explaining high temperature ice nucleation in models. This continued rapid progress is allowing significant advances to be made in quantitative understanding of cloud processes.\n\nModelling results: \n\ni) Results in press show uncertainty reduction in cirrus ice crystal concentrations from ice nucleation by several orders of magnitude indicating that elevated measured concentrations may not be real, possibly explaining high measured supersaturation. \n\nii) Inverse modelling has reduced discrepancy between field and laboratory derived water uptake and model and \n\niii) aircraft observations have been used to parameterise fine-scale updraft variability for weather models. \n\niv) Work modelling effects on clouds of condensing organic vapours is in press and \n\nv) design of global and cloud model experiments for the large-scale uncertainty analysis is complete.\n\nProcess Model Highlights:\nIntense precipitation from deep convective clouds has been studied using new modelling techniques enabling combined effects of all important model uncertainties to be studied using a small number of simulations. These clouds are responsible for a large fraction of the UKâ€™s extreme rainfall. The most important cloud processes that determine the intensity of rain are found to be related to the way that ice particles and droplets interact in the cloud. In our studies, under normal continental aerosol conditions the maximum rain rate varied between less than 100 mm/hr to nearly 200 mm/hr, with three-quarters of the uncertainty attributable to the rate at which graupel particles (ice pellets) and droplets combine to form larger particles. These rain intensities are sufficient to cause flooding in localised areas, and are typical of some intense rain events over the UK. Aerosols contribute a maximum of about 20% of the uncertainty in maximum precipitation rate, except at very high concentrations of aerosols typical of smoke plumes. Accurate simulation of intense precipitation from deep convective clouds largely depends on poorly defined microphysical processes. Our results suggest that the influence of aerosols is substantially less than other more important uncertainties and our ability to predict cloud response to changes in aerosols (from air pollution) will very much depend on how well we can accurately specify the complex cloud microphysical processes going on in the cloud.\n\nLarge-Scale Model Highlights:\nOur studies have led to improved capability to describe clouds in large-scale models. Bridging the gap between the cloud scale and the global scale to capture complex aerosol cloud interactions (ACI), use of high-resolution large-scale models such as those from operational numerical weather prediction has been explored. Malavelle et al. (2014) describes a way to include missing subgrid scale (or unresolved) contribution to vertical velocity variability in such models operating with horizontal grid sizes up to ~2 km and highlights the importance of representing the subgrid scale updraft in kilometer-scale simulations of ACI. The high profile finding that semi-volatile organic vapours affect the efficiency of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) with potential large radiative effect in specific geographical locations has been efficiently and accurately parameterised for use in large-scale models (Connolly et al., 2014). We have found that the best CCN activation parameterisations tend to overestimate the number of cloud drops. Simpson et al. (2014) points out reasons for this discrepancy and areas for parameterisation improvements. Malavelle, F. F. et al., doi:10.1002/2013JD021218; Connolly, P. et al., doi:10.5194/acp-14-2289-2014; Simpson, E. et al., doi:10.5194/gmdd-7-1317-2014. The primary external impact will be achieved through the complete integration of the Met Office in the work programme activities as project partners. Met Office personnel are involved directly in the CRM work package 3 and in the activity linking the cloud resolving and large-scale modelling (investigating sub-grid scale vertical velocity parameterisation). The improved physical processes incorporated in the Hadley Centre's Unified model suite including numerical weather prediction (NWP) and global climate models (HadGEM) will allow assessment of impacts of improved parameterisations for both short timescale operational weather forecasting and longer timescale climate scenarios.\n\nDevelopment of the parameterisations via the UKCA chemistry and aerosol module will lead to climate projections with aerosol-cloud processes traceable from the laboratory studies through the cloud resolving model studies to the regional and global scales. Implementation in such models will allow both the impact of improved indirect radiative forcing estimates and the impacts upon weather and climate via complex feedback mechanisms.\n\nPolicy will be directly influenced by improved climate projections and it is necessary to engage policymakers within the ACID_PRUF programme. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) are direct potential beneficiaries. A DECC representative will attend programme meetings ensuring that the science directly feeds through to policymaking. The Department of the Environment, Food and Regional Affairs (Defra) will also benefit from the increased realism associated with the improved parameterisations in global and regional projections of climate change. Such improvements will inform policy. The_ relevant_ interfaces to Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) will be sought to address all relevant stakeholders at once. Programme Delivery: All work was presented at the annual programme meeting with participation of the international advisor. Draw-through from measurements to models and the completed task deliverables ensures the programme is on target to reduce uncertainty in radiative forcing resulting from aerosol-cloud interactions - the exploitation activities will commence once the uncertainty modelling phase of the project has commenced.
