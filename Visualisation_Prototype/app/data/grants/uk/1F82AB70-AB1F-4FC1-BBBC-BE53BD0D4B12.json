Our PDRA, has visited the Swain lab in Michigan State University and has been trained in techniques to isolate EC cells from intact sections of colon. \n\nInitial experiments allowed us to reach purification levels of 20%, however, since her return from Michigan she has managed to improve the isolation procedure and is now obtaining cultures that are close to 50% pure. Improvements included coating cover slips with poly-D-lysine previous to incubation with isolated cells, optimisation of concentrations of dissociation enzymes, accurate control of incubation temperatures, adjustment of density gradients to optimise the dissociation technique for mouse tissue.\n\nWe are currently performing experiments to look at monitoring 5-HT release using electrochemical techniques. A PDRA from the Swain lab will be visiting over the summer vacation this year with individually addressable microelectrode array, which was designed by Dr P in conjunction with the Fraunhofer Institute at Michigan State University. With these devices we aim to measure 5-HT release at multiple points along the colon and correlate these findings with mechanical and electrical recordings of colonic migrating motor complexes which are important motor patterns for driving the movement of the intestinal contents through the colon. The reserach can provide direction for development of new drug enitities to alter gastroinestinal motility by targeting EC cells The findings from these studies will provide insight into the function and regulation of the enterochromaffin (EC) cell. This is an important mucosal cell line that modulates motility and ion transport. The studies provided will provide rapid analysis of the key regulatory components of the EC cell and thus provide an insight toward new targets for therapeutic agents.
