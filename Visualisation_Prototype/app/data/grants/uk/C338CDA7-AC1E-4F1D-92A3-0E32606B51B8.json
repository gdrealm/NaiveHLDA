The new system will incorporate new single particle polarization detector technology into an existing airborne certified single particle backscatter spectrometer that has been developed for commercial airliners. The target for the demonstrator will initially be the commercial airline industry, with a focus on contributing to civil aircraft safety and Government contingency applications, but it will also serve for global atmospheric research and monitoring applications, e.g. to assist assessment of the impact of aircraft operations on the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere region. It will also improve meteorological information currently broadcast via the World Meteorological Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) system from commercial aircraft as well as the UK Science community by providing enhanced measurement capability to their research aircraft. \n\nAn existing aircraft test bed, the FAAM BAe 146 research aircraft, operated jointly by the UK Meteorological Office and NERC, and which operates under civil aircraft rules, has already been identified for the demonstration/flight validation aspect of the proposed work. An existing measurement system we propose to base the new novel demonstrator on is already flying on this aircraft. We therefore propose to use the FAAM BAe 146 platform to flight validate the new measurement system to minimize costs. The existing system, a miniature non-flow invasive backscatter cloud spectrometer (BCP-100) was developed for the European Research Infrastructure Programme, IAGOS (In-Service Aircraft for Global Observing System), Figure 1. This has already received European Supplemental Type Certification (STC) approval for operation on Airbus A-320 series civil airliners as a component of the IAGOS instrument package programme and this will be expanded to other Airbus types, including A320/40, as IAGOS increases its fleet. The current Airbus platforms with their novel miniature IAGOS instrument packages will also offer a guaranteed future market base for the new system via upgrades and replacements, which will be managed by IAGOS and its extensive links with commercial carriers. Subsequent demonstration of the new system in this high profile environment for both airline safety and improved weather prediction and climate monitoring applications will be used to expand potential market for this system to other aircraft manufacturers with whom IAGOS is already in discussion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I023058/1","grantId":"NE/I023058/1","fundValue":"142070","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Global climate change represents arguably the most serious environmental issue facing mankind today, with implications for global political stability and the global economy. Reliable predictions of the future climate using climate models are central and fundamental requirements for determining future mitigation strategies. The use of commercial aircraft allows the collection of highly relevant observations on a scale and in numbers impossible to achieve using research aircraft, and where other measurement methods (e.g., satellites) have technical limitations. This new technology is being evaluated for installation on commercial passenger aircraft as part of the IAGOS global climate measurement aircraft fleet.

This has been designed, built, tested in the Canadian Ottawa Cloud Tunnel, delivered to the NERC FAAM BAe 146 aircraft, installed, certified and flight tested. The first phase of the project has been successful. Analysis of flight data is now proceeding. The instrument will be used as a component of aircraft performance analysis for safety assessments in high icing conditions by Airbus. The instrument will be used to define upgrade pathways for current autonomous cloud detectors on Airbus commercial aircraft.\n\nSoftware for exploitation of the data products from the instrument is being developed as part of current IP agreements with the manufacturer, Droplet Measurement Technology-USA, called OASIS, which is a software tool suite developed for their current range of research cloud spectrometers.
