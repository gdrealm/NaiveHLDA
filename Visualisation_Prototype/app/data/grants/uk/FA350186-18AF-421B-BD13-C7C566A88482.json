For example patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapies, either following organ transplant or for the treatment of diseases such as cancer and autoimmune conditions, are much more likely to develop invasive fungal infections. People with a suppressed immune system either as a result of infections such as HIV or due to inherited mutations in key proteins that regulate immunity are also at much greater risk of acquiring fungal infections. In these patient groups when invasive fungal infections occur they are difficult to treat and have a high mortality rate. This represents an increasing problem as the numbers of people in high-risk groups grows and as resistance to existing antifungals increases. Understanding how the immune system detects and responds to fungal pathogens is therefore an important issue.\nFollowing infection, one of the first cell types to detect fungal pathogens are specialized cells in the immune system termed antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Once these cells sense the presence of a fungal pathogen they undertake several functions, key amongst which is the production of cytokines, small proteins that are released from immune cells and that are required to co-ordinate the immune response. APCs are able to detect fungal pathogens as they express certain specialized receptors that are specific for molecules that are found on the surface of fungal pathogens but not on the body's own cells. One such receptor is a protein called dectin-1. The relevance of dectin-1 to fungal infection has been demonstrated by the observations that both dectin-1 knockout mice and people that carry an inactivating mutation in the dectin-1 gene are more sensitive to fungal infection.\nIn the research outlined in this proposal we will use a variety of techniques to study the way in which the activation of dectin-1 promotes the required cellular response and controls the production of cytokines. Key to this is understanding how dectin-1 affects intracellular signaling networks, many of which are controlled by a process known as protein phosphorylation. These processes are essential for the cell to translate the detection of a fungal pathogen by dectin-1 into the correct immune response. A major part of this study will be to use sate of the art mass spectrometry methods to map global changes in protein phosphorylation that occur inside the cell following the activation of dectin-1. This will allow us to build up a picture of the signaling networks activated. We will then examine the contribution of specific parts of this network to the control of cytokine production.\nThis work will increase our understanding of how the immune system deals with fungal infections, and may suggest ways in which the immune system could be targeted to increase its ability to combat fungal infections. In addition several of the cytokines that are induced by fungal pathogens can, in other circumstances, have pathological roles such as in autoimmune diseases like arthritis. Understanding how their production is controlled therefore also has wider implications for interpreting how the immune system functions and for future drug development programs for a number of immune related diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L000849/1","grantId":"MR/L000849/1","fundValue":"428726","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Arthur","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
