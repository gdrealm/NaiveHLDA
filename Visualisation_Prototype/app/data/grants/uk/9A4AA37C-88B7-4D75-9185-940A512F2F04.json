{"id":"9A4AA37C-88B7-4D75-9185-940A512F2F04","title":"Extending the Theory of Colour Graphs","abstractText":"Constrain Satisfaction Problems provide a framework for a wide variety of problems across a number of scientific disciplines. For example, the problems of scheduling use of shared experimental equipment such as space telescopes, of interpreting geometric information as required by modern drawing tools, and of designing the layout of silicon chips can all be seen as Constraint Satisfaction Problems.In general, it is difficult to solve such problem so researchers concentrate on expanding their knowledge of case that are tractable. Recently for a particular class of these problems progress has been made by considering a particular structure --- the solution graph --- that is associated with these problems. Our aim is to continue this progress by looking at solution graphs for a class of problems for which they have not previously been studied. It is hoped that this will lead to improved algorithms that will help us efficiently solve new problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E048374/1","grantId":"EP/E048374/1","fundValue":"107777","fundStart":"2007-11-12","fundEnd":"2011-05-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Published results have been cited in recent publications.

A chararacterization of pairs of colourings that are connected in the solution graph for 3-colouring was found.\n\n\n\n4. Partial results were obtained on finding shortest paths between colourings in the solution graph for 3-colouring.\n\n\n\n5. A characterization was found of when the solution graph for 3-colouring is connected.\n\n\n\n6. It was shown that it is coNP-complete to decide when the solution graph for 3-colouring is connected ...\n\n\n\n7. ... but can be done in polynomial time for planar graphs.\n\n\n\n8. Results for special graph classes (notably chordal graphs) were found.\n\n\n\nThe project also obtained initial results on the problem of connecting colourings by using extra colours and on similar problems on the solution graphs for the Hamiltonian Cycle problem. The findings were disseminated via many conference and seminar talks and journal publications. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
