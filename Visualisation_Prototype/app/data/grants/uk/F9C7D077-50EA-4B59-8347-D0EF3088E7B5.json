{"id":"F9C7D077-50EA-4B59-8347-D0EF3088E7B5","title":"GridPP4 Tranche-II ScotGrid-Durham Staff Grant","abstractText":"This proposal, submitted in response to the 2009 invitation from STFC, aims to\nprovide and operate a computing Grid for the exploitation of LHC data in the UK.\nWe propose to operate a Grid as the main mechanism for delivering very large-scale\ncomputational resources to the UK particle physics community. This foundation will\nunderpin the success and increase the discovery potential of UK physicists. We\nwill operate a production-quality Grid, delivering robustness, scale and\nfunctionality. The proposal is fully integrated with international projects and we\nmust exploit the opportunity to capitalise on the UK leadership already\nestablished in several areas.\nThe main objectives (equal priority) are:\n1) To operate and maintain the UK Tier-1 center at RAL meeting national and\ninternational obligations to the wLCG and the LHC experiments.\n2) To operate and maintain the UK Tier-2 infrastructure, meeting national and\ninternational obligations to the wLCG and the LHC experiments.\n3) To deploy, operate and support the Grid middleware in the UK across the Tier-1\nand Tier-2 facilities.\n4) To support the experiments in the use of the UK Grid.\n5) To manage the GridPP project in an open, efficient, and cost-effective manner.\n6) To collaborate and communicate across the UK and international communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K003615/1","grantId":"ST/K003615/1","fundValue":"26675","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Richardson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" Computing for the LHC experiments to be supplied by GridPP Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
