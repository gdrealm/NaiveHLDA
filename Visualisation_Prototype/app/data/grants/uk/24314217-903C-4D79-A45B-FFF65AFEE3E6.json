As these datasets comprise human populations from the entire globe, it is tempting to look at the geographic distribution of genetic variants and try to find explanations for why some variants are more common in some places rather than others. After all, we have known for a long time that sickle cell anaemia is found in regions where malaria was prevalent, as it can confer resistance to the deadly disease. So, could we find other important genetic variants that have been affected by natural selection by examining their geographic distribution? While this approach sounds promising, it raises the issue of being able to distinguish between those patterns that truly reflect past and present selection, and patterns that might have simply arisen by chance. In this project, we propose to develop a population genetics framework that will allow us to reconstruct the spread of anatomically modern humans around the globe, taking into account past changes in climate and the shape of continents. By knowing how and when people got to different parts of the world, we will then be able to distinguish which genetic variants have geographic distributions too extreme to be the result of mere chance, and thus have been the target of natural selection. Besides looking for regions under selection in the nuclear genome, we will also consider the small amount of genetic material contained in the mitochondria, small organelles that act as the biochemical powerhouses in our cells. Mitochondrial DNA is arguably the most widely used source of information for reconstructing human past history, but such reconstructions rely on the assumption that mitochondrial DNA has not been affected by natural selection. Our new framework, together with a better geographic coverage of mitochondrial genetic variability that will be achieved in this project, will allow us to test the assumption of neutrality and to find any deviation that should be taken into account in future work on human settlement history.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H008802/1","grantId":"BB/H008802/1","fundValue":"555557","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Francois  Balloux","coPersons":["Andrew David Friend","Andres  Ruiz-Linares"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
