These discussions centered on three major societal trends that are destined to influence each other - the explosion of information, the emergence of mobile computing and the growth in social networking and open innovation. Clearly these three major trends open up new opportunities, but they also pose significant challenges. The first of which is how to make sense of the copious quantity of data available to organizations today.The world is becoming more instrumented - organizations are collecting data at ever more disaggregated levels. Services, such as credit and loyalty cards, allow banks and retailers to capture individualized data. Every mobile phone transmits location data, while every security camera records activity data. Products are increasingly instrumented. Sensors in cars and planes continuously transmit data on product performance and reliability. Every visit to a website leaves a footprint. Data is contained in every photo posted to Facebook and every tweet made to Twitter!A challenge for organizations is how to harness these data and extract insight from them. Today's context means that this challenge is complicated by three factors - (i) the simple volume of data, (ii) the fact that 80% of this data is unstructured and (iii) the fact that much of the data lies in disconnected source files - databases, excel spreadsheets and individual websites.The thesis that underlies this proposal is that parallel developments in mobile computing and social networking technologies, including open innovation, may offer a solution to the challenge of extracting insight from data. For while the simple challenge of making sense of data is not new, the novelty in this proposal lies in bringing together mobile technologies, with socially distributed ways of working, to explore the potential of what we are calling collaborative performance analytics. Collaborative performance analytics builds on the ideas of open innovation and socially distributed ways of working. It asks the question - how might organizations open up their performance data to a wider community and engage them in the analytics process. Clearly a pre-requisite would be for the wider community to have to have access to technologies that enable socially distributed working. Hence the thrust of this proposal - that we should bring together mobile technologies, with social networking applications to enable collaborative performance analytics. To explore this concept this proposal explains how we intend to create a demonstrator scenario to illustrate the potential of collaborative performance analytics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I031782/1","grantId":"EP/I031782/1","fundValue":"97343","fundStart":"2012-01-16","fundEnd":"2013-01-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project has been used to inform subsequent work on performance analysis and data analytics, particularly that conducted through the Cambridge Service Alliance.
