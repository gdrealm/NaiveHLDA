{"id":"121A459D-5F48-4B50-8BB7-1D3D38CB156C","title":"The Musicians' Union: A Social History","abstractText":"The UK music industries are worth &pound;3.9 Billion per annum (Page 2010) and the creative industries remain high on the political agenda. Yet too little is known about the lived experience of a key set of creative workers - musicians. Through the prism of the history of the British Musicians' Union (MU) this research aims to develop a new understanding of this key group of workers underpinned by access to a unique and previously untapped resource - the MU Archive.\\n\\nSince the formation of its precursor - the Amalgamated Musicians' Union in 1893 - the MU has played a highly significant yet largely unexplored role in the UK's broader musical, cultural, and socio-economic life. As it has included interactions and negotiations with, amongst others, the BBC, orchestras, government, other trades unions, music industries' employers and copyright agencies, the scale of the MU's activities mean that its story provides major insights in to the UK's broader social history. \\n\\nWe will examine musicians as particular types of workers, highlighting the implications of their working patterns for their organisation within a trade union. An examination of the ways in which the MU has operated will provide further insight into the history of the UK's music industries. This will include investigating the extent to which its actions can best be seen as attempts to uphold the professional standing and remuneration of musicians, or as attempts to prevent or slow down inevitable changes in the production of music. In order to provide a balanced perspective, we will interview employers of musicians and thus seek to provide a disinterested account of both sides of the negotiating table.\\n\\nA number of key themes is likely to emerge. One is the role of technology and the ways in which the MU sought to resist those technological changes which it believed threatened its members' livelihoods. This includes its reaction to radio which was founded on the principle that as much music as possible sould be live. We will investigate how it restricted the amount of recorded music played on the radio through 'needletime' agreements with the BBC and the PPL and its continued influence on radio policy via its members' involvement with the BBC orchestras. We will also examine how the MU reacted to the advent of the 'talkies' - which made cinema orchestras redundant - and to the rise of recorded music - which lead to its 'Keep Music Live' campaign. Of particular interest in such cases will be how the MU's restrictive practices have contributed to the kinds of music which resulted.\\n\\nA related issue is that of non-union labour such as amateurs, military bands and foreign musicians. We will examine how the MU reacted to such perceived threats and how its negotiations with both employers and government gives insight into broader societal concerns around labour policies. especially with regard to immigration.\\n\\nA further area will be the impact of musical genre on musicians' lives. We will examine both publicly and commercially funded musical activities (such as concerts, recording and teaching) and how the MU has sought to influence provision in all areas. In doing so we aim to shed further light on how genre impacts on both the type of music which is supplied to the public and on musicians themselves. We will also show how certain ideologies within certain musical genres militated against MU membership and examine the impact of that on musicians, the music and the MU.\\n\\nOur research is designed to provide the first full account of one of the UK's most significant cultural intermediaries. It is premised on a belief that the MU is uniquely placed to provide insight in to the lives of artistic creators and the industries within which they work(ed). Through a critical examination of the MU's history we aim to gain further understanding not only of the creative industries but also the broader UK society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I027215/1","grantId":"AH/I027215/1","fundValue":"449612","fundStart":"2012-04-02","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin John Cloonan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
