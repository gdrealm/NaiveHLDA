Each data source will be processed in a way that adds value. Customers of the webGIS platform comprise house builders, developers and their advisors, local authorities, community groups and businesses. At least one dataset will be crowdsourced, as proof-of-concept to showcase its value and practicality. When Data4Sustain is market ready, it is intended that it will be available via professional subscription. A free low resolution product will also be made available for the general public. Data4Sustain will be designed to be modular and capable of including new data sources as they arise. Outputs of this feasibility stage will include an evaluation of the availability, limitations and applicability of each dataset measured against cost, usability, relevance, potential for added value; a prototype built for local authority use to evaluate how well it works; and a refined business model for bringing the product to market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N007301/1","grantId":"NE/N007301/1","fundValue":"41395","fundStart":"2015-07-02","fundEnd":"2016-07-01","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Darren  Beriro","coPersons":["Patrick Deryk Bell","Mark  Cave"],"organisation":"NERC British Geological Survey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
