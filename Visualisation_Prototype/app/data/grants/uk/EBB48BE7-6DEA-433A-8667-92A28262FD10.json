{"id":"EBB48BE7-6DEA-433A-8667-92A28262FD10","title":"SIGNAL: Stochastic process algebra for biochemical signalling pathway analysis","abstractText":"The science of computational Systems Biology uses computer modellingof living organisms to help us understand those process at work insidewhich we cannot directly see or measure. Based on experimentallydetermined data, a systems biologist invents a model of how they thinkthat things work. The model is usually analysed by one of two kindsof computer simulation: stochastic or deterministic. In a stochasticsimulation the mathematical theory of probability is used to express adegree of uncertainty about how fast reactions happen or thequantities of reactants which are in use. In a deterministicsimulation the theory of ordinary differential equations is used togive an efficient continuous approximation of very large numbers ofmolecular elements. Computational modelling is helpful here becauselaboratory-based experimentation is an extremely expensive,time-consuming and labour-intensive process. An important subject forcomputational modelling is signal transduction.Signal transduction pathways are biochemical pathways which allowcells to sense a stimulus and communicate a signal to the nucleus,which then makes a suitable response. They are complicated signallingprocesses with built-in feedback mechanisms. Signalling pathways areembedded in larger networks and are involved in important processessuch as proliferation, cell growth, movement, cell communication, andprogrammed cell death (apoptosis). Malfunction results in a largenumber of diseases including cancer, diabetes and many others. Despiteenormous experimental advances in recent years there is still anabsence of good, predictive pathway models which can guideexperimentation and drug development. To date, models either encodestatic aspects such as which proteins have the potential to interact,or provide simulations of system dynamics using ordinary differentialequations.We will develop a novel approach to analytic pathway modelling basedon our experience of modelling concurrent computing systems. The keyidea is that pathways have stochastic, computational content. We willmodel pathways using stochastic process algebras which denotecontinuous time Markov chains thus affording new quantitative analysisand new ways to structure pathways and reason about incompletebehaviour.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E031439/1","grantId":"EP/E031439/1","fundValue":"281804","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Bio-PEPA modelling language and associated tool suite have been adopted for use to analyse a number of systems.

The language can be equipped with static analysis techniques to allow the automated detection of errors and inconsistencies in models. Semantic equivalences were developed which allowed models to be simplified in useful ways which preserve key aspects of behaviour but reduce the computational burden of system analysis. Moreover an extended version of Bio-PEPA was defined with enriched support for spatial modelling. The language also supported formal stochastic model checking via the PRISM tool.\n\nAll these features allowed detailed analysis of biological processes. The ease of developing both a stochastic and a deterministic interpretation of a model, allowed these to be compared, and supported the investigation of the impact of stochasticity of biological processes such as the circardian rhythm in the alga Ostreoccocus tauri. Bio-PEPA is being taken up within the QUANTICOL project for experimental models of smart transport systems. This has informed the design of a new modelling language with enhanced capabilities for spatial modelling.
