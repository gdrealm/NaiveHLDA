{"id":"D9A07F61-1366-4D87-BFC1-ED55593E999D","title":"Platform Grant: Structural Acoustics","abstractText":"The aim of this Platform Grant is to underpin the research activities in the ISVR in the area of Structural Acoustics, and to facilitate adventurous feasibility studies in the related area of biodynamic systems. Structural acoustics involves the analysis, modelling and control of noise and vibration of complex, built-up structures over a wide range of frequencies, typically the audio frequency band. Specific topic areas are smart structures for vibroacoustic control, high frequency structural dynamics, automotive noise and vibration, railway structural acoustics, dynamic behaviour of buried fluid-filled pipes and buried object location using acoustics, damage detection and human identification, and vibrations of nonlinear systems. Modelling techniques developed for structural-acosutic systems will be applied to the modelling of biodynamic systems, and paradigms from nature will be used to develop engineering solutions for vibroacoustic control.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E006450/1","grantId":"EP/E006450/1","fundValue":"880472","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  ElliottMike John BrennanBrian  Mace","coPersons":["David John Thompson","Neil  Ferguson","P  Gardonio","Christopher John Jones","Tim  Waters"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
