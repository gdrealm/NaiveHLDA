This research project seeks to examine the practices of curriculum making, in order to compare and contrast approaches across organisations and subject areas. </p>\n\n<p>It will detail the relationships between the prescribed, described and enacted curriculum, in particular for the 14-18 age group who can learn in both settings. The project aims to illuminate the factors and their interrelationships that result in different cultures of curriculum making and the experience of students at a time when reform of the curriculum and qualifications is high on the political agenda. </p>\n\n<p>Analysis will be both qualitative and quantitative, providing thick descriptive case studies of the cultures of curriculum making, and inductively identifying factors affecting the processes in different subject areas and organisations through thematic and factor analysis. This mixed method approach combines the advantages of in depth interpretive analysis with a wider data base to enable a degree of generalisation of the findings and comparison between different types of organisations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2452","grantId":"RES-000-22-2452","fundValue":"77532","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Edwards","coPersons":["Mark  Priestley"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
