When this migration takes place their visual system changes from one that is designed to see the world in colour to one that is more sensitive but can only see in back and white. This change is more suitable to their new environment where there is little light and almost no colour. Eels probably do this by changing the type of cells that process light information, with some cells that are colour sensitive being lost and others that only respond in darker environments being added. In no other adult animal is there such a dramatic change in its visual system. However, no one has ever looked at exactly which cells are lost, which are added, and how this happens By inducing this change with hormones in animals in the laboratory, we will be able to discover which types of cell are lost, which types are added, and the time over which this occurs. The addition and loss of these light capturing cells means that the whole visual system must have to change in a unique manner, but such changes in response to different environments have never been investigated. Genes regulate these changes in the eels visual system as it moves from rivers to the sea. We will explore the role of genes in this process. In this way we will be able to link together genes that are responsible for changing the eel's visual system with changes in the organisation of the retina and the animal's behaviour.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D009820/1","grantId":"BB/D009820/1","fundValue":"212911","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Glen  Jeffery","coPersons":["James Keith Bowmaker","David Martin Hunt"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
