{"id":"FFEA16B5-D895-4FA6-8076-374D341D9551","title":"Language and Social Structure in Urban France","abstractText":"This project is borne of a dissatisfaction among linguists and social scientists with the way in which, as interest in the relationship between language and society has grown since the 1970's, their respective disciplines have drifted apart to their mutual detriment. One sociolinguist has even warned of a 'sociologically innocent and ignorant generation of sociolinguists'. \\n\\nWith around 30% of UK research now having a sociolinguistic focus, the consequences of this ignorance for French linguistics are alarming. Firstly, sociolinguists who attempt to study the interaction between language and societal factors (e.g. age, social class) are often hamstrung by outdated methodology which takes too little account of recent methodological developments in sociology, anthropology, and geography and consequently lacks the sophistication necessary for reliable results on the social dimension. Secondly, sociolinguists can be accused of failing to understand changes in French society since the so-called 'Trente Glorieuses' (1945-75), an era of unprecedented economic growth buttressed by heavy public-sector investment. During this period urbanisation doubled, the presence of racially diverse migrants increased considerably, gender parity began to be taken seriously and real upward mobility for many became possible. The less favourable economic conditions of its aftermath, and the emergent post-industrial society and concomitant 'medianisation' of social classes resulted in linguistic changes which might be described as 'levelling'. But as Hornsby (2006) has argued, the received view that levelling implies inevitable homogenization has meant that new forms of variation in France's burgeoning urban centres have been largely ignored, as sociolinguists have explored either (as in the case of the Phonologie du fran&ccedil;ais contemporain ('Contemporary French Phonology') project: PFC) remote, linguistically divergent sites (e.g. Gu&eacute;zennec 2003) or deprived multi-ethnic banlieues on the oskirts of major cities (e.g. Jamin 2005). Much other work has focused on perceptions rather than behaviour (e.g. Bulot 2008) or on the now revalorised regional languages. While the PFC project among others has provided useful linguistic data, there has been limited application of sociolinguistic methodologies and even more limited consideration of sociological background. \\n\\nThe proposed research network seeks to remedy this unhealthy division of labour by bringing together sociolinguists, sociologists, social anthropologists and geographers to debate possible methodological interfaces. The desired research outcomes are twofold. First, by examining the different models of analysis used for sociolinguistic and sociological research both in France and in the Anglo-Saxon world, a better understanding of the rapidly transforming French social landscape can be achieved. For sociolinguists, this will mean the development of models which are, at last, properly informed by contemporary sociology and applied to the specific conditions of francophone (rather than north American or anglophone) society. At the same time, this network will facilitate the use of findings and models developed for the study of language to challenge and refine existing sociological practice. These would include the relationship between linguistic and non-linguistic conceptions of identity, language as an 'objective' and 'subjective' dimension of class, and the characteristics of urban networks, all of which will provide social scientists working on contemporary France with new insights and perspectives to inform their own research agendas. In order to provide a precise focus for this debate, two one-day workshops and an interdisciplinary conference will explore questions which interface sociolinguistic and sociological issues in the French context: i) class, ii) urbanization and social structure ana iii) the self and 'other' within a globalizing community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H031448/1","grantId":"AH/H031448/1","fundValue":"35352","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The research network has created an ongoing dialogue between sociologists and sociolinguists working on French.

A social network-based approach to variation and change offers a possible explanation for extreme regional dialect levelling and the dominance of a supralocal norm throughout France, precisely because it links language change directly to the peculiarities of France's urban structure. Whereas in neighbouring Britain, low-status forms have often been adopted much further afield than the cities with which they are associated, the physical and geographical separation that exists between, on the one hand, the urban mainstream and, on the other, the most socially disadvantaged significantly restricts contact between these groups of speakers and thereby inhibits linguistic change from below. Indeed, somewhat paradoxically, it might even be possible to speculate that the Revolutionary dream of a unified francophone nation may have been realized more as an accidental by-product of urban planning than as a result of top-down language planning diktat by successive administrations. Stigmatized forms can certainly be identified, most notably in the banlieues. However, since the concept of 'inner-city area' - shorthand for urban deprivation and social problems at the heart of urban settlements in the Anglo-Saxon world - appears to have less resonance in the French context, the adoption of these features rarely occurs beyond their peripheral heartlands. It is for this reason, we would argue, that the controversial term fran?ais populaire is outmoded insofar as it denotes a nationally homogeneous sociolect, broadly synonymous with working-class Parisian usage.There is already evidence of divergent norms within the same city and in different banlieues, and the experience of new towns such as Milton Keynes suggests that, as the second and third indigenous grands ensembles generations come of age, this divergence is likely to become more marked. While some interesting evidence points to parallel linguistic developments in geographically distant banlieues, these are likely to have arisen because of a similar input dialect mix rather than from contact, and there already some signs that norms are beginning to diverge. The palatalization of dental stops, for example, appears to have attained the status (in Labovian terms) of linguistic indicator in Paris, linguistic marker in Grenoble and stereotype in Marseille. Parallel urban development of this kind may also go some way towards explaining the surprising lack of impact, until the very late twentieth century, of Labovian sociolinguistic methodology in France (cf. Gadet 1996: 89: 'il n'existe ? peu pr?s pas ? ce jour de sociolinguistique variationniste fran?aise'). While Labovian methods have been successfully applied in French speaking north-America , they have enjoyed much less success in francophone Europe. Kerswill (2011) has argued that the lukewarm reception variationism has received in France may stem from a fundamental difference over social models. While Labovian approaches in their early manifestations at least drew heavily on the 'consensual' social model associated with Talcott Parsons (1937, 1951), which presume shared norms amid inequality, French sociologists and linguists (e.g. Bourdieu 1982) have been more attracted to 'conflict' models which start from a position of irreconcilable opposition between classes. The more evident physical separation of classes in the French context may explain both the preference for conflict models and the failure to apply Labovian urban methodologies, which presuppose a stratified population sample taken from one place (e.g. New York's Lower East Side for Labov 1966)\n\nThe interrelationship between the two principal foci of our volume, social class and space, serves to illuminate a glaring and hitherto inadequately explained contrast between the urban sociolinguistic profiles of France and the UK. It may also, we have suggested, offer a partial explanation for the lack of enthusiasm in France for Labovian methodology. But our volume also demonstrates that French exceptionality might not always be quite what it seems. While banlieues clearly differ greatly from British (or American) 'suburbs', the recent 'gentrification' of former working-class inner-city areas in some British cities, most notably London, may perhaps in time echo aspects of French urban socio-spatial arrangements, with similar linguistic consequences. Conversely, the depopulation of English industrial towns such as Liverpool (Watson 2006), or Accrington (Vivian 2000) has left their working-class populations isolated, in some respects like those of the banlieues, and showing increasingly focused and divergent non-standard norms. As far as methodological approaches are concerned, while French reticence with regard to the Labovian paradigm may be grounded in part on a rejection of the Parsonian social class model in the French urban context, it may be that subsequent variationist critiques of that model (see for example Rickford 1986, Milroy &amp;amp; Milroy 1992a) have simply been overlooked. In short, variationist sociolinguistics has moved on from its 1960s and 1970s guise, providing space for precisely the meeting of minds which thevolume, and the research network which preceded it, have endeavoured to promote. It is hoped that the findings will impact the research methodologies used by sociolinguists and sociologists working on French Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
