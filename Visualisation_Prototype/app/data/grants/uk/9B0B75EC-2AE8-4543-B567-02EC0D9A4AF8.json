Two types of stem cell with particularly useful properties are human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), both of which have the ability to renew themselves indefinitely and to become almost any type of specialized cell, which could be used to treat disease. The ability of hESC and iPSC cells to self-renew and maintain their special properties has traditionally been assessed using a set of stem cell genes and surface markers. However, testing for these markers is usually invasive and/or destructive and is only qualitatively related to the stem cell?s potential. We believe that such potential can be revealed by measuring the metabolism of stem cells; especially the way they generate energy to grow and develop. In our proposal we will compare the ?energy profile? of hESCs with that expressed by iPSC and non-stem cells to provide robust biomarkers of stem cell potential and viability. We have extensive experience of this kind of approach from working with early embryos, the source of embryonic stem cells. Specifically, we have shown that embryo metabolism can be linked to successful development and ultimately the capacity to give rise to a pregnancy. We expect to discover similar links between the metabolism, health and function of stem cells and believe that our project could play a key role in the translation of stem cell research from the laboratory to the clinic.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802556","grantId":"G0802556","fundValue":"207739","fundStart":"2009-10-05","fundEnd":"2012-01-04","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger George Sturmey","coPersons":["Mark Christopher Coles","Henry John Leese","Robert Colin Bielby"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
