Building on our recent collaboration (Nature, 2011, 474, 367), we will develop crystal structure prediction methods to underpin the discovery of new functional organic materials. Our focus is 'porous organic cages', a sub-class of porous materials in which the UK has an international lead, and their use in selective molecular separations and in ionic conductivity. The programme involves the close integration of leading groups in the areas of computation, synthesis, and specific property measurements. Hence, a wider outcome will be the development of an integrated 'prediction-to-properties' approach that will have broad impact across many classes of materials, as outlined in the EPSRC Grand Challenge, &quot;Directed Assembly of Extended Structures with Targeted Properties&quot;.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K018132/1","grantId":"EP/K018132/1","fundValue":"308960","fundStart":"2013-09-16","fundEnd":"2017-09-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Graeme Matthew Day","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" The prediction of organic molecular crystal structures is a demanding challenge for computational chemistry, and reliable methods in this field will allow computationally-directed design of molecules with targetted solid-state properties. An aim of this project is the development of crystal structure prediction methods that are able to be used on large molecules with intrinsic porosity, to direct the synthesis of new molecules with improved properties. \n\nA key early finding in this project is that small changes to large molecules can have a big impact on the entire landscape of possible crystal packings of a molecule, not just on the crystal structure that is observed. For example, one molecule might have only one low enegy possible crystal structure, while a modified version has many nearly energetically equivalent crystal structures available. The former is desirable for engineering predictable crystallisation. The findings are developing crystal structure prediction methods in general, so could be used in any area where the arrangement of molecules in the solid state has an important impact on properties of interest (pharmaceuticals, pigments, dyes, orgaic electronics).
