{"id":"DE3C2EC3-B187-47EF-AA9D-AD13A6EAF674","title":"E-Infrastructure Connectivity","abstractText":"The proposal is for funding to establish a high performance computing centre to be shared by the N8 Research Partnership - a consortium of the research-intensive universities in the North of England (Durham, Lancaster, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and York). The aim is to underpin world class research in science and engineering, which increasingly makes use of large scale modelling, simulation and scale data analysis, alongside theory and experiment. The new facility will be cost effective, because it will be shared by 8 universities rather than each of the universities having a similar facility, and it will enable much more complex simulations and analyses to be run routinely than is currently possible. As well as underpinning world class research, the facility will be of great interest to industry, and is likely to lead to new research and innovation collaborations between the universities and business.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K000209/1","grantId":"EP/K000209/1","fundValue":"667649","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris John Taylor","coPersons":["David  Hogg"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
