{"id":"F8546EEE-51CE-4363-9D14-13917AB36E31","title":"Nanofuels as Future Energy Vectors","abstractText":"This project proposes a novel concept of using nanofuels, pure metal nanoparticles (dry-fuel) or suspensions of nanoparticles in a liquid fuel (wet-fuel), as a future energy vector. The concept comprises three elements: production, utilization and regeneration of nanofuels. The utilization of thermal energy upon combustion of nanofuels is identified as the key element for the feasibility study. This project will use reciprocating internal combustion engines (ICEs) as a model system to assess the combustion process of nanofuels. Three identified potential nanofuels, silicon, aluminium and iron, in the form of wet-fuels and dry-fuels will be injected and combusted in two ICEs, and the engine performance including in-cylinder pressure, temperature and work output will be characterised. Key features of the experimental assessment including nanofuel formulation and injection, ignition and combustion of nanofuels, oxide particle capture and regeneration, and engine emission, wear and lubrication will be investigated. Our preliminary investigations indicate that the project is a visionary and innovative but risky application, worthy of EPSRC funding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F027281/1","grantId":"EP/F027281/1","fundValue":"179443","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dongsheng  Wen","coPersons":["Zheng Xiao  Guo","Theodosios  Alexander","Roy James Crookes","Chris  Lawn"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
