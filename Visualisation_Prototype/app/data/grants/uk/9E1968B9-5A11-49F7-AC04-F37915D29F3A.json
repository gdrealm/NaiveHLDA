In the last few decades, demographic, social and economic changes have resulted in increased diversity across individual life courses and housing careers, while the recent economic downturn is having a disproportionate impact on first time home buyers.</p>\n\n<p>Three research questions address the dimensions of change, the key determinants, and whether social and geographical polarisation has increased over time. Secondary data from Scottish Censuses and the Scottish Longitudinal Study, linked to other data on housing and labour market characteristics, are used in an integrated macro-micro modelling approach to predict living arrangements at the end of each decade for both age groups. Results will provide evidence on the main drivers of decadal change and whether differences between the most advantaged and disadvantaged social groups, and between local areas in Scotland, have widened over time.</p>\n\n<p>The study is the first on Scotland to analyse housing transitions and changing living arrangement for young and older adults within a common analytical framework, and findings will contribute to the evidence base for policy development.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K003747/1","grantId":"ES/K003747/1","fundValue":"157739","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elspeth  Graham","coPersons":["Zhiqiang  Feng"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
