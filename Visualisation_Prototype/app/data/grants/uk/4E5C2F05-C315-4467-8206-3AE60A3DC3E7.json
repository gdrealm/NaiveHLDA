It will be given by skin injection daily for 14 days. The main outcome in this pilot study will be to see if blood tests confirm that we have indeed damped down the inflammation that we think is so damaging in this condition. The drug is already used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0502131","grantId":"G0502131","fundValue":"797968","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Christopher  Crossman","coPersons":["Julian  Gunn","Allison  Morton"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
