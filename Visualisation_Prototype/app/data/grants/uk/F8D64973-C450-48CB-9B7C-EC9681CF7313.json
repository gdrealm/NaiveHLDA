These 'naval' data will be computerised and combined with compatible material from trade and taxation records.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4127","grantId":"RES-000-22-4127","fundValue":"77069","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2012-10-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Charles Ayton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
