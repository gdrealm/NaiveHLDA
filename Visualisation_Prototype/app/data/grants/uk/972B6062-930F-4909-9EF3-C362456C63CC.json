These embryonic cells reside in clusters on the borders of the spinal cord and brainstem, where nerves exit and enter to connect to the rest of the body. These clusters, the boundary caps, are thought to be important for the correct development of the nervous system in mammals. In addition, they have the potential to act as stem cells that could be used for nervous system repair and regeneration. For these reasons, we want to understand how boundary caps are formed, how they function in the embryo to aid nervous system development, and how they eventually become nerve cells and support cells to in the adult nervous system. To achieve these goals, we will explore the function of three types of molecules that were previously shown to regulate the behaviour of neurons and blood stem cells and are targetable by clinical drug therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I008373/1","grantId":"BB/I008373/1","fundValue":"398276","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2014-07-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We have so far published two research paper and two review articles, all in open access journals.

Others may wish to use VEGF as a therapeutic agent early on after nerve injury to promote repair. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
