{"id":"E9ED40C6-2BED-4E40-B33A-31494B9CC422","title":"BEYOND NAVIER-STOKES: MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF NON-EQUILIBRIUM GAS DYNAMICS","abstractText":"Being able to predict how fluids behave at high speeds or small scales is key to a diverse range of exciting future technologies: high Mach number, high altitude flight could transform global travel, while the ability of nano- and micro-devices to change our macro environment by manipulating it at the smallest scales holds the promise of a new industrial revolution. While these technologies seem, at first sight, unlikely partners, both require a deep understanding of fluid dynamics under extreme conditions / beyond that of current models. Our vision in this project is to provide this understanding by building a new dynamical model from the fundamental statistical mechanics of gas flows at the molecular level. The project will employ a postdoctoral research assistant and a PhD student, with modest travel and support costs, and our results will be disseminated through a one-day open meeting (comprising seminars and a workshop) to present and discuss UK research in non-equilibrium flows. This meeting will also act as a forum to discuss the future growth and direction of this research community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D007488/1","grantId":"EP/D007488/1","fundValue":"233372","fundStart":"2006-02-02","fundEnd":"2010-02-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jason M Reese","coPersons":["Colin  McInnes"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
