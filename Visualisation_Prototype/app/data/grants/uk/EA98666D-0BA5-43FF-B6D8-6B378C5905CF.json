The current problems are:(i) users feel disengaged with the bland, utilitarian, and non-user friendly design of many existing energy control and feedback interfaces which could impact upon their general disengagement with energy efficiency; (ii) users are not aware of the connections between their decisions and energy use; (iii) designers do not know enough about user behaviour in the context of energy usage There is a gap in the market for novel and exciting beautifully designed, high-end energy control and feedback interfaces. EMPOWER's work packages will begin with ethnographic workplace studies of users' interactions with energy and decision making processes, and drill down into detailed user insights and users' mental models. These insights will underpin a series of highly iterative and novel participatory design workshops within workplaces, with users and stakeholders. The outcomes of the workshops will drive the product development process. The final outcome will be an innovative user-driven energy efficiency product, which can be commercially exploited beyond the end of the project. The project is supported by More Associates' CarbonCulture behaviour-change delivery and research platform and an ongoing collaboration with the Department of Energy and Climate Change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/I000720/1","grantId":"TS/I000720/1","fundValue":"83989","fundStart":"2010-09-06","fundEnd":"2012-09-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project developed More's nascent 'CarbonCulture' energy monitoring platform into a suite of web apps, a user dashboard, blog, visualisations and physical touchpoints designed to engage staff in understanding the energy and carbon impacts of everyday behaviours and practices.

This digital platform has now been launched commercially as CarbonCulture. \n\n\n\nA collaboration between More Associates, Design at Brunel University and WMG at the University of Warwick, EMPOWER benefited from DECC's offices in Whitehall as a pilot site. The project developed More's nascent 'CarbonCulture' energy monitoring platform into a suite of web apps, a user dashboard, blog, visualisations and physical touchpoints designed to engage staff in understanding the energy and carbon impacts of everyday behaviours and practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brunel and Warwick teams:\n\n\n\noProvided a sound base of knowledge of user-centred design techniques for behaviour change which fed into the other parts of the project, via a literature and practice review\n\noCarried out a series of original ethnographic workplace studies of users' daily interactions with energy to inform design decision-making\n\noDisseminated the insights revealed by the workplace studies to the project team, in an appropriate format to provide a base of knowledge for the rest of the project\n\noRan a programme of novel participatory user-centred design activities involving building users and other stakeholders\n\noContributed to the design and development process for the new service arising from the participatory design activities\n\noDisseminated research findings to relevant stakeholders and a wider audience, including writing journal and conference papers. \n\n\n\nThe aim of the pilot was to achieve a high level of staff engagement--measured by repeated use of the platform--demonstrating effective methods of engaging employees in caring about the part their behaviour plays in CO2 emissions, both as a precursor to behaviour change, and to increase buy-in to relevant building operation changes.\n\n\n\nFollowing ethnography, participatory activities, carbon footprinting, and background research (including contributions from all project partners), key areas of staff behaviour were identified to address through CarbonCulture's combination of digital and physical interventions, including: \n\n\n\no encouraging staff working late to move to a single floor\n\no encouraging staff to eat lower-carbon lunches\n\no logging commuting transport choices\n\no involving staff in assessing thermal comfort \n\no providing information on CO2 impact of business travel\n\n\n\n'Apps' were paired with physical touchpoints (e.g. loyalty cards for lunch choices), available via a dashboard presented as part of the DECC intranet. All apps offered users points for logging particular actions, redeemable for prizes; a 'social proof' ticker showed users the actions their colleagues were taking. \n\n\n\nPublicly available electricity and gas visualisations--both near-realtime and summary data--connected staff directly to building performance and seasonal changes, enabling conversation with facilities management. The introduction of gas data visualisation at DECC enabled 20% daytime gas savings to be identified.

This digital platform has now been launched commercially as CarbonCulture. Other government departments--including Number 10--have also signed up for elements of CarbonCulture. \n \nMore launched CarbonCulture publicly in late 2012, with a blog and a DECC-endorsed report including sections authored by Dan Lockton, the Brunel/Warwick researcher on EMPOWER. Academic outputs which might be put to use by others include papers published and in preparation on interaction heuristics, engagement strategies and mental models of energy.
