Phyllostictine A constitutes a formidable synthetic challenge, and its assembly will require us to develop a variety of new chemical reactions and processes. Emphasis will be placed on sustainable, catalytic transformations and on adhering to the principles of the 'ideal' synthesis (e.g. atom, step and redox economy). For example, the 4-, 5- and 11-membered rings will be made using palladium, gold, and ruthenium catalysis respectively. This natural product displays potent herbicidal activity against a variety of weeds, and most recently, anti-cancer activity. In parallel with the total synthesis, a selection of analogues and intermediates will be tested for bioactivity. This will help advance our understanding of the mode of action of phyllostictine A, and will pave the way for the development of simplified analogues of the natural product for use in medicine and agriculture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031783/1","grantId":"EP/K031783/1","fundValue":"415371","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mike  Shipman","coPersons":["Paul  Neve"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
