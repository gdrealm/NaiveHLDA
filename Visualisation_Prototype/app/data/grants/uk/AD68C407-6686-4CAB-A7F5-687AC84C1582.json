{"id":"AD68C407-6686-4CAB-A7F5-687AC84C1582","title":"Creativity in Film and Television in an Interactive Media Environment","abstractText":"&quot;The theme of the proposed collaborative network, which is supported by a series of workshops and an interactive website, is the conditions which motivate and inhibit creativity following recent developments by interactive media. The literature of creativity is well developed but it rarely examines creative practices in television and film, and in particular the implications of new media and interactivity in this sector. Building on the ideas of those writing about the creative sector, we propose to explore the topic in a series of workshops which will support a collaborative, multidisciplinary network of academics and professionals, notably those in small media production businesses on which the industry is traditionally reliant. The workshops will be held in the south west of England because of the large cluster of SMEs operating out of Bristol and the surrounding Wessex and Devon/Cornwall region. Significant London participants are involved on the grounds that a regional perspective cannot ignore the gravitational pull of the capital. The regionally contained focus will encourage a more coherent, cohesive network that will allow rapid advancement of thinking on the thematic area. The project and outcomes will be of interest to those involved in television and film production, commissioning and training, and to academic sin the humanities and social science, including business and management, who are interested in the motivation and coordination of creativity in screen-based media. Primary aims of the project are:\n? To enhance understanding of the contemporary conditions which motivate or inhibit creativity in television and film in an interactive media environment. \n? To encourage and support new collaborative relationships and intellectual exchanges between academics from a range of media-related disciplines and professional and SMEs involved in television, film and new media in the south west of England, and to engage media users in the exchanges through on activities.\n? To disseminate outcomes regionally and nationally\n? To identify and mutually agree tangible research projects, a book for publication and industry training programmes that capitalise on the professional and academic resources, expertise and emerging knowledge base of the network.\n\n\n&quot;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E508286/1","grantId":"AH/E508286/1","fundValue":"11765","fundStart":"2006-11-03","fundEnd":"2007-11-02","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Daymon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Bournemouth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
