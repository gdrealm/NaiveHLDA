The project aims to develop novel guided wave ultrasonic technology for\nsubsea pipelines to be deployed by diver or a Remote Operating Vehicle (ROV): (A) Condition Monitoring (CM) for the\nearly detection of in-service defects, e.g. corrosion - using Long Range Guided Wave Ultrasonic (LR-GWU) Pulse Echo\n(PE) technology, Teletest Focus electronic instrument, encircling ultrasonic sensors and signal processing for the on-line\n(in-production) innovative inspection of subsea pipes carrying hydrocarbons, (B) Innovative High Power - Continuous Wave\n(CW) LR-GWU electronic instrument and transmitters to dislodge and remove accumulated debris fouling in subsea &amp;\ntopside pipelines at temperatures of up to 400C, (C) for pipe regions susceptible to fouling - innovative Moderate Power\nCW LR-GWU electronic instrumentation and transmitters for fouling prevention in subsea pipelines at temperatures of up to\n400C.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N012127/1","grantId":"NE/N012127/1","fundValue":"645464","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Tat-Hean  Gan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
