It will study hearing infants of deaf mothers who use a sign language as their dominant language (HoD infants) in comparison to hearing infants of hearing mothers (HoH infants). Despite normal hearing, HoD infants have a different early experience of speech and language to that of HoH infants.</p>\n\n<p>First, since deaf signing mothers are less likely to use auditory speech than hearing mothers, their infants are likely to have reduced exposure to auditory spoken language.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the experience of HoD infants includes both a language in the visual modality, eg British Sign Language (BSL), and one in the auditory modality, eg English. Since HoD infants are exposed to two languages, they will be compared to HoH individuals who are exposed to two spoken languages.</p>\n\n<p>This project will use near infrared spectroscopy and eye-tracking to test the hypothesis that the experience of HoD infants influence their neural representation of language, their patterns of eye gaze during spoken and signed language perception and their audio-visual speech integration.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001329/1","grantId":"ES/K001329/1","fundValue":"171528","fundStart":"2013-06-17","fundEnd":"2016-06-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Evelyne  Mercure","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
