It will investigate how interactive technologies can promote older people’s engagement with their physical and social environments, and encourage new forms of interaction with younger people. Designers and cross-generational participants will co-design novel interactive devices and situations will be created that challenge age-based stereotyping and encourage younger participants to reflect on ageing. Detailed analysis of participant’s experiences with the devices and systems will provide a rich source of information for the design of future innovative technologies and services and also help specify best practice for involving older people in design.\n<br />\n<br />The project will proceed by 3 case studies: Window-on-the-world will focus on engagement with the local environment to explore issues of mobility and sense of place; Digital Place explores virtual worlds as a medium for older people to interact with one another and with younger people; Engagement in the public sphere develops systems for public places to support interaction with the wider community.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F015925/1","grantId":"ES/F015925/1","fundValue":"330243","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Wright","coPersons":["Mark  Blythe","William  Gaver"],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
