This has been much remarked upon by historians and English literature specialists, but has been subject to little anthropological analysis. The Pitt Rivers Museum (founded in 1884) has over 30,000 objects from England and these collections can be seen as part of this broader concern for what it meant to be English. </p>\n\n<p>The project will analyse the collections of the museum, together with the history and motives of the people making the collections (who were often heavily involved in institutions such as the Folklore Society) to throw new light on what was being collected and how this was used. The overall aim of the project is to use a major museum collection, with its connected documentation, to throw light on the modern construction of Englishness in the late nineteenth century. The changing structure of the English collections will be analysed, focussing on the geographical areas of Essex, Somerset, Yorkshire, Greater London and Oxfordshire. Archival resources will be used to provide rich contextual information on the artefacts and the people who collected them.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1439","grantId":"RES-000-23-1439","fundValue":"369203","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Hugh Gosden","coPersons":["H  La Rue"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
