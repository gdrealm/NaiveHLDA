{"id":"72ECE015-8BA2-4274-9CF1-BE2A772C73E0","title":"Antiparasitic pyrrolopyrimidines","abstractText":"Parasitic diseases, including malaria, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis are amongst the most prevalent diseases world wide collectively with the poorest availability of effective drugs. Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) has been reported to have a greater morbidity and mortality than HIV/AIDS in some locations. Parasitic disease is difficult to treat because the parasites become closely connected with the living host and it is therefore difficult to find drugs that attack only the parasite. Available drugs are few and are also toxic to humans. In laboratory experiments, we have shown that novel compounds designed and prepared in at the University of Strathclyde and University of Dundee are potentially able to fill the gap in drug availability. Our project is to optimise the effectiveness of our compounds to provide candidate drugs for full clinical development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901426","grantId":"G0901426","fundValue":"672972","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Suckling","coPersons":["Michael Peter Barrett","William Nigel  Hunter","Colin  Gibson"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
