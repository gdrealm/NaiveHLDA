{"id":"EF76D176-CADB-433E-9F8F-541AE9575E5E","title":"Measuring the Security of Internet Infrastructure","abstractText":"The rising tide of spam, phishing and other online crime has shown that it's not enough to leave it to website owners to encrypt traffic. You may be misled or defrauded if you visit the wrong website; or if you visit a website with the right name but at the wrong IP address; or if you visit a site at the right IP address, but hosted in another part of the world. It has thus become clear that we have to protect the Internet at the infrastructure level, which means protecting the naming (DNS) and routing (BGP) mechanisms. The industry is about to deploy DNSSEC, and various ad-hoc mechanisms are being used to protect BGP.However these deployments will take years, and many firms will initially get it wrong. There is a clear case for NPL to monitor the process in order to measure what's working and what isn't; to create pressure on sectors of the economy that lag behind; to help improve both authentication and monitoring tools; and to provide an authoritative voice on the move to a more secure infrastructure. Our research programme will help create this capability at NPL by establishing the monitoring framework. We also plan to develop a BGP reflector system to deal with global routing table growth out of band , along with an authentication and validation system for the route servers used by internet exchanges such as LINX and AMSIX to improve peering point resilience and to prevent a number of possible types of attack.We believe that this is of global importance, and that as players such as the US Department of Commerce and the IETF have got bogged down in political wrangling, a UK / European standards lead has a good chance of developing into global leadership.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H018298/1","grantId":"EP/H018298/1","fundValue":"291819","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The &quot;Costs of Cybercrime&quot; study has been cited 75 times already and used to debunk earlier scaremongering about cybercrime.

Unfortunately, by the time Richard arrived the relevant people at NPL had been made redundant -- so there were significant limitations as to what might be achieved. However, it was possible to identify a significant project (the Whois study for ICANN) that NPL would never have tendered for otherwise. The contract was eventually awarded to NPL and the work completed before the end of the project timeline. A key outcome from this project will be a novel open source Whois parsing system, which will be of use to a range of different organisations. \n\n\n\nWe also collected data on a number of other aspects of cybercrime including how expired bank domains are exploited, and wrote high-profile reports on both the costs of cybercrime and the resilience of the Internet interconnection ecosystem. The deft-whois.org package is attracting interest by various industry groups (such as APWG) and individual cybercrime researchers. The ICANN study is going to impact decisions made as to the future of the Whois system, with the many of the comments made being favourable.\n\n\n\neg:\n\n\n\nhttp://forum.icann.org/lists/comments-whois-pp-abuse-study-\n\n24sep13/pdfRlDwg7bizt.pdf\n\n\n\nThe RySG believes that the scope and thoroughness of the Draft Report\n\nprovides sufficient information to support careful analysis of its\n\nstated results. Most importantly, we believe that the study results\n\nprovide objective data that will facilitate policy development work\n\ngoing forward. The ICANN work will be exploited via the industry and through ICANN while the reports on cybercrime and Internet resilience are having impact on policy - with the latter having been adopted as EU policy by ENISA.
