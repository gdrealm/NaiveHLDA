As such, within the historical context of the 2001 OAC, this project will integrate secondary data to implement a methodology of screening of small area residential structures over time, and create temporal measures of uncertainty that can be both communicated to policy-practitioner audiences, and furthermore, be utilised to provide updates to the 2001 OAC. This work will establish a methodology that can then be used prospectively in the construction of the 2011 OAC.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004719/1","grantId":"ES/K004719/1","fundValue":"146864","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The grant has generated a series of classifications including:\n- temporal Output Area Classification for England\n- London Output Area Classification\n- New American Atlas (tract level classification for the US)\n- analytical refinements to the 2011 Output Area Classification (co-funded by the Office for National Statistics in a related stream of work)\n\nUsage has been stimulated through a variety of outreach activities including a training workshop (13 Participants: splits - 42% academic staff; 42% academic student; 8% public sector; 8% commercial); a public engagement website (http://www.opengeodemographics.com/ - 828 recorded users to date) and a visualisation portal (http://public.cdrc.ac.uk - 5500 users to date).

This hampers the creation of temporally updatable geodemographic products because of compatibility and availability of different attributes between countries. Research findings have highlighted how LSOA / Data Zone geography may be a more appropriate level through which future UK secondary data based classifications can be constructed. Furthermore, the re-use of secondary data to supplement census attributes has wide ranging (and sometimes undesirable) consequences for temporally updatable OA level classifications. Such issues arose in part because non-census data show a greater degree of inter-correlation than the census attributes for which they serve as proxies. This is manifest in significant differences when compared to classifications built with solely with census data, or built using a mixed set of attributes. Given such challenges, secondary data were shown to be most effectively used to create uncertainty measures rather than in a hybrid combinations of census and non-census data.\n \nA geodemographic model for the US was developed from small area estimates derived from the American Community Survey (ACS), which is a resource that to a great extent has replaced much of the detail that would traditionally be measured by a Census of the Population. This international case study was useful in the context of the 'Beyond 2011' debate about the future of the UK Census, in demonstrating the large error margins of ACS data when associated with neighbourhood scale geodemographic classification. We made the case in this work that a solution to this problem is a shift from a variable-based mode of inquiry to one of multidimensional contexts (e.g. geodemographics). While single ACS variables can be methodologically problematic to use for disaggregate geography, a large collection of such variables provides utility as composite measure of places under investigation. Given the uncertainty of the census remaining into the future, and the potential of alternative non-census sources, we argue that this particular work could hold great significance as our spatial data economies continue to evolve.\n\nFinally, this grant has developed a technique for the compilation of large scale cartographic outputs that can enable the visualisation of multiple attributes about places without the need to consult web maps. Such techniques have hitherto been difficult to develop with &quot;off the shelf&quot; GIS tools; however, through coupling of open source tools a range of cartographic products has been created for local authority districts (e.g. 2011 Census Atlas: http://www.alex-singleton.com/r/2014/02/05/2011-census-open-atlas-project-version-two/). We anticipate that the classifications arising out of this research will be extended and implemented by a range of end users. The code used to create our classifications is in the public domain, and we anticipate that it will be adapted to create customized classifications for particular applications domains or geographic areas. Our related work in creating the 2011 Output Area Classification is enjoying wide use and has spawned a niche application to London (see cdrc.ac.uk/public). In an age of public expenditure restraint, the software and applications provide a useful free alternative to commercial solutions.\n\nAt the time of writing, we are in early negotiations with the Greater London Authority to develop and extend our research methodology to develop a geodmeographic classification principally from secondary sources. It is hoped that this will enable updating of the 2011 London Output Area Classification, that is widely used to broker planning applications and in a range of public resource allocation decisions.
