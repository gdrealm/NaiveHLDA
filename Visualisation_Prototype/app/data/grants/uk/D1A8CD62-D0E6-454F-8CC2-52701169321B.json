Numerous genes influencing behaviour have been identified in organisms such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster but there are very few studies of how important allelic variation at these genes is to variation in natural populations. We will take advantage of new techniques in genome information, genetic scoring and statistical approaches to detecting genes in natural populations to examine the genomic location of genes influencing variation in ecologically important behavioural traits in the Arctic fly species Drosophila montana. We will examine genes identified in the laboratory as influencing these traits in D melanogaster as well as random background genes. We will produce semi-natural populations of D montana from two different natural populations (from Finland and Canada) and test whether allelic variation in genes is co-inherited with male song and female song preferences. The results will identify genes influencing these traits in natural populations and tell us if these genes are conserved between populations and between different species. The results are important because they allow us to determine whether the function of genes is conserved across species, which has important implications for our understanding of gene function and behaviour, which are very poorly studied in natural populations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E015417/1","grantId":"NE/E015417/1","fundValue":"254151","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Ritchie","coPersons":["Roger Kenneth Butlin","J  Slate"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
