It will relate key moments of the social and political history of the period to the production of film and video. It will analyse the legislative and censorship constraints on mainstream cinema of the period, and will look at parallel developments in experimental, abstract and artists' film and video.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119286/1","grantId":"119286/1","fundValue":"69431","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sue  Harper","coPersons":["David  Allen","Justin Timothy Smith","Graeme  Harper"],"organisation":"University of Portsmouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
