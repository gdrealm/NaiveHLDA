This project examines randomised evaluations of an innovative anti-poverty program which simultaneously tackles capital and skills constraints in an effort to encourage occupational change amongst the worldâ€™s poorest women.</p>\n\n<p>The issue at hand is whether one can create successful female entrepreneurs - who acquire skills and make use of productive capital - out of poor women who started out with neither. Key to this question is whether asset and skill transfers can induce the poor to alter their occupational choices and permanently exit poverty, as opposed to simply enabling them to increase their consumption in the short term. By looking at three evaluations in three countries (Bangladesh, Uganda and Pakistan) we hope to&nbsp; draw more general lessons regarding whether or not basic entrepreneurship, where severely disadvantaged women take on occupations which were the preserve of non-poor women, can serve as a powerful means for transforming the economic lives of the poor.&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L005689/1","grantId":"ES/L005689/1","fundValue":"327450","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin Stuart Burgess","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
