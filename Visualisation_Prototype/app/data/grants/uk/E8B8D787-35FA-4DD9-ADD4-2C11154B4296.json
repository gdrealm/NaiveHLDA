It is now clear that one reason why older people can develop problems with their immune system is that they carry chronic viral infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV). The immune system has to work very hard to control these infections and this ?diverts? them away from new infections such as flu.\nWe propose to use anti-viral drugs, that are often used to treat diseases such as cold sores, to dampen down CMV and therefore allow the immune system to recover from fighting the virus. We anticipate that the efficiency of the immune response will then improve and make a stronger response to flu vaccination.\nIn the first part of the study we will find the dose of tablet that is most effective in this effect and see how long it needs to be taken for. In a second section we will use this dose in a large cohort of elderly donors who are receiving their influenza vaccine. We will therefore test if this intervention is effective. \nIf proven, this form of treatment could be valuable in a wide range of clinical conditions and help to promote healthy ageing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000622","grantId":"G1000622","fundValue":"884312","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Moss","coPersons":["Jonathan  Van-Tam","Richard James McManus"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
