To function effectively precise connections must be made between cells which are often far apart. Cells in the retina of the eye, called retinal ganglion cells, send out fine processes called axons, which travel along predefined pathways (a process we call ?navigation?) and connect to specialised cells (their ?targets?) within the brain which will transmit visual information collected by our retinas for processing into images. So how do retinal axons make the long journey from the eye to their targets in the brain without going astray? A little like us using a map to navigate from one location to another and deciding whether to turn left or right at a junction to reach our destination, retinal axons respond to signals from their environment to tell them which way to go. These signals are chemicals produced by the different areas of the brain which attract or repel axons and so guide them along the correct path. These signals are identified by receptors on the surface of the axon which cause the axon to turn one way or the other. Axons can make wrong decisions if either the chemical cues are wrong or if the receptors on the axons that respond to the chemical cues are abnormal. One example of how this process can go awry is where special sugars or ?glycoprotein sidechains? found on the surface of cells are not constructed properly. This results in retinal axons failing to respond to cues in the brain telling them where to turn, and ending up in the wrong areas of the brain. We do not yet know why problems with the structure of certain glycoprotein sidechains give rise to problems in the axon?s ability to navigate appropriately to their targets; the experiments in this proposal aim to find out. To investigate this question we will disrupt the formation of particular glycoprotein sidechains and see how this affects the ability of axons to find their targets in the brain. Identifying what happens when particular sugar structures are not formed correctly will allow us to begin to understand the role of these sugars during normal development of the visual system. In the future we may be able to use our knowledge of the normal processed involved in guidance of axons from the eye to the brain to repair retinal axons lost either by disease or injury.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701460","grantId":"G0701460","fundValue":"557918","fundStart":"2008-10-13","fundEnd":"2012-01-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Pratt","coPersons":["John Orr Mason","David  Price"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
