As with any defence mechanism, the risk of collateral damage is unavoidable. The immune system uses several different strategies to limit the damage to the host. T cells (a type of white blood cell) play a central role in orchestrating immune responses, in the killing of infected cells and in the maintenance of immunological memory (the basis for vaccines). Each T cell that develops has a unique receptor on the surface that can bind to components of pathogens and hence recognise their presence. Each T cell expresses a unique, randomly generated specificity for such recognition. There is of course always a potential for such receptors to recognise different organs in the body. To avoid overt attacks on the body's organs, T cells with strong self-reactivity are eliminated during development. However, some self-reactive T cells escape this elimination process and need to be kept in check. Recently, a subgroup of T cells / called regulatory T cells (Tregs) / has been identified. These T cells are self-reactive, but instead of initiating immune responses, they suppress the function of potentially destructive T cells. Individuals who lack this population of T cells die young from a devastating attack on different organs in the body. There is great interest in learning more about how the Tregs work. In particular, scientists want to know if they can harness the power of Tregs to protect against autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. In addition, pharmaceutical companies developing drugs against normal T cells that cause autoimmune diseases, want to avoid inhibiting the function of Tregs. PI 3-kinases are enzymes that relay information from outside the cell to the cell nucleus, allowing the cell to make decisions based on environmental cues. When a T cell recognises a component of a pathogen, the PI 3-kinase pathway is activated and influences the type of immune response that ensues. By inhibiting PI 3-kinases, certain harmful immune responses may be averted. Pharmaceutical companies are therefore currently developing and testing dugs against p110delta, the type of PI 3-kinase expressed in T cells (but not by cells in the major organs). We have found, using mice in which PI 3-kinase activity in T cells has been blocked genetically, that Tregs are unable to block the function of conventional T cells. This could be a serious disadvantage for the development of drugs against p110delta and needs to be investigated further. To this end, we intend to identify genes that may be affected by the lack of PI 3-kinase activity in Tregs. This will help us better understand precisely how p110delta inhibition may affect Tregs, but may also help us identify other genes that are required for Treg function; most of these are currently unknown. We will also examine how p110delta contributes to the development of regulatory T cells during an immune response. Most of the experiments to date were performed with cell cultures and do not necessarily fully reflect the role of Tregs during an autoimmune attack. To examine this aspect further, the capacity of p110delta-deficient Tregs to protect against autoimmune diabetes will be examined. This requires a more complex network of cellular interactions and it will be important to map the precise defects of p110delta-deficient T cells in this context. Finally, we will delete the gene for p110delta specifically in Tregs. This experiment will reveal definitively whether p110delta in Tregs is essential for keeping the rest of the immune system in check. The benefit of this research is that we will gain a greater understanding of the genes and molecules that control the life-saving properties of Tregs. In addition, this research will help inform pharmaceutical companies about the advantages, as well as potential dangers, associated with drugs that target p110delta.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E011659/1","grantId":"BB/E011659/1","fundValue":"21442","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our work has further clarified key signalling pathways in regulatory T cells, thus not only adding to the base of literature in this area -- which will be of interest to immunologists and medical researchers alike -- but has also taken us one step closer to defining novel therapeutic targets by which regulatory T cells may be manipulated in vivo in the treatment of a spectrum of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases.\n\nOn the basis of the findings of this work, we were successful in securing a Wellcome Trust Veterinary Integrated Research Training Fellowship grant, which has further advanced the story.

Of these, we confirmed by quantitative PCR and by a technique called flow cytometry that CD38 is expressed at lower levels on p110?D910A Tregs than on wild-type Tregs. Increased CD38 expression was found to be associated with high suppressive capacity; however CD38-/- T cells die in vitro and could not be used for suppression assays. CD38+/- T cells suppressed normally. The ligand for CD38 is CD31 and together with our collaborator Professor F Marelli Berg, we showed that CD31-/- target cells could be suppressed efficiently. We propose that CD38 is a useful marker for Tregs, but not directly involved in suppression.\n\nWe have shown that TGF-? signalling is normal in p110?D910A (enzyme-null) conventional helper T (Th) cells, despite the failure of TGF-? to convert these Th cells to Tregs. In vivo expansion of Tregs is defective in p110?D910A mice infected with Leishmania major, thus confirming that the failure of p110?D910A Th cells to convert to Tregs in vitro is relevant in vivo (J Immunol. 2009 183:1921).\n\nContrary to our expectations, p110?D910A Tregs could prevent the induction of diabetes melitus in a mouse model (L Walker). \n\nWe have crossed p110?flox mice with Foxp3Cre mice to selectively delete p110? in Tregs. Deletion of p110? selectively in Tregs does not lead to overt inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, at least not in young animals (O. Garden). OX40Crep110?flox mice are also healthy, but lack follicular helper T cell functions (J Immunol 2010 185:4042)\n\nUsing the EL4 thymoma model, we have demonstrated that the Foxp3Crep110?flox mice can reject tumours under conditions under which wild-type mice do not. However, contrary to previous reports, we have not observed substantial expansion of Tregs in this model and are investigating other mechanisms for how Tregs may suppress tumour immunity in a p110?-dependent manner. Our work has further clarified key signalling pathways in regulatory T cells, thus not only adding to the base of literature in this area -- which will be of interest to immunologists and medical researchers alike -- but has also taken us one step closer to defining novel therapeutic targets by which regulatory T cells may be manipulated in vivo in the treatment of a spectrum of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases.\n\nOn the basis of the findings of this work, we were successful in securing a Wellcome Trust Veterinary Integrated Research Training Fellowship grant, which has further advanced the story.
