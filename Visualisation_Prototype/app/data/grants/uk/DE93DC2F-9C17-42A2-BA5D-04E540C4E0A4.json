{"id":"DE93DC2F-9C17-42A2-BA5D-04E540C4E0A4","title":"Making it happen - Increasing access to diagnosis and treatment for tuberculosis","abstractText":"One third of 8.7 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) occurring each year are missed by health services and there is a need to increase case identification worldwide. In Ethiopia, TB is one of the major causes of adult death, affecting the lives of many people and health service coverage is poor, resulting in low case detection. \n\nRecently, proactive approaches canvassing the community to identify individuals through house-to-house visits combined with health education have been shown to increase TB case detection. We have shown that village-based health extension workers (HEW) in Ethiopia increase the accessibility to diagnosis and treatment in the Southern Region. HEWs are part of the Ethiopian Health Service Extension Programme (HSEP), which aims to improve access to health services by providing basic health packages at community level. In the new TB package, HEWs identify individuals with symptoms suggestive of TB, collect and prepare tests from sputum and supervisors with motorbikes link the HEWs to the diagnostic laboratories and treatment is provided and supervised at home or at the local health post. The package has doubled the number of cases identified and increased treatment completion, confirming that bridging the gap between services and the community is crucial to increase uptake. \n\nThe approach has considerable support by health providers and donors and has generated interest for adoption by the HSEP. However, moving from an independent-project to a package integrated within the system is a process that requires many steps for adoption. Clearly there is a need to have a process to formalise the debate to consider the adoption of a community-based TB package and we therefore propose to:\n\n1. Engage health and financial policy decision makers at district, regional, national and international level to discuss the process of policy development in Ethiopia,\n\n2. Engage policy makers and programme managers to set objectives and agreeing monitoring and impact assessment needs for the TB package and \n\n3. Document the process considering the implementation of the package within the HSEP as a case study. \n\nMethods: \nThe process will start by preparing packages of documentation describing concepts and research findings; systematic reviews available; summaries of findings presented in ways accessible to political, health service and user audiences and users; descriptions of mechanisms to guide policy change and discussion guides with issues that need debate. We will organise a variety of discussion platforms of all stakeholders including focus groups discussions (FGDs) and in depth interviews (IDIs) with Ministry of Health (MoH), beneficiaries and programme implementers to highlight barriers to accessing diagnosis and treatment; staff from the Health Bureau and the department of finance and economic development to discuss the package, its advantages, disadvantages and costs; barriers, enablers and implementation modalities of best practice that could be useful to the community and IDIs with high level policy makers, the WHO and funders to discuss policy formulation. The process will culminate in a national meeting to discuss the package and eventual policy development.\n\nLearning by doing\nThe barriers for accessing services are not specific to TB and similar approaches are needed for other health problems and Ethiopia is desperately looking for interventions to improve health service delivery for rural communities. The process of adopting a new package could be used to build capacity to review and develop policies and as a knowledge transfer platform for similar packages within the HSEP. The process proposed would be a catalyst for capacity building in decision making, the use of research evidence for policy guidance and a case study on how evidence can inform policy development in a Sub-Saharan country.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L007746/1","grantId":"ES/L007746/1","fundValue":"82474","fundStart":"2014-03-03","fundEnd":"2015-03-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This projects aims to influence policy makers, funders and implementing programmes to adopt a package in which of community-based health workers identify individuals with symptoms of TB and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment at the village level. We have highlighted the findings of the project with policy makers (e.g. parliamentarians from UK and Canada, the World Health Assembly), funders (e.g. TB REACH, Global Fund), local politicians (Minister of Health) and programme implementers (National and Regional TB control programme). We are currently continuing the activities planned to influence policies, but we have made much progress to date. Notice some activities can not be made public, as they are informal discussion to inform policy makers.
