{"id":"5E974AAF-86FE-43B1-8BFD-0DD898084D88","title":"Properties, Individuals and Contingency","abstractText":"It seems obvious that existence is a contingent and temporary matter. You exist, but if your parents or grandparents had never met you would not have existed, and you did not exist before they met. However, this contingency and temporariness can be interpreted in different ways. One interpretation is that what is contingent and temporary is only what properties given individuals have, not the individuals themselves, just as winning the lottery is a contingent property because any given lottery winner could have lost and any given lottery loser could have won, and being young is a temporary property because any given old person once had it. On a different interpretation, what is contingent and temporary is not only what properties given individuals have but also what individuals there are in the first place to have those properties, so that non-existence implies that there is not even an individual to lack the property of existing. The current consensus in metaphysics is that existence is contingent and temporary according to the second, more extreme interpretation. The aim of the project is to call this consensus into question. In particular, it will do so by developing and applying the currently under-explored branches of logic that are best suited to serve as a framework within which to reason about what individuals and properties there are, were, will be or could have been. These branches are known as second-order modal and tense logic. Systematic considerations seem to favour logics of this type according to which the contingency and temporariness in existence all follows the pattern of the first interpretation. Thus it seems that in the most radical sense of 'exist', the sense of most logical significance, what exists is a necessary and permanent matter. The project will involve clarifying the exact bearing of the relevant logical systems on the metaphysical questions. Some of the relevant logical principles were already articulated by the great Persian philosopher Ibn Sina (980-1037) and rediscovered by the logician Ruth Barcan Marcus in the 1940s, but more recently developed techniques of formal semantics using the notion of a possible world enable more powerful mathematical techniques to be used in the analysis of the logical relations between the pertinent logical principles. But the project is far from a purely formal one. There is an apparent clash between the common sense facts and some of the putative logical principles at issue, and explaining how the appearance of inconsistency can be deceptive requires sensitivity to subtle metaphysical distinctions between different notions of existence that are not a formal matter. The upshot of the project should give us both more understanding of the original metaphysical issues and also refine our framework for reasoning about the distinctions between the contingent and the necessary and between the temporary and the permanent with respect to individuals and their properties. It will also act as a test case for the way in which the rigorous formal techniques of logic and the informal discursive procedures of other branches of philosophy can fruitfully interact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G005567/1","grantId":"AH/G005567/1","fundValue":"32739","fundStart":"2009-01-13","fundEnd":"2009-04-12","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  They have led to extensive developments in quantified modal logic, and have been applied as far afield as to the interpretation of quantum mechanics (see the citations of my book Modal Logic as Metaphysics in Google Scholar).

I provide systematic arguments for the paradoxical-sounding conclusions that necessarily everything is necessarily something and always everything is always something, explain why they are not as paradoxical as they sound, and show how they simplify the logic of this area. The methodology developed in my book Modal Logic as Metaphysics, involving the treatment of logics as much more similar to theories in natural science than is usually thought is applicable to a wide variety of disputes in logic and philosophy.
