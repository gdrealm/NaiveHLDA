This study aims to understand better how to prevent and treat many of the chronic diseases associated with ageing such as heart disease and stroke, cancer, arthritis, diabetes, respiratory disease and osteoporosis leading to fractures as well as how to maintain optimal health in later life. \n\nMeasurements of new biologic markers in blood, including genetic profile, are also enabling us to understand better disease processes and progression, which may help us identify better treatments. We continuing to follow up the participants in this study and in the next phase, assess physical and mental function to examine how we can influence how these change as we age.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401527","grantId":"G0401527","fundValue":"2147480","fundStart":"2006-01-03","fundEnd":"2011-01-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kay-Tee  Khaw","coPersons":["Paul James Foster","Nicholas  Day","David  Broadway","Nicholas John Wareham","Sheila  Rodwell"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
