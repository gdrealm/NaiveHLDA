Therefore, an important topic of research in visual cognition concerns the nature of the processes that determine where the eyes are directed from moment to moment. Recent research has highlighted two general categories of factors that affect where we look: stimulus factors related to the scene itself, and cognitive factors such as how we interpret what we are looking at. How these two sources of information trade off and are integrated with each other is not well understood. This research project involves a series of experiments aimed at understanding the mechanisms that control where we look in a complex, real-world visual scene.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F034229/1","grantId":"ES/F034229/1","fundValue":"343767","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John M.
