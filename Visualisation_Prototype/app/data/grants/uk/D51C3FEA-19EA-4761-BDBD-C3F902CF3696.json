{"id":"D51C3FEA-19EA-4761-BDBD-C3F902CF3696","title":"Development of a performance-based methodology for assessing concrete durability","abstractText":"A lack of reliable, consistent and standardised test procedures for evaluating concrete performance is frequently cited as a major barrier to the adoption of performance specifications and that the appropriate testing technology has not been sufficiently developed to satisfy performance-based philosophy. Indeed, performance-related design methods now permitted under EN 206-1: 2000 Annex J which states that 'such a method may be based on satisfactory experience with local practices in local environments, on data from an established performance test method for the relevant mechanism or on the use of proven predictive model'. Central to the concept of performance-based specifications include the availability of reliable, repeatable test methods which can evaluate the required performance characteristic(s) along with performance compliance limits which should take into account the inherent variability of the test method. It is evident that test procedures and predictive models are required such that those properties of concrete which ensure long-term durability can be determined very early on in the life of a structure and that it will meet specified requirements. The situation is made more complex by the range of cements now available under BS EN 197 which defines a total of 27 products in the family of common cements. There is thus a need for quick, reliable performance tests for concrete durability which have to go far beyond current reliance on the 28-day compressive strength. The lack of adequate performance-related test methods is one of the main factors inhibiting the move from prescriptive to performance-based specifications and forms the focus of this proposal. Furthermore, since it is the cover which protects the steel from the external environment, attention is directed towards assessing the performance of this zone. It is set against this background that the programme of work aims to develop predictive models and exploit novel testing techniques which can then be used in a performance-based testing protocol in the assessment of concrete durability. The techniques will utilise both electrical property measurements and permeation characteristics of concrete as a means of quantifying durability and hence long term performance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G02152X/1","grantId":"EP/G02152X/1","fundValue":"324724","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings from the research have been used in RILEM and ACI technical reports.

As a consequence, we now know why certain models are better than some others and more importantly which model is reliable for the prediction of service of reinforced concrete structures in marine environment. In addition, certain limitations of in situ tests for assessing the chloride induced corrosion performance of reinforced concrete structures was established. The findings from the project has already been in both RILEM and ACI technical reports, by which existing practices will be influenced. They are also beneficial to some of the model developers for improving the sale of their models to the construction industry. Construction","dataset":"gtr"}
