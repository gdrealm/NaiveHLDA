If this information is not transmitted or transmitted to the wrong place or at the wrong time, then the cells do not respond correctly and disease or developmental abnormalities may occur. It is therefore important to understand the precise function of proteins that regulate the transfer of information within cells in order to design treatments that interfere with or promote their function to combat disease. One such group of proteins act as molecular scaffolds by binding to particular enzymes involved in transmitting information. These scaffold proteins direct the location of the enzymes in the cell and can regulate their activities. We will investigate using rodent models how particular scaffold proteins and their associated signalling enzymes control normal neurone function and how these functions break down in response to stress, as can occur during stroke, brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases. The project will therefore elucidate important mechanisms underlying neurone behaviour and thus contribute to finding future treatments for neuronal diseases and brain injury. Such treatments will be beneficial to patients suffering from these conditions both in terms of prevention and enhanced recovery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400620","grantId":"G0400620","fundValue":"203542","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan John Whitmarsh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
