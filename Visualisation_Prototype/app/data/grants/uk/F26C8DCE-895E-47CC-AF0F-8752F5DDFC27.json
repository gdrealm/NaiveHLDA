Thus, a greater understanding of the complex\nregulatory networks that control cellular development, and how they operate, interact, and\nrespond to intercellular and extracellular signals is urgently needed to generate plants with\nincreased biomass and stress-tolerance. We propose that emergent properties of gene regulatory\nnetworks involved in cellular differentiation can be represented and tested mathematically\nusing information gained from development-specific transcriptomic signatures in response to\nvarying conditions. To test this hypothesis we are using as a model the Arabidopsis root phloem\nsieve element, for which we have developed a unique set of molecular, mathematical, and physiological\ntools. Because complete differentiation of the enucleated sieve elements takes place in a\nvery compressed manner, within 20 cells, SEs provide a cell differentiation model of unprecedented\ncellular resolution. Our goal is to integrate development-specific transcriptomic, molecular\nand imaging data, with information about known key regulators using a system of ordinary differential\nequations and agent based modeling. This mathematical approach will allow us to gain a comprehensive\nand quantitative perspective of the design rules governing the progression from stem cells\nto their final stage of differentiation. We aim to iteratively improve the accuracy and strength\nof our models by integrating additional data after exposing this cellular process to two disparate\nperturbations; symplastic isolation and iron deficiency.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N013158/1","grantId":"BB/N013158/1","fundValue":"247931","fundStart":"2015-11-01","fundEnd":"2018-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Yka  Helariutta","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
