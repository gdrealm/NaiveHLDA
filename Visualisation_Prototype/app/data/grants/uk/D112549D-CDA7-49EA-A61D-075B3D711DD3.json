{"id":"D112549D-CDA7-49EA-A61D-075B3D711DD3","title":"DISTRIBUTING INDUSTRIAL OPTIMIZATION TASKS TO RURAL WORKER","abstractText":"This proposal seeks to investigate the thesis that large numbers of industrial optimisation tasks can be outsourced to rural workers to provide a sustainable source of skilled employment. The project consortium brings together a team of collaborators with the interdisciplinary expertise required to investigate the social, business and technological issues inherent in the vision of &quot;human intelligence&quot; being subcontracted to rural workers from urban manufacturing industry. The goal of the three year program will be to deliver a 'business model' (supported by the performance and economic evidence from a series of trials) that can deliver long term benefits to rural populations. The challenges of delivering this objective range from the social and training issues associated with low literacy rates to the establishment of the performance metrics and pricing models required by the industrial customers. The project consortium of academics, government agency and commercial enterprises brings together a unique combination of skills that range from Crowdsouring and Interactive computer graphics to service innovation and Knowledge Process Outsourcing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J000728/1","grantId":"EP/J000728/1","fundValue":"519860","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Corney","coPersons":["Nuran  Acur Bakir"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
