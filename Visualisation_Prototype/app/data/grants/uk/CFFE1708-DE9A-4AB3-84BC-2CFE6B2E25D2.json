Lydgate, a monk at Bury St Edmunds (Suffolk), remains the most prolific poet in the English language. This project uses manuscripts in archives to show how Lydgate's often-overlooked shorter works can tell us a great deal about Lydgate's innovations in women's reading, literature for children, political propaganda, medieval humour, patronage, middle-class and urban reading, and popular religion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112804/1","grantId":"112804/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Bale","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
