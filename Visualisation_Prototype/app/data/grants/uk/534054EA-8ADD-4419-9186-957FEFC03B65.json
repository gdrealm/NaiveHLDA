{"id":"534054EA-8ADD-4419-9186-957FEFC03B65","title":"Socioeconomic status, psychosocial stress, and cellular ageing","abstractText":"Health varies with social class, and people in affluent sectors of society generally live longer and remain healthier than less privileged groups. Socioeconomic inequalities in health have become a major concern to health professionals and the public at large. There is an urgent need to understand how social factors are translated into disease risk. Psychosocial factors such as job stress, financial strain, social isolation and depression also contribute to risk of physical illness, and are more common in adults of lower socioeconomics status. It is possible that lower social status and exposure to chronic life stress stimulate faster ageing, and that this is one reason why they contribute to disease risk. Our project will test the hypothesis that lower socioeconomic position and chronic life stress lead to more rapid biological ageing by measuring the telomeres in the nuclei of cells. This is an interdisciplinary collaboration involving epidemiology, psychology and cell biology. The study will involve middle aged and older men and women who are part of the Whitehall II epidemiological cohort, a sample of British Civil servants who have been monitored for the part 20 years by Professor Marmot and his research group. They will have their telomeres measured, and assessments will be made of their cardiovascular and inflammatory responses to stress, subclinical cardiovascular disease, and oxidative stress. We expect that lower socioeconomic position and life stress will be related to a level of cellular ageing characteristic of an older person, and that these effects will be related to greater inflammatory stress responses. The study will deepen our understanding of the biological pathways through which life experience influences physical health, while pointing to new preventive and therapeutic avenues that might be explored in order to reduce socioeconomic health inequalities in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601647","grantId":"G0601647","fundValue":"230076","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Patrick Steptoe","coPersons":["Jorge  Erusalimsky","Michael Gideon Marmot"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
