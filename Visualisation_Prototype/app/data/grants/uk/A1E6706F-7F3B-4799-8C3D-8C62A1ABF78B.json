It draws upon and furthers the development of the following most recent key scientific advances:1. in quality improvement and modification of carbon nanotubes and their application in functional nanocomposites2. in the synthesis of porous media via emulsion templating 3. in nanoparticles as alternative surfactants including the synthesis of Janus, i.e. anisotropic two-faced, nanotubes and 4. in microbial synthesis of renewable (Janus) nanomaterials and their applications in green nanocomposites.The speculative nature of this research lies not only in the synthesis of bi-functional nanomaterials, but also in the use of guided self-assembly to create novel materials. The idea is to engineer innovative structural materials that can respond 'intelligently' to changes in their environment. The programme will explore the synthesis of anisotropic 'Janus'-particles, the development of scalable purification and modification processes for carbon nanotubes, and processes for manufacturing multifunctional materials. It will target applications in challenging environments, where extraordinary materials are in demand. The prime objectives of this proposal are to:1. foster a system of innovation connecting engineering research, basic science advances, and end-users in the design, synthesis, process and application of novel multifunctional structural materials;2. form an Exploration Group that brings together a network of distinguished scientists, academic experts, young academics and industrial users from around the world;3. engage with the public, media professionals and policy makers with a view to educate and inform the public and potential users and receiving feedback from these groups. The Exploration Group, as a network of excellence, will interact through a Roundtable of Ideas programme. It consists of planned and ad hoc activities such as colloquia, workshops and ideas factories to generate Blue Skies ideas and identify new research directions. The skills-set of the team will be enhanced through the exchange of research personnel. An interdisciplinary team of young researchers with a broad spectrum of skills in the area of multifunctional materials will be nurtured to take an internationally leading role in this field. This grant will provide the necessary space to think, be creative and flexible, to collaborate freely and to take risks for which there is little room in project-based funding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E007538/1","grantId":"EP/E007538/1","fundValue":"915469","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This Challenging Engineering Programme aimed to establish my workgroup, the Polymer and Composite Engineering (PaCE) Group, at the heart of a Network of Excellence, combining expertise from basic, applied, social and engineering sciences to develop scientific and engineering ideas to potential products. During the course of the programme PaCE grew to between 25 to 30 members (ca 20 PhD and up to 9 PDRA) from various backgrounds. The team did conduct adventurous research in nanomaterial enhanced multifunctional materials. Specifically, the project added to the design, manufacturing and applications of multifunctional materials, fibre reinforced nanocomposites and novel porous media. Throughout the project we did or started to develop: 1. a novel scalable CNT purification and modification method; 2. processing and fabrication protocols for synthesis of anisotropic Janus nanoparticles; 3. new characterisation techniques required to study such materials; 4. guided self-assembly into novel structural materials simultaneously performing a second function, i.e. foam templates for macroporous polymers, change shape or as delivery tool for living matter, 5. applications in areas as diverse as the oil servicing, chemical and construction industry; 6. durable truly green nanocomposites with structural performance. \nFor a concrete example; our research into very permeable yet mechanically robust macroporous polymers was inspired by the need of the oil industry to identify replacements for gravel packs usually employed as permeable filters down oil wells. The title of the Challenging Engineering call in 2006 was &quot;Bringing Ideas to Life&quot;; our idea was to utilise recently &quot;rediscovered&quot; particle stabilised emulsions as templates to produce macroporous polymers. To address the industry's challenge of compromised well integrity and reduced production efficiency posed by gravel packs, we proposed using emulsions, which can be pumped down the oil well and polymerised when placed, triggered by the temperature of the well, to yield a very porous and mechanically sound permeable filter. The polymerised, permeable porous material should have a minimum gas permeability of 1 D and compressive strength of 3.5 MPa. Prior to our work, research within the emulsion templating area heavily focused solely on high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) stabilised by surfactants to synthesise polyHIPEs. &quot;Standard&quot; polyHIPEs are very porous, open-cell and interconnected but unfortunately have only low gas permeabilities of up to 0.46 D and very poor mechanical properties. We showed that particle stabilised HIPEs with internal phase volume fractions of up to 0.92 could be produced by using suitable nanoparticles and that the emulsions can be polymerised into novel poly-Pickering-M/HIPEs, which were however closed-cell and so impermeable. Here the nanoparticles act simultaneously as emulsifier for the M/HIPE template and as reinforcement in the final polymer foam. To create interconnects in this poly-Pickering-M/HIPEs, small amounts of a surfactant were added to pre-made Pickering-emulsions prior to polymerisation. The resulting modified poly-Pickering-M/HIPEs had much larger pores and interconnecting pore throats (compared to standard polyHIPEs) and had adequate mechanical strength and gas permeability. This was further explored by a KTS with the aim to explore the real world suitability of these materials for down well filters. \nAlso, we it was possible by tailoring the emulsification process to prepare HIPEs in which surfactant and particle stabilised droplets co-exist. When polymerised these templates yield macroporous polymers with a hierarchical pore structure in which large closed cell pores are embedded in many interconnected smaller pores. These polymer foams are permeable and have mechanical properties exceeding those of standard polyHIPEs but also poly-Pickering-HIPEs. Such materials might be of interest for controlled delivery applications.\nMoreover, as part of this Challenging Engineering Award the group was twice invited to the Science Museum London. We took part in a three day workshop called Trash Fashion in the Antenna wing to demonstrate the potential of bacterial cellulose. This hands-on workshop was visited by 10,000 people. Also, we did provide a materials for a stationary showcase in the museum on nanocellulose materials.
