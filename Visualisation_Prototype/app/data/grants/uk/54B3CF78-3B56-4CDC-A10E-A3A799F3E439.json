{"id":"54B3CF78-3B56-4CDC-A10E-A3A799F3E439","title":"New Perovskite Materials with Large Field-Induced Electromechanical Strains","abstractText":"Professor Cann will be a Visiting Scholar at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Sheffield for a period of 3 months from April 1st until June 30th 2011. During his study visit, he will undertake in collaboration with Professor Reaney's research in the field of PbO-free ceramics which exhibit high electromechanical strain. The main aim of the research is to combine the excellent compositional-processing-studies carried out in several promising systems at Oregon with the exceptional knowledge of crystal chemistry, structure and microstructure available within Prof. Reaney's group. In addition, Prof Cann will use his time at Sheffield to visit with other interested research groups at Leeds, Imperial, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester to foster further links within the UK community. He will, were appropriate, give seminars and discuss his excellent research findings at targeted UK groups who work in Electroceramics","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I033319/1","grantId":"EP/I033319/1","fundValue":"30704","fundStart":"2011-06-30","fundEnd":"2011-09-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The work has resulted in the development of multilayer capacitors for high tempertaure electronics (&gt;150 oC). The capacitors were developed at Sheffield and the technology has also been used to fabricate temperature stable capacitors based on CaTiO3. Sheffield are looking to commercialise there compositions and process.\n\nAs computers shrink in size, the components are required to perform at higher temperatures since heat sinks and fans can no longer be utiiised.
