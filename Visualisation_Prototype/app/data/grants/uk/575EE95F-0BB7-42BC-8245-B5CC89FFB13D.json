Currently there are two main approaches. The first is readily accessible to biologists, but offers only small amount of material at high cost. The other requires highly trained chemists to provide the materials, where the chemistry is challenging and often unreliable. Our approach represents a new biotechnology\n\nAims and Objectives\nWe aim to provide two related simpler approaches that should allows biologists to access the desired NTPs with relative easy in also allow them to access more useful amounts of these materials in a cost effective manner. Our objectives centre on using an enzyme system, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), to facilitate the production of NTPs. \n\nPotential Applications and Benefits\nThe specific class of NTP that we will address in this one-year proof-of-concept proposal has a range of applications in determining how enzymes work and also how signaling pathway operate within biological systems. Our approach will benefit research workers in these areas and the specialist chemical companies that prepare NTPs. With our concept proven, we hope to expand our strategy towards a broader range of nucleotide systems, and generate a generic, broad platform towards this class of molecule.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M024733/1","grantId":"BB/M024733/1","fundValue":"109470","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Robert Hodgson","coPersons":["Martin  Cann","Martin  Schroeder"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
