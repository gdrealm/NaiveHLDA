This Committee, with members in history, archaeology, historical geography and art history from London, Birmingham and Nottingham universities, has proved very successful and productive. It continues to be strong and active with members and the PI teaching on Silk Road courses at each others institutions; advising on research students; facilitating Wikipedia Editathons at member HEIs; providing students for annual internships at IDP; ongoing discussions for joint research projects; and regular meetings to discuss the IDP resources, their dissemination and their potential exploitation in research. Applications are currently being considered at the BL for two PhDs with IDP under the CDP programme. \n\nThe conference held at the start of the grant period involved all the network members and furthered their links with other scholars in the field worldwide. This and ongoing facilitation by IDP of discussion between researchers working on or interested in IDP resources has led to new and expanded research, covering isotopic analysis of glass found in Central Asia and China; comparisons of Bronze Age burial sites in Central Asia and Scandanavia; water management on the Silk Road; the links between Buddhist material culture and trade; and family life of monks on the Silk Road. Some of these have already resulted in lectures and papers. \n\nIn addition, during the course of the grant a new partnership was started with the China National Silk Museum that will shortly result in additional online resources, joint research on Central Asia textiles and, it is hoped, collaboration with the National Museum of India (discussions in progress).\n\nThroughout the project we worked closely with students to give them the skills on resource creation for the web, including creation and editing of Wikipedia pages that relate to and enhance existing IDP online resources. We also considered their potential to act in place of or alongside traditional authority files. The grant enabled discussions with researchers and developers on interfaces and online tools to exploit the IDP resources. As a result, IDP has been asked to join a partnership developing software tools for the research, cultural and education communities. The aim of the partnership is to create data-centric, self-supporting social enterprises, which generate sustainable funding sources for content holders and generate long-term support without relaying solely on grant capital and government funding. \n\nAlso as a direct result of connections made during this grant period and of the enhanced resources created by the grant, IDP has been approached by a research foundation exploring climate change keen to work with IDP to exploit its data to map changes in the environment to inform current knowledge of climate change. \n \nBoth these are being considered and would have a potential impact on all the sectors selected below.
