{"id":"07DF1362-66B8-47EC-BFD0-30FAE15E3F91","title":"Walking interconnections: Performing conversations of sustainability","abstractText":"Disabled people's voices have been largely absent from the sustainability debate, and from groupings of environmental activists, due at least partly to a lack of inclusion and diversity within the environmental movement. These two communities, with their own distinct cultures exist largely in parallel to each other. At the same time, agencies responsible for emergency and environmental planning have tended to view Disabled people as only a vulnerable group, rather than a group with knowledge skills and awareness to contribute to planning. However Disabled people may have lived experiences which bestow expertise which would significantly contribute to discussions about and planning for environmental risk and for a more socially sustainable society.\n\nRecent research (Abbot and Porter, 2012) has led us to propose that there may be a 'wisdom' (Leipoldt, 2006) drawn from lived experience, which Disabled people can contribute to the sustainability debate. Leipoldt identifies the wisdom he believes can be drawn from the disability experience, which can be summarised as: making real choices, moving beyond the rhetoric of rights to value individual choice; acknowledging limits, knowing what to accept and what is open to change; skilfully 'riding the wave', rather than seeking to control it; bearing up through committed relationships, with oneself, others and the environment; and, creativity in living, and personal transformation. \n\nThe 'Walking Interconnections: Performing conversations of sustainability' research project explores this 'wisdom' and its potential contribution to learning for a sustainable society, by developing dialogues between Disabled people and sustainability practitioners. It uses walking, story telling and arts based methods to develop dialogues between these two traditionally separated communities. Through these dialogues it seeks to understand more about different forms of resilience, and to question the valuing of self reliance over positive interdependencies, in support of the transition to a sustainable society.\n\nThe study takes a participatory action research (PAR) approach. It explores the place of mobile and arts based methods to surface embodied practices by testing an approach, using a mix of methods including arts-based and performative methods, which will enable participants to tap into and describe their expertise, and so builds a sense of agency and supports dialogue between the Disabled people and sustainability practitioners involved as co-researchers in the project. \n\nMethodologically the research is innovative in that it is expanding the discourses/theories of walking practices by finding out how Disabled people experience walking, examining the practices of mobility and using walking, arts based methods and narrative approaches to reveal and understand the everyday lived experiences of Disabled people. While it is well established that the body (and autobiography) of the walker makes a difference to the experience of walking, critiques of walking continue to make presumptions about both the walker and the walking practices. Not least, they presume that all walkers are able bodied and walking is a bipedal and visually oriented practice. Collaborating with Disabled people and environmentalists and sustainability practitioners, our project seeks to expand the frame of walking reference, and our knowledge of walking (Keating and Porter, 2012). \n\nWe argue that it is a waste of resources to marginalise the knowledge contribution that comes from the margins of lived experience of disability, which can offer a whole new way to view our relationship with each other, the environment and the move to sustainability. \n\nThe Walking Interconnections: Performing conversations of sustainability research project will include planning agencies as partners, alongside Disabled people and environmentalists and sustainability practitioners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K004093/1","grantId":"AH/K004093/1","fundValue":"31642","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Mary Porter","coPersons":["Deirdre Elizabeth Heddon"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
