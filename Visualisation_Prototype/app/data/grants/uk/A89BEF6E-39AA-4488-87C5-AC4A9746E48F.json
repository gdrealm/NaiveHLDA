Those enzymes that are shown to convert one or more such compounds will be characterized in detail. This analysis will employ techniques that involve absorbency of light (spectrophotometry), separation (chromatography) and mass determination (mass spectrometry). Analysis will also involve determining whether certain enzymes can distinguish between non-superimposable mirror images of chemical compounds (i.e. stereoisomers), as this is of critical importance when producing pure compounds for the pharmaceutical industry, for example. It is highly likely that some of the enzymes will not convert the chosen chemical compounds. These enzymes will then be tested against other chemical compounds that will be informed by studying the relevant scientific literature. The results generated will inform the efficient selection of other enzymes, by the industrial partner producing the enzymes, which are complementary to those that are performing interesting conversions. This will increase the total number of enzymes produced that perform interesting conversions, i.e. generate wide-ranging screening panels that will therefore perform a large range of interesting conversions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M028496/1","grantId":"BB/M028496/1","fundValue":"82240","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gary William Black","coPersons":["MENG  ZHANG","Justin  Perry"],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
