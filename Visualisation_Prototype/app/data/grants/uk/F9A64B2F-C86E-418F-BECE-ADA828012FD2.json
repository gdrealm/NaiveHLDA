{"id":"F9A64B2F-C86E-418F-BECE-ADA828012FD2","title":"The Association between Child Disability and Poverty Dynamics in British Families","abstractText":"Previous research has documented a strong link between poverty and child disability. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this association. The main aim of this project is, by tracking the fortunes of approximately 7,000 British families over a period of six years, to determine the extent to which British families raising a disabled child are at greater or lesser risk (when compared to other British families) of entering into and escaping from spells of poverty. In addition, we propose to identify the types of events (eg changes in employment) that are associated with transitions into and out of poverty among British families raising a disabled child. The project will involve secondary analysis of data collected in the longitudinal Families and Children Study.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F042728/1","grantId":"ES/F042728/1","fundValue":"74132","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Eric  Emerson","coPersons":["Damon Mark  Berridge","Gillian Ann Lancaster"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
