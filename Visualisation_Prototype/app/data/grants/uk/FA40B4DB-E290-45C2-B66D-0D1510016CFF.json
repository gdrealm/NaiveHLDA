Our expansion of IML will give scientists and non-ICT specialists unprecedented access to cutting-edge Machine Learning algorithms by providing a human-computer interface by which they can directly interact with large scale data and computing resources in an intuitive visual environment. In addition, the outcome of this particular project will have a direct transformative impact on the sciences by making it possible for non-programming individuals (scientists), to create systems that semi-automatically detect objects and events in vast quantities of A) audio and B) visual data. By working together across two parallel, highly interconnected streams of ICT research, we will develop the foundations of statistical methodology, algorithms and systems for IML. As an exemplar, this project partners with world leading scientists grappling with the challenge of analysing enormous quantities of heterogeneous data being generated in Biodiversity Science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K015664/2","grantId":"EP/K015664/2","fundValue":"518914","fundStart":"2014-01-06","fundEnd":"2017-03-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Girolami","coPersons":["Gabriel Julian Brostow","Kate Elizabeth Jones"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
