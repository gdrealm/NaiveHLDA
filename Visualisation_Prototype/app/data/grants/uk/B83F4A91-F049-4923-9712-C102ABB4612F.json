{"id":"B83F4A91-F049-4923-9712-C102ABB4612F","title":"Persistent serious offenders in the North West of England, 1880-1940","abstractText":"<p>This research seeks to understand the start, continuance and ending of serious, persistent offending using the life histories of men and women who were criminally active around the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It also seeks to explore the impact of social and economic conditions, as well as specific legislation on these processes. The research will use a variety of court generated data to trace the offending and life histories of a group of serious offenders for the entirety of their lives. By cross-referencing court records, census material, and newspaper trial reports, we will collect details of each offender's employment history, marriage, offspring, residence, offending, punishment, as well as details of their friends/acquaintances. </p> \n<p>We will use our data sets to interrogate structural factors operating at individual level which could influence these processes. The findings will be disseminated to the academic and lay-historian community. We plan to hold a series of one-day seminars at Keele University, The Galleries of Justice in Nottingham, and the National Archives in London to outline the possibilities and processes of data-linking between records for archivists, social scientists, social and economic historians, and the public (genealogists, local and family historians).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0416","grantId":"RES-062-23-0416","fundValue":"141663","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Barry  Godfrey","coPersons":["Stephen  Farrall"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
