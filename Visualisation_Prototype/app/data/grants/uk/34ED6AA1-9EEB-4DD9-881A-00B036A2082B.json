Building on methods used in the UK (in this ESRC funded project) and a platform of research undertaken in India, we have submitted a proposal to DfID/ESRC (under consideration) to develop a Practitioner Tool and Handbook that could be used to identify older people living in rural areas most vulnerable to social and financial\npoverty. The Tool and Handbook will be designed to have specific application in developing countries and we will test their success in creating pathways out of poverty for older people in India and Nepal.\n\nAn international consortium will deliver the research (if funded). The Principal Investigator and one Co-Investigator are located in UK, three Co-Investigators are located in India (Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal) and one is located in Nepal. We have brought together an international\nstakeholder group of organisations (a community of practice) from across the third sector in India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Many of these are representative of organisations that provide services to older people in terms of livelihood interventions, help to access pensions, social care services, and in India, help accessing maintenance tribunals. These service pathways impact on the social and financial wellbeing of the older population and are common to many developing countries\nbeyond those included in the project.\n\nDuring the course of the research, service-provider partner organisations will be provided with training in using the Practitioner Tool, increasing their skills and knowledge within the sector in India and Nepal. However, our impact will not be limited to those organisations that are partners on the project. The commitment from a broad range of international collaborating partners provides the basis for wide-scale dissemination beyond the direct contact outlined above. In\nparticular, our collaboration with HelpAge India, HelpAge International Nepal, NEPAN and HelpAge International Bangladesh will facilitate the dissemination of the information within the participating countries. Drawing on the international networks in which these organisations are embedded, the reach will be beyond the confines of these countries. The Tool and Handbook will be freely available to practitioners and will be available to download from the websites of our partner organisation. We anticipate co-operation from UNFPA (our data provider) and the World Health Organization in international dissemination of the products. Thus, our dissemination\nstrategy aims to capture a broad and large global audience. We will use social media to engage widely with the public (see our pathways to impact plan) and will ensure that all of the languages used in our team are utilised to increase readership. We will also continue discussions with the BBC concerning the potential to translate the research into a documentary - further helping with international dissemination.\n\nOur project is anticipated to build international research capacity in gerontology through mentoring early career researchers, and PhD candidates during the course of the project.

We have identified and compared three types of parent-child relationships (tight-knit; sociable; intimate but distant) and three types of sibling relationships (sociable, proximal-but-indifferent; detached) of older Gujarati, Punjabi and Sylhetis living in the UK with those living in South Asia. We have found differences that may be a result of family change due to migration and settlement in the UK. \n\nThe study has adapted the Wenger (1989, 1994) support network typology, taking into account the type (e.g. kin, non-kin), gender and age of members within each network. We have identified four types of support networks (multigenerational households: older integrated networks; multigenerational households: younger family networks; family and friend integrated networks; and restricted non-kin networks) and have determined that older Gujaratis, Punjabis and Sylhetis in the UK have different levels of family solidarity and provision of care to those in South Asia. Furthermore, we have identified the networks that are most robust (family and friend integrated network) and those that are most vulnerable (restricted non-kin network) in terms of ill health, loneliness and social isolation. The project has begun to determine the effects that immigration has on the provision of support, and how this differs from the norms of support that exist in the country of origin and/or the host country. We have subsequently tested the classification of networks with other ethnic migrant groups in a Leverhulme and NISCHR-funded studies. The typology can be used in cultures with a preponderance of multigenerational households. \n\nWe have applied for funding to adapt the measure to a succinct practitioners' tool to identify older people with the most vulnerable networks (financial and social poverty) in India, Nepal and Bangladesh.
