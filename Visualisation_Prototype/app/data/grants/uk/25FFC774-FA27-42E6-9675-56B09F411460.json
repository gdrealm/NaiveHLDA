These are mainly in sub-Saharan Africa although ASF has recently been introduced to the Caucasus and Russia increasing the risk of further global spread. Most of the virus isolates cause an acutely fatal disease in pigs, although there are some less virulent isolates. ASF has potentially devastating effects on the commercial and subsistence pig production. In countries such as Cameroon or Madagascar, the introduction of ASF resulted in the loss of between 50 and 80% of the pig population. ASF has serious implications for food security. Pigs are often reared in areas where beef production is difficult. They are excellent converters of food waste and agricultural by-products into high quality protein and have a relatively short production cycle. ASF is difficult to control for several reasons. These include the presence of reservoirs of the virus, ASFV, in wild pigs and soft tick vectors, the lack of a vaccine and the stability of the virus in pork and in the environment. Most outbreaks of ASF are not reported and control measures are therefore not implemented. This is because samples have to be submitted to reference laboratories for diagnosis. In many African countries these are either not present or sending samples to them is costly and requires a long time. This project will aid control of ASF by development of penside diagnostic tests which can be used locally on farms. Similar penside tests have been used to great effect in the diagnosis and control of other animal diseases, such as in the campaign which has resulted in the global eradication of the disease known as cattle plague or Rinderpest. These penside diagnostic tests will be made available commercially in the short term. The approach taken will be to characterise the proteins that are exposed on the surface of the ASF virus particles and then to produce antibodies that recognise these proteins. ASFV is a large complex virus and it may be necessary to test antibodies against several proteins to identify those that are best to use in the diagnostic tests. The antibodies will be incorporated into simple devices, similar to pregnancy testing kits, which can be used on farms. These will be used to detect virus in samples from pigs that are suspected to be infected with ASFV thus ensuring rapid and accurate diagnosis. The virus surface proteins will be used for two other purposes. These proteins are expected to be important for the virus to bind and enter host cells to begin production of progeny virus particles. Activating the host's immune system to recognise these proteins may inhibit virus infection and protect pigs from ASF disease. The ability of combinations of these virus surface proteins to stimulate an immune response in pigs and protect them from ASF disease will be tested. Promising candidate proteins will be incorporated into programmes for vaccine development against ASFV. Finally, the reagents generated in the project will be used for basic scientific studies to improve our understanding of how ASFV virus particles bind to and enter host cells and how virus particles are assembled. This information will be of broad scientific interest in understanding the interaction of viruses with the host cell which in the longer term may lead to novel strategies to control virus infections.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H008969/1","grantId":"BB/H008969/1","fundValue":"724816","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Linda Kathleen Dixon","coPersons":["Haru - Hisa  Takamatsu","Chris  Oura","Geraldine  Taylor","Livio Edward Heath"],"organisation":"The Pirbright Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
