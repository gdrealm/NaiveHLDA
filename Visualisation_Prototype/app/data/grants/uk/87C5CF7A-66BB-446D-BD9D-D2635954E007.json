Pain in laboratory animals is a cause for both ethical and scientific concern, and reducing this source of animal suffering is likely to help address public opposition to the use of animals in research, as well as improving the quality of the science produced. So far, efforts to reduce pain in animals have focussed on providing pain-killing drugs and more comfortable bedding material following surgery. However, recent evidence from humans undergoing surgery shows that the emotional state of people prior to surgery can have a significant effect on the severity and duration of the pain they experience following surgery, with happier people showing fewer symptoms and faster recovery than those that are anxious or depressed. This observation suggests a new approach to tackling post-operative pain in animals: perhaps if we can improve the emotional state of animals prior to surgery we can reduce the amount of post-operative pain they experience. Our aim in this project is to test this possibility. The first stage of the project will involve creating groups of rats with different emotional states, either happy, neutral or anxious/depressed. We will create happy rats by making sure that their cage environments are stable and predictable, and by providing them with a range of items such as blocks of wood, chewable bedding materials and houses that make their otherwise barren cages more varied and interesting. Anxious and/or depressed rats will be created by housing rats in barren cages in which various aspects of the environment are unpredictable. A number of previous observations confirm that environmental manipulations such as these are capable of producing differences in emotional state: rats housed in the improved conditions are typically more willing to explore novel environments and objects and more willing to engage in pleasurable activities such drinking sweetened water. Happy animals are also more optimistic when making decisions about unpredictable events. We will use all of these techniques to assess the state of our rats prior to their undergoing a common surgical procedure involving an incision in the abdomen. We aim to treat all the rats with pain killing drugs following surgery to reduce any unnecessary suffering. Although these drugs are known to reduce symptoms of pain in rats, they do not eliminate them completely, allowing us to assess the effects of the rats' emotional states prior to surgery on post-surgical pain. Following surgery we will measure how much pain the happy, neutral and anxious/depressed rats are experiencing by recording behaviour patterns known to be associated with pain, such as flinching and back arching. On the basis of what is known in humans, we predict that the happy rats will also show reduced severity and duration of pain following abdominal surgery. In a final stage of the project we will explore whether antidepressant drugs can also function to reduce the severity and duration of post-operative pain if given prior to surgery. We expect that these drugs might produce an improvement in our anxious/depressed rats, however we do not know whether these drugs will produce an additional improvement in our already happy rats. The results obtained from our research will increase our understanding of how the way in which we keep animals affects their welfare, both before and after they undergo potentially painful procedures such as surgery. On the basis of our findings we hope to produce recommendations for simple ways in which the welfare of laboratory rats can be improved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F01970X/1","grantId":"BB/F01970X/1","fundValue":"305518","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  To inform future study designs to investigate affective state and pain perception in rats.

We know that mood and emotional state change the degree of pain perceived by people, but no information is available as to whether similar effects occur in rats. If the emotional state of an animal does change its perception of pain, then it offers us the opportunity to reduce pain associated with research procedures by altering husbandry to develop positive affective states in the animals used. \n\nA more detailed account of the outputs from this award were submitted as a final report, but this has not been migrated to research fish (the research fish staff have been notified) The chronic mild stress paradigm, coupled with use of cognitive bias to assess emotional state, produced unexpected results, however use of the apparatus in a collaborating laboratory did produce results consistent with previous studies. Our findings will be of value to others attempting to use these approaches to assess affective state in rodents. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
