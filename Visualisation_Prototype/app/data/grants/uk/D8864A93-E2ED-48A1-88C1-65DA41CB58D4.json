{"id":"D8864A93-E2ED-48A1-88C1-65DA41CB58D4","title":"Mother-infant interactions in high-risk autism siblings","abstractText":"<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most devastating developmental disorders of childhood. This study will investigate the early social interactions between babies who are the younger siblings of children with ASD (A-sibs) and their parents. Because ASD is highly genetic, some (but not most) of these babies will go on to develop the disorder.</p>\n\n<p>Social impairments tend to develop early in ASD but are subtle. Therefore, parents often describe interaction with their baby as baffling and difficult. As social interaction in the first year of life is generally very important for social development, any such interactions that are compromised in ASD are likely to be an additional developmental difficulty for the A-sib baby to overcome. However, there is no evidence that interaction difficulties are a cause of ASD. </p>\n\n<p>The free play videos of 72 mother-baby pairs recruited nationally to the British Autism Study of Infant Siblings (BASIS) Network will be studied at two time points using a brief rating assessment and a system developed for this study that enables detailed analyses. Understanding these early interactive processes between A-sibs and their mothers will provide the potential to open up possibilities for early 'preventative' work. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G045577/1","grantId":"ES/G045577/1","fundValue":"79806","fundStart":"2009-11-09","fundEnd":"2011-05-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ming Wai Wan","coPersons":["Jonathan Michael Green"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
