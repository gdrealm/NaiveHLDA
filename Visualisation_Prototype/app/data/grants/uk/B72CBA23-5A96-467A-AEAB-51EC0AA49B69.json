{"id":"B72CBA23-5A96-467A-AEAB-51EC0AA49B69","title":"Expression Profiling and the Clinical Course of Systemic Vasculitis","abstractText":"Systemic vasculitis (AASV), caused when the immune system attacks the body, is a severe disease with a high risk of renal failure and premature death. As it is hard to predict how the disease will progress or respond to toxic immune suppressive therapy, such treatment may be used excessively, risking side effects such as infection and cancer. Clinicians, bioinformaticians, and immunologists have teamed up in Cambridge to study patients with vasculitis using modern technology to detect patterns of gene expression in blood cells. These patterns will be integrated with clinical information, providing new ways to measure disease activity and predict response to treatment. New tests thus generated may enable targeting of therapy to people who most need it, improving treatment effectiveness and reducing toxicity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400929","grantId":"G0400929","fundValue":"295707","fundStart":"2005-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kenneth G Smith","coPersons":["Afzal  Chaudhry","Alvis  Brazma","Paul  Lyons","David  Jayne"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
