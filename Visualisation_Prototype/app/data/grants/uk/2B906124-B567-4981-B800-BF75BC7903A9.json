{"id":"2B906124-B567-4981-B800-BF75BC7903A9","title":"Connections in High Energy Astrophysics: A Visitors Grant for Leeds","abstractText":"The University of Leeds is currently involved in four major projects in the field of High Energy Astrophysics: The Pierre Auger ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray observatory, the HESS and VERITAS gamma-ray telescopes and the KM3NeT neutrino telescope. All of these instruments are aimed at expanding our knowledge of extreme and energetic phenomena in the universe. To get the most from these instruments the group in Leeds needs to interact and collaborate with leading scientists from around the world. Here we request resources to fund visits to Leeds by theoretical and experimental astrophysicists. These visits will help us to fully explore the connections between cosmic-ray, gamma-ray and neutrino astrophysics and substantially improve the science output arising from the interpretation of our experimental data.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F002912/1","grantId":"ST/F002912/1","fundValue":"12406","fundStart":"2008-06-04","fundEnd":"2012-06-03","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Johannes  Knapp","coPersons":["Alan Andrew Watson","James Anthony Hinton","Joachim  Rose","Stella Marie Bradbury"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
