{"id":"A83B5CF0-F0CA-45F9-8EB7-BDE179B17D3D","title":"Healthy Eating and Lifestyle in Pregnancy","abstractText":"Obesity in pregnancy is linked to poorer outcomes for both mother and child. It is also linked to complications during the pregnancy and at birth such as increased risk of caesarean section or diabetes that develops during the pregnancy. Retaining weight gain following pregnancy can lead to longer term obesity. We have developed an intervention for obese pregnant women based around the Slimming World approach combined with input from midwives which targets diet and physical activity. A scientific evaluation is now needed to determine whether or not this is effective. We plan to do this by recruiting 20 antenatal units across the UK. We will train midwives from half the units in how to deliver the intervention. Women attending intervention units will attend groups run by ?Slimming World? and a midwife. These women will be encouraged to eat more healthily and increase their levels of exercise using a walking programme. Women attending control units will receive usual care and a leaflet giving advice on diet and exercise. The main outcome we will look at is the difference in Body Mass Index (BMI), 12 months from giving birth, between the women in intervention and control groups. We will also measure changes in diet and exercise levels, mental health, quality of life, child?s weight, self confidence, social support and self regulation. Pregnancy and birth outcomes will be assessed as well as the cost effectiveness of the intervention. Women will be followed up at the 36th week of pregnancy, then at 6 weeks, 6 months and one year after giving birth. Some of these women will be invited to take part in an interview which will ask them about their experiences of the intervention. This intervention could reduce complications during pregnancy and childbirth as well as influence women?s health behaviours in the longer term which could impact not only on the woman?s health but that of her family as well. If the study is successful we will develop a training package for midwives which could be rolled out across the UK. We will develop a study website which is accessible to everyone which will describe the study results. We will also offer to send all participants a summary of the results and we will look for creative ways to publicise the results via the media. We will use our links with Slimming World to publicise the results, including on their website.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802038","grantId":"G0802038","fundValue":"1041450","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sharon Anne Simpson","coPersons":["Donna Georgina Duncan","Monica Erika Busse","Dawn  Harries","Robert  Newcombe","Eleri  Owen-Jones","David  Cohen","Clare  Francis","Karen  Jewell","Nefyn H Williams","Rebecca Anne Playle"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
