Those 25 years have had a profound impact on the social, political, economic, cultural and spatial structures of Northern Ireland ever since. The consequent reaction by government, security and statutory authorities bore witness to a profound material impact upon inner-city communities resulting in architectural and spatial disconnection and disengagement with the economic and social structures that manage, govern and regulate the built environment. \n\nThis review focuses on a specific aspect of material impact, the built structures installed within the inner-city to divide streets, disconnect spatial continuity, mitigate against vehicular flow and limit pedestrian movement. These vary in implementation and include walls, bollards, landscaping and the locating of housing across the path of existing streets. This material impact is extensive across inner-city Belfast. Whilst the sociological and economic impact of The Troubles has received much research attention the impact of these built interventions has yet to be systematically assessed. This review recognises the inner-city exemplar of Ballymacarrett, East Belfast as a community of disconnected people and disconnected spaces. The considered implementation of these divisive built structures has served to fundamentally fragment and spatially disconnect this community. This review conceives of a community as an intrinsic ecosystem of people and the built environment and addresses the challenging issue of engaging a disenfranchised and disconnected community with a broad range of stakeholders and academic research. The review process is a catalyst for inclusive discussion that involves a team of project partner stakeholders, directly linking the review process with the agencies with the remit and funding to implement urban regeneration and social housing policy review and change.\n\nThe aims of this review are to utilise knowledge gained from academic and practice-based research methods to inform and stimulate discussion amongst key stakeholders with active inclusion from policy makers and the community. Such discussion has the stated aim of developing a policy discussion mechanism that will continue to progress the issues highlighted by the review beyond the review period. These aims meet address the objective of engaging research with non-academic stakeholders; empowering the related community; developing a methodological framework that is transferable to other contexts.\n\nThe creation of buildings and spaces is a complex scenario involving stakeholders across the social, political and economic spectrum. As a consequence built artefacts contain much embedded information pertaining to a wide variety of perspectives that concern, and have potential to engage, the community within which they are installed. The research team of an architect and a fine art photographer presents a cross disciplinary approach to analysing this context. The disciplines have been aligned to provide a historical record that is accessible to a diverse audience of community, policy, politics and academia. Architectural and spatial analysis will identify Case Studies of built structures that will be documented and illustrated through conceptual photographic representation. Built structures will be utilised as mechanisms to extract data of historical and contemporary importance, eliciting new knowledge. Disconnections will be highlighted and former connections illuminated. The key relationships that are revealed will be essential tools towards addressing the very real architectural and spatial issues within inner-city Belfast communities. Such analysis will present a new perspective to the social, political, economic, cultural and spatial factors that shaped physical change in this community in a distinct and extreme period in cultural history.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011878/1","grantId":"AH/J011878/1","fundValue":"27177","fundStart":"2012-02-10","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The stakeholder workshop tested, developed and piloted as part of this research, provided an opportunity for knowledge-exchange and co-production of knowledge, thus aiding capacity in the participating grass-roots community organisations East Belfast Partnership and East Belfast Mission. Moreover, this engagement process helped engage local residents in a structured research process with community partners and professional stakeholders from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, Planning Service of Northern Ireland, Belfast Regeneration Office and Strategic Investment Board of Northern Ireland.\n\nEast Belfast Partnership have proven capacity in community development and urban regeneration initiative delivery and their involvement as a project partner in this research process has allowed them to further develop this capacity. Engagement in a structured research process with experienced academic researchers and local community residents has led to the to co-production of knowledge that will benefit pertinent urban regeneration and social housing policy discussions. The Workshop Report, co-produced by East Belfast Partnership and local grass-roots community organisations translate the research findings into a transferable format that can be used for further engagement with social and urban regeneration initiatives. The process of compiling and producing the report has also offered a key mechanisms for exchange and enhancement of specialist knowledge, skills and expertise between academic partners and these important community partners. \n\nThe development and delivery of this workshop requires a specialist expertise that has been developed through this process. This workshop and community partner will be central to the follow-on funding application AH/M001342/1 where East Belfast Partnership will mentor and co-deliver further stakeholder engagement workshops with Belfast's four other social partnerships: North, South, West and Greater Shankill. The workshop builds on the 'Spaceshaper' workshop format first established by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) and now administered by the Landscape Institute (LI). Spaceshaper was conceived to facilitate the investigation of recreational space by everyday users of public spaces, with a dedicated website that accepts data gathered in the workshop and generates illustrations of the findings. The engagement-workshop format that has developed from this research, and its inner-city focus, will lead to the development of an Urban Spaceshaper variant. The research team will work with the Landscape Institute through the follow-on funded project, to accredit this transferable format for use by communities to investigate urban space and produce an illustrated record of findings suitable for a range of related uses. All partnerships have a proven record of engaging professional stakeholders and community representatives in constructive, inclusive discussions. This collaboration offers the opportunity to develop and enhance skills and expertise in this area.\n\nThe establishment of these aforementioned mechanisms provided a variety of opportunities for in-kind collaboration between an innovative inter-disciplinary team encompassing community and academic partners. This offered the opportunity to exchange expertise in knowledge and methods between disciplines and to facilitate knowledge-exchange between academic and community partners. This collaboration also establishes a networking infrastructure for future talks, lectures and briefings on subject matter beyond the research context.\n\nThis research has also had impact on policy development within the Northern Ireland context. The stakeholder engagement workshop involved key government project partners and the discussions therein, and data generated, have been germane to the follow-on funded project AH/M001342/1 and a collaborative research team that involves key policy maker project partners from government: the Office for First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMdFM); the Department of Justice (DoJ); and Belfast City Council (BCC). OFMdFM and DoJ are responsible for the Together: Building a United Community Strategy, the key policy ambition for the Northern Ireland Executive. This follow-on project has the capacity to influence policy formulation in the areas of housing, physical development, public safety and social regeneration. These cross-cutting themes are united under the united community strategy and involve a range of government departments. Project partner OFMdFM will facilitate dissemination of the research findings to the related departmental agencies as the research progresses. Two Policy Symposia provide a structured forum ensuring emerging research findings are critically considered in relation to policy objectives. An experienced and inter-disciplinary research team cover built environment, social policy, post-conflict transformation and community engagement, offering a highly relevant and cross-cutting forum for the discussion of future policy. This team will develop collaborative Discussion Papers that will be evaluated with government partners through the symposia mechanisms to produce Departmental Working Papers that clarify policy implications in relation to the Together: Building a United Community Strategy. Moreover, in 2015 a range of planning powers in Northern Ireland will be transferred from central to local government. Local government Project Partner Belfast City Council will organize and chair a series of structured Briefing Sessions during the research process to ensure that research findings are disseminated to the full range of related council agencies responsible for the development of local community plans and eventual management and regulation of these areas.

The Together: Building a United Community Strategy is the main policy framework addressing the spatial legacy of the Northern Ireland conflict. However this document focuses on known 'Interface' architecture such as the widely recognised 'peace walls'. This research project has substantiated the presence of another architectural legacy of the Northern Ireland conflict that fits the criteria to be addressed by current policy, but which is not under that policy radar. The credible evidence supported through the research findings has been used to build a collaborative cross-disciplinary research team for a funded follow-on project (AH/M001342/1) comprising academia, community and policy makers, which will now examine this research context especially in relation to government policy objectives.\n\n2: This funded research has also helped develop and test a stakeholder engagement workshop format for the investigation of space by specialist and non-specialist actors (as discussed in the Narrative) that will now be taken forward and applied in a city wide study in a follow-on funded project (AH/M001342/1).\n\n3: The research fieldwork led to the emergence of a related research trajectory concerning a further related policy gap within the east Belfast policy regeneration context. This spin-off research project was written up in the publication: Reflections on Titanic Quarter: the cultural and material legacy of an historic Belfast brand. (DOI:10.1080/13602365.2013.804855TQ). Research findings will be primarily taken forward by way of follow-on funded research project AH/M001342/1.\n\nResearch processes have led to the generation of innovative, high quality fine art photographic outputs and architectural spatial analysis. These outputs will be supplemented and expanded through project AH/M001342/1. The research team have been approached confidentially by a major international gallery to discuss the development of an exhibition of these, and further, research findings. The funder will be kept fully informed as this develops. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
