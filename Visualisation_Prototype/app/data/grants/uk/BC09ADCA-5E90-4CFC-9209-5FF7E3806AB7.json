{"id":"BC09ADCA-5E90-4CFC-9209-5FF7E3806AB7","title":"Service Integration in Schools: Research and Policy Discourses, Practices and Future Prospects","abstractText":"<p>This interdisciplinary seminar series creates a unique UK-wide forum to examine critically the research evidence for school and community based service reformations. </p>\n\n<p>The seminars explore the nature of policy discourse that shapes professional thinking, knowledge and practice. They examine the rhetoric invoked across a range of disciplinary fields relating to concepts such as community, social inclusion and social justice, and analyse the contested nature of policy and practice. </p>\n\n<p>A number of questions and concerns relating to professional education are addressed through this seminar series: for example, the case for developing elements of inter-professional training for all professionals working in schools. </p>\n\n<p>Academics and practitioners from the different disciplinary fields will explore what is involved in professionalism and the values that inform the current range of service provision. The difficulties experienced by service-users in working with the personnel of multiple agencies, and the challenge to professionals of sometimes demanding service-users will be examined.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The seminars will also ask larger questions about how school service integration relates to the rights of children and young people, about retaining and reforming the role and identities of professionals in advanced democracies, and about global thinking concerning the governance of future schools.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4179","grantId":"RES-451-25-4179","fundValue":"12706","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Walter Malcolm Humes","coPersons":["Deirdre  Martin","Roy  McConkey","Joan Christine Forbes"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
