For instance, a child stepping from behind a parked car, or a friend appearing at a window all tend to elicit our awareness. There currently exist two possible explanations as to how the brain directs attention to new objects. The aim of the proposed work will be to assess these two alternatives. The new object hypothesis proposes that cortical regions of the brain keep track of all objects in a visual scene and a new object joining the array is detected by these same regions. Critically, this theory argues that the brainâ€™s cortex is responsible for the detection of new objects. The alternative transient hypothesis suggests that a new object attracts attention because its appearance corresponds with a small change in brightness. Pre-cortical brain mechanisms detect this brightness change and attention is thus drawn to its location. The proposed work will therefore address the important question of how attention is directed to potentially important visual events. This will in turn advance the understanding of general human performance and specifically how the brain works.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1766","grantId":"RES-000-22-1766","fundValue":"75340","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoff  Cole","coPersons":["Robert William  Kentridge","Charles  Heywood"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
