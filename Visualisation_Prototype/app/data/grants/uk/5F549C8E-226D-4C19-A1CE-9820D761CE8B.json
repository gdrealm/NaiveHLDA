{"id":"5F549C8E-226D-4C19-A1CE-9820D761CE8B","title":"New Perspectives on Education and Culture","abstractText":"<p>This seminar series is coordinated by Professor Jocey Quinn, University of Plymouth and Dr Kim Allen, London Metropolitan University.</p>\n\n<p>It explores how Education and Culture are not separate entities, but inter-related across every aspect of life. What we know and learn in formal and informal spaces is shaped by culture, by the ideas, values and practices that surround us. Similarly those ideas, values and practices are shaped by our experiences of education and learning. A growing interest in education amongst cultural scholars, and the current policy emphasis on education as fluid and lifelong, makes now an ideal moment to explore these inter-connections across academia, policy and practice.</p>\n\n<p>The series is multidisciplinary, bringing together outstanding international scholars such as Lorraine Code, Judith Halberstam and Beverley Skeggs. It focuses on six issues:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>cultural narratives and forms of knowing</li>\n\n <li>popular culture</li>\n\n <li>local cultures</li>\n\n <li>family cultures</li>\n\n <li>teaching cultures</li>\n\n <li>knowledge cultures. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Reflecting the interaction of education and culture across different spaces, and seeking the widest impact, each seminar takes place&nbsp; in a thematically linked venue: Whitechapel Gallery, British Film Institute, Toynbee Hall, Womenâ€™s Library, NUT Headquarters, British Library, and will actively involve ractitioners and users of these venues.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0890","grantId":"RES-451-26-0890","fundValue":"11918","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jocey Teresa Quinn","coPersons":["Kimberly  Allen"],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
