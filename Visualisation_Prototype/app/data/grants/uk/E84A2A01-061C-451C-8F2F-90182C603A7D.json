Fracking involves the injection of pressurized fracturing fluid that overcomes the confining pressure and tensile strength of the reservoir rock, breaking open fissures that act as conductive pathways in the otherwise impermeable shale. The water-based fracturing fluid is miscible with the host fluid, and must be injected at a faster rate than it dissipates within the shale play.\n\nThe proposed project addresses an alternative fracturing mechanism: multiphase fracturing, where a gaseous phase penetrates a water saturated porous media. Unlike traditional fracking (a single phase process), the capillary forces acting at the gas/liquid/grain interface is expected to play a significant role in the fracture growth dynamics.\n\nThis project will focus on developing a detailed understanding of the fundamental physical mechanisms that govern multiphase fracture growth. A custom made experimental flow rig will be used to study the fracture growth dynamics and the evolving fracture network pattern upon injection of a pressurized gas into a water-saturated, deformable porous media. Questions we seek to answer include: How does surface tension, wetting properties and grain size influence growth activity at the fracture tips? Can the evolving fracture pattern formation (and by extension the permeability of the fracture zone) be controlled using experimental parameters such as capillary forces, compressibility and injection rate?\n\nA second objective is to undertake a first fundamental study of CO2 fracturing, focusing on the complex interplay between the fracturing process, and the subsequent absorption and diffusive transport of CO2 within the pore space host fluid. Using CO2 as an unconventional fracturing fluid has potential for achieving high permeability fracture zones, increased methane recovery as CO2 binds preferentially to grain surfaces, and a combined process of shale gas recovery and large scale CO2 geo-sequestration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L013177/1","grantId":"EP/L013177/1","fundValue":"98599","fundStart":"2014-02-03","fundEnd":"2016-02-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project is in the start up phase, but has already had an educational impact by hosting several undergraduate research and summer projects, as well as providing images/movies and other materials used in teaching of a module at Masters level.

A new experimental setup is close to completion and new experimental procedures are under development. Preliminary experiments show very promising results, with spectacular fracture patterns that we are increasingly apt at imaging with new techniques we are developing. We are also developing new image analysis techniques that will allow us to probe some of the more complex features of the evolving patterns. The new experimental/imaging/analysis procedures may be adopted by other researchers in the field. Through the course of the project we will uncover new fundamental insight that will impact on a wide multidisciplinary scientific audience, and underpin long term industry research and development related to subsurface flows (e.g. CO2 storage, hydraulic fracturing, soil pollution remediation).
