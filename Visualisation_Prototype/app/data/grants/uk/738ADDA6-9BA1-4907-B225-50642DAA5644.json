{"id":"738ADDA6-9BA1-4907-B225-50642DAA5644","title":"Exploring Everyday Practice and Resistance in Immigration Detention","abstractText":"<p>Detention is a pressing empirical, conceptual, and political issue. Detained populations, detention facilities, and industries have expanded globally. Developments in detention practices have not been given the academic attention they deserve and a multi-disciplinary approach can shed light on some of the most salient issues that detention expansion raises.</p>\n\n<p>By bringing together a range of established academics, early-career academics, postgraduates, practitioners, artists, activists and former detainees this seminar series will investigate the ways in which the UK experience of detention reflects and re-produces the contradictory logics inherent in modern global detention practices. Through five one-day workshop events the seminar series will span the academic disciplines of criminology, geography, politics and sociology in order to examine the phenomenon of detention as it relates to supporting detainees, penology and prisons, everyday experiences of detention and the politics of, and resistance to, detention practices.</p>\n\n<p>The seminars, to be held in London, York, Birmingham, Oxford and Lancaster will also reflect upon the ethical/methodological challenges that the study of detention produces and the tension, running throughout work in this area, between outright resistance to detention practices or a reformist approach based on working with the state on behalf of immigration detainees.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021814/1","grantId":"ES/J021814/1","fundValue":"18172","fundStart":"2013-01-28","fundEnd":"2015-01-27","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nick  Gill","coPersons":["Imogen  Tyler","Alexandra  Hall","Dominique  Moran","Mary  Bosworth"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
