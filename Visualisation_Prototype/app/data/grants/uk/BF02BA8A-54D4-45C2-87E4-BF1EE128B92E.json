{"id":"BF02BA8A-54D4-45C2-87E4-BF1EE128B92E","title":"Persistent topological structures in noisy images","abstractText":"The proposed research is on the interface between topology and algorithms.The methods are topological coming from the recently developed theory of persistent topology.The key idea of persistent topology is identifying features of geometric objects that remain stable for a wide range of varying parameters. The research objectives are applied and involve designing novel learning algorithms to recognise topological graphs in noisy images.A natural application is identifying a text-based advanced CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) widely used on the web to prevent automatic posting to blogs.A desired learning algorithm will be parallel like the human brain analysing local persistent properties of pixels in a noisy image.Hence it is the next step towards reverse-engineering the human brain.Other potential applications include recognising handwritten mail addresses and designing computer glasses reading signs of directions for blind people.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I030328/1","grantId":"EP/I030328/1","fundValue":"99975","fundStart":"2011-08-08","fundEnd":"2013-08-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vitaliy  Kurlin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" A new algorithm was designed to reconstruct persistent topological structures of arbitrary graphs or networks in noisy images given as point clouds on the plane. The algorithm is based on the recent theory of persistent homology in topological data analysis. The evolution of topological features of data at different scales can be summarized in a simple combinatorial object called the persistence diagram. Persistent features have a long life span and can be separated from noisy defects in the persistence diagram. The stability of persistence can theoretically guarantee a correct reconstruction if a given sample sufficiently approximates an unknown graph. The project can be potentially extended to recognizing more complicated topological structures in high-dimensional big data sets in metric spaces.
