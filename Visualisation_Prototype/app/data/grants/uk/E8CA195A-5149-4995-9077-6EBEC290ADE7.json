{"id":"E8CA195A-5149-4995-9077-6EBEC290ADE7","title":"Directional copper trafficking: In vitro and in vivo studies of metal binding and transfer","abstractText":"A protein is a biological polymer with a complex three-dimensional structure. Many proteins bind metal ions which are usually essential for both structure and function even though the metals constitute typically less than 0.5 % of the total mass of the molecule (approximately one third of all proteins contain metals and these molecules are called metalloproteins). Metal ions have to be incorporated into the correct proteins within cells, and systems (networks of proteins) are emerging via which this is achieved. These regulatory networks of proteins also prevent the potentially damaging effects of the uncontrolled reactivity of metal ions and when these systems are impaired various diseases can result. The proposed studies aim to investigate the proteins which are responsible for ensuring that copper is supplied to the correct destination in a relatively simple model organism. Metal affinities of all of the proteins involved will be determined as will their ability to transfer copper. The effects of designed alterations to the protein structure on metal binding and transfer, protein interactions as well as the influence on physiological activity in the model organism will all be assessed. A detailed appreciation of the factors regulating this important biological process will be obtained.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E016529/1","grantId":"BB/E016529/1","fundValue":"467129","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Findings have been used primarily for publications in high impact journals.

We also provided a thorough analysis of the thermodynamics of copper and zinc distribution in this organism.\n\nThe influence of pH on the Cu(I) affinity of copper trafficking proteins was used to provide important mechanistic information about Cu(I) trafficking involving CXXC-containing domains.\n\nThe thermodynamic factors that influence copper transfer between superoxide dismutase and its copper metallochaperone CCS were determined.\n\nThe influence of protein folding on copper affinity was established.\n\nThe possibility of crosstalk between copper and zinc homeostasis in simple prokaryotes and also in humans was identified.\n\nThe importance of CXXC-containing motifs on the ability of domains to differentiate between copper and zinc was uncovered.\n\nWe found that the cyanobacterial protein FutA2 is a typical ferric binding protein. Understanding how metals, and in this case copper, are trafficked safely to the correct destinations in a cell has a range of potentially important applications. Many biotechnologically useful proteins and biopharmaceuticals are metalloproteins and their recombinant production requires correct metallation. Furthermore, in synthetic biology approaches, the production of modified organisms with a gain of function acquired through the addition of a particular metalloprotein, would require this protein to be correctly metallated. Copper-containing compounds are widely used for their ability to prevent the growth of a range of organisms in various applications, including the addition of copper to anti-fouling paints, the use of copper, along with silver to disinfect water, the use of copper in hospital fixtures to reduce transmission of nosocomial infections, and copper-based agrochemicals. Additionally, copper mis-handling is associated with a range of diseases. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
