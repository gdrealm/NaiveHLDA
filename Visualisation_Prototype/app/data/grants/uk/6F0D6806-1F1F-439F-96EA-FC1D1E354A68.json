The bacterium Clostridium difficile is a highly resistant bug that is a major cause of infections in hospitalised patients. It causes debilitating diarrhoea, which in extreme cases can cause death.

Thus 80 per cent of cases occur in the people who are over the age of 65. It follows, that as the proportion of the UK population that is over 65 is increasing, the disease is becoming more common. C. difficile-associated deaths in England and Wales in 2008 were 5391, meaning that it caused almost four times as many deaths as MRSA. Aside from the human suffering it causes, outbreaks of C. difficile cost the National Health Service considerable sums of money. This is mainly because infected patients need to stay in hospital for extended periods of time. Its financial impact on the healthcare system has recently been estimated to cost at least 2 billion dollars in Europe and 3.2 billion dollars per year in the US. Moreover, there is a danger that the situation could escalate out of control should strains resistant to metranidizole and vancomycin emerge. More effective ways of preventing the disease are required. \n\nTo control infections, it is crucial that medical science understands how an organism causes disease. Under Wellcome Trust sponsorship, the complete genome sequence of the organism (i.e. its genetic blueprint) has now been determined at the Sanger Institute, Cambridge. However, whilst we now know the precise sequences of every gene in the C. difficile chromosome, in the majority of cases we do not understand their precise function. The most effective method of working out what individual genes do, is to mutate them (make them non-functional) and assess the consequences. Such an approach was not possible with this bacterium at the inception of this project, because the genetic tools necessary to bring about the specific mutation of target genes were not available to the research scientist. The development of these mutational tools was the overall goal of this proposal. \n\nOur overall goal was achieved, and a novel tool, the ClosTron, was successfully created which can be used to mutate any gene within the C. difficile genome. The mechanism by which the ClosTron mutates genes is complex. In essence, by making very small, specific changes to the DNA sequence of the ClosTron, the element is able to jump from the plasmid delivery vehicle introduced into the Clostridium cell, and insert itself into the target gene, causing its inactivation. The nature of the small changes made make this targeting process very specific, such that the ClosTron only inserts itself into the intended gene. The process has proven to be highly effective and reproducible. Thus, at the beginning of the project just 3 genes in Clostridium difficile had been mutated. By the projects end, between our laboratory and those of collaborators, over 40 genes have been inactivated.\n\nThe availability of the ClosTron will now allow the identification of those genes which are required for infection, which should eventually lead to more effective ways of controlling the disease.

This objective was entirely met through:-\n\n[1] the formulation and exploitation of a novel method for the insertion of group II intron-encoding DNA into the genome at specifically targeted sites within coding regions. The 'ClosTron' (www.clostron.com) has been deployed at Nottingham and in laboratories around the globe to create over 150 clostridial mutants to date (2009). Its significance cannot be overstated. It represents a step-change in clostridial molecular biology. \n\n[2] The project contributed (along with BB/D522797/1) to the development of a standardized modular (18 components) vector system (the pMTL80000 series) for Clostridium, to facilitate the rapid assembly of plasmids tailored to need. We propose that this system is adopted as a standard for vector development by the clostridial scientific community. To aid this task we have established an online facility at http://www.clostron.com/pMTL80000.php where any of the 400 plasmid variants may be assembled in silico and the predicted plasmid sequence downloaded as a '*.gb' file. Our ClosTron mutagenesis method is universally applicable, not only to Clostridium difficile, but potentially to any Clostridium species, and indeed any bacteria in which the components function. It can be used to identify intervention targets in the pathogens (C. difficile, C. perfringens, C. tetanus and C. botulinum), as well as in those benign clostridial species useful in the production of chemicals and fuels, or indeed in those species being pursued as tumour delivery vehicles for cancer therapy. The ClosTron has become the most widely used mutagen in the clostridial scientific community.
