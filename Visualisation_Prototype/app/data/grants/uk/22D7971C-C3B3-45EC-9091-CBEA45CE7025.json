Protein molecules are essential to fold the DNA in an organised manner so that its information can be decoded easily. This protein and DNA complex is called chromatin. The Human Genome project has revealed the entire sequence of the human genome, but there is still much to learn about how it provides instructions for cell function and organism development. One of the most exciting areas of research at the moment is how chromatin proteins can affect gene expression. Gene expression requires the opening of chromatin structure to allow the transcriptional machinery access to the underlying DNA. Most of the genome exists as a condensed structure, however. These structures can spread along DNA and dominantly repress gene expression. This project studies how DNA sequence elements, called insulators, allow genes to protect themselves from chromatin compaction. We are focusing on proteins that specifically bind to insulator DNA to try to determine the mechanism of insulator action. Understanding how these insulator elements work will have broad implications for understanding how genes are normally regulated and how this can fail in disease. The protective properties of insulator elements can also be exploited to shield transgenes for use in gene therapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400180","grantId":"G0400180","fundValue":"461085","fundStart":"2005-02-21","fundEnd":"2010-07-20","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Adam  West","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
