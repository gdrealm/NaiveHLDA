Yet, whereas some social exchanges foster healthy relations with considerable benefits for society, some actively jeopardise the social connections on which harmonious societies are based.</p>\n\n<p>A powerful driver of such social degeneration is prejudice, reflected by the stereotypes harbored by individuals. Specifically, stereotypes bias thought and action via top-down processes, including imposing unsubstantiated inferences about competence, trustworthiness and criminality based on the recognition of out-group identifiers.</p>\n\n<p>However, little is known about how stereotypes and prejudice exert a top-down control to shape the dynamics of information extraction and integration, thereby influencing critical social judgments. We propose a state-of-the-art data-driven and modeling analysis of the dynamics of information acquisition over the time course of social judgments. We will document the role of top-down factors on the extraction dynamics and use of information for social judgments by combining eye movements and reverse correlation methods to understand how top-down social categories (prejudice and stereotypes) modulate the sequences of eye fixations on static faces to extract social information for social judgments. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00607X/1","grantId":"ES/K00607X/1","fundValue":"326026","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Philippe Georges Schyns","coPersons":["Rachael Elizabeth Jack"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
