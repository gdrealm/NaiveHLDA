Leukaemia occurs due to a genetic change (mutation) within the DNA of bone marrow cells. This results in a mutant RNA transcript which produces an improperly functioning protein. The result is failure of the normal control mechanism for cell development and the uncontrolled growth of white blood cells. The current treatment is chemotherapy with highly toxic and non-specific drugs. Chemotherapy can affect all cells in the body leading to side effects ranging from general ill health during treatment but also, often life-threatening long term damage to organs and unfortunatly imparement or even loss of fertility. The proposed novel therapeutic approach comprises a tiny particle which specifically recognises and attaches to leukaemic cells and then delivers a unique genetic component (so-called short interfering RNAs or siRNAs) into the leukaemic cell. This siRNA adds a second degree of specificity as it recognises and binds only to the unique mutant RNA in the leukaemic cells. This prevents production of the mutant protein and so stops the aberant excessive cell division characteristic of the disease. The particle itself is a mix of fats and protein combined with the siRNA, so the therapy is non toxic to normal cells but lethal to leukaemic cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802495","grantId":"G0802495","fundValue":"683809","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Olaf  Heidenreich","coPersons":["Simon  Bailey","Graham Hunter Jackson","Gareth  Veal","Roland  Kontermann"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
