{"id":"6E964CAB-22EB-4049-A9AE-005B62E1C55D","title":"The developmental logic of trigeminal sensory neurons","abstractText":"Sensory neurons relay information about our external environment to our central nervous system. The sensory neurons that project to our face and jaws, form part of trigeminal nerve, whose name derived from the fact that it has 3 branches; one branch projects to the forehead region, one to the upper jaw and one to the lower jaw. Many of these neurons are concerned with relaying information about heat, pain, and touch from the head to brain. Another group of trigeminal sensory neurons is additionally concerned with spatial information about the position of our jaw, which is important for mastication and speech. This same situation is seen in all jawed vertebrates.\n\nWe know a lot about how sensory neurons develop in the trunk. They are found in the dorsal root ganglia, which form alongside the spinal cord. They arise from a single embryonic population called neural crest cells during early development and progress through a well-studied path to differentiate as sensory neurons. The situation with the trigeminal nerve is very different however - it is much more complex. The sensory neurons that are concerned with heat, pain and touch are found in the trigeminal ganglion, which does lie alongside the brain, but rather than being derived from a single embryonic population that are derived from 3 distinct populations. Many are derived from thickenings of the embryonic skin, the ophthalmic placode and the maxillomandibular placodes, as well as some from neural crest cells. In stark contrast to what is seen in the trunk, the neurons that transfer information about the spatial position of the jaw are not found in ganglia beside the central nervous system but are rather found within the brain itself. In the trunk, the neurons that monitor the position of the limbs also reside in the dorsal root ganglia.\n\nThe aim of this research is to understand the significance of the developmental complexity that we find in the trigeminal system and to test the hypothesis that the embryonic origin of trigeminal sensory neurons matters. Preliminary data suggests that trigeminal sensory neurons send axons to different regions of the head. If this were true for all trigeminal neurons of different origins then this would allow us to demonstrate previously unknown complexity within the trigeminal system. This would have an impact for our understanding of the adult and aging situation. We will determine why the neurons that monitor the positioning of the jaw are sitting within the brain. We will also conduct an in depth comparison between the development of trigeminal and trunk sensory neurons to help us gain insights into the commonalities and differences that exits in the programme that lead to the formation of sensory neurons. Finally, we will also test if the motor neurons that control the movement of the jaw are also important in leading the axons of the sensory neurons that monitor its position to their correct location and how this is achieved","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J015261/1","grantId":"BB/J015261/1","fundValue":"372933","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are just two years into this grant and have as yet to maximise our narrative impact Education Societal","person":"Anthony  Graham","coPersons":["Michiel Albertus Basson","David  Chambers"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":" We have shown that the cells of the neurons that help co-rodinate jaw movement have a more complex developmental oirigin that previously thought.
