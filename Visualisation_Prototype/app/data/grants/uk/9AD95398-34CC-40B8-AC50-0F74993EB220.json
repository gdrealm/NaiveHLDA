{"id":"9AD95398-34CC-40B8-AC50-0F74993EB220","title":"The influence of the human form on visual judgements of movement","abstractText":"<p>Social interactions dominate much of human behaviour, and rely on our ability to perceive the moods, intentions and actions of other people. Vision is especially important in terms of the richness of the information it can provide. â€˜Actions speak louder than words'; perception of movement plays a fundamental role in many social interactions. This project aims to investigate how human visual motion perception is optimised for perceiving the actions of other people.</p>\n\n<p>The brain is divided into a set of anatomically distinct processing areas. Sensory motion processing detects the local speed and direction of primitive features such as edges, while social motion processing in other brain areas deals with more complex features such as posture, and gait. How are social attributes derived from sensory data? Do social attributes influence sensory processing? Two research techniques will be used to address these questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>perceptual experiments on adaptation to the speed of natural movements</li>\n\n <li>computational research on the link between image content and perceived movement.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project will generate new knowledge about how people use visual information about other moving humans to adjust to changes in the dynamic visual environment, such as in crowded environments and sports events.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006088/1","grantId":"ES/K006088/1","fundValue":"286945","fundStart":"2013-08-31","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The research is at too early a stage for impact to have emerged.
