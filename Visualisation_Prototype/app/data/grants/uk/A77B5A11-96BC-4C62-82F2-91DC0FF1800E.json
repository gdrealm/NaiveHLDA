Understandably, major disasters tend to provoke calls for better information, on the assumption that if people were more aware of risk (such as flood risk) they would be better able to respond to it. This could in principle influence their selection of places to live and work, or the adaptation of their living spaces to make them more flood resilient. Behind this assumption, however, lie a series of very significant theoretical contentions which challenge the idea that public information alters public behaviour in any clearly defined or predictable way. </p> \n<p>This project explores specifically the way in which the public and professionals have responded to the flood zone maps presented by the Environment Agency. It aims to use quantitative (questionnaire) and qualitative (interview and focus group) approaches to understand the process of interaction with this information source, the ways in which this experience relates to attitudes about flooding, and the extent to which flood-related behaviour is affected. The objective is to support risk managers in designing information presentation to maximise the benefits to society.<br /></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1710","grantId":"RES-000-22-1710","fundValue":"40960","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Jeremy Clark","coPersons":["Sally  Priest"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
