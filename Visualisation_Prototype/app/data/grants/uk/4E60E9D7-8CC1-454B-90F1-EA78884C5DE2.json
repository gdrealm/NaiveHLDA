As a result of supporting this technical endeavour we have developed a new versatile device for measuring distances with exquisite precision. We refer to the new instrument as EUCLID (Easy to Use Compact Interferometric Device). We wish to support patent applications for the new device with further design and development work and to further investigate its potential as both a tool for gravitational wave astronomy and as assess its potental as commercial product.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F003609/1","grantId":"ST/F003609/1","fundValue":"77769","fundStart":"2008-06-02","fundEnd":"2009-02-01","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Clive Christopher Speake","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
