Although all four elicited male admiration, they have only begun to re-emerge from the obscurity to which a tradition of historiography has consigned them for more than two centuries. Ironically, what first links these women writers is partly the fact that they stepped out of the only authorial part deemed to be acceptable for a woman to play, by not choosing devotional writing, but instead a genre, the romance, traditionally decried as unworthy and morally corrupting by virtue of its 'femininity'. Despite the stylistic discrepancy between these authors' works and their intrinsic specificities, what ideologically links them is their representations of women. These in turn inform us about these women writers' internalisation of dominant cultural values in the broader context of early modern Europe - that is in the context of what we could call 'parallel mentalities', encapsulated in the centuries-long debates of the 'Querelle des femmes', with regard to woman's appropriate place in society and access to culture. The book first focuses on the representation of women's bodies in Bigolina's, Fonte's, Wroth's, Scud&eacute;ry's and Zayas's texts, and the ways in which these women writers respond to the prevailingly partriarchal ideology that informs the various manifestations of ambivalence that govern the mapping of womanhood in the early modern period. In particular, the book uncovers the ways in which these women writers manipulate with some defiant twist the canonic images of women that were available to them through the visual arts and the various literary genres from Petrarchan poetry, epic and pastoral romances to non-literary genres (such as courtesy books; pamphlets against, and apologies for, the 'fair sex'). The argumentation then shifts to the alysis of women's voices and performances in the private and public spheres of these texts' fictional patriarchal societies. While these (dis)empowering performances may recall those of female personae in early modern theatre, one particularly innovative aspect in these women's works is their responses to misogynistic writings, whereby they often emerge as the unbiased historiographers of women and assertive defenders of women's access to culture, and transform their texts into a 'locus memoriae', 'lieu de m&eacute;moire' for women. In particular, I consider the extent to which the various manifestations of salon culture in which these women writers were immersed enabled them to articulate a counter-discourse in their own fiction. Owing debt to a far-reaching tradition that uses landscape as the locus of the feminine, many of the feminocentric spaces found in these women's texts serve as a backdrop for social gatherings in which women are portrayed as cultural agents. As I argue in this book, this counter-discourse and transformation of the text into a 'locus memoriae' for women culminate in these women writers' textual and spatial representations of female literary creativity. Their innovative multiple positive representations of the woman of letters, undoubtedly played an important role in the fashioning of their female readerships and in the formation of a feminist consciousness. \\nLack of records often make the task of identifying the cultural impact of early modern works which have been written out of the canon. Nevertheless, this has also been hardly explored, mainly because the bulk of the primary sources and their relative inacessibility have made it an almost impossible task to achieve. In taking up this challenge, my book sheds light on early modern women writers' agency in the creation of a cultural memory for women by women, while addressing the limits of their feminist agendas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H006591/1","grantId":"AH/H006591/1","fundValue":"26707","fundStart":"2010-11-15","fundEnd":"2011-04-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  My findings have allowed me to further my research into the field of women's literary history, and eighteenth-century literary adaptations, and translations: in particular my focus (in the last chapter of my book) on the reception of the works of Scud?ry, Fonte, Marinella and Zayas has led me to examine anthologies and dictionaries dedicated to women, by Joseph La Porte, Ann Thicknesse, and Mary Hays. Some of those findings were recently presented at the Gender, History and Society Conference at the University of Winchester (September 4-5th, 2014) at the Gender Studies Centre.

My published article offers an innovative reading of Scudery's 'pr?ciosit?'. Through its inter/cross-disciplinary analysis, it calls for more dialogical studies of seventeenth-century novel writing that explore literary and socio-cultural paradigms such as 'pr?ciosit?' and 'galanterie' in the wider context of European Renaissance literature (here Italian), and that look at the interrelationship between visual/ performative arts and the production of fiction. \nMy forthcoming book will offer new directions for 1) the the assessement of the history of women's writing from a diachronic perspective by challending the notion of periodization, but also for 2) for an appreciative assessment of early modern women's writing from an aesthetic perspective (in the way studies of male writing would). In other words , while recognising the importance of women's writing as shaping a feminist consciousness, it also suggests new ways of analysing women's writing (here using 'the poetics of space' as a fruitful line of enquiry), and in particular new ways of examining how women writers could engage creatively with literary and cultural models, and thus produce original thinking and original works within national and transnational contexts.
