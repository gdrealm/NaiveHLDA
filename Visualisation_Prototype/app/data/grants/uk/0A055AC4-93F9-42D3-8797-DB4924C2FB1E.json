A non-union is a broken bone that fails to heal. These result from both civilian and military injuries including the consequences of cancer and lead to pain, suffering and loss of dignity. Our aim is to create a co-ordinated self-sustaining network linking the Trauma HTC and other major UK clinical research centres, both civilian and military, in order to pull solutions from the science and technology research community and assist their translation to the clinic. The network will link with centres of expertise and research excellence in healthcare technologies supported by EPSRC and others, and to industry and other key stakeholders including patients. This network will ensure, by a programme of activities with both proven and novel components, that these disparate communities are empowered to explore together those areas where new scientific and technological opportunities have the promise to resolve important clinical problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M000230/1","grantId":"EP/M000230/1","fundValue":"149684","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Key areas of interest have already emerged and will be communicated at the launch meeting.

This has led to one on one meetings with key clinicians and an information gathering stage in preparation for the formal network launch meeting on 1st December 2015. Key activities planned are three research sandpits - the first on early interventions and early diagnosis, the second on rehabilitation and the third, &quot;stretch&quot; sandpit, addressing advanced therapies and the science of wound healing. Sandpits will result in both pilot feasibility projects and closer specification of the needs. It is anticipated that the network will deliver improved problem statements and that these in turn will lead to pilot projects within the existing funding and larger projects where further funding is sought from EPSRC and other research councils. The network is already a collaboration of clinical, industrial and science based partners and is well positioned to take things forward.
