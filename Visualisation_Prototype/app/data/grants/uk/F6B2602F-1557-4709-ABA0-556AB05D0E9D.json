In a conventional computer information is stored in a bit which can either be a 0 or a 1, and processing information involves changing 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. In a quantum computer information would be stored as a Qubit which is a super-position of 0 and 1. An analogue would be that a classical bit is like a light switch, which is either on or off, while a Qubit is a dimmer switch set simultaneously to all possible positions. This proposal involves using magnetic metal complexes as Qubits , and looking at methods for linking them together to perform quantum operations. The key problem is to introduce links which can be modified easily and thus make a two Qubit quantum gate . Two means of modifying links are by shining light on them - if they are photo-active - or adding or removing electrons from them - if they are redox-active. The proposal builds on previous work in Manchester in making the magnetic metal complexes and photo/redox-active compounds. Combining these two areas of expertise makes it possible for us to make significant progress towards creating a prototype molecular quantum gate. As no efficient means for performing quantum information processing presently exists - despite large scientific effort in this area from companies such as IBM - if successful this project would change the world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D05138X/1","grantId":"EP/D05138X/1","fundValue":"287968","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Eric Winpenny","coPersons":["Stephen  Faulkner","Benjamin John Coe"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
