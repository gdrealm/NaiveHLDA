It is an intervention that focuses on retraining the brain through practice using a combination of motor learning tasks and behavioural psychology elements. \n\nAbout 75% of stroke survivors sustain motor problems that limit their abilities to perform every day activities and often reduces their independence. This is particularly so when the brain damage affects the arm and the hand. \n\n\nRecent studies of CIMT shows that patients can make significant gains in their motor functions. This is even the case when the stroke or head injury had happened many years ago. \n\nTo make CIMT available as a standard rehabilitation method, more research is needed to show that how the treatment helps and how it can be applied in those patients who have more severe loss of arm function. In a five year research program we will determine how much patients gain from an adapted version of CIMT and to describe how the brain changes when a patient gets better with the treatment. The study program will use a combination behavioural test and brain imaging methods, including high-density EEG recordings, functional and structural MRI.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200128","grantId":"G0200128","fundValue":"762210","fundStart":"2004-01-05","fundEnd":"2009-07-04","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Annette Marie Sterr","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
