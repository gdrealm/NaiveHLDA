{"id":"F605D435-8853-4D70-A748-FA92CD6C748B","title":"Combining migration data in England and Wales","abstractText":"At present, the internal migration data in England and Wales are limited due to differences in sources, availability, quality and measurement. In this project, we will provide some solutions to deal with the above problems by developing a statistical model that combines different data types and information to predict detailed flows. We will also demonstrate the usefulness of these estimates by analysing them over time from 1991 to 2005.\n<br />\n<br />The advantages to having a consistent and reliable set of migration flows are numerous. Detailed estimates of migration flows are needed so that local governments have the means to improve their planning policies directed at supplying particular social services or at influencing levels of migration. This is important because migration is currently (and increasingly) the major factor contributing to population change at sub-national levels in England and Wales. Furthermore, our understanding of how or why populations change requires detailed information about migrants. Without these, the ability to predict, control or understand that change is limited.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F025726/1","grantId":"ES/F025726/1","fundValue":"78924","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Raymer","coPersons":["Peter William Smith"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
