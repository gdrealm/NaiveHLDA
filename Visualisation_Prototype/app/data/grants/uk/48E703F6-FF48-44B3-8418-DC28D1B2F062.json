{"id":"48E703F6-FF48-44B3-8418-DC28D1B2F062","title":"Live Performance, the Interactive Computer and the Violectra","abstractText":"This research project represents the continuation of an ongoing, productive and successful collaboration between violinist, Dr Mieko Kanno (Durham University), and composer, Dr Sam Hayden (formerly University of Sussex, now Durham University). The project explores the specific potential of the 'Violectra' electric violin as an instrument of avant-garde contemporary music in combination with advanced real-time DSP techniques; the integration of instrument-specific timbres and virtuosic extended techniques with interactive, real-time synthesis software, using established and customized computer music tools. Composer/computer musician Dr Nick Collins (University of Sussex) provided technical assistance with system construction and evaluation, in particular through the programming of machine listening and learning techniques in order to facilitate a more intelligent musical responsiveness in the Max/MSP patches. This software development enables the online learning of gestures (automatic clustering of textures and gestures) in an adaptable stand-alone module, existing as a Max/MSP external object (ll~). \n\nThe project created a brand new work 'Adaptations' (2011) for electric violin and interactive computer, as well as extensively developing and revising Hayden's 'schismatics' (2007, rev. 2010) for electric violin and live electronics (the existing fruit of this collaboration). This piece is now an interactive (as opposed to reactive) work, with greater computer agency and autonomy, utilizing machine learning and listening techniques. Both works involve a more (artificially) intelligent computer as 'virtual' performer whose output is more 'musical' (as defined by the project collaborators), with more differentiated sonic textures and processes. These developments were achieved through a combination of regular documented studio sessions with development periods and email/telephone communication in between these practical sessions.\n\nOutputs include: (a) an extensive reworking of 'schismatics' (2007, rev. 2010), including a complete redesign and radical overhaul of the internal technical workings of the Max/MSP patch (using IRCAM and 3rd party real-time analysis / synthesis objects) as well as significant improvements to the user interface, performer feedback mechanisms (including visual) and hardware set-up (such as the addition of performer control using a mouse pedal); (b) the production of a flexible software performance tool that could be used in other musical situations such as improvisations; (c) the creation of an entirely new work, 'Adaptations' (2011), using this flexible computer-based performance tool in combination with composed musical notation; (d) a co-authored journal article (Proc. of ICMC 2011) discussing findings arising from the specifics of the project, including advice of a general nature concerning the creative process, collaboration and techniques used; (e) the online publication to open-source communities of machine learning module; (f) the online publication of performance patches in compiled versions subject to copyright restrictions (public versions of patches available online will use open-source externals).\n\nThrough this practice-led research, a greater understanding of the potential of live performance involving the Violectra e-violin with real-time DSP has been gained. The project has addressed a range of detailed research questions, which can be divided into aesthetic/philosophical and practical/technical issues -- although the distinction is necessarily blurred since these categories feed off each other symbiotically. In essence, the nature of 'interactivity' in a specific musical context between solo performer (e-violin) and computer has been explored and the successful integration of live performance and real-time DSP has be defined in practical, technical and aesthetic terms, thus developing the collaboration between Sam Hayden and Mieko Kanno to to its full potential.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H018425/2","grantId":"AH/H018425/2","fundValue":"4380","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  MaxMSP patches and ll~ object have been downloaded from relevant websites.

In essence, the nature of 'interactivity' in a specific musical context between solo performer (e-violin) and computer has been defined and explored, the MaxMSP patches evaluated qualitatively in terms of criteria such as 'ease of use', 'responsiveness', 'musicality', 'reliability', 'predictability of response', 'timbral variation' and so on. The successful integration of live performance and real-time DSP has been explored in practical, technical and aesthetic terms, thus developing the collaboration between Dr Sam Hayden and Dr Mieko Kanno to to its full potential. The software (MaxMSP patches) developed for 'Adaptations' can be freely downloaded from above URL and used for the development of new notated compositions or improvisation contexts by other composers and musicians. Requires download of Nick Collins' listening and learning system: MaxMSP external object (ll~), also developed during the project.
