{"id":"AAB58294-7160-4C02-9A4B-17789B89D993","title":"A confocal system for biomaterials and tissue engineering","abstractText":"Many diseases and loss of tissue due to trauma can be treated using novel surgical procedures involving the implantation of natural or synthetic materials. These materials can be highly porous tissue engineering scaffolds which promote the in-growth and regeneration of tissue once implanted and in some cases can be pre-loaded with the patients own cells prior to implantation. We are currently involved in a large collaboration within the University of Manchester to develop new and improved biomaterials and tissue engineering scaffolds for the regeneration of a variety of tissues and organs such as bone, cartilage, intervertebral disc, skin, ligament, tendon and liver. We are also engaged in nerve repair and the controlled differentiation of stem cells. In order to further the understanding of cellular interactions with our novel scaffolds we are hoping to acquire a confocal laser scanning microscope system which is optimised for use with biomaterials and tissue engineering scaffolds. A confocal system allows cells and the biomolecules they synthesis, labelled with fluorescent markers, to be imaged within 3D. The microscope takes optical sections through cells and tissues (and scaffolds) to enable imaging of specific markers such as proteins, sugars and cell surface receptors where other microscopy techniques cannot. This will allow us to better understand the requirements for regeneration of diseased or damaged tissues and organs via tissue engineering.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F011547/1","grantId":"BB/F011547/1","fundValue":"210230","fundStart":"2008-10-28","fundEnd":"2009-10-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie  Gough","coPersons":["P  Skeldon","Christopher Michael Ward","Paul  Christian","Ian Anthony Kinloch","Alberto  Saiani","Aline Fiona Miller","Rein  Ulijn","Sandra  Downes","Catherine Louise Merry","SJ  Eichhorn"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
