Thyrotoxicosis is an established cause of osteoporotic fracture but the underlying mechanism of bone loss has not been determined. Our recent studies, however, indicate that thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRalpha) has a critical role in skeletal development, acquisition and maintenance of adult bone and thyrotoxic bone loss. Moreover, our studies suggest that TRalpha has an important role in regulating the activity of bone resorbing osteoclasts. Although the mechanism is unknown these studies identify TRalpha as a potential new drug target for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Importantly, the therapeutic potential of TR-isofom specific compounds has already been demonstrated in patients with for high cholesterol. In the proposed studies Dr Bassett and Professor Williams at the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London, will characterise the actions of T3 in osteoclasts and their subsequent effects on bone structure and strength. These studies are critical and timely as it is essential that the molecular mechanism of thyrotoxic bone loss is defined, before new drugs, acting on TRalpha are developed for the treatment of osteoporosis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800261","grantId":"G0800261","fundValue":"488168","fundStart":"2009-03-26","fundEnd":"2013-03-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John Howard Bassett","coPersons":["Graham Richard  Williams"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
