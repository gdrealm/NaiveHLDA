{"id":"3512AD4B-D899-43F4-AB4C-C2F291211EA4","title":"System-Smart Intrusion Detection","abstractText":"Criminal use of the national network infrastructure is commonplace: blackmail, and phishing (social engineering) alone are significant in economic terms. These activities exploit network hosts that have been previously subverted, by attacks that are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are unable to detect new or subtle attacks, and deploying IDS sensors in higher volumes results in high report volumes, but little more effectiveness. This project will show that by taking a system design approach to the choice and configuration of sensors, together with network deployment strategies that allow flexible sensor placement, it is possible to substantially improve the detection of subtle attacks. This work does not focus on improvements to individual intrusion detection components; but rather exploits the synergy that can be obtained by combining the strengths of different types of sensor, in a holistic approach to intrusion management design.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E028128/1","grantId":"EP/E028128/1","fundValue":"228258","fundStart":"2007-09-28","fundEnd":"2010-07-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have demonstrated out work to CESG.

The primary outcomes of the work are: \n\na) The production of a system deployment model (winner of a best paper prize) that allows various deployments to be compared and optimised.\n\nb) The development of a multi-criteria optimisation framework allowing various deployment evaluation criteria to be traded of against each other. The deployments are evaluated via off-line simulation using randomly generated loads and attacks. The approach uses evolutionary computation and simulated annealing.\n\nc) The production of a Bayesian model for identifying insider agents in network as new information is received.\n\nd) The production of papers regarding sensors and their characterisation and also difficult areas for intrusion detection Our best paper prize initiates a discussion about the value of deployments. We think much more work can and should be done on this angle to place intrusion detection on a principled basis. \n\nFurthermore the work on probe placement (essentially optimal use of resources) could be extended to deal with finer matters of configuration over and above location. Thus, the general optimisation approach can be applied to dynamic configuration of audit logging. \n\nWe believe also that our Bayesian insider agent model can find application in real networks.
