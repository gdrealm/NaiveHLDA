We propose to study the function of blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord (also known as the central nervous system or CNS) since this a specialized biological system that is amenable to functional, cellular and molecular investigations. Blood vessel malfunction during ageing is manifested by the leakage of molecules from the blood circulation and this may result in damage to nerve cells and impaired cognitive and/or sensory functions. The key cells that control access of molecules into the brain and spinal cord are the 'endothelial cells', which line the blood vessels. Normally CNS endothelial cells have a key property, the presence of 'tight junctions' which present a barrier to the movement of molecules from the blood to the CNS. Endothelial cells also express another class of proteins termed transporters on their surface that selectively drive the transport of key molecules such as nutrients into the CNS and exclude noxious substances present in the blood. During ageing, endothelial cells lose the expression of tight junction and transporter proteins and the barrier becomes leaky but it is not known whether these changes occur progressively with age or the precise mechanisms leading to CNS blood vessel malfunction. This project investigates whether a newly-described mechanism controlling specialised properties of cells, applies to the control of the barrier tight junction and transporter function between the blood and the CNS in the context of ageing. Small regulatory molecules termed microRNAs can regulate and rapidly reduce the level of particular proteins in cells and we propose that this regulatory mechanism is altered in the cells that form the blood vessels of the CNS during normal ageing. The first objective of the project is to characterize the changes in CNS blood vessel function that occur during normal ageing in two model organisms with different life spans, humans and mice. We have chosen leakiness of blood-borne molecules as a physiological process maintained by blood vessels that is critical for the normal functioning of the CNS. It is not known at what point in the ageing process CNS blood vessels start to malfunction and a systematic study on this has never been reported. The second objective is to measure the extent and significance of changes in microRNA levels at the stage in which CNS blood vessel malfunction starts to occur in the two model organisms. Here, we will also analyze changes in the pattern of gene expression in CNS blood vessels and identify whether changes in specific genes linked to tight junction or transporter function are likely to be driven by alterations in microRNA levels. To do this, we will use state-of-the-art techniques to simultaneously determine millions of microRNA and target gene molecules in CNS blood vessels in young and old individuals. Finally, we will select specific microRNAs that are altered during ageing and manipulate their levels in CNS endothelial cells in laboratory settings. In doing so, we will determine whether this manipulation results in changes in expression of their gene targets and in blood vessel function. These experiments will confirm whether microRNAs are important regulators of specialized functions of cells during the ageing process. The main expected outcome of this project is knowledge of whether the ageing process of a biological system with specialized functions is driven by alterations in microRNAs. If this proves to be the case, alterations in microRNA levels may represent a novel mechanism of ageing in multiple cell types with different specialized functions. This knowledge then could benefit not only academics working within the field of ageing but also those investigating how specialized functions of cells are altered in disease states, in particular those affecting the brain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K006711/1","grantId":"BB/K006711/1","fundValue":"353922","fundStart":"2013-07-31","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are still at an early stage of the project, so we are still in the process of generating findings.

We have begun to characterise age related changes in the endothelial cells that line blood vessels in human autopsy tissue samples and mice. We have now developed the method to isolate the RNA from these cells by laser capture microdissection. We have purified messenger RNA, which encode the proteins of the cells, and microRNA's which regulate the messenger RNAs. We now plan to go forward to analyse the pattern of genes expressed. This project is at an early stage but we are regularly sharing data with our collaborator, I Romero, at the Open University so that the two sides of this project can proceed optimally together.
