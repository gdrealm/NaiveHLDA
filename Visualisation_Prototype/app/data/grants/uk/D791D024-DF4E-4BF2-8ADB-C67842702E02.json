{"id":"D791D024-DF4E-4BF2-8ADB-C67842702E02","title":"HERA CinBA Follow On Study","abstractText":"One year after the successful completion of the major international HERA-funded project Creativity and Craft Production in Middle and Late Bronze Age Europe (CinBA) (www.cinba.net), this AHRC grant will revisit our partners and collaborators to carry out an assessment of impact in terms of the project's effectiveness, scale (national and international), persistence, and leverage. \n\nCinBA explored the creativity that underpinned Bronze Age objects over time and space; the Bronze Age saw developments taken for granted today in textiles, metal and ceramics, including colour, pattern, texture and decoration. Working closely with non-academic partners, The Crafts Council and Sagnlandet Lejre, it has further investigated the potential impact these objects may have as a source of inspiration and means of stimulating contemporary creativity for different groups, including contemporary designers / makers at a range of career stages, and the public. Throughout CinBA, knowledge exchange has been embedded within the research journey. It is, however, clear that the project has continued to have reverberations. In addition to predicted outcomes, a range of additional unforeseen outcomes and responses also emerged organically during and after CinBA. This project will explore what the longer-term impact of inter-disciplinary opportunities provided by CinBA have been for the crafts and heritage sectors and how they add value to these. A reflection on CinBA effectiveness and best practice will help to set useful directions for future knowledge exchange activities with these sectors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M504245/1","grantId":"AH/M504245/1","fundValue":"14628","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanna Rachel Sofaer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
