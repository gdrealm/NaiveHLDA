{"id":"DFB60253-5752-405E-A692-D2A5E1AAFE65","title":"Following Young Fathers: The lived experience of young fatherhood.","abstractText":"<p>Following Young Fathers addresses an important and under researched topic - the lived experience of young men entering into fatherhood. We currently know relatively little about how and why young men become fathers at an early age, how young fatherhood is constituted and practiced and what impact policy interventions or other kinds of support may have on these processes. The broad aim of this research is to address these gaps in knowledge in ways that are theoretically engaged, empirically innovative and policy relevant. A greater understanding of young fatherhood is essential if policy and practice responses are to be effective.</p>\n\n<p>Our core method is a Qualitative Longitudinal tracking study of a varied sample of 25 young fathers, conducted through three waves of in-depth interviews and two rounds of focus groups. The tracking study will be accompanied by three complementary strands of work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Secondary analysis of existing qualitative evidence will be conducted through data sharing workshops.</li>\n\n <li>A review of policy and practice developments of our topic from the past two decades will be undertaken to produce an inventory of specialist support for young fathers.</li>\n\n <li>Finally we will conduct a local case study evaluation of service provision.</li>\n\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J022993/1","grantId":"ES/J022993/1","fundValue":"452185","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Carmen  Lau- Clayton","coPersons":["Bren  Neale"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
