In addition to manipulating readers' comprehension goals, we will also measure the speed with which readers integrate incoming text with the<br />situation model corresponding to the text they have just read.&nbsp;Work conducted by other researchers in the area suggests that readers do not update these situation models as soon as they are able to.&nbsp;We propose that this is because no previous work in the area of text processing has looked at how the types of comprehension questions that readers have to answer affect the way in which they read.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1601","grantId":"RES-000-22-1601","fundValue":"39148","fundStart":"2006-01-24","fundEnd":"2008-01-23","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew James Stewart","coPersons":["Evan  Kidd"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
