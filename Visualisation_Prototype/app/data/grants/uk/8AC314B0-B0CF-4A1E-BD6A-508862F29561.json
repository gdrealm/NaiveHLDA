It seriously compromises animal welfare because it causes severe lameness in affected cattle and even though apparently treatable, soon reappears. Estimates of the cost to the dairy industry in England and Wales range from &pound;48 to &pound;90 million per year (DEFRA). It was quickly established that the main candidate for the spread of digital dermatitis is a bacterium from the genus Treponema and we have been the major group (internationally) studying this infectious agent and its link to DD. The evidence for treponeme(s) being the cause of DD is now quite compelling and we have also shown that the disease has been spread to sheep by infection with this organism. Previous research from our group has enabled us to obtain more than 50 cultures of the treponemes from DD lesions in cattle and sheep. The current proposal aims to investigate how these organisms cause the disease in cattle, to identify which ones are the most important and to identify those components of the organisms which may be useful for future targeted treatments such as antibiotic selection to treat infected animals, vaccine development or means of preventing the organisms from causing infection and subsequent disease by therapeutic intervention or cattle breeding programmes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E018920/1","grantId":"BB/E018920/1","fundValue":"470762","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart David  Carter","coPersons":["Richard John Birtles"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
