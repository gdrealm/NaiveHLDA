The question of what structure schools should have (comprehensive, private, selective, Academy etc) is only addressed within this debate about educational outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>This proposed research asks: is the value of schooling identical with the value of education? If not, what is the basis of the value of schools separate from the education they provide, and are children owed a particular structure of school as a matter of social justice? This research considers schools as institutions that serve the needs of children as fellow members of a political community. Research into this political conception of childhood and of schools will include examination of the notion of child-citizenship, votes for children, and schools as institutional that protect child-citizens from inequalities with adults. The aim of this research is to develop principles of social justice that apply to the structure of schools, distinct from those that apply to the provision of education. These principles of the just school will address an important omission in the political theory literature and be valuable to stakeholders in policy debates on schooling, including professional organisations, think-tanks, government, and parents. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3228","grantId":"RES-000-22-3228","fundValue":"22405","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Andrew Cook","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":" The most important outcome from the research to date has been a new basis for justifying the abolition of a minimum voting age and allowing all minimally qualified children to vote, regardless of their age. The main arguments of my paper 'Against a Minimum Voting Age' set out the moral and theoretical arguments for this position, and develop feasible policy implications of these arguments. The main suggestions are replacing a minimum voting age with individual tests of minimal competence in the form of a test for basic literacy (self-completion of a simple voter registration form); and minimum independent to cast a personal vote (a private ballot). The main scientific output to date has concerned my argument for abolishing the minimum voting age and replacing it with an individual procedural test for minimum electoral competence. I am optimistic that this work can have direct impact on the growing debate around the voting age, particularly following the involvement of 16 and 17 year-olds in the Scottish Referendum. I am actively seeking both academic and policy partners to develop this work further and seek meaningful impact in the impending debate around these important social, political and moral questions.
