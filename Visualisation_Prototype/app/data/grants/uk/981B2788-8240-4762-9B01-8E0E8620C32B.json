{"id":"981B2788-8240-4762-9B01-8E0E8620C32B","title":"Passive air sampling of organic pollutants.","abstractText":"We have pioneered research on the theory, development, laboratory testing, field calibration/application and refinement of passive air samplers (PAS) for persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This has been motivated by our desire to understand the atmospheric sources, transport and global cycling of POPs, and has been funded by NERC, the Environment Agency and the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. We have identified a market for the substantial increase in use of PAS for POPs, largely because of the advent of EU air quality regulatory standards, but also because of other national and international developments. This proposal is therefore to facilitate: optimization of the design; market research; accreditation of our analytical laboratories, prior to commercialization of their manufacture, supply, use and analysis for a range of organic contaminants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D521606/1","grantId":"NE/D521606/1","fundValue":"61307","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Kevin  Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
