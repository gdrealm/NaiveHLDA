People with sight loss have low levels of participation across many aspects of their lives and low levels of wellbeing.</p>\n\n<p>Many organisations, from large national charities to small local voluntary groups, work to improve circumstances for people with sight loss. These organisations need evidence to develop services and to secure funds to deliver those services. Many in the sector highlight a lack of research skills and awareness.</p>\n\n<p>This programme addresses this need through the following work strands:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Knowledge Exchange Across the Sector: eight regional workshops and networking events.</li>\n\n <li>Professional and Workforce Development: social research training programme for researchers, policy officers and service managers in the national sight loss sector.</li>\n\n <li>Knowledge Hub: offering sight loss organisations a point of contact for advice on social research evidence.</li>\n\n <li>Collaboration and Networking: a network establishing sustainability by developing ongoing collaboration and cooperation beyond this project.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>A new post for a formerly unemployed blind or partially sighted trainee will be created, to join the project team to help deliver these work strands.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002000/1","grantId":"ES/L002000/1","fundValue":"55354","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sally  McManus","coPersons":["Kandy  Woodfield","Christopher  Lord"],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
