Failure to control the generation of stem cells or the differentiation into their progeny contribute to cancer. Thus, the goal of this project is to identity key regulators and mechanisms that control the maintenance of healthy skin by regulating stem cell growth and differentiation. Once we have identified important factors regulating stem cell fate, we further investigate whether their mis-regulation contribute to cancer. These approaches are being developed and exploited to uncover novel mechanisms and pathways that are involved in cancer development and could well lead to the discovery of novel anti-cancer drug targets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801904","grantId":"G0801904","fundValue":"411732","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michaela  Frye","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
