A great deal is known about the underlying technology - the neuron - and we can observe large-scale brain activity through techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, but this knowledge barely starts to tell us how the brain works. Something is happening at the intermediate levels of processing that we have yet to begin to understand, but the essence of the brain's information processing function probably lies in these intermediate levels. To get at these middle layers requires that we build models of very large systems of spiking neurons, with structures inspired by the increasingly detailed findings of neuroscience, in order to investigate the emergent behaviours of those systems.\n\nHigh-performance microprocessors have reached a brick wall in terms of improving single-thread performance. The technology advances that have delivered exponential performance gains over the last 3 decades will not deliver the same gains in the future, and a new approach is required. Industry giants, including Intel, are all agreed that the continuing increases in chip transistor count can no longer be turned into making one processor faster, but should instead be turned into putting more processors onto a chip. This delivers more total performance, but through parallelism, not single-thread performance.\n\nThe grant was an early stepping stone to a much larger vision of creating a system containing a million cores; (subsequently funded by EPSRC EP/D079594/1, Samsung and others). &amp;quot;Project findings&amp;quot; is not really an appropriate term. It was an (extremely successful) enabling project. See &amp;quot;potential use&amp;quot; in the follow-on project, EPSRC EP/D079594/1.
