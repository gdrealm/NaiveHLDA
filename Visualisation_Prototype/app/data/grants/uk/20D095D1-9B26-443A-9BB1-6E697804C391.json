Bayesian statistics provide an alternative framework that views data through models of the underlying random, physical and biological elements. Measurements, hypothesis tests and decisions take into account all the available information and are provably optimal, but these powerful techniques remain largely inaccessible. In our BBSRC research we combined Bayesian methods with specialist programming languages to build a unique platform (BAYSIG) for data management and analysis. We will extend this platform and prove that it can provide important new insights into large and complex datasets, both biological and financial. We will build a Bayesian model of heart beat recordings and show that we can characterise real heart beat signals with greater precision than is currently possible. These analyses and other developments of BAYSIG will be commercialised through a user-friendly web interface.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K020242/1","grantId":"BB/K020242/1","fundValue":"175619","fundStart":"2014-05-04","fundEnd":"2015-05-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  In progress and commercially sensitive.
