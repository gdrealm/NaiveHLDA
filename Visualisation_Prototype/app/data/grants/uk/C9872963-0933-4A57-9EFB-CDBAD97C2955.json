MDIPP seeks to understand and explain how these relationships function in a particularly well-documented domain; the period when French music drama was subject to a system of licences, 1806-1864. The project examines institutional structures and their relationship both to those responsible for the creation and cultivation of stage music in the period and on the structure and from the resulting works them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113049/1","grantId":"113049/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Everist","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
