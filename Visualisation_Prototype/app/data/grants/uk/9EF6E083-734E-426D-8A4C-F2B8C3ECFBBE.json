Ease or difficulty in learning to use advanced technologies and problems that arise in usage will also be studied. A further project aim is to understand what types of advanced technologies disabled people want to see developed and explore solutions and innovations with designers and engineers. The national and international disability communities will be involved in discussing current and potential new uses and roles for advanced technology in their lives.</p>\n\n<p>One critical issue is how adaptable advanced technologies can be to individual requirements and the limitations to choice that can be exercised. Ultimately, the aim is to understand the ways in which advanced technology assists or hinders disabled people in independent living.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E00427X/1","grantId":"ES/E00427X/1","fundValue":"203168","fundStart":"2006-10-23","fundEnd":"2008-10-22","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer  Harris","coPersons":["Thilo  Kroll","Nicolas Alexander Hine","John  Arnott"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
