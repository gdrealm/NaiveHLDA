Underlying aims include increasing the effectiveness and quality of health services and policy, enhancing the quality of life of older people, and ensuring that national minimum standards (including equality and human rights standards) are enforced.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004018/1","grantId":"ES/K004018/1","fundValue":"64978","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Polly Ann Vizard","coPersons":["Tania  Burchardt"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
