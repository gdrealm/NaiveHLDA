{"id":"C2BE3ED8-CA9C-4581-B353-3557F1F1947C","title":"PDE and Fluid Mechanics","abstractText":"The study of the partial differential equations arising from Fluid Mechanics is of great importance both from the applied and theoretical point of view. For example the relevance of the understanding of the Navier-Stokes equations (incompressible fluids) has been highlighted by the choice of the global existence of solutions as one of the Millenium Problems by the Clay Institute for which one million dollars has been offered.The proposed activities revolve around the organization of a workshop involving the international leading researchers in PDE and Fluid Mechanics., to expose the UK to the new developments in the area. We expect to create a platform for the interaction of all participants, to promote the development of new research links and collaborations. This includes the involvement of graduate students and post-docs with poster sessions.In addition, and linked to their participation in the workshop some speakers will spend extended visits (up to 2 extra weeks) to continue collaboration with the PI on the evolution of sharp fronts for surface quasi-geostrophic equation and its connections with the Euler equation (Charles Fefferman) and the co-PI on partial regularity for Navier Stokes (Igor Kukavica). Additional, similar arrangements might be made with some other speakers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I001050/1","grantId":"EP/I001050/1","fundValue":"21688","fundStart":"2010-07-10","fundEnd":"2010-10-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jose Luis Rodrigo","coPersons":["James Cooper Robinson"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" The main objective of the grant was the organization of a conference in Partial Differential Equations, with particular emphasis on attracting leading international researchers (over 75% of speakers were from abroad).\nA volume of proceedings from the conference was edited (Cambridge University Press). Multiple collaborations were established as a consequence of the conference that have lead to several different lines of research. The community has been energized and multiple workshops have been organized since, including several by the PI and Co-PI. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
