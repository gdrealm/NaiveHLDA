Identity, culture and society in the Western Sahara","abstractText":"The Western Sahara is the last colony in Africa and the only Spanish speaking territory in the Arab World. When in 1975 the agonizing Fran&ccedil;oise abandoned hastily its colony, Morocco and Mauritania occupied the Territory, despite the protest of the UN and the resistance of a nascent Saharawi liberation movement, the Frente Polisario. During the first months, the conflict displaced thousands of Saharawi's to the neighboring Algerian region of Tandouf, where almost 200,000 Saharawi's still live today in four large refugee camps. The war between Morocco (Mauritania renounced to its territorial claims in 1979) and the Saharawi nationalists lasted unti11991, when the UN managed to broker a ceasefire with the promise of organising a self-determination referendum. But 15 years later, the referendum has not yet been organised, the peace process seems irremediably stagnant and the regional tension grows dangerously. Meanwhile, the Western Sahara remains divided by a 2.600 kilometer-long military wall, built by Rabat in the late 1980s. The Western Sahara wall is the largest military wall active nowadays and separates virtually every Saharawi family.\n\n\n\nIn these three decades of conflict, the refugee camps have become the centre of a state founded by the POLISARIO in 1976: the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), now recognised by over 60 states worldwide and member of the African Union. What makes this case of special interest is precisely the process of nation building developed in the refugee camps over these 30 years of exile. The refugee camps are the base of the Saharawi state-in-waiting. It was in the camps where the POLISARIO implemented the communitarian ideas of the Saharawi nationalism forged during the 1970s, creating a new culture and society based on the articulation of elements from the Hispanic, Arab and African traditions. The past was inscribed in a new historical narrative, a new discourse about 'what is to be a Saharawi' emerged, new rontiers of inclusion/exclusion were constructed and a new way of representing and symbolising the Saharawi nation was developed, naturalised and reproduced through a whole array of practices, spaces and narratives.\n\nThis research project aims to study the dynamic process of identity construction and nation building developed in the refugee camps, attending at how the contours of the Saharawi nation are delineated, represented and symbolised in the refugee camps through everyday life practices, social spaces, collective imaginaries and both 'popular' and 'high' culture (literature, painting, music, etc.).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E503551/1","grantId":"AH/E503551/1","fundValue":"21771","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Pablo  San Martin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
