Skin also serves as a source of adult stem cells, and several distinct adult somatic cell populations isolated from the skin were successfully employed for reprogramming and generation of induced pluripotent cells. \n\nResearch into genome and chromatin biology over the last two decades has revealed that in addition to genetic mechanisms, lineage-specific gene expression programs are also regulated epigenetically, i.e., via biochemical modification of the chromatin structure. \n\nGenome organizer Satb1 protein plays an important role in establishing specific associations between different genes in the nucleus, which are required for proper control of cellular functions and gene expression programs.\n\nSatb1 protein regulates expression of the genes that are highly expressed in skin epithelial cells via establishing of specific three-dimensional conformation of the skin-specific genomic loci in the nucleus. However, its role in the control of skin ageing remains unclear. \n\nIn this project, we propose a systematic study to 1) understand how skin-specific gene loci are spatially organised in the nucleus, 2) define genes that form their close genomic neighbourhood and 3) understand how Satb1 protein regulates these processes during skin development and ageing. \n\nSuccessful performance of this project will help in better understanding the complexity of regulatory mechanisms that control skin development and ageing and in designing new approaches for modulating ageing process and targeting stem cells in the clinical age-associated conditions accompanied by their un-controlled activation/expansion or exhausting/loss","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K010050/1","grantId":"BB/K010050/1","fundValue":"412889","fundStart":"2013-06-24","fundEnd":"2016-06-23","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The data obtained on this project provide an important platform for targeting Satb1 and modulating its activity during wound healing in human skin and for correction of poor skin regeneration in elderly and diabetic patients.

The research will be continued towards the identification of the effects of Satb1 on the formation of such interactomes in keratinocytres during ageing. The data obtained during performance of this project are published or in a process of publication. These data will be used by other researchers as an important platform for further analyses of the role of chromatin regulators in the control of skin ageing and for the development of new cohort of epigenetic drugs for pharmacological modulation of stem cell activity in aged skin.
