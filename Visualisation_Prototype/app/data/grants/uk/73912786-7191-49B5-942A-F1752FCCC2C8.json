More specifically we propose to develop a microfluidic reaction system for the rapid labelling of target molecules using 11CO as a radionuclide source. In this device we propose to have: a) one component (based on transition metal complexes) for the pre-concentration of 11CO; and b) a solid-supported palladium catalyst to accelerate the reaction of this gas with specific substrates for the synthesis of labelled molecules of biomedical interest. This two-stage approach will help to overcome the 2 major drawbacks that currently hinder 11CO labelling methodologies, namely poor reactivity and low concentrations of CO. Our final aim is to have an enabling technology to perform all the steps required for PET imaging with 11C-labelled probes within 15min, including a) pre-concentration of 11CO; b) catalytic reactions to incorporate 11CO onto the target molecule; c) purify labelled species; d) use the labelled probe for PET imaging.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G027749/1","grantId":"EP/G027749/1","fundValue":"508120","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ramon  Vilar Compte","coPersons":["Andrew James De Mello","Nicholas  Long"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" The key findings in this project have been in three main areas: 1) development of microfluidic systems for catalyst screening and to perform rapid carbonylative coupling reactions; 2) development of new catalytic systems (homogeneous and solid-supported) for carbonylative coupling reactions; 3) synthesis of new metal-based compounds with the ability to 'trap' and 'release' carbon monoxide. \n\nThese key findings are detailed below: \n\na) A novel gas-liquid microfluidic reactor system has been developed to study Pd-catalyzed carbonylation reactions over a range of flow regimes and reaction conditions (Chem. Eur. J. 2012, 18, 2768). We have shown that segmented gas-liquid flow regime, in comparison to annular flow, enables reactions to be studied over longer reaction times and without the build-up of unwanted Pd particles. This system has allowed us to compare the catalytic activity (in-chip) of one of the palladium dimers described above with that of a mono-palladium complex typically used for this type of reaction. \n\nb) A gas/liquid microfluidic reactor (not based on segmented flow as above) has been developed and used for the first time to efficiently perform [11C]carbon monoxide carbonylation reactions for the preparation of 11C-radiolabelled amide molecules within a short timeframe (Chem. Eur. J. 2011, 17, 460). This has allowed us to prepare a wide range of 11C-labelled molecules for PET imaging, including some substrates that are biologically relevant. \n\nc) We have demonstrated that sterically-hindered di-palladium complexes act as excellent pre-catalysts for aminocarbonylations of aryl halides (Org. Biomol. Chem., 2011, 9, 3499). We have successfully applied these catalytic systems to carry out 11C-labelling of organic substrates. These studies have provided the proof of principle for the use of these dimeric species as efficient catalysts for positron emission tomography (PET) labelling.\n\nd) We have developed a catalytic system based on palladium-xantphos supported on silica for carbonylative coupling reactions (unpublished results). This material was then packed into Teflon tubing and flow catalytic reactions were carried out. Although we still need to improve on the yields of the reaction at short reaction times (to make it useful as a system for 11C-PET labelling) we have demonstrated that this system is catalytically active and superior to other solid-supported palladium materials. As part of our efforts to yield heterogeneous catalyst, we have developed another materials based on palladium nanoparticles imbedded in a silica matrix (unpublished results). \n\ne) Several new metal-based compounds have been developed to efficiently 'trap' and 'release' carbon monoxide in solution (Dalton Trans., 2012, 41, 83) and solid state (J. Organomet. Chem. 2012, 715, 39). In particular, two of these complexes (based on Co and Fe centres coordinated to hemilabile phosphines) have shown to bind CO in solution very efficiently and upon heating release it back in solution. The new complexes and their uptake/release mechanism have been characterised in detail. Preliminary studies on their use as [11C]CO pre-concentrating materials have been carried out and showed that these complexes could indeed be further developed for PET labelling studies.
