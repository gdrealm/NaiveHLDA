The aim is to develop indicators of recovery that can exploit the wealth of data now available, including that from satellite imagery, internet-based statistics and advanced field survey techniques. Two key aspects of the proposal are that the indicators will be based on a user needs survey of aid agencies and will be validated against published data and field survey observations. The proposal is important because currently there is no agreed standard approach to evaluating the effectiveness of recovery aid. A simple way of using satellite imagery, statistics and digital in-field data to measure and monitor the extent of recovery over time would be of immense benefit to aid agencies in targeting resources effectively and evaluating the effectiveness of their expenditure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F015232/1","grantId":"EP/F015232/1","fundValue":"388756","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin  Spence","coPersons":["TORWONG  CHENVIDYAKARN"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
