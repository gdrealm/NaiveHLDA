Currently we can see light emission from live, anaesthetised animals with non-invasive tools and are thus able to quantify expression. These methods have limitations including the requirement for anaesthesia (which can alter gene expression) and relatively poor resolution. The basic components required to establish a substantially improved system to deliver high-resolution use in the conscious animal already exist (fibre optics, micro-lenses, miniature detection systems). Through a joint effort between biologists and optical physicists we propose to take the first step to realising that goal and we propose to use transgenic rats that express luciferase and eGFP as tools for developing this technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802588","grantId":"G0802588","fundValue":"50347","fundStart":"2009-08-31","fundEnd":"2011-02-27","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sabrina  Semprini","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
