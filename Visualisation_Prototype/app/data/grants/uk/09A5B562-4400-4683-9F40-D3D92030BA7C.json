These initiatives will be organised and delivered by the member of staff employed during the Phase I pilot, in conjunction with the rest of the Commercial Relations Team, who are engaged in similar activities as part of the EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account, and other relevant personnel within the University. All our initiatives will include a significant industry component with the central aim of enhancing the impact of NERC-funded research. Activities will include: the organisation of facilitated workshops on specific research themes, the administration of collaborative seed funding to kick-start projects with industry, and the development of marketing materials to raise the NERC and University of Edinburgh's external profile and visibility.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L012820/1","grantId":"NE/L012820/1","fundValue":"201620","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander William Tudhope","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
