A special session organised by Ulijn and Perry will deal with three main areas: (i) biomimetic materials, (ii) biological interactions at the solid-liquid interface, (iii) molecular self-assembly strategies and (iv) bio-responsive materials and (v) applications in biology and medicine. These research areas are currently led by large US based groups and for the UK to be competitive in this area a good presence at this symposium is of strategic importance. Within the international biomaterials community the MRS symposia are seen as excellent environments for students and young researchers to present their research to an international academic audience. Hence, this proposal is to provide travel support to allow UK based scientists and students to attend the MRS Spring meeting and specifically the session The Nature of Design- Utilizing Biology's Portfolio .","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F000863/1","grantId":"EP/F000863/1","fundValue":"6930","fundStart":"2007-04-20","fundEnd":"2007-07-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rein  Ulijn","coPersons":["Carole  Perry"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
