This project will test a randomized intervention designed to provide vulnerable young people residing in poor, peri-urban HIV/AIDS affected communities with strategies for building economic, social and health skills.&nbsp; The intervention will be delivered in conjunction with local schools and will target students in grades 10 and 11.&nbsp; The strategic skills proposed are to help build economic assets and offer protective strategies against HIV and early pregnancy.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F019726/1","grantId":"ES/F019726/1","fundValue":"418638","fundStart":"2007-11-22","fundEnd":"2010-11-21","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kelly Kay Hallman","coPersons":["Prudence  Ditlopo","Eva  Roca"],"organisation":"Population Council","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
