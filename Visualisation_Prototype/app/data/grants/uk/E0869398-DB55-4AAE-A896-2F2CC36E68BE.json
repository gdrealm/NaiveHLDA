An analysis of UK households' CO2 emissions and their association with socio-economic factors","abstractText":"<p>Effective emissions reduction policies are required to avoid dangerous climate change. The redistributive impacts resulting from those policies will be relevant for their public acceptability. This project first examines the distribution of CO2 emissions across UK households. Second, it will explore the potential distribution of financial burdens across UK households resulting from a range of climate change mitigation policies. Households that will be most vulnerable to CO2 reduction policies will be identified.</p>\n\n<p>The project will develop a household emissions dataset by combining data from the Living Cost and Food Survey with energy prices and emission factors for specific expenditure items. This database will then be used to estimate the distribution of CO2 emissions across UK households, comparing different categories of emissions (home energy, transport, indirect and total household emissions).</p>\n\n<p>The project will also analyse the impact of different socio-demographic factors on household CO2 emissions. In particular, we will compare the importance of different factors for low and high income households, enabling us to identify potentially vulnerable households in low income groups.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4083","grantId":"RES-000-22-4083","fundValue":"80168","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used by the ONS to update the way in which the Living Costs and Food Survey records information on flights.\nOur findings have also been used by other academics and students to develop their research.

Emissions from transport are most unequally distributed and emissions from home energy are least unequally distributed. CO2 taxes on home energy are therefore likely to be more regressive than taxes on transport emissions. We also put together a dataset with CO2 emissions at the household level for over 50 consumption categories for a sample of 24446 households in the UK, 2006-2009. The results might influence the design of future climate change mitigation policies or adjacent policies to reduce regressive effects and improve public acceptability.
