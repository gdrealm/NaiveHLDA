{"id":"ADBB8085-7EF6-49E0-AE27-8A6FFF2FA34F","title":"An edition of Oscar Wilde's contributions to the Dramatic Review and the Pall Mall Gazette","abstractText":"Oscar Wilde was a prolific journalist throughout the 1880s, writing on a wide range of subjects. My edition will concentrate upon his contributions to two publications. One is the Dramatic Review, an advanced magazine concerned with the developments in playwriting, including the plays of Ibsen, and with new ideas of staging. The other is the Pall Mall Gazette, a prominent daily newspaper and an example of the 'New Journalism' that courted controversy. My aim is to provide reliable texts and helpful annotations that will situate Wilde's contributions historically, both in terms of his own career and the expanding newspaper industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112879/1","grantId":"112879/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Stokes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
