{"id":"C30ED8E4-3205-432C-BAE1-EA4338BFB2CD","title":"A Rolling Grant for the Observation and Study of Cosmic X-ray Sources","abstractText":"The X-ray Astronomy group at the Institute of Astronomy researches the X-ray properties, mechanisms and evolution of clusters of galaxies, active galaxies and the X-ray background using data from satellites (e.g. Chandra, XMM-Newton and ASTRO-E2). It is proposed to continue the PPARC Rolling Grant with the core staff remaining constant at 3.5 PDRAs. The increasing sophistication of the computer tasks, particularly with the great increase in spatial and spectral resolution (Chandra, XMM and ASTRO-E2) requires enhancements in computing power. I anticipate a better understanding of (a) the operation of black holes through the relativistic iron line; (b) cooling and heating processes in cluster cores; (c) the gas content of clusters; (d) the environment of accreting black holes from reflection and absorption signatures; (e) the obscured growth of massive black holes; and (f) other processes and cosmic objects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D000998/1","grantId":"PP/D000998/1","fundValue":"599274","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Fabian","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
