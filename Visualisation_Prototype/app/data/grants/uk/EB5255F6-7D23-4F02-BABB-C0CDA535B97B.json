{"id":"EB5255F6-7D23-4F02-BABB-C0CDA535B97B","title":"The Art of Identification","abstractText":"The practical identification of individuals has, in the modern period, taken a number of forms - from Early Modern badges and insignia to the contemporary strobe light of a retinal scanner. The term 'identification' can also be taken to mean a number of things, including the determination of individual personhood via paperwork, bodily examination, verbal testimony, and digital recording; the detection of false or forged identities; the creation of offender profiles by forensic psychologists; and the taxonomic (and later genetic) tracing of ethnic 'types'. This subject has been of recent interest in historical, social scientific and biological scholarship. However, what has been neglected to date is the inherent connections that exist between techniques of identification (as defined above) and the intimate personal identity divulged by literary and artistic representation. The question of who we are, in the practical sense of identifying individuals via their documents and bodies, has remained curiously absent from the question of who we are in terms of our intimate portrayal of the self. \n\nThis research network will seek to redress this discrepancy by examining the papers of identity documents alongside a range of written and visual media and thereby advance a fresh interpretive model for the consideration of both identificatory practices and the artistic depiction of identity. The broad spectrum of participants speaks to the interdisciplinary nature of the project and its ability to resonate across different areas of study and practice. To achieve its objectives, the network will advance conversation and collaboration via a series of four day-long workshops its website and twitter feed. The online activities will involve the dissemination of research questions, potential reading lists and thematic concerns prior to workshops and the publishing of papers and discussion topics following the workshops. Postgraduate students and early career researchers will form an integral part of the workshop and help to sustain its ongoing existence and development.\n\nThe first workshop, at the University of Cambridge, will focus on the theme of 'image and information' and address the central first question of how identity documents can be interpreted as cultural artifacts that connect with artistic representations of identity. The second workshop, at the University of Illinois, will move on to think more specifically about the site of many identificatory practices - the human body - and consider its relationship to the kinds of bodies depicted in art and literature. The third workshop, at the University of Birmingham, will bring together academics, practitioners of forensic science and a range of creative practioners in order to consider the ways in which their varying models of identity could be brought to bear on each other. The fourth and final workshop, held at the Library of Birmingham, will comprise a working meeting between key members of the network steering group and museum professionals, curators and archivists. Building on the content of these workshops, the aim of the meeting will be to develop a conceptual framework which will accommodate the various interdisciplinary and professional approaches to identification and identity developed by the network. This framework will actively develop a rationale for reading a host of different identity documents as works of art, thereby realizing a huge potential within various archival material held in locations such as the Library of Birmingham. The stimulation of new creative work will also be addressed with the inclusion of practicing writers and artists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M011143/1","grantId":"AH/M011143/1","fundValue":"35341","fundStart":"2015-07-14","fundEnd":"2016-07-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rex  Ferguson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
