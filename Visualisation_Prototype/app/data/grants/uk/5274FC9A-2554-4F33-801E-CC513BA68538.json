{"id":"5274FC9A-2554-4F33-801E-CC513BA68538","title":"Tutorials and Workshop: ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF NONLINEAR CONTROL SYSTEMS","abstractText":"Nonlinear phenomena occur naturally in physical and artificial systems. These phenomena can be modelled by means of mathematical relations (differential and/or difference equations). Nonlinear systems and control theories provide the tools for the analysis of these systems and for the design of procedures or algorithms aimed at modifying their behaviour.These theories have undergone substantial changes and have witnessed several important developments in the last decades. It is therefore fair to state that these theories are now at the basis of a mature discipline. In particular they are part of most engineering and several new mathematics, biology and chemistry curricula and are one of the most active areas of research in the systems and control community. Nevertheless, nonlinear systems and control theories are relatively under-represented in the UK, and their impact in industry and in the development of advanced applications is still relatively small.Goal of this proposal is to support the organization of a four-day event, with contributions from leading international researchers, with the aim to reverse this trend, to expose UK PhD students and researchers to novel ideas and the latest developments, and to facilitate the interaction between the UK research community and the international one (for example by establishing new research collaborations).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F043090/1","grantId":"EP/F043090/1","fundValue":"24976","fundStart":"2008-05-06","fundEnd":"2008-11-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This grant has been used to support a major control event in the UK.
