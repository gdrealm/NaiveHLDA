Due to limitations of available instruments, understanding of the fundamental mechanism is still very limited and some industrial processes involving flow and particles are still inefficient. To benefit from the rapid development of image technologies, an ultra-high speed LDA-PIV system is proposed, in which an ultra-high speed image sensor will be used to replace the photodetector in the receiver of a conventional Laser Doppler Anemometry. Since the required sensor is not commercially available, a smart sensor with data processing functions will be developed in collaboration with experts in sensor technologies. This instrument will enable simultaneous measurements of flow and particles (both spherical and non-spherical, down to nano/micro scales). As this new instrument will offer new opportunities for the investigation of microscale turbulent flows and nano/micro particles, it will be used to study a typical example of nanoparticle aggregation, a UV-TiO2 photocatalytic system for water purification. Optimal design and better performance control and ultimately a more efficient system are expected. The instrument will also be used to study microscale turbulent structure fundamentally. It is aimed at advancing our understanding on the phenomena and to improve turbulent modelling and performance of industrial processes that involve the turbulence.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C009819/1","grantId":"EP/C009819/1","fundValue":"500556","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Daoyi  Chen","coPersons":["Gary John Royle"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
