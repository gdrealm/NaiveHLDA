Covering just under 80 acres running south from the parish of St Botolph Bishopsgate to the Thames, this area experienced a population explosion during the early modern period, from c.3,500 inhabitants in 1540, over 11,000 by 1650, to nearly 20,000 by 1700. The area offers a population with a unique range of social and economic experiences which allow the greatest possible scope for studying suburban living in early modern London. Moreover, it also offers an unprecedented array of sources, including parish registers, records of poor relief, numerous taxation and household listings, and the observations of the parish clerks of St Botolph. The project will: assess the impact of burgeoning population and industrialisation on the topography of the study area; examine the social and economic characteristics of the area’s population; and study the relationship between rapid urbanisation and health and mortality. These analyses will inform and underpin large-scale explanations of the development of the early modern metropolis and its role in the ‘modernisation’ of English society.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F040555/1","grantId":"ES/F040555/1","fundValue":"729194","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew  Davies","coPersons":["Vanessa  Harding","Richard Michael Smith"],"organisation":"University of London","findingsText":" Four main findings have arisen from analysis of the study area’s parish registers:\n\n\n\n1) Infant mortality was high but largely invariant by occupation (and, by implication, social status) and geographical areas within London\n\n\n\n2) The epidemiological regime changed following the last plague of 1665, with a reduction in the volatility and shifts in the age structure of mortality\n\n\n\n3) The suburb’s occupational structure saw a stable sectoral distribution across the period, but also the development of many new types of manufacture. European migrants played a significant role in these new industries, such as gunmaking.\n\n\n\n4) Age at first marriage varied considerably over time although the age gap between the sexes remained relatively stable. Clandestine marriage was especially popular among younger men and women, and appears to have siphoned off these couples from their home parish registers.\n\n\n\nThe main findings relevant to the area’s housing and inhabitants were threefold. First, the low ground rents charged by the numerous institutional freeholders often enabled lessee landlords to provide housing at low rental charges, whilst still ensuring that they invested in amenities and the build quality of the housing stock. This dynamic probably explains the ability of lessee landlords to meet the demand for cheap, high density housing, without apparently resorting to the poor quality structures that characterised much of the low rent housing in other areas of early modern London. \n\n\n\nSecond, despite pockets of extremely poor quality housing with a high density of occupation, particularly in East Smithfield, the overall character of the topography and housing stock of the suburb was mixed. Larger ‘mercantile’ type dwellings were present across the period, as were smaller artisanal houses.\n\n\n\nFinally, information from the sample property histories and related sources indicates that the duration families and individuals could occupy their dwellings was often considerable, regularly spanning decades. This questions somewhat previous assumptions regarding the inherently transient nature of suburban dwelling.\n\n\n\nInvestigations into the health of the area’s inhabitants focused on the issues of poor relief and nursing provision. Through detailed biographical reconstructions it was possible to establish that the local authorities made no distinction between the ‘deserving’ and ‘undeserving’ resident poor throughout the period when it came to the provision of relief. This approach was not simply the result of an attempt to preserve the stability of the community but was also founded on a strong sense of neighbourly responsibility. Research also suggested that the extensive seventeenth-century, parish-financed system for boarding and nursing the poor and the sick represented the formalisation, to some extent, of earlier private practices that were visible from the sixteenth century.\n\n\n\nIn terms of methodologies, the project had two principal outcomes:\n\n1. Family reconstitution techniques have been adapted and updated for use with large urban populations with rapid population turnover, and fully explained for use by other researchers.\n\n2. A ‘London-specific’ methodology has been developed for studying domestic groupings in the 1695 Marriage Duty returns, a substantial, Census-like source extant for many locations nationwide. The research findings and data have the potential for use by a range of non-academic groups. These include local and family historians, for whom the outputs will provide valuable context as well as information about particular neighbourhoods, families and occupations - especially in the East End of London. The digital publication of the Parish Clerk's Memoranda Books of St Botolph Aldgate will bring to public attention a unique source which sheds light on everyday life in early modern London. In terms of relevant future research, the project’s demographic data will be used in a new project to be funded by the Wellcome Trust. This will investigate shifts in the epidemiological regime throughout England, by examining variations in short term mortality in urban areas, market towns and rural parishes. Two current GIS mapping projects associated with the Centre for Metropolitan History will also be using the project’s data-sets in their outputs. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
