Thinking often involves the mental manipulation of one mental object while holding others in mind unchanged (eg, mentally simulating moves in chess). Evidence points toward the existence of a focus of attention in working memory that selects one element at a time for processing. </p>\n\n<p>The project addresses the following questions about the nature of this focus: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Is it structurally limited to one element, or can it take in several elements? <br />How does the focus process relations (eg, verify that in the word &quot;MEMORY&quot; the &quot;E&quot; comes before the &quot;O&quot;)?<br />\n</li>\n <li>How are working memory contents updated by the results of manipulating a mental object (eg, in counting, how is the previous value replaced by the new one)?<br />\n</li>\n <li>How does the focus of attention select an element in working memory?<br />\n</li>\n <li>Can the focus be regarded as the entry gate to a bottleneck for cognitive operations that executes one operation at a time?<br />\n</li>\n <li>Can the focus be expanded through practice?<br />\n</li>\n <li>The long-term goal is to understand how working memory subserves reasoning by manipulating elements in structural representations.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1527","grantId":"RES-000-23-1527","fundValue":"140658","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Klaus  Oberauer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
