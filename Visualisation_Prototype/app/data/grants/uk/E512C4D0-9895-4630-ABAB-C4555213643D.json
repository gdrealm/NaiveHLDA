It will compare the current focus upon increasing 'participation' in education and training with the historical project of raising the school leaving age ('ROSLA'). The project will offer an historical argument which takes account of the wider context as well as the public debates surrounding the issue. It will start from the hypothesis that the measure was, in broad terms, a 'policy success', in supporting equality of opportunity and social justice more widely. Specifically it will address the following questions:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ol>\n <li>What were the motivations for, and arguments against, extending the school leaving age?</li>\n <li>What were the key issues and contradictions in the development of the policy?</li>\n <li>How was the policy conceived and enacted in selected case study areas and what does this reveal about the nature of central policy making?</li>\n <li>How can a historical analysis inform contemporary policies in this area?</li>\n</ol>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G008876/1","grantId":"ES/G008876/1","fundValue":"141686","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our finding on the raising of the school leaving age and the raising of the participation age have fed into academic and practitioner research in these areas.

ROSLA affected educational structure and content, including building and teacher supply, pedagogy and curriculum and had significant financial implications in achieving 'secondary education for all'.\n\nWe identified continuing opposition to ROSLA. During the 1950s, some Conservatives argued for lowering the school leaving age. Only gradually did a concern with 'wastage' in grammar schools extend to all children, informed by the idea of human capital. In 1964, the Conservative Edward Boyle announced the decision to raise the school leaving age to 16. This represented not only an attempt to deflate Labour Party election promises, but also reflected an expanding view of education within the Conservative Party. ROSLA continued to play a major role in political debate throughout the post-war years, and the two-year delay from 1968 had significant political and educational implications.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, ROSLA facilitated arguments for comprehensive schooling based upon a five-year secondary course. Distinctive forms of education targeted at the 'less able' were developed. The impulse for common schooling could paradoxically lead to an emphasis upon the separate needs of particular groups of students that were rarely well-resourced - assumptions about different types of education based on small groups were not widely practised. The built environment also impacted upon ROSLA and broader educational debates. After 1947, wide-ranging aspirations relating to 'secondary education for all' were curtailed by shortages and a hutting operation (HORSA) instituted. The bulk of post-war school building was carried out on the assumption of compulsory education to 15. By the 1970s, temporary accommodation and 'ROSLA blocks' contributed to a diverse educational provision which attempted to address the needs of older pupils.\n\nCase studies reveal a diversity of responses in organisation and curriculum. Locally, there was a slow reaction to national debates which only quickened in the years immediately preceding 1972. Some authorities embraced ROSLA as a means to expand education but others used it to help preserve selective schooling, offering pre-vocational courses for 'rosla students'. ROSLA created a situation in which vocational education became a concern in the 1970's and 1980s.\n\nOur project fosters understanding of the policy to raise the participation age especially in relation to the issue of preparedness and continuing historical dilemmas. Discussions with the Participation Unit are on-going. The long preparatory phase to 2015 has parallels in the past that indicate the policy will be altered in practice as it is slowly filtered through various levels of educational practice. Some preparations have already been halted, notably certain diplomas. As in the past, reduced funding will further limit opportunities for those who are not in education, employment or training (NEET). This reflects an historical oscillation in the ways that educational expansion has been perceived alternately as a cost and an investment, a change of emphasis which took place with the incoming Coalition Government in 2010. Historical tensions between differentiated and common provision are very apparent in contemporary debate. The project has a potential contribution to make to policy-makers and practitioners involved in raising the participation age, particularly in relation to the idea of preparedness for change. It could also help to raise awareness the variety of ways in which a similar reform was implemented in the past. \n\nIn terms of educational research, this project provides a good example of the way in which historical understanding can contribute insights into contemporary policy. The kinds of tension and contradictions faced in the past continue to have a resonance today: for example, viewing education as a cost and/or investment; between common and differentiated curricula; and the respective roles of schools, further education and other training providers. These and other issues all have long roots which need to be teased out through historical research.\n\nThere is also a wider relevance for the social history of modern Britain, which places education in a pivotal role in understanding changing perceptions of youth and young people in relation to adulthood and citizenship. The expansion of compulsory state education contributed directly to increased expectations about the potential of young people as well as highly gendered fears about the rise of crime and delinquency. These concerns also have long and significant international parallels and repercussions. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
