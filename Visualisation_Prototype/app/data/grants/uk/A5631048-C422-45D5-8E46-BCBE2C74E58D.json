{"id":"A5631048-C422-45D5-8E46-BCBE2C74E58D","title":"MSSL PATT linked grant","abstractText":"The next two years of research in MSSL's Astrophysics group will continue the intensive exploitation of data from XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift to study accreting binaries, AGN, neutron stars, star forming galaxies and gamma-ray bursts. Our programme will be expanding in 2008 with the launch of ESA's Herschel mission, and we will need to compliment our guaranteed time on this facility with ground based preparatory and follow up observations. All of our research is dependent on ground based observations to provide multiwavelength extensions or follow up in order to get the full science return. This proposal is for a continuation of our current PATT grant (PP/D003016/19) as a PATT linked grant, and requests travel funds to allow group members to travel to PATT and PATT-approved telescopes to conduct these observations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F012284/1","grantId":"ST/F012284/1","fundValue":"12248","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mathew James Page","coPersons":["Ignacio  Ferreras","Graziella  Branduardi-Raymont","Mark Scott Cropper","Silvia  Zane","Kinwah  Wu"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
