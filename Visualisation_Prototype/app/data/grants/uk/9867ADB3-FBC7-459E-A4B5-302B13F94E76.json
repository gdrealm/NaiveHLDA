This process is called gene expression and it is vital to all life. Gene expression comprises two main steps, called transcription and translation. In transcription, the information in the DNA sequences of the genes is converted into equivalent sequences in so-called messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. In translation, the mRNA molecules are 'read' by a large molecular structure called the ribosome, which uses the information to dictate the synthesis of proteins. This short project will help us understand how the use of the information encoded in the mRNA molecules is controlled. In order to be able to do this, we need to have detailed information about the early part of each mRNA. Sequencing projects have not provided this information. This project will develop a new procedure that will be capable of obtaining this information for every mRNA in a chosen organism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E012280/1","grantId":"BB/E012280/1","fundValue":"80890","fundStart":"2007-05-15","fundEnd":"2009-04-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Edward McCarthy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
