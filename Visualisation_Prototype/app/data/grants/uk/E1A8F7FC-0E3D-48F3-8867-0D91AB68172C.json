{"id":"E1A8F7FC-0E3D-48F3-8867-0D91AB68172C","title":"Determining the role of the SUMO-specific, ubiquitin ligase RNF4","abstractText":"The work here is directly relevant to finding out how cellular components are destroyed. Understanding how this is done is important as it is involved in the regulation of basic cellular processes. The subject of this proposal, RNF4 is a unique enzyme that adds chains of ubiquitin molecules onto proteins already modified with another ubiquitin-like protein known as SUMO. This targets the modified proteins for proteasomal degradation. It is RNF4 that mediates the therapeutic effect of arsenic in treatment of Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia, by inducing degradation of the oncogenic PML-RAR fusion protein responsible for the disease. Understanding the detailed mechanism of RNF4 action could therefore have important implications for the development of future therapeutic agents. The remarkable efficacy of the proteasome inhibitor Velcade in Multiple Myeloma suggests that more substrate specific inhibition of proteasomal degradation could allow the development of drugs with increased efficacy and reduced side effects. Identification of suitable targets for the development of new drugs requires a detailed knowledge of the molecules involved in protein degradation and their mechanisms of action. The work described here is an attempt to obtain a detailed mechanism for the function of RNF4.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701194","grantId":"G0701194","fundValue":"915737","fundStart":"2008-10-13","fundEnd":"2013-04-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ronald Thomas Hay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
