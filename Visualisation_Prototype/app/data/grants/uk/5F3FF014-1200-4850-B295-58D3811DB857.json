The severity of the disease and the need for new treatments are reflected by the fact that nearly 40% of people who are diagnosed with heart failure die within a year (a rate of death which is higher than that associated with most cancers), despite receiving treatment with the available drugs. Two cardinal features of heart failure are a change in the shape of the heart, which becomes enlarged, and a compromised ability of the heart to perform its normal pump function. This project will investigate a protein that is found in the heart, called protein kinase D (PKD), which is suspected to contribute to both the shape change and the depressed pump function, focusing on how PKD interacts with other proteins to bring about its effects. We hope that this work will reveal new avenues of investigation towards the development of more effective treatments for heart failure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800206","grantId":"G0800206","fundValue":"567851","fundStart":"2009-02-15","fundEnd":"2012-10-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Metin  Avkiran","coPersons":["Elisabeth  Ehler","Friederike  Cuello"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
