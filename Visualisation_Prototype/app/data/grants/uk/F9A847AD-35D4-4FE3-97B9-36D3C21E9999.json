In addition, AKI is associated with high costs for intensive and prolongued treatment. To date, no early detection of AKI is possible. However, early detection is essential to initiate appropriate treatment, thereby preventing development of disease, or at least reducing the severity. Such an appproach would reduce mortality, and also costs. \nThe proposal aims at developing a technology platform that enables early detection of AKI, based on specific proteins an peptides in urine, so-called biomarkers. These biomarkers have already been identified. For their efficient clinical application a plattform that allows accurate and fast analysis has to be developed, this development is the scope of the project. Upon successful completion of the project, a robust technology will be available that enables early detection of AKI, hence initiation of appropriate early therapeutic measures. We anticipate that as a result of this project, mortality due to AKI can be significantly decreased, and costs can be reduced.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000791","grantId":"G1000791","fundValue":"784275","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Harald  Mischak","coPersons":["Matthew  Walters"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
