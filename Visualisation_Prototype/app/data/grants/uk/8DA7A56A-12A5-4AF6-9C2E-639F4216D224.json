{"id":"8DA7A56A-12A5-4AF6-9C2E-639F4216D224","title":"Experimental dendritic-cell based immunotherapies for advanced breast cancer","abstractText":"Dendritic cells (DC) are specialised cells of the immune system that are responsible for triggering immune responses. DC that are grown in culture can be readily used to protect mice against transplanted tumours, and have shown some efficacy in clinical trials for treatment of human cancer. However, it is now essential to refine our current suboptimal approaches in animal models that more closely resemble the human situation. This project will investigate DC-based therapies in a mouse model of breast cancer that is also relevant to other types of cancer. Specifically we will identify combinations of chemical agents that will make the DC more efficient at triggering anti-tumour responses; find ways of overcoming cells that may normally inhibit them, and of stimulating others to help; and investigate how we can encourage potentially beneficial cells to enter the tumours in order to destroy them and give long-lasting protection against recurrence of cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700072","grantId":"G0700072","fundValue":"543481","fundStart":"2008-01-15","fundEnd":"2011-01-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Mark Austyn","coPersons":["Vincenzo  Cerundolo"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
