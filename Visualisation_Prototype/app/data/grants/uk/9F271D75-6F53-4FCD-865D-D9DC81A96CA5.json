The range extends from residual Public Service Broadcasting values in the UK to 'quality American TEV' (notable Home Box Office) in the USA and globally. Besides interrogating notions of quality and their discursive positions, the research identifies new production circumstances (economic, technological, and cultural) which create space for quality. Finding suggests that 'quality' TV drama is produced in a highly commercial, digital-global context, through the values determining 'quality' defy tradition. The research redresses a tendency to assume that good TV drama is simply a thing of the past.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112833/1","grantId":"112833/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin  Nelson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
