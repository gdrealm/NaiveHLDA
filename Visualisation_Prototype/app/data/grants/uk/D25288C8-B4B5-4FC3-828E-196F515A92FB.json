{"id":"D25288C8-B4B5-4FC3-828E-196F515A92FB","title":"SPIRE'06 Symposium in Glasgow: Support for Student Attendance","abstractText":"This proposal is requesting funding to support UK student attendance and also to cover the costs of keynote speakers at the Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval (SPIRE 2006) which will be held in Glasgow in October 2006, hosted by the University of Strathclyde. SPIRE 2006 is 13th edition of SPIRE. The first four editions of this series focused primarily on string processing (SP) and were held in South America. From 1998 the focus broadened to include the area of information retrieval (IR) due to its increasing relevance and its inter-relationship with the area of string processing. In addition, since 2000, the conference venue has been alternating between South and Latin America and Europe, being hosted in Europe on even years. The scope of the SPIRE series of conferences includes not only fundamental algorithms in string processing but also contributions in different application areas like biocomputing, DNA sequencing, WWW based IR systems and IR related languages like SGML and XML. Given its inter-disciplinary nature, it offers a singular opportunity for researchers from computer science, information science and engineering interested in working with problems related to these areas to meet and discuss how to collaborate towards the best solutions.SPIRE is one a very few fora where the IR and SP communities can meet and discuss future collaborations and synergies. By supporting UK student attendance to SPIRE 2006 we aim at maximising the impact of this event on the UK IR and SP communities. This is the first time SPIRE is held in UK and in our view it would be ashame from many UK research students to loose the opportunity to attend. Attendance also benefits research students in other way. It enables them to meet and discuss their ideas with leading members of the IR and SP field from both the UK, Europe, and further afield. The two invited speakers are two of the best known researchers in their respective fields.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D078598/1","grantId":"EP/D078598/1","fundValue":"17010","fundStart":"2006-08-15","fundEnd":"2007-03-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Fabio  Crestani","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
