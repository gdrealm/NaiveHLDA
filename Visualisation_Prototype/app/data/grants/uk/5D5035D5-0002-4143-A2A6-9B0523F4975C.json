The book constitutes a comparative study of the construction of place in the work of resident and migrant Sri Lankan writers in relation to two factors: first, competing constructions of home and homeland and secondly, the internal and external displacement generated by the civil war. Both these factors hfave led to complex literary negotiations of territory and belonging, and reformulations of the constructions of the insider and outsider which intersect with - and can entrentch or challenge - cultural formulations of national identity and ethnicity. It will be seen that both literature and critical reception of texts do not simply relfect but are themselves constitutive of territorial relations. Further, in comparing 'resident' constructions of space, place and home with 'migrant' representations, I question the very basis of the distinctions between the two categories and work towards formulating alternative models of identity and belonging.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112934/1","grantId":"112934/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Minoli  Salgado","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
