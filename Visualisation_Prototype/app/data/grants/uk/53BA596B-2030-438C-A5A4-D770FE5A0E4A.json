Resilience, adaptability, and transformability of fishing communities in the face of the World fisheries crisis","abstractText":"<p>Todayâ€™s world fisheries crisis can be seen as one incidence of the increasing scarcity of natural resources experienced globally as a result of population growth, globalisation and increased consumption per capita, among other factors. In the case of fisheries, this situation is exacerbated by the increasing numbers of people who rely on fishing to maintain their livelihood and the use of more powerful and more efficient fishing equipment. As a consequence, there is a growing consensus that the overall fishing effort needs to be curbed significantly if the sustainability of the world fisheries is to be restored. However, how can policy reforms aimed at reducing fishing efforts be implemented without causing millions of resource-poor people to fall deeper into deprivation and food insecurity?</p>\n\n<p>The overall aim of this project is to use the most recent progress in resilience thinking and wellbeing research to generate empirical qualitative and quantitative analyses and provide a policy-relevant answer to this question, thus aiming at reconciling inclusive growth with resource conservation. The project is built around 4 country case-studies: Sri Lanka and Vietnam in South Asia, Ghana in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Fiji in the Pacific region.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J017825/1","grantId":"ES/J017825/1","fundValue":"414268","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christophe  Bene","coPersons":["James Allister McGregor","David Jonathan Mills","Truong  Van Tuyen","Patrick Sakiusa  Fong","Ramatu M.
