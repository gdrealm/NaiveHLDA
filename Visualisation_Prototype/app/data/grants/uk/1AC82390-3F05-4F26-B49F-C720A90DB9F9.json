To achieve these goals six one-day seminars were held involving participants from the UK, Europe, North America, including academics, policy shapers and practitioners. Each of the six events focused on a different dimension of the career/migration nexus.</p>\n\n<p>Key findings:<br /><br /></p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the loss, recovery and reconstruction of career capital as pivotal in experiences of migration. Key emergent issues were: insecurity, security and their dynamic interplay</li>\n\n <li>the centrality of relationships with family (in home and host countries), compatriots, communities in migrantsâ€™ career development</li>\n\n <li>work and career as important to processes of acculturation</li>\n\n <li>the salience of emotional dimensions - often overlooked in the literature</li>\n\n <li>methodologies in research and practice: appropriateness of creative and narrative approaches for researching and supporting people in unfamiliar environments</li>\n\n <li>migration takes many forms and some styles of international working (eg weekly commuting) blur the boundaries between international and intranational moves</li>\n\n <li>individual and corporate goals frequently differ in the management of international assignees, and these discrepancies are rarely recognised, let alone resolved.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0375","grantId":"RES-451-26-0375","fundValue":"15692","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Laurie  Cohen","coPersons":["Maggie  O Neill","John  Arnold"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
