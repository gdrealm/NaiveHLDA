When conditions become more favourable, these spores can germinate and so allow bacterial cells to grow and multiply. Spores can survive in a metabolically inactive state for many years until conditions become favourable for germination. Spores are resistant to extreme temperatures, radiation, desiccation, harsh chemicals, and physical damage. The spore has a dense core containing the bacterium's genetic material; this is surrounded by many layers of protein, carbohydrate and fatty lipids arranged much like the layers of an onion. The outermost layer, know as the 'exosporium' acts like a thin, semi-porous membrane with a dense array of filaments attached in the form of a 'hairy nap'. This outer layer is important because it acts as the first point of contact between the spore and its environment, for example in an anthrax spore engulfed by a host cell; it allows spores to stick to surfaces; it is the main part of the spore recognised by the immune system; and it may have a protective role for the spore. We are attempting to understand the way the spore is constructed and how this construction endows the spore with its special biological and physical properties. In order to fully understand how the spore works we need to understand its three-dimensional structure in molecular detail. We also need to know what the molecular building blocks are and how they are put together. We propose to use an electron microscope to visualise the structure of the different layers, starting with the exosporium and working our way inwards towards the spore core. We have the advantage that many of these layers can be separated, allowing us to analyse the biochemical composition. Moreover, a number of them are partially crystalline making the molecules very much easier to visualise than would otherwise be the case. An important step in building up a three-dimensional picture of the spore will be to identify the positions of the various types of protein building block. This we will do by genetically modifying the bacterium to make spores that are missing known proteins and we will see where these are lost within the three-dimensional structure. This will also tell us in what way these particular proteins are important for the function and properties of the spore.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G004323/1","grantId":"BB/G004323/1","fundValue":"584538","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Per Andrew Bullough","coPersons":["Anne  Moir"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" Bacteria of the Bacillus cereus family form highly resistant spores, which in the case of the pathogen B. anthracis act as the agents of infection. The outermost layer, the exosporium, enveloping spores of the B. cereus family as well as a number of Clostridia, plays roles in spore adhesion, dissemination, targeting, and germination control. We have analyzed two naturally crystalline layers associated with the exosporium, one representing the &quot;basal&quot; layer to which the outermost spore layer (&quot;hairy nap&quot;) is attached, and the other likely representing a subsurface (&quot;parasporal&quot;) layer. We have used electron cryomicroscopy at a resolution of 0.8-0.6 nm and circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements to reveal a highly _-helical structure for both layers. The helices are assembled into 2D arrays of &quot;cups&quot; or &quot;crowns.&quot; High-resolution atomic force microscopy of the outermost layer showed that the open ends of these cups face the external environment and the highly immunogenic collagen-like fibrils of the hairy nap (BclA) are attached to this surface. Based on our findings, we present a molecular model for the spore surface and propose how this surface can act as a semipermeable barrier and a matrix for binding of molecules involved in defence, germination control, and other interactions of the spore with the environment. 1. Knowledge of the surface structure of spores could be exploited in the development of vehicles to present foreign proteins e.g. antigens for vaccines.\n\n\n\n2. An understanding of the adhesive properties conferred on spores by their structure may help in the development of decontamination protocols.\n\n\n\n3. An understanding of spore structure may help in the development of rapid detection protocols.
