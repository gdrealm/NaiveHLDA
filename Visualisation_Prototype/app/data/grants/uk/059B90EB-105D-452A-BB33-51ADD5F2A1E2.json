{"id":"059B90EB-105D-452A-BB33-51ADD5F2A1E2","title":"North West HTMR","abstractText":"The best method for finding out whether one treatment is better than another is to perform a research study known as a randomised controlled trial, in which treatments are allocated to patients at random, rather like throwing a dice to decide. Studies like this are not without their difficulties. For example, when drugs are first trialled, the research should proceed in stages with evaluation at each stage. As treatments move into the later phases of study, researchers must choose which outcomes are most important to measure, a decision ideally arrived at through consideration of both the clinical and patient perspective. This proposal is to create a world-class centre where issues such as these facing the clinical trials community can be investigated, the overall aim being to improve patient care by improving the evidence on which decisions about healthcare are based.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800792","grantId":"G0800792","fundValue":"2910720","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paula  Williamson","coPersons":["Patricia Anne Whitehead","Rosalind  Smyth","John  Whitehead","Ann  Jacoby","Anthony Guy Marson","Munir  Pirmohamed","Dyfrig Arwyn Hughes","Bridget  Young","Catrin  Tudur Smith","John  Neoptolemos","Peter  Bower","Carrol  Gamble"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
