{"id":"059D6447-1C26-4AC3-A0A4-58F1C1DD11BB","title":"Researching Youth Mentoring - Building Theory and Building Evidence","abstractText":"Significant numbers of new policy initiatives focused on ‘vulnerable’ or socially excluded young people have been based on the notion of mentoring – matching the young person with a single volunteer or worker who will help them to achieve his/her potential. The design of these interventions has often copied American models established to provide youngsters with role models and supporters in making successful transitions out of childhood. Such schemes, though intuitively appealing, are often poorly evaluated: we don’t know if they work, or – if they work – what it is about the complex process of mentoring that makes them effective. We understand little about how such interventions travel when translated from one cultural background to another. Inevitably perhaps, such schemes often see vulnerable young people as being ‘in deficit’ rather than focusing on their capacities and resilience.\n\n<p>This seminar series will examine how ‘mentoring’ has been translated into policy initiatives in various fields. We will look at evidence of effectiveness and at which elements of mentoring seem promising. Moreover, the seminar series will look beyond the applied policy applications, and delve deeper into the theoretical frameworks which underpin the notion of mentoring with the aim of offering a sounder theoretical base for the concept.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4172","grantId":"RES-451-25-4172","fundValue":"11199","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kate  Philip","coPersons":["Helen  Colley","Michael  Stein","Janet  Shucksmith"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
