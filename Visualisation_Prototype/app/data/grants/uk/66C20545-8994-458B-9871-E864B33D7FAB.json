Continuing exploitation and the uncertain impacts of climate change are adding further pressures on fish resources. New strategies are therefore required to assist in our management and conservation efforts. One such development will be to incorporate the extent and dynamics of spatially-associated biological differences that exist among fish stocks into stock assessment. Such information is important since most exploited fish species comprise assemblages of individuals that differ in their vital rates of growth, reproduction, migratory tendency and mortality. It therefore becomes desirable, for example, to match the level of fishing intensity to the projected rate of replenishment following harvesting, thereby reducing the probability that individual stocks will become extinct. Conserving such biological differences among stocks is also important in the maintenance of genetic diversity in wild fish populations, so endowing them with greater evolutionary potential for adapting to changes in the environment. A critical component of such work involves the testing of hypotheses relating to the relative contributions of such factors as dispersal of eggs and larvae, and behaviour of juveniles and adults in maintaining such biological differences. By integrating research efforts across each of the three major UK fisheries agencies (FRS, CEFAS, AFBI) with partners in UK Universities, a NERC Institute and an international cod expert from Denmark, we will for the first time examine the extent, patterns and stability of cod (Gadus morhua) population structuring throughout UK waters. We will employ existing (microsatellites) and new (single nucleotide polymorphisms) genetic markers to assess the extent to which individuals from different spawning groups interbreed, and will compare these indirect methods of dispersal with direct measure of fish movement taken from chemical analysis of ear-bones ('otoliths') and individuals that have been electronically 'tagged'. We will then input these data to tailored cod population models that will test the likely effects of young-stage and adult dispersal on observed patterns of stock separation, as well as simulating the likely consequences of spatially-based differences in stocks on such things as fishing effort, stock recovery and the design of marine protected areas. The proposal will represent the first opportunity for UK Universities and all three UK Fisheries agencies to work together on a problem that has to take account of the interdependence of fish stocks across large regions of UK and adjoining waters. The proposal will generate new genetic estimates of stock separation, especially in areas of uncertainty such as the Celtic and Irish Seas and the Southern North Sea and English Channel, as well as the provision of new theoretical tools (population models) than can be used to forecast the impact of continued fishing pressure and environmental change on cod populations. Moreover, the tools will provide information on the appropriate spatial scale and distribution of marine protected areas and the probable rates of stock recovery in a species that is now formally endangered and listed in the IUCN Red List (http://www.iucnredlist.org/).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F001827/1","grantId":"NE/F001827/1","fundValue":"8358","fundStart":"2008-08-12","fundEnd":"2012-07-11","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"GR  Carvalho","coPersons":["Clive James Fox"],"organisation":"Scottish Association For Marine Science","findingsText":" The latest ICES assessment of state of North Sea cod shows some overall improvement (increase in SSB). This has been picked up by the media and stakeholders as the stock recovering. Our main finding is that the 'recovery' of the North Sea stock masks distinct differences in the population trajectories of northern and central-southern components. Even if the stock as a whole continues to rebuild, this does not mean that all the historical sub-populations will be sustained. The observations and model development undertaken in this project provide a more coherent picture of how all the cod stocks and sub-stocks around the UK interact. Differences in productivity between population units in our model were linked to hydrodynamics which affect the proportion of eggs and larvae retained in areas of suitable settlement habitat18. We assumed that each population unit was homogeneous with respect to biological properties (growth in length, maturity given length, weight given length, and fecundity given weight), and did not invoke any differentiation of growth between the population units. Our analysis of the observations did not support a statistically significant difference in growth at the scale of the two population units, though other analyses indicate that there are variations at smaller spatial scales within the North Sea 12, 38. Our analysis indicates a systematic difference in maturation rate between the Dogger and Viking units, though this was dwarfed by the trend in maturity given length over the period 1980-2005. In the early 1980s, approximately 25% of 50-55cm fish were mature, but by 2000-2005 this proportion had risen to 75%, representing a 30cm reduction in the length at 50% mature. Hence we allowed for the temporal trend in maturity of both the population units in the hindcast runs.. The scenario experiments showed that differences in maturity on the scale of the temporal difference between 1980 and 2005 had a discernible effect on the productivity of the population units and hence on equilibrium abundance given fishing mortality rates. However, the effect was small compared to the impact of competition between the units.\n\n\n\nThe fact that spatial re-distribution of fishing mortality affects the relative survivorship of spatially distributed population units is, on face value, unsurprising39, 40. However, the mechanism by which this occurs in our case study is more complex than simply the re-distribution of mortality. Competition between population units at key life-history stages is by far the dominant factor and has been largely overlooked in previous model-based analyses which have focussed on the extent to which the straying between population units and differences in productivity affect the sensitivity to spatial distributions of fishing mortality 41, 42. Density dependent regulation in these models has been implemented at the level of individual population units through parameterised relationships between unit recruitment and spawning stock biomass, which take no account of the combined resource requirements of spatially overlapping units. Interaction between population units leads to marked divergence between the traditional fisheries management controls required to ensure sustainable yield, and those required to also ensure long-term persistence of diversity. Both our data analysis and the hindcast model fit indicate that cod fishing mortality rates have historically been lower in the northern North Sea compared to the shallow southern waters, which has fortuitously protected the Viking unit from depletion by a combination of lighter fishing mortality and suppressing competition from the Dogger unit. However, this situation is threatened by a shift of mixed-species demersal fishing effort into deeper water over recent years 43, 44. Spatial shifts in fishing effort within management units are not subject to any controls, since it does not lead to any change in overall fishing effort within the management unit.\n\n\n\nOur conclusions provide evidence that a revision of the geographic scales at which harvest rates are managed is required, in order to simultaneously secure sustainable yields and protect population diversity. In practice, the current harvest management regions are long-established and so enshrined in national and international legislation that any revision would be extremely difficult to negotiate. However, our genetically informed modelling scheme offers an alternative approach, by providing a means to estimate a precautionary regional harvesting rate which will ensure that all of the component population units remain at safe levels of abundance, given prognoses of the likely spatial distribution of fishing. For example, in the case of North Sea cod, our model indicates that achieving regional scale maximum equilibrium landings - often referred to as maximum sustainable yield (MSY) which is a key target for fisheries management45 - is commensurate with a regional spawning stock biomass at 20% of the un-fished state. With hydrodynamic, pelagic survival and maturity schedules applicable in 2005 this corresponds to a regional fishing mortality rate of 0.35 y-1 (Figure 14). However, if the prognosis was that the spatial distribution of fishing was likely to be 1.5-times higher in the northern North Sea than the south, then the regional harvesting rate required to ensure that the Viking unit does not fall below 20% of un-fished biomass would need to be reduced to approximately 0.2, well below that required to achieve regional MSY. Hence, our model offers a method of retaining the administrative structures associated with current fisheries management regions, but modifying the harvesting targets to strike a balance between achieving a sustainable yield and meeting commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity.
