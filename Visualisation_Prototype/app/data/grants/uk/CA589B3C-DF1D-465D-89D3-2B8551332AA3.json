However, the extent of the health gain that can be achieved by early detection and treatment of chlamydial infection remains unclear. Estimates of the numbers of complications that could be prevented in two recent UK models were based on entirely different sources of data, and neither met the requirement that they should be both internally consistent and consistent with all the data. This project will scrutinise the full range of prospective and retrospective evidence, consider potential biases in it, and reach a consensus view on its interpretation. New statistical modelling techniques will be deployed to combine information from disparate sources, adjusting for bias and using all relevant studies and routine surveys, in order to make the most accurate possible estimates of the complications of chlamydia and the potential gains from screening. While oriented to CT policy in the UK, the research will introduce an approach and scientific results that could be applied in other industrialised countries, and to other public health conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801947","grantId":"G0801947","fundValue":"205119","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"A E  Ades","coPersons":["Ian  Simms","John  Macleod","Paddy  Horner","Daniela  De Angelis","Nicky Jane Welton","Kate  Soldan"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
