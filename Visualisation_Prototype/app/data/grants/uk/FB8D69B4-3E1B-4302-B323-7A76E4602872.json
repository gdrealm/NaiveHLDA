This grant focussed on integrated Dynamic Earth Models, where plate motion history driven mantle geodynamics, building on studies of mineralogy, seismology and rheology, with impact on such important aspects as volatile cycles, core dynamics, magnetic field and dynamic topography were investigated. This study involved meetings, preparations of white-papers, and a workshop. It merged with two other scoping studies which focussed on Dynamic Topography and Rheology respectively and ultimately produced a substantial and focussed document for the Earth System Science Theme Leader. The findings were used by the Theme Action Plan Leader to formulate a Directed Programme which was ultimately selected by NERC for support. Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
