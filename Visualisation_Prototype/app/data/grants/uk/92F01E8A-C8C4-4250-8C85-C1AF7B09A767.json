Most patients try to resist these commands but feel compelled to obey, fearing the consequences if they don t. Such individuals are of great concern to clinicians and consume exceptionally high levels of services. There are no accepted treatment for this high risk group.We recently completed a pilot trial funded by the DoH of an adapted form of cognitive therapy(a talking therapy) which sucessfuly reduced compliance with the voice by encouraging the patient to see that the voice is not as powerful as they believe. In this proposed trial we compare the treatment with treatment as usual in 3 centres in the UK , using the infrastructure of the Mental Health Research Network. Over a period of 18 months we will recruit 180 individuals;our primary aim is to reduce compliance and self harm which will be monitored over 18 months.NHS and other service consumption will also be monitored .\nThis study will provide a breakthrough , evidence based treatment for this high-need group and open the way for further important work to help similar patients.The applicant has considerable experience of public dissemination of results of this kind of research through radio and TV interviews. He is also patron to RETHINK a leading UK mental health charity that actively promotes this therapy to their members and families.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500965","grantId":"G0500965","fundValue":"1108410","fundStart":"2007-09-17","fundEnd":"2012-02-16","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Max  Birchwood","coPersons":["Nicholas  Tarrier","Helen  Lester","Emmanuelle  Peters","Shon William Lewis","Linda Mary Davies","Til  Wykes","Graham  Dunn"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
