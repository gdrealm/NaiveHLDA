{"id":"A3441994-2DDD-47B1-9D62-9AD8EB044130","title":"Disorder Controlled Quantum Transport in Carbon Nanotubes","abstractText":"The proposed joint project is aimed at launching an internationally leading programme of studies of quantum transport in carbon nanotubes (CNs). In a combined effort of two groups (experimental at Exeter and theoretical at Birmingham) we want to perform systematic research into the effects of controlled disorder on the electrical properties of CNs. Investigations of these unique one-dimensional objects are rapidly expanding, although they are still underrepresented in the UK. The existing studies concentrated on either clean or dirty systems. We will study how, dependent on disorder, the metallic system is transferred either into a strongly correlated insulating state or Anderson insulator. A range of complimentary experimental techniques will be employed. The experiments will be supported by the development of the theory of one-dimensional quantum transport in the presence of disorder. We will also search for new principles of using CNs for device applications, such as a quantum switch.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D031109/1","grantId":"EP/D031109/1","fundValue":"307525","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Igor  Lerner","coPersons":["Igor  Yurkevich","Robert  Smith"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
