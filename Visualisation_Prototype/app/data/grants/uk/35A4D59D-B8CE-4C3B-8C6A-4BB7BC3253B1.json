{"id":"35A4D59D-B8CE-4C3B-8C6A-4BB7BC3253B1","title":"Emergence: Where is the Evidence?","abstractText":"Emergence is of increasing interest to scientists and philosophers as a way of characterising relationships between complex entities and their parts, relationships between the sciences, and the place of the mind in the physical world. An entity or property is emergent if it depends for its existence on other entities or properties, yet is somehow novel and distinct from them. The idea of emergence was introduced by nineteenth-century philosophers seeking to describe the problematic relationship of life and the mind to the rest of the physical world. Since the 1970s, it has also become prominent within physics as a way of understanding how complex physical systems can display new and surprising kinds of behaviour.\n\nOne can distinguish between weak and strong emergence. Weak emergence is uncontroversial, because it concerns knowledge of the world, or our description of it: a property is emergent if its existence is surprising, or could not be predicted, or if describing it requires the application of new concepts. Strong emergence, which is far more controversial, involves novelty in the world itself: new properties or objects, laws or causal powers. An emergent property's new causal powers might be exerted on the very properties from which it emerges (this is 'downward causation'). Strong emergence is controversial because it appears to conflict with principles of the causal completeness of the physical (CCP). If CCP is true, then an entity or property can exert causal influence in the physical world only if it itself is (in some sense) physical. Moreover, downward causation could not exist.\n\nThe project workshops will bring philosophers and scientists together to discuss four key groups of questions about strong emergence and the possibility of downward causation.\n\n1. Where is the evidence for CCP? Can it be found in physics itself, or in the explanatory relationships between physics and other sciences, such as chemistry and biology? Many philosophers assume that such evidence can be found, but far fewer actively seek it out.\n\n2. What is the best way to understand human agency? Can the mind both emerge from the physical, and also exert causal influence over it?\n\n3. How well do physicists' candidate cases of emergence, such as phase transitions and symmetry breaking, fit philosophers' conceptions of emergence?\n\n4. Do biological and social systems provide examples of strong emergence?\n\nAlthough scientists and philosophers both use the term 'emergence,' communication between them is hampered by the different meanings they attach to it. Debate between philosophers is also hampered by the differing presuppositions (such as CCP) that underlie the entrenched positions of emergentists and their opponents. In this project we aim to relate philosophers' and scientists' conceptions of emergence, and to expose the presuppositions of different sides of the emergence debates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M006395/1","grantId":"AH/M006395/1","fundValue":"25077","fundStart":"2014-12-15","fundEnd":"2015-12-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sophie Catherine Gibb","coPersons":["Robin  Hendry"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
