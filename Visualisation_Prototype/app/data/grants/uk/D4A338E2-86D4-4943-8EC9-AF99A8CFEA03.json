{"id":"D4A338E2-86D4-4943-8EC9-AF99A8CFEA03","title":"Secure Data Service extension","abstractText":"<p>The Secure Data Service (SDS) extension will build on the experience of the SDS pilot to permit controlled access by the academic community to data deemed too sensitive, confidential or potentially disclosive to be made available through other means. The service will provide secure remote access to data held on the central secure server located at the UK Data Archive.&nbsp; It will allow academics unprecedented access to valuable data for research from their home institutions, with all of the necessary safeguards to ensure that data are held, accessed and handled absolutely securely. </p>\n\n<p>The Service will provide access to highly detailed data from largescale ESRC-funded longitudinal data collections, and from late 2010 will provide access to business microdata and detailed social surveys from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), data previously only available at the ONS's Virtual Microdata Laboratory (VML). Different access modalities may apply to different datasets, enabling access either from an academic user's JANET-connected computer, or from a secure room at their home institutions. Users must be approved and trained, and accept the terms and conditions of use (including the breaches penalties), prior to using the service. Further information can be found at the Secure Data Service website. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-232-25-0002-01","grantId":"RES-232-25-0002-01","fundValue":"1666640","fundStart":"2010-02-15","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Melanie  Wright","coPersons":["Matthew  Woollard"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
