Exploiting the newly commissioned Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the LHC will bring greatly enhanced understanding of the 'Standard Model' of particle physics, particularly in the area of heavy-quark physics, searching for as yet undiscovered gauge bosons and supersymmetric particles, and ultimately shedding light on the mysterious 'Higgs' boson which is connected with the origins of mass. The experimental work on to producing a narrow beam of muons is an essential precursor to building intense beams of these particles which will be used, by their decay in flight, to provide intense beams of neutrinos to be detected in large (million tonne) detector systems. Studying in detail the properties of neutrinos will illuminate the matter/anti-matter asymmetry of our universe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H000925/2","grantId":"ST/H000925/2","fundValue":"154226","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Robert Hobson","coPersons":["Malcolm  Ellis","AM  Khan","David Ryan Smith","Roger  Powell","Paul  Kyberd","Liliana  Teodorescu","Dawn Elizabeth Leslie","Joanne Elise  Cole"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
