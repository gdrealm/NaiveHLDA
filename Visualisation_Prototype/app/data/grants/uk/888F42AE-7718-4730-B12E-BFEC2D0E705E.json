Exposure to UV-B wavelengths (280-315 nm) has numerous effects on plants, including changes in metabolism and development. Importantly, UV-B stimulates responses in plants that protect them against the potentially damaging consequences of UV-B exposure. The effects of UV-B are due to its ability to regulate the expression of numerous plant genes, including those involved in UV-protection, biosynthesis and chloroplast function. However, little is known about how UV-B is perceived by plants and how it initiates responses. The first component involved in these processes has been identified, a protein called UVR8. UVR8 acts as a photoreceptor to detect UV-B light. UVR8 interacts with another protein, COP1, to initiate responses to UV-B in plants. The aim of this project is to enhance understanding of the processes through which UVR8 and COP1 function to regulate plant responses. Establishing the molecular mechanisms of plant UV-B perception will help us to understand how UV-B regulates aspects of plant growth and development and how plants survive in sunlight.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J008494/1","grantId":"BB/J008494/1","fundValue":"409227","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth Islwyn  Jenkins","coPersons":["John MacKie Christie"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
