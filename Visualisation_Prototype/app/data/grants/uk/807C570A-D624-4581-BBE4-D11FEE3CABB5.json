{"id":"807C570A-D624-4581-BBE4-D11FEE3CABB5","title":"Custom CMOS design for cardiac imaging","abstractText":"Scientific cameras are general purpose devices that are not well suited to specialized imaging tasks. The proposal is based on combining expertise from engineering and cardiac life science groups to create bespoke custom solutions for specific experimental problems that are difficult to answer using current technology. By allowing researchers to generate specific, targeted data for each experiment, custom cameras will vastly increase the quality and quantity of data gained. In addition, custom cameras have the potential to reduce the number of animals used per study, as less experiments will be required to validate hypotheses. During the course of the project, the applicants will evaluate novel camera designs that i) match heart cell dimensions, allowing direct measurement of cell mechanics and activity, ii) measure two experimentally important cardiac parameters simultaneously at and at high speeds, and iii) simultaneously measure fine structural detail and low resolution high speed activation patterns to relate structure and function. The project aims to both validate the approach of making a custom detectors on a per experimental study basis, as well as provide software and tools for other research labs to so.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902246","grantId":"G0902246","fundValue":"99146","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gil  Bub","coPersons":["Mark Charles Pitter","Roger  Light"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
