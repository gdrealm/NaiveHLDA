This finding has led to elegantly simple theoretical models for economic walking and running. These models have inspired technological advances such as the fastest running tracks, the most economic bipedal robots, and simple prosthetics devices, including the Cheetah Flex-Foot worn by track athlete Oscar Pistorious. Despite these advances, the design of prosthetics that can move with both stability and economy over uneven terrain remains a challenge. Walking and running in natural terrain requires frequent adjustment for bumps, steps, holes and obstacles. Yet, current prosthetic devices for human locomotion perform poorly over uneven terrain. Although the flex-foot prosthetic worn by Oscar Pistorious provides high economy, allowing him to run long distances, it does not adjust for variations in terrain such as kerbs or stairs. Advances such as motorised prosthetic devices can improve mobility in uneven terrain, but currently have limited use because they consume too much energy and run out of battery power quickly. New prosthetics and other mobility aids that perform well in varied terrain could vastly improve quality of life for those with limited mobility, including amputees and ageing individuals at risk for falls. In comparison to these technologies, humans and birds achieve remarkable stability and economy of movement in varied terrain. However, we understand very little about how they accomplish this. Current models of walking and running are based mostly on studies of movement over completely smooth, uniform terrain (such as a track or treadmill), which rarely exist in nature. It has long been supposed that a trade-off exists between economy and stability of locomotion. This idea has never been tested because so little research exists on stability of walking and running. This project will address this problem by by comparing stabilising strategies and energy cost of locomotion among six species of ground birds. We will measure mechanics, stability and energetic cost as birds walk and run over uneven terrain conditions. This will reveal how bipeds choose among different movement strategies depending on terrain condition, speed and gait. Ground birds are ideal study animals for this research because they are diverse bipedal athletes, live in broad range of habitats, and span a large size range: from quail under 100 grams to ostrich over 100 kilograms. Through study of ground birds, this project will develop simple models for stable bipedal locomotion that apply to a broad range of animals and terrain conditions. The models will reveal basic principles for stability and economy that could directly impact upon the design of prosthetics, orthotics and legged robots. One important observation is that small birds walk and run with a crouched, bent-leg posture, and large birds move with a relatively straight-leg posture. The difference in leg posture and anatomy likely reflects greater adaptation for stability in small birds and economy in large birds. For small and large animals moving in the same terrain, any change in terrain height will be a larger fraction of a small animal's leg length. Consequently, the world is a relatively 'rough' place for small animals, requiring robust stability. This project will compare stability strategies used by small and large birds and determine whether small birds are more stable. This research will reveal how bipeds walk and run over uneven terrain without falls or injury. Mobility without falls and injury is particularly important for the wellbeing of ageing and gait impaired individuals. The findings are likely to have high impact in these areas, inspiring innovation in human fall prevention, gait rehabilitation, and the design of prosthetics, orthotics and other mobility assistance devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H005838/1","grantId":"BB/H005838/1","fundValue":"462892","fundStart":"2010-05-31","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have led to robotics applications through a new collaboration with engineers at Oregon State University, and we have had impact through education and media activities, demonstrating to school students and the public how biological research can lead to novel engineering solutions.
