{"id":"63ED3968-AF79-4182-BB92-6E2C76BB7190","title":"Oxidant and particle photochemical processes above a South-East Asian tropical rain forest (OP3-Danum-08)","abstractText":"In this project we will integrate ground-based and airborne field measurements of surface fluxes and atmospheric composition of reactive trace gases and particles with modelling studies of chemical processes in a protected forest area of Sabah, East Malaysia, to better understand how a south-east Asian rain forest contributes to the formation of ozone and particles in the lower atmosphere. We will do this using a Consortium of eight of the leading members of the UK's Distributed Institute for Atmospheric Composition, utilising the UK's Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurement's BAe 146 research aircraft, the resources of the UK's University Facility for Atmospheric Measurements, the Malaysian Meteorological Service's Global Atmospheric Watch station at Bukit Atur, Sabah, Malaysia, and the Royal Society of London-supported Danum Valley Field Centre. We will bring significant added-value to NERC resources by the active participation of international collaborators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D002060/1","grantId":"NE/D002060/1","fundValue":"190380","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Charles Nicholas Hewitt","coPersons":["Dwayne Ellis Heard","Brian Matthew Davison","Hans Friedrich Graf","Martin William Gallagher","Mathew John Evans","Nicola  Carslaw","Brian James Bandy","Claire  Reeves","Alastair  Lewis","A.
