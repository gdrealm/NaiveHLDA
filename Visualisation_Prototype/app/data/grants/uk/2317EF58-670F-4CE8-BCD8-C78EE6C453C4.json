{"id":"2317EF58-670F-4CE8-BCD8-C78EE6C453C4","title":"The Corporation: A Critical, Multidisciplinary Project","abstractText":"<p>In the contemporary academy, the nature of the corporation and its role in the global, and local, political economy is analysed from various different disciplinary perspectives. The problem is that each discipline constructs its own, partial picture of the corporation. Significant gaps and blind spots exist, as well as discipline-specific biases that skew the picture of the corporation.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this seminar series is to bring together experts on the corporation from law, management studies, economics, political science, anthropology and sociology/criminology and beyond. We will also invite people from practice, such as labour union organisers, NGO activists, policymakers and others. Together we aim to construct a comprehensive, and complete picture of the corporation in its local and global context.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This will lead to new perspectives on many of the most pressing issues in today's 'corporate' world. For example, on the nature and uses of corporate power on the global level, the ideological construction of the corporation as an agent of legitimate authority in global governance&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\"></a>and the challenges of regulating or governing transnational corporate groups - between global and local worker, community and class interests. The seminar series will generate collaborative action and concrete change.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000687/1","grantId":"ES/L000687/1","fundValue":"19038","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Collaboration with Harvard IGLP on Corporation &amp;amp; Global Society group - co-hosting Corporate Power Conference at Harvard, and co-hosting Pro-Seminars on the Role of Law in Global Production Networks.
