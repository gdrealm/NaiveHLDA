Even in the absence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, ageing involves a loss of brain matter that starts in young adulthood and accelerates around mid-life. These brain changes are paired with changes in thought-related, mental abilities, such as memory, attention, planning, and motor action, generally termed &quot;cognitive&quot; abilities. While we know a great deal about how these age-related brain changes map onto changes in cognitive abilities, less is known about how they impact our emotional wellbeing. However, there is overlap in the brain systems involved in some of these cognitive abilities and those involved in dealing with emotions appropriately. \n\nIf these brain systems deteriorate with age, then do older adults deal with emotional situations less well, or do they use different brain systems to maintain wellbeing and happiness in daily life? Large survey studies have reported an increase in positive emotion with age, with some psychologists suggesting an improvement in the skills to regulate one's emotions. We have also learned from prior research that individuals differ in the extent to which their cognitive abilities change with advancing age. What has not to date been studied is how these age-related individual differences in cognitive ability associated with differences in the structure of the brain affect our ability to appropriately regulate emotion. \n\nThe aim of this research is to identify how emotion regulatory ability in middle- to older-aged individuals, who vary in the extent to which their cognitive ability has changed in recent years, is impacted by age-related brain changes and how the neural circuitry may adapt to compensate for brain matter loss. We will further test how cognitive and emotion regulatory ability relate to happiness and wellbeing in daily life. We will ask 70 volunteer members aged 55 - 85 who are part of the University of Reading's Older Adult Research Panel to participate in our study, half of whom have experienced a decline in cognitive ability measured over the previous 3 visits, and half whose cognitive ability has remained stable. Twenty younger adults will also be recruited to control for age differences in emotion regulation in the absence of cognitive decline or brain matter loss. \n\nUsing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), we will obtain structural brain scans, as well as a functional scan while performing an emotion regulation task. Physiological and behavioural measures will be used to assess emotional responses. Cognitive tests will be performed outside the scanner, and participants will be asked to report their wellbeing and provide saliva samples to quantify daily fluctuations in the stress hormone cortisol. Employing the latest analysis techniques combining brain imaging data with other measures, we will assess the extent to which individuals who have experienced brain matter loss compensate by activating their brains differently when regulating emotion. We will examine the relationship between the ability to regulate emotion, even in the face of decline in cognitive ability and brain matter, and healthy diurnal cortisol pattern and self-reported wellbeing. This research forms the building blocks to understanding how older adults can successfully adapt to stressful events by effectively regulating their emotions, and will directly inform the design of intervention programmes to promote lifelong wellbeing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J009539/1","grantId":"BB/J009539/1","fundValue":"373502","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings obtained thus far in this on-going research project have informed the research community at this stage.
