This then provided an opportunity for more detailed case studies (Sheffield; Barnsley Doncaster and Rotherham; Hull and East Riding; and North Yorkshire and York) to explore the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to waste planning.</p>\n\n<p>The research revealed that in many cases the plan making process was not being speeded up, and stakeholder integration was mixed, with private sector actors feeling their perspectives were more understood and accepted, whilst amongst the public, except for the usual environmental pressure groups the process failed to capture the imagination of the wider public.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-623-26-0004","grantId":"RES-623-26-0004","fundValue":"565","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David Paul Shaw","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
