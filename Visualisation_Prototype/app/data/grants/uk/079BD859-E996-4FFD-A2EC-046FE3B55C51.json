Hitherto most social science research methods have been taught in dedicated methods modules. Whilst a number of pedagogic techniques are used to enhance the effectiveness of teaching, these modules are often seen by students as necessary, but disconnected from substantive subject modules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The research aims to test whether embedding QM produces a more relevant link between theory, evidence and analysis.The research will take place at Cardiff University and Plymouth University and will use a quasi experimental methodology, whereby a second level module from each university will be chosen as an ‘experimental’ group and those students in the year cohort not taking these modules will constitute the ‘control’ group.</p>\n\n<p>Students in both the experimental and control groups will be surveyed on their views and experience of QM both before the modules commence and at their end and the results over time and between groups will be compared.

One second-level module in each university was chosen as the experimental modules and the year groups not taking the modules constituted the control group. An online questionnaire was administered, at the beginning of the second semester of 2012, to both the control and experimental groups and repeated at the end of the semester, thus permitting measurement of attitudinal change and knowledge/ confidence in quantitative methods in both groups. \n\nThis was a 'one shot' experiment, as much concerned with the process of embedding, with results more indicative than conclusive. Between time t1 and t2 students in the experimental group who were less likely to be distrustful of statistics than the control group, they were also more positive about the role in statistics in understanding social research compared to the control group, which became more negative in attitude. Yet, the experimental group had increased preference for essay writing over statistical work and at the end of the study were less confident about their statistical abilities.\n\nKey Findings\n1. Measuring the effect of the intervention. The experimental group were less likely to be distrustful of statistics than the control group, although the latter also saw a modest increase in levels of trust. The experimental group were also more positive about the role in statistics in understanding social research compared to the control group whose attitudes become more negative. \n2. Changes in perceived ability were complex, with improvements over time in both control and experimental groups. Those in the experimental did report less difficulty in some items, after the intervention, but this may be due to a selection effect, in so far as those in the experimental group reported at t1 that they found some concepts easier than did those in the control group.\n\n3. Pre-test comparisons with the findings of the 2007 study of sociology students. Pre-test results from Cardiff and Plymouth showed that, despite some improvement in attitudes between the two studies, the data indicated that 76.8% of the students sampled in the 2012 pre-intervention survey would rather write an essay than use statistics, an increase of 12.8% from the 2007 study. Despite investment in these universities there was evidence of increased student hesitancy to engage with statistical assessment.\n\nSince the research was undertaken, the Cardiff Q-Step Centre was established and a programme of the embedding of quantitative methods, in substantive modules is underway. Because this practice is now being mainstreamed, richer comparative data will become available that will allow us to further test the validity of the original findings. Embedding is also being undertaken in other Q-Step centres, in particular Manchester University. 'One shot' experiments can only provide indicative data, however with other universities beginning to embed quantitative methods in substantive modules, it will be possible to assess whether this works generally and what might be the possibilities and barriers to further embedding. Q-Step staff have given a number of talks outlining our experience in embedding and we will work alongside other universities to further develop pedagogy. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
