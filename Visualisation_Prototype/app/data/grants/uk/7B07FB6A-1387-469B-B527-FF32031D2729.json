AB represents a very promising hydrogen storage material (19.6 wt % hydrogen), the exploitation of which will be significantly advanced by the application of two complementary approaches, based around either stoichiometric or catalytic exploitation of metal reagents: (i) chemical modification designed to disrupt the framework of dihydrogen bonding in the solid state and thereby facilitate more facile and complete evolution of H2; and (ii) transition metal catalysis of AB dehydrogenation, focussing in particular on the elucidation of mechanistic information, thereby allowing for the rational design of more efficient catalyst systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F01600X/1","grantId":"EP/F01600X/1","fundValue":"518031","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings from this work have been utilised in developing new methods for the synthesis of key types of intermediate relevant to chemical manufacture Chemicals Economic","person":"Simon  Aldridge","coPersons":["Peter  Edwards","Martin Owen Jones"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" Reactions of saturated and unsaturated organic molecules with boron-containing reagents represent a very powerful\nand versatile range of methodologies for the introduction of functionality into organic substrates, which have been widely\nexploited, e.g. in the syntheses of pharmaceuticals, natural products and functional materials. this research has developed new methodologies for carrying out the synthesis of these key intermediates Initially through academic dissemination and use of methodologies by others in synthesis; in the medium term - within fine chemical synthesis Chemicals","dataset":"gtr"}
