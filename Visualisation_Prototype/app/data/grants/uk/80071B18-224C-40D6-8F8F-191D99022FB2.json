Complex organisms such as humans are composed of trillions of cells, whereas simple organisms may consist of just a few hundred cells. During development from egg to adult, cells of all metazoan organisms therefore need to divide, or proliferate, in order to increase in number. However, it is equally as important that cells stop proliferating at the appropriate time and differentiate (take on specialised roles appropriate to their individual circumstances of position, ancestory and timing). Proliferation and differentiation therefore need to be in perfect balance to ensure that tissues and organs develop with the correct size and functionality. Stem cells have particularly important properties. They have the ability to self-renew (make more of themselves) as well as give rise to daughters that differentiate. They do this by dividing asymmetrically: one daughter cell retains the stem cell fate of further proliferation, whereas the other daughter stops dividing in order to differentiate. Stem cells can also sometimes divide symmetrically, with both daughters retaining the ability to proliferate further, helping to expand the number of progenitor cells for particular purposes. Stem cells sometimes retain the ability to proliferate throughout the lifetime of the organism in order to generate (and sometimes re-generate) particular tissues and organs. For example, hematopoietic stem cells generate blood cells throughout the lifetime of many organisms, and epidermal stem cells constantly generate new skin cells. Stem cell divisions must therefore be very tightly controlled, so that the conflicting demands of proliferation vs. differentiation are correctly balanced. Understanding how stem cell divisions are controlled is crucial to 21st century biological research because it may be possible to harness these cells in order to produce any required cell type on demand, for example new spinal cord neurons for patients with spinal injury. It is also thought that stem cells are at the heart of carcinogenesis. However, we have much to understand about the basic biology of stem cells before potential therapies can become routine. All properties of cells are ultimately under genetic control, which dictates that the appropriate RNA and protein molecules are produced at the correct time and place. Human development is an incredibly complicated process, involving trillions of cells and many thousands of genes, therefore before we can begin to understand human development and human stem cells, we need to investigate a simpler system. This is where the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans comes in. Many of the genes that are important for C. elegans development are remarkably similar to human genes, therefore studying C. elegans development will ultimately shed light on the biology of higher animals including humans. C. elegans have cells called seam cells. These are stem cells, in that they divide throughout development to give rise to more stem cells, as well as daughters that differentiate by becoming skin cells and neurons. Our aim is to understand which genes are important for controlling the correct pattern of seam cell divisions. Previously, we have isolated two genes, rnt-1 and bro-1, as being important for this process. Strikingly, the human counterparts of both these genes, Runx and CBFb, are also involved in stem cell development, including haematopoietic and epidermal stem cells. This means we are studying a conserved process, and lessons gained from studying the problem in C. elegans are very likely to be applicable to higher organisms including humans. In this proposal, we are seeking to understand more about how rnt-1 and bro-1 control seam cell divisions, and also to isolate new genes involved in this process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G018448/1","grantId":"BB/G018448/1","fundValue":"466123","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Key findings have been published, or are in the process of being published, therefore have contributed to the UK (and International) knowledge economy.\n\nThe pal-1 project is being continued by a BBSRC funded graduate student in the lab who has made very interesting progress on the embryonic role of this gene.\n\nWe have observed expression of rnt-1 in intestinal nuclei using some reporters and have found that it is stabilised during stress or starvation. This is very interesting because we have previously observed that rnt-1 mutants fail to recover properly from starvation, suggesting a possible role for rnt-1 in the starvation response. These observations are intriguing, given that Runx3 expression in mammalian intestinal cells may be similarly linked with stress/infection, and Runx3 mutations are strongly associated with gastric cancers. This work is now being followed-up in the lab.\n\nThe bro-1 enhancer is being studied by another group interested in the molecular details of enhancer function, therefore this work has catalysed other research.

This control prevents premature cell cycle re-entry, and acts in parallel to the alternative let-7 miRNA family target hbl-1, with rnt-1 working in the seam cells and hbl-1 working in the surrounding hypodermis.\n\n2) Investigation of rnt-1/bro-1 cis-regulatory architecture\n\nUsing a 1-hybrid screen we identified the GATA factor ELT-1 as being a direct upstream regulator of bro-1. Further analysis revealed that bro-1 has dual roles in regulating seam cell divisions, both promoting proliferation by directly activating bro-1, and preventing inappropriate differentiation by regulating the fusogen eff-1. \n\n3) ) RNAi screen for rnt-1/bro-1 synthetic lethals\n\nSeveral interesting synthetic lethal genes were isolated in our screen, including the Meis homologue unc-62 and the caudal/cdx homologue pal-1. peer-reviewed academic publication, further funding, dissemination to the wider scientific (and non-scientific) sector Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
