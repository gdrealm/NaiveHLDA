{"id":"BDA8AB7A-64B8-4E15-AC94-6EC4E81D9A86","title":"Encoding and retrieval processes in short-term memory: The role of similarity","abstractText":"<p>The project addresses the role of similarity in short-term memory or, as it is called today, working memory. Most research agrees that similarity is bad for short-term recall of information; for example, remembering the order of words that sound the same (eg, “cap”, “map”, “trap”) is harder than remembering dissimilar sounding words (eg, “tree”, “desk”, “ball”). This is usually seen as resulting from confusions of similar items at recall (for example, “cap” is recalled instead of “map”). </p>\n\n<p>The current project tests an alternative view, according to which similar items are encoded differently from dissimilar items; for example, a theory we have proposed states that items similar to current working memory contents will not be stored to the same extent as items that are not similar to current working memory contents. We also investigate effects of similarity when recalling items that go beyond mere confusion. For example, one suggestion is that items that have been recalled have their availability reduced, to prevent people from recalling the same item over and over again. </p>\n\n<p>One question we will address is whether the mechanism responsible for this reduction in availability extends to items that are similar to recalled items, but were not themselves recalled.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1665","grantId":"RES-000-22-1665","fundValue":"41155","fundStart":"2006-03-15","fundEnd":"2007-03-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Farrell","coPersons":["Klaus  Oberauer"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
