Current treatments attempt to prevent the action of the androgen receptor, a protein that drives prostate cancer growth. Unfortunately, these treatments are not effective in the long-term and the generation of disease that no longer responds to this therapy, termed hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), is common and often fatal. Therefore, the key goal for researchers is to develop new drugs that can be used to treat this disease.\n\nThe androgen receptor remains an important driving force in the development of HRPC and therefore the generation of new agents that can permanently block it?s function are necessary to effectively treat the disease. \n\nThis project will study the effect of a new panel of drugs that can inactivate the androgen receptor in several model systems of HRPC. These studies will provide important information regarding the effect of these agents on androgen receptor action and growth of prostate cancer cells. Ultimately, this work will be important for determining the effectiveness of these drugs as future therapies for prostate cancer treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800889","grantId":"G0800889","fundValue":"409180","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Craig Nigel Robson","coPersons":["Sarah  Loddick","Nigel  Brooks","Luke  Gaughan"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
