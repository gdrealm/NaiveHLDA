There is a vaccine to prevent spread, but this is of no use to the 400 million people estimated to already be chronically infected. There are now a number of drugs available to treat hepatitis B infection but these typically only suppress the virus rather than clear it; when the patient stops the treatment the virus level comes back up. There is no effective drug therapy for the end-stage complications of liver failure and liver cancer.\nThe goal of the work proposed here is to allow us to develop a type of treatment to safely boost immune control of hepatitis B virus infection. We would like to harness the natural ability of a component of the immune system called T cells to control this virus. There are very few of the right type of T cells left in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, so we will genetically engineer the patients? T cells to regain the ability to fight against hepatitis B virus. This proposal aims to look into how effective these genetically engineered T cells will be at combatting hepatitis B virus when it is in the liver, by mimicking this situation in a test tube and in a mouse model. Our findings will provide essential information for the future application of this approach to hepatitis and other chronic infections and tumours.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901374","grantId":"G0901374","fundValue":"169462","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mala Kunti Maini","coPersons":["Graham Russell Foster","Hans  Stauss"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
