The progressive decline with age of the immune system - immunosenescence - is the primary underlying cause of the age-related increase in this susceptibility. Despite decades of research, important gaps remain in our understanding of the fundamental nature of the process, as well as in our practical ability to protect older adults against infectious diseases. Some of the key gaps in knowledge result from the insufficient integration of the available models in which to research immunosenescence, and incomplete validation of the relevance of obtained data to the human aging. Specifically, the two most popular and most relevant models - the (immuno)genetically versatile and easily manipulated mouse model; and the ethically much more complex and experimentally limited, but physiologically supremely relevant human model, have provided data that is insufficiently compatible with one another thus far. This proposal seeks to reduce this gap by taking advantage of the newly developed human model by one of the co-applicants, to study memory T cell response in the skin of healthy young and old donors. Our recent human studies had identified a significant defect in the ability of old subjects to mount an eficient immune response in the skin. However this is not a global deect as the white cells from the blood of the same individuals can respond to the same microbial product that was injected in the skin. However the actual manipulation of the cells that are defective in the skin cannot be performed in humans due to ethical constraints. Furthermore, it is not possible to test whether we can enhance the responses of these cells by directly targeting cell surface activatory receptors (Toll receptors) on the cell that is defective called macrophagethe in vivo. We propose to further develop in depth this model in humans and to broaden, enhance and complement the data generated by the parallel use of mechanistic studies in the aged mouse model of skin immunity that will be performed in close partnership with Dr. Janko Nikolich-Zugich at the University of Arizona. Thus we will develop he same skin challenge experimental system in the mouse that we can manipulate to attempt to boost immunity in he skin in old animals. During the preparation of this proposal, Dr Akbar had visited Tucson in late November, 2008, and Dr. Nikolich travelled to London in February 2009 to organize the aims and strategy for this application. From the intense discussions and joint efforts, we have developed a synergistic experimental strategy, whereby incisive, cutting-edge studies in humans will be linked to parallel investigations in mice to enable the manipulation of the ageing immune system in vivo to determine if we can reverse the cutaneous defect in cutaqneous immunity that develops during ageing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H020519/1","grantId":"BB/H020519/1","fundValue":"529554","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Arne Nalpon Akbar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" The key aim of the grant was to determine whether there were any similarities between current models of mouse and human antigen-specific cutaneous responses. Our studies show current mouse models that have been used do not reflect the human DTH model. Nevertheless we found prelimiary data that suggests that other murine models may be more representative of human immunity.\n\n\n\n1.In humans, we have found that cutaneous delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to recall antigens are significantly decreased in older individuals. This is not due to a change in T cells in terms of their capacity for migration. Instead, there is defective activation of dermal blood vessels in older subject which prevents memory T cell entry into the skin after antigen challenge. This is due to the lack of inflammatory mediators (such as TNF-alpha) in the old skin.\n\n2. Once isolated cutaneous macrophages can be induced to secrete TNF-alpha after stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 or TLR 4 ligands in vitro; This indicates that the defect in their ability to activate the endothelium is reversible.Therefore the lack of macrophage activation is not characteristic of macrophages themselves but is possibly a consequence of the changes in the skin milieu in old individuals and/ or lack of early activating signals which come from another cell types and then fail to become amplified. \n\n3. There is no difference in the number or positioning of CD4 cells and macrophages or DCs in the old skin. The only difference observed is the increased proportion of CD4 cells expresisng Foxp3 which have regulatory function. The capacity of skin resident T cells from the old skin to respond to mitogens appears to be uneffected. We are currenlty examining their capacity to respond to recall antigens.
