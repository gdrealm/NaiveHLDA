{"id":"94F0BEA0-88F8-48E1-AD60-10D9808B5CD4","title":"The Arabidopsis.info germplasm service (NASC: V)","abstractText":"The Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC) is a National and International Capability Resource that has been running successfully for over 20 years. From small beginnings with only 200 seed stocks in 1991, NASC now has over 800,000 stocks and sends out materials to researchers worldwide (over 120,000 tubes in 2010 alone). \n\nOur users are a broad spectrum of scientists and educators who use these germplasm resources as key materials in their research. These range from insights into global food security to the development of biofuels; and from basic fundamental questions about plant growth and development to models for breeding and education. Arabidopsis has led (and in some cases driven) the development of new fields such as systems biology and sequencing based eco-genomics in plants. \n\nNASC is a reference library and acts (with its sister centre in Ohio) as the word's largest, most accessible collection of academic seed germplasm for any single species. Stocks arrive at NASC as tens of thousands of donations every year from all over the academic world. These are preserved in specialist seed storage facilities dedicated to the long-term storage and conservation of seeds. Our dedicated technicians receive these donations, store and regenerate low volume donations; and then process orders placed through our on-line user-friendly catalogue. \n\nFor the last ten years we have charged all users a nominal fee per stock in order to demonstrate a willingness to supplement our grant with cost recovery income. This has been used to employ temporary workers within NASC to (more than) match staff numbers on the grant. It also means that our UK funding is partly matched by substantial direct charging of foreign users.\n\nThis application asks for funds for primarily technical staff salaries largely in order to maintain the status quo of a very successful genetic resource unit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J018961/1","grantId":"BB/J018961/1","fundValue":"824299","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sean Tobias May","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
