{"id":"DE40E8D5-3EE8-421B-B8F4-3C844C9A3E37","title":"Balthasar: A Fundamental Critique","abstractText":"Hans Urs von Balthasar was an enormously erudite and immensely prolific writer: his corpus is large, and ranges unusually widely and freely among theological, philosophical and literary sources. I will offer a fundamental characterization and critique of Balthasar, not by attempting an exhaustive survey, but by examining fundamental and repeated patterns in his thought, analysing the way in which he argues, and teasing out unarticulated assumptions about his own standpoint in relation to his material. What such an approach is able to bring to light is that Balthasar consistently but implictly presupposes a God's eye point of view, and that this sets up a serious tension between the performance of his theology and its content. Case studies focused on particular themes in Balthasar's thought (gender and the doctrine of the Trinity) will illustrate the problem working itself out in concrete ways. Finally, the claim that there is something distinctly problematic in Balthasar's approach will be both sharpened and strengthened by a comparison with the method of three other theologians/Thomas Aquinas, Karl Barth and Karl Rahner.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E001157/1","grantId":"AH/E001157/1","fundValue":"24449","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Kilby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
