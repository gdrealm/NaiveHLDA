The specific research questions are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>What is the degree and nature of overlap between the various deeply socially excluded groups that may also experience homelessness?</li>\n\n <li>What is the view of those affected by MEH about the relative importance of the different difficulties they face?</li>\n\n <li>To what extent are there similar or different 'routes in' to specific manifestations of MEH?</li>\n\n <li>What is the role of material deprivation in generating MEH?</li>\n\n <li>What role is played by social and psychological factors in generating MEH?</li>\n\n <li>Does the nature of MEH vary geographically?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research comprises a multi-stage, quantitative survey in six research locations across the UK. The first stage will involve drawing a representative sample of 'low threshold' services working with people experiencing deep social exclusion in each of these research locations. The second stage will comprise a 'census' self-completion survey of users of these services over a two-week time window. The third stage will be to conduct follow-up extended interviews with 400 respondents who have experienced MEH. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-188-25-0023-A","grantId":"RES-188-25-0023-A","fundValue":"45252","fundStart":"2010-07-02","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This study provided the first statistically robust analysis of routes into 'multiple exclusion homelessness' (MEH) in the UK. Its demonstration of the very high degree of overlap between homelessness and forms of 'deep exclusion' such as substance misuse, institutional living (e.g. prison) and 'street culture activities' (e.g. street drinking and begging) influenced the work of the Ministerial Working Group (MWG) on Preventing and Tackling Homelessness, established by the then Housing Minister, Grant Shapps, in 2010. Its findings, particularly those regarding the need for early intervention, are referenced extensively in the Government strategy 'Making every contact count: a joint approach to preventing homelessness', published in 2012. The study has influenced service planning for distinct subgroups of the MEH population, prompting national and local service providers to consider how best to design tailored services for each. Users of the research to date include major service providers, umbrella bodies (including the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless (FEANTSA)), and local authorities.

In adulthood, the incidence of self-harm and suicide attempts is notable \n\n\n\no Individuals who had migrated to the UK (as adults) reported less difficult family backgrounds and lower levels of support needs than the rest of the MEH population - Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
