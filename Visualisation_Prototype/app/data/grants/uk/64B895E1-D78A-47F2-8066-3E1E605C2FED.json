A recent review of the literature highlighted some of the key skill-based differences that have been reported both in regard to how performers allocate limited attention resources within the visual field and the manner in which the different components of visual system (i.e., the fovea, parafovea and periphery) are employed to capture relevant information to guide action. Of particular interest in aiming tasks is the work on the quiet eye period (QE), defined as the final fixation on the target prior to initiation of the obligatory motor response toward the target. A longer QE period, with an earlier onset of QE has been consistently reported to characterise expert performance, as well as performance outcome. During this time, it is proposed that the movement parameters for the required action are set. However, despite the plethora of research on QE, the underlying mechanisms and neural activity present during this behaviour are unknown. By increasing our knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning the effective use of vision, in particular QE, we can explore how training programmes can be designed to facilitate performance across numerous domains. The current project aims to identify the functional and neural mechanisms of QE, and how these interact with stress, specifically anxiety, and whether we can use this knowledge to expedite skill learning and modify behaviour.\n\nIn Phase One of this project, we will examine whether QE can protect against distracting stimuli, to keep the performer focused on the task-relevant cues. Subsequently, we will use brain-imaging techniques to highlight key areas of the brain that are activated during QE. We will compare gaze behaviours and neural activation between elite and sub-elite archers using an aiming task. This will enable us to identify structural differences in behaviours between skill levels. \n\nIn Phase Two of this project, we will use the same task as in Phase One, but test archers in the real-world environment. We will also manipulate anxiety via financial incentives and peer-based competition. This will enable us to identify how the mechanisms identified in Phase One are affected by stressors. By comparing between skill levels, it will enable us to identify how anxiety is mediated by expertise.\n\nIn Phase Three of this project, based on the data gathered from the previous phases, we will design and implement training interventions which aim to improve the gaze behaviours of sub-elite athletes. Specifically, we will attempt to modify QE behaviour to promote effective and efficient attention control. We will also monitor brain activation throughout the intervention to identify any neurological changes that occur as a result of training.\n\nThe project will identify the mechanisms underpinning expert performance in aiming skills and determine whether learning can be expedited through trans-magnetic simulation and behavioural modifications. Our work will highlight the neural activation during QE for the first time, enabling the development and monitoring of superior skill. Moreover, the project will improve conceptual understanding of how performance is influenced by anxiety and whether, and in what manner, any negative effects may be mediated by expertise. The knowledge generated will help refine and develop methods employed to improve perceptual and cognitive skills in other professional fields such as the military, law enforcement, emergency services, medicine/healthcare, as well as in education and training more generally.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J017248/1","grantId":"BB/J017248/1","fundValue":"210539","fundStart":"2013-06-06","fundEnd":"2016-06-05","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael James Grey","coPersons":["Rowland Christopher Miall"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
