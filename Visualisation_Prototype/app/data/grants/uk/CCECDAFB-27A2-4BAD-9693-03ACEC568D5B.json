They are an important part of the modern marine ecosystem, but also have a long fossil record (nannofossils) stretching back 225 million years (Triassic). Both living and fossil coccolithophores provide valuable information about ocean environments and changing climate. The fossils also provide a simple and quick means of age-dating the rocks in which they are found. For these reasons, coccolithophores are of interest to a very wide range of scientists, including marine biologists, palaeoceanographers and geologists (stratigraphers). The effective use of coccolithophores is dependent upon the availability of up to date and reliable information concerning their classification (taxonomy - which species is which, and why?), their ecology (which species live where, when and why?) and their geological history (which species lived when and where?). However, this information is frequently difficult to find because it is dispersed throughout specialist publications. In order to widen access to this crucial information, we have started work on a web resource called Nannotax (www.nannotax.org) that we hope will become the online reference source for anyone needing to obtain basic to specialist information on coccolithophores and nannofossils. Our pilot version focused on the relatively recent, Neogene, fossil record (0-23 million years ago) and has already proved popular, registering 670,000 page views and 275 registered users. We now aim to build on this, and will add more species (the older fossil record, plus all the living species), add more types of data (age, ecology and, where appropriate, biology), expand the content (glossary, guides to identification and methods of study) and bring the site to the attention of those who will most benefit from it. The end-product Nannotax website will provide a complete listing of living and fossil coccolithophore and nannofossil taxa, with short descriptions, age data, multiple illustrations, bibliographic references and original descriptions. There will be identification keys and linked pages providing information on study methods. In parallel, we will provide hands-on training in the use and potential of the system, and respond to requests from those who have 'test-driven' the system at workshops and conferences. We think that the development of this system is essential to the hydrocarbon industry and to academics and educators involved in nannoplankton research, training and learning. By removing the barriers to learning nannoplankton taxonomy, identifying specimens and obtaining accurate information about species, existing users will be enabled to expand their expertise, and we believe it will also attract a range of new users. To ensure that we are providing the right kind of information for this wide range of scientists, we have enlisted the support of project partners who represent international biologists, oceanographers, geologists and oil company stratigraphers, who will both provide us with data, and also review and comment upon our progress and product.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J006416/1","grantId":"NE/J006416/1","fundValue":"100149","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Bown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" Microfossils are tiny fossils that can only be studied using microscopes but they are extremely abundant in sedimentary rocks (thousands to billions in very small samples), easy to identify, and evolved rapidly through time, regularly appearing or disappearing in the stratigraphic record. This means they can be used to divide up geological time (they are good ‘index’ fossils) and to reliably date sedimentary rocks, a requirement that is central to the Earth Sciences both in research and industry (e.g. oil and gas exploitation). However using microfossils as age-dating tools requires high-quality data on the stratigraphic age range of taxa, a global understanding of their biogeographic distribution, and a comprehensive and rigorous taxonomic classification framework. We have developed Nannotax (Nannotax 3 http://ina.tmsoc.org/Nannotax3), to provide basic to specialist information on the nannoplankton microfossil group. The core of the website currently consists of 2700 taxon pages each of which gives authoritative data on the nomenclatural taxonomy of the taxon, combined with a diagnosis, references, biostratigraphic data, additional notes (most cases) and images (for almost all taxa). The site is illustrated with ca 13,000 images including many high-resolution SEM images and colour light micrographs. In addition there is a catalogue of 5500 scanned pages of original descriptions, fully linked to main pages and 500 taxon pages covering non-coccolithophores. \nThis is now by far the best online resource for living or fossil coccolithophore taxonomy and to the best of our knowledge it is substantially better than anything available for other microfossil groups or extant microplankton groups. This reflected in usage statistics, e.g over the 6 months period 5th May to 5th November 2014 there have been around 255 thousand pages views with average duration of 13 minutes showing that visitors are making real use of the site, also reflected in the fact that 80% of visitors are returning users. The strong weekly cyclicity indicates that the site is primarily used as a working tool with weekend use minimal; there is also a noticeable decline in use during the summer university vacation months. The website design could be used to present similar kinds of information very easily.
