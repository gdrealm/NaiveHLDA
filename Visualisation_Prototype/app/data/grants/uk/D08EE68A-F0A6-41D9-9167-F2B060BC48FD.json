These instructions, or genes, are contained in the heritable material, the DNA. When genes are actively expressed, mRNA copies are produced by transcription in some, but not all cells. At a given time, only a sub-set of genes is expressed by a highly regulated and complex process that requires thousands of different protein factors. The precise number of factors involved in transcription is unknown, and the mechanism by which they work is often unclear. Because different cells contain different transcription factors, a characteristic pattern of genes is expressed for each cell type in the human body. Equally important to the activation of transcription, is the switching off of genes. This can be achieved in different manners. For example, factors can bind to DNA and repress transcription. Alternatively, factors can inactivate gene expression by destroying the mRNA copies of genes. The Ccr4-Not factor can potentially influence gene expression in both ways: by repressing transcription and by destruction of mRNA. Recently, we showed that this factor can interact with estrogen receptor. Estrogen receptor is a transcription factor that mediates the cellular effects of the steroid hormone estrogen. Binding of the hormone to estrogen receptor causes a structural change of the receptor which leads to activation of the receptor. As a result, the expression of several hundreds of genes is altered. Some genes are switched on and are actively transcribed in response to the hormone, such as several genes that promote cell division. Other genes are switched off in response and become repressed, including genes that inhibit cell division. The proposed work will investigate how Ccr4-Not will influence cellular gene expression in response to estrogen. It will do so by specifically engineer cells that lack subunits of Ccr4-Not. Using DNA microarray technology, the expression of &gt;30,000 genes, the majority of human genes, will be determined in a single experiment. The resulting large data sets obtained using normal cells and cells lacking functional Ccr4-Not will be compared using bioinformatics. This will allow to define how important Ccr4-Not is in the cellular response to estrogen. In addition, the proposed work will determine to what extent Ccr4-Not uses its capacities to inhibit transcription and destroy mRNA to influence gene expression in response to estrogens. This will be done in cell lines that lack either the transcriptional repression function, or the mRNA destruction function of Ccr4-Not. Finally, because it is known that estrogens can stimulate cell proliferation, it will assess how Ccr4-Not can have an effect on cell division. The results will increase our basic understanding of the molecular machinery in cells. Furthermore, they may be of interest to the pharmaceutical industry, because there are several drugs that can bind to estrogen receptor and influence its activity in different ways as compared to the natural hormone estrogen. These drugs are successfully used for the treatment of osteoporosis, severe post-menopausal symptoms and cancer, but concerns about efficacy and safety remain. A better understanding of the workings of estrogen receptor may eventually result in the development of safer drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E02338X/1","grantId":"BB/E02338X/1","fundValue":"304870","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The most tangible impact is the distribution of tools to a number of academic laboratories (&gt;12) across the UK, Europe, USA, and China.

We uncovered biological roles for several subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex: the CNOT1 and CNOT3 non-catalytic subunits, as well as the Caf1a and Caf1b deadenylase subunits are required for efficient cell proliferation. Moreover, the Ccr4a and Ccr4b deadenylase subunits are additionally required for cell survival and the prevention of cellular senescence.\n\n2. We established that the highly similar Caf1a and Caf1b RNAse subunits have essentially identical gene targets. Similarly, the Ccr4a and Ccr4b paralogues have identical gene targets. These findings are contrary to speculative suggestions in the literature regarding unique properties of the paralogues in gene regulation. Both Caf1a/Caf1b and Ccr4a/Ccr4b mostly regulate gene expression via mRNA decay and not via transcription. \n\n3. The Caf1a/Caf1b and Ccr4a/Ccr4b deadenylase subunits regulate distinct gene sets. This is surprising, because it was assumed that these deadenylase subunits cooperate in gene regulation via mRNA degradation. Overall, the main objectives were met. However, the emphasis shifted from a focus on transcriptional mechanisms in the beginning of the project to mechanisms of mRNA decay.\n\nWe generated resources as proposed. In addition, antibodies against Ccr4-Not components are under characterisation (objective 1). \nWe established that the catalytic subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex are not generally required for the regulation of estrogen-mediated transcription, but are important for proper expression of certain estrogen-regulated genes via post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA levels (2,4). \nWe characterised the role of the deadenylase enzymes, as well as of two non-catalytic subunits, in cell proliferation using cell cycle profiling (5).\n\nWe were unsuccessful in determining how components of the Ccr4-Not complex regulate transcription initiation events (objective 3). Using siRNA knockdown, we noted that Caf1a and Caf1b make a temporal, quantitative contribution to estrogen-dependent repression of three genes: CCNG2, BLNK and SMAD6. However, we failed to obtain reproducible chromatin-immunoprecipitation data in knockdown cells to further investigate the underlying mechanism. We now believe that the deadenylase subunits predominantly regulate gene expression through mRNA decay.\n\nIn addition to the work stated in the objectives, we established the relationship between the Caf1a and Caf1b paralogues and the highly similar Ccr4a and Ccr4b proteins, respectively. Furthermore, we identified unique roles for the Ccr4a/Ccr4b enzymes in cell survival and the prevention of cell death. These findings provide important novel conceptual advances in understanding the role of the Ccr4-Not molecular machine in mRNA degradation. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
