{"id":"F5007297-2F56-4823-931C-FEF91F8C39D8","title":"Vortex rings in gasoline fuel sprays","abstractText":"This project aims to investigate the applicability of a theoretical model for vortex rings, developed by Kaplanski and Rudi (2005), to the analysis of vortex rings observed in direct injection gasoline engines. The investigators will also carry out a feasibility study on the further modification of this model, taking into account the effects of multiphase flow. They will also undertake further experimental investigation of vortex rings in these engines with particular emphasis on the essential parameter values required in order to develop the theoretical model. The project will examine the theoretical predictions of vortex ring properties against the values of typical parameters for gasoline engines which will allow a detailed comparison between the predictions of the model and experimental results to be made. Finally, the team will investigate the feasibility of developing a vortex ring model, capable of predicting the properties of vortex rings in gasoline engines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E047912/1","grantId":"EP/E047912/1","fundValue":"29493","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project was focused on the development of new analytical models for vortex rings and their application to the analysis of vortex ring-like structures in direct injection gasoline engines. The efficiency of the new models was clearly demonstrated based on the comparison between the predictions of the models and experimental data. At the same time, these models could be used only for predictions of the trends and for highlighting the underlying physics of the processes, but not for proper quantitative analysis of the phenomena. Also, the thermal and confinement effects on the behaviour of these structure were not taken into account. It is anticipated that all these issues will be addresses in our new EPSRC project 'Investigation of vortex ring-like structures in internal combustion engines, taking into account thermal and confinement effects' due to start in April 2014.

The model could be used by academics working in this field, as nobody ever suggested the model at this level of difficulty. Also, designers of direct injection gasoline engines could use it for predicting the trends of the behaviour of the vortex-ring like structures in these engines. The work on this project led to a much bigger EPSRC grant 'Investigation of vortex ring-like structures in internal combustion engines, taking into account thermal and confinement effects' due to start in April 2014, with an extended team included in it.
