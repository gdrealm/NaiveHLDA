{"id":"59D45012-DF12-47CC-87AF-A30FC4ADBB7E","title":"Construal, Processing Style, and Memory for Social Events","abstractText":"<p>People can think about the same event in very specific/detailed terms or in very general/global terms. Differences in how one thinks about an event have been recently discussed in terms of different 'levels of construal.' </p>\n\n<p>Theorists use the term 'low level construal' to describe the first example (ie, focusing on the details) and 'high level construal' to describe the second example (ie, focusing on the 'big picture'). </p>\n\n<p>Construing an event at either a high or a low level can influence how it is stored in memory, and how it is later recalled. Moreover, construing one event at a high level may make it more likely that other, subsequent events will also be construed at a high level (and likewise for events construed at a low level). </p>\n\n<p>This project examines two aspects of how people encountered during an event are remembered: face recognition, and memory for behaviour. Based on previous research, it is expected that high-level construal will facilitate face recognition and memory for the meaning of behaviours (eg, traits and goals) whilst low-level construal will impair face recognition and improve memory for detailed characteristics of behaviour. Other aspects of event memory and mediating and moderating factors will also be explored.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G035563/1","grantId":"ES/G035563/1","fundValue":"246329","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Natalie  Wyer","coPersons":["Sabine  Pahl","Timothy John Hollins"],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
