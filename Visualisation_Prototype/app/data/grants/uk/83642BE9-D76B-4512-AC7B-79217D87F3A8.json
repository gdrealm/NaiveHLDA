The virus is spread by insects (flying midges), since 1998 outbreaks of Bluetongue have spread Northwards in Europe and in September 2007 it reached the UK. The current European situation is severe with widespread infection of sheep, goats and cattle causing many animal deaths, and there is significant risk that a similar scenario will develop in the UK. Current vaccines available against Bluetongue are considered neither safe nor effective enough to be used on a widespread basis, nor do they protect from more than one of the 24 different strains of the virus. As prior vaccination for one strain does not protect against other strains a vaccine that will protect against all currently circulating strains of the virus is a priority. This proposal will develop such a vaccine, while maintaining the possibility to distinguish between infected and vaccinated animals, which is important for trade considerations. The new vaccine is only possible due to recent discoveries made by UK researchers, and uses technology which is not yet available in other public or commercial sector organisations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F02049X/1","grantId":"BB/F02049X/1","fundValue":"568936","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Polly  Roy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
