{"id":"4C31ECEF-D611-42D0-8790-A11E9C3E1656","title":"CoDiMa (CCP in the area of Computational Discrete Mathematics)","abstractText":"Computational Discrete Mathematics applied computers to a number of areas within pure mathematics, \nincluding abstract algebra, combinatorics and number theory and their applications in, for instance,\ncryptography, network routing, experimental design and others. Although less visible than the use \nof numerical methods in solving continuous problems such as differential equations, computation in \ndiscrete mathematics has an equally long history.\n\nThe project is aimed at the community-building activities centred around the two main open-source\nsoftware systems, GAP and Sage. GAP (www.gap-system.org) is a 25 year old software package widely \nused for computations in important areas of pure mathematics, especially in abstract algebra, the \nmathematics of structure and symmetry. The Sage project is a free open-source general mathematics \nsoftware system, started in 2005 with the ambitious aim of providing an open-source alternative \nto such well-established closed systems. Sage builds on the Python and incorporates dozens of \nopen-source mathematical packages, in particular GAP, Singular, PARI/GP and others.\n\nGAP and Sage both have quite well established user communities in the UK and internationally. \nHowever these communities are limited in a two ways, which the CCP is designed to address. \nFirstly they are limited by discipline -- while finite group theorists are well aware of GAP, \nfor instance, few physicists or computer scientists are; while Sage is well known in number \ntheory research, it is still not much used in the UK for mixed symbolic-numeric work; etc. \nSecondly the level of involvement of users is limited. Users need support to become programmers; \nprogrammers to become package authors and package authors to become contributors to the core \nsystem and all need support to best use parallel programming.\n\nThe proposed software management and user support activity underpins the whole project. The \nCCP will provide baseline support in these areas which will have a direct impact on GAP's \nsustainability. It will support the rollout of its next mainstream version, GAP 5, which \nsupports shared memory parallelism, and will facilitate the transition to GAP 5 in the user \nand developer communities.\n\nFor the Sage system, of which GAP is an essential component, the CCP funding will facilitate\ntighter Sage-GAP integration, in particular regarding memory management and parallelisation, \nand incorporating into Sage as many GAP packages as possible; the latter currently is done \non an ad hoc basis, is hard to maintain and error-prone. \n\nLast but not the least, closer GAP-Sage collaboration will allow GAP to learn from the newer \nSage project which has been very successful in using modern tools and software development \nworkflows and in being exceptionally welcoming to new developers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M022641/1","grantId":"EP/M022641/1","fundValue":"294007","fundStart":"2015-03-01","fundEnd":"2020-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Linton","coPersons":["Alexander  Konovalov"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
