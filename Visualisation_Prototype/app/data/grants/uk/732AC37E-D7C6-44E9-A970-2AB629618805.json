{"id":"732AC37E-D7C6-44E9-A970-2AB629618805","title":"Nitric oxide neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis","abstractText":"The formation of functional connections, called synapses, between individual nerve cells enables them to communicate with each other and is therefore critical for nervous system function. This process is closely linked to the growth of nerve cells as only nerve cells that come into physical contact with each other can directly communicate. However, not all nerve cells that contact each other will also communicate. The formation of connections is a highly complex and specific process that organises nerve cells into functional networks for the processing of sensory information and the control of behaviour. This project will look at the relationship between the effects of the gas nitric oxide on the growth of nerve cells and the formation of functional connections between nerve cells. Functional connections between nerve cells are first formed during the development of the nervous system, but this process continues in the adult nervous system, where learning can induce the formation of new connections. Similarly, injury can trigger the re-organisation of connections in the adult nervous system. Interestingly, nitric oxide is known to play a role in all of these events. Nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme that produces nitric oxide, can be found in specific neuronal and non-neuronal cells from an early developmental state, where it has been shown to affect the growth of nerve cells. Blocking nitric oxide signalling also interferes with many forms of learning and the formation of long-term memories that are linked to the formation of new connections. Finally, nitric oxide appears to play a role in the re-organisation of nerve cell connections after injury. However, so far it is not clear whether nitric oxide directly affects the formation of connections, or whether nitric oxide has only indirect effects on this process by altering the pattern of nerve cell growth. Here, we will study directly the relationship between the effects of nitric oxide on the growth of nerve cells and the formation of nerve cell connections. We will use the nervous system of the common pond snail as a model system. The organisation of the snail's nervous system is less complex than the nervous system of higher animals such as mice. Furthermore, individual nerve cells are relatively large and easily identifiable. They are also accessible for experimental manipulations. Snail neurons can be isolated from the nervous system and maintained in cell culture, where they grow and form functional connections. Importantly, the basic processes and factors that control the growth of nerve cells and the formation of functional connections are highly conserved in all animals. Thus, the nervous system of the snail is an ideal model system for this study. The specific aim of the project is the study of the precise relationship between the effects of nitric oxide on nerve cell growth and the formation of functional connections in a selection of identified nerve cells. The results will show, what effects nitric oxide has on nerve cell growth and on the formation of functional connections. They will also show whether the effects of nitric oxide on nerve cell growth and the formation of connections are independent of each other, or whether nitric oxide's effects on the formation of connections depend on nerve cell growth. In a broader context, the results will contribute to a better understanding of the factors that control nerve cell growth and the formation of functional connections. This is relevant to the understanding of the development of the nervous system. It is also significant for the understanding of the processes that control nerve cell regeneration following injury. Finally, the results might provide some new insights why nitric oxide plays such an important role in many forms of learning and the formation of long-term memories that are linked to the formation of new connections between nerve cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E009972/1","grantId":"BB/E009972/1","fundValue":"322299","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Volko Arno Straub","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":" The project has demonstrated that the gaseous neurotransmitter nitric oxide can affect the growth of nerve cells and the formation of functional connections (i.e. synapses) between nerve cells following axonal injury, thus supporting our hypothesis that nitric oxide is an important modulator of these events.\n\nWe have studied directly the relationship between the effects of nitric oxide on the growth of nerve cells and the formation of nerve cell connections using the nervous system of the common pond snail as a model system. The organisation of the pond snail's nervous system is less complex than the nervous system of higher animals such as mice. Furthermore, individual nerve cells are relatively large, easily identifiable and readily accessible for experimental manipulations. Importantly, the basic processes and factors that control the growth of nerve cells and the formation of functional connections are highly conserved in all animals. Thus, the nervous system of the pond snail provided an ideal model system for this study. We specifically concentrated on two nerve cell types in the snail's nervous system called B1 and B2. These two nerve cells are located in close proximity to each other and extend processes in the same nerve. Our project has shown that injuring these nerve cells by crushing the nerve containing their main processes triggers extensive regeneration of nerve cell processes. During regeneration, B2 nerve cells form novel chemical synapses with B1 nerve cells, but not vice versa. Furthermore, the strength of existing electrical synapses between B1 nerve cells on the left and right side of the nervous system increases about five-fold during regeneration. The regeneration of nerve cell processes appears to be highly dependent on nitric oxide as it is significantly reduced by blocking nitric oxide production in the nervous system. Similarly, the injury-induced increase in the strength of electrical synapses between B1 nerve cells is prevented by blocking nitric oxide production. Blocking nitric oxide production also reduced the strength of newly formed chemical synapses between B2 and B1 neurons on opposite sides of the nervous system. Most of the effects of blocking nitric oxide production in the nervous system could be reversed by applying nitric oxide donors. Furthermore, applying nitric oxide donors to individual isolated B1 and B2 nerve cells in cell culture increased the total length of their processes demonstrating that nitric oxide can directly enhance nerve cell growth. Finally, we have shown that the effects of nitric oxide on nerve cell growth and synapse formation are mediated by an evolutionary conserved signalling pathway involving the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase that has been implicated in the effects of nitric oxide in all animals. Thus, we have provided conclusive evidence for a significant role of nitric oxide in nerve cell growth and synapse formation, which contributes to our understanding why nitric oxide plays such an important role during the development of the nervous system, and in many forms of learning and long-term memory formation that are linked to the formation of new connections between nerve cells. Our findings that nitric oxide signalling can affect neurite growth and synaptic re-modelling following injury could potentially be useful for the development of treatments of nerve injuries. We are currently exploring whether nitric oxide signalling has similar effects on neuronal growth in mammalian model systems. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
