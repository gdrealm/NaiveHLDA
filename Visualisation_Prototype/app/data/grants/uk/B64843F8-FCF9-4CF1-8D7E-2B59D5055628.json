They are an increasing proportion of the human drugs market, but widespread use in veterinary settings has been prevented by high production cost. Replacing the expensive mammalian cell culture systems with transgenic chickens has significant potential to reduce this cost. With our system, hens can produce protein of consistent quantity and activity over their entire laying lives, and purification is performed using standard techniques. Here we propose to take forward our recent success producing active pig CSF1-Fc in transgenic hens' eggs by purifying large quantities and testing in potential applications. We will scale up purification, perform full quality control, test in pig models of human disease, and provide material to other experts for evaluation. We will also produce a new transgenic line expressing dog CSF1-Fc for future studies in veterinary medicine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M021920/1","grantId":"BB/M021920/1","fundValue":"554485","fundStart":"2015-05-11","fundEnd":"2017-05-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Sang","coPersons":["David Arthur Hume","Andrew Christopher Gill"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
