{"id":"B91F3CBE-0CB1-4893-9F1E-29EB16F87FB3","title":"Travel and Subsistence for the UKQCD Collaboration","abstractText":"This application is for travel and subsistence for the UKQCD collaboration for three years to fund collaboration meetings, working visits, workshops and external collaboration. The collaboration comprises over 60 physicists from seven British universities (Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Oxford, Southampton and Swansea). During the period of the grant we will be exploiting the QCDOC supercomputer in Edinburgh, performing lattice QCD simulations with the inclusion of up, down and strange quarks with masses close to their physical values. Principal research projects include: (a) QCD parameters (strong coupling and quark masses) ; (b) Hadron structure (spectrum, hybrid and singlet mesons, glueballs, structure functions and distribution amplitudes); (c) Weak matrix elements (b- and c-quark phenomenology and kaon physics); (d) QCD phase structure at non-zero temperature and finite baryon density. Further work addresses algorithms for dynamical quark simulations, design and development of QCD computers, and grid-based data storage and retrieval via national (QCDgrid) and international (International Lattice Data Grid) projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E007341/1","grantId":"PP/E007341/1","fundValue":"16343","fundStart":"2007-10-14","fundEnd":"2010-10-13","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Flynn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
