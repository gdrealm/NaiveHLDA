A recent development, called Unit selection speech synthesis has now improved the quality of the speech so much that it is often indistinguishable from natural speech.Unfortunately, the creation of new voices for this unit selection technology is very expensive because it is labour intensive and must be done by experts. This is preventing the use of the technology in many applications, such as the production of high quality speech synthesisers for languages spoken in less developed countries.We are proposing to develop methods that will make it much quicker and cheaper to create new voices for speech synthesisers and also allow non-experts to carry out this work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D058139/1","grantId":"EP/D058139/1","fundValue":"238471","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  King","coPersons":["Matthew Peter Aylett"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" The project succeeded in producing both statistical parametric and unit selection &quot;emergent phone&quot; systems. In addition we also created orthographic unit-based systems. These systems were evaluated against classical phone systems. A large number of techniques were evaluated for generating these systems and applied to the two main underlying problems that needed tobe solved namely:* Segmenting and categorising units of speech. * Generalising the expected units in unseen words from a database of s  ","dataset":"gtr"}
