We have obtained commercial scanner data from the market research company Taylor Nelson Sofres and plan to compare this data to that available in the long-established UK Family Expenditure Survey and British Household Panel Survey. We aim to establish ways in which scanner data may be preferable to traditional means of collecting spending information and where they may be deficiencies. </p> \n<p>Scanner data is potentially valuable as it is one of the few sources of panel expenditure data. Scanners also provide extremely detailed product information and exact prices paid. However, households may fail to scan certain items properly and some household types may have difficulties using the technology. Using both simple comparisons and sophisticated econometric techniques, we aim to develop an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of scanner data, and to use our findings to propose ways to improve its quality. This may allow scanner technologies to be employed in existing surveys with more confidence.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E024297/1","grantId":"ES/E024297/1","fundValue":"41135","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Zoe  Oldfield","coPersons":["Andrew Mark Leicester"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
