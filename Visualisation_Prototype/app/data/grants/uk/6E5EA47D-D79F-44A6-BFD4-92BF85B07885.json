{"id":"6E5EA47D-D79F-44A6-BFD4-92BF85B07885","title":"Flexible Single-Optical-Fibre Endoscope","abstractText":"Recently, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Korean University demonstrated a single multimode-optical-fibre (MMF) imaging endoscope. Compared with conventional fibre-bundle based endoscopes, this device is ultra-slim, high-resolution, wide-field, lensless, low cost and disposable. The main drawback of such devices is that they cannot be used as flexible endoscopes due to image blurring caused by fibre-shape variation. However, flexible endoscopes are viewed as most desirable and are widely used in modern healthcare. In order to overcome this problem, this research aims to develop the world's first flexible single-fibre endoscope system by using a novel speckle monitoring technique. The monitoring module will consist of a calibration beam and associated optics to monitor the real-time changes in mode coupling induced by fibre movement and bending. The monitoring results will be used to predict MMF imaging transmission matrix for original image restoration. At the end of the project, a prototype device together with real-time software and algorithms will be developed for potential clinical trials and translational research. The project is highly interdisciplinary: it brings together expertise in the areas of optics, instrumentation, imaging, signal processing and surgery. The outcome of the proposed research has the potential to put the UK at the forefront of a crucial emerging area of new medical devices for modern endoscopy, which is likely to have a huge impact not only on research and patient well-being, but also on the UK and global economy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L022559/1","grantId":"EP/L022559/1","fundValue":"100504","fundStart":"2014-08-31","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Lei  Su","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
