At the heart of the organisersâ€™ purpose is to propose, analyse and evaluate the validity of this concept and its relevance to policy and practice. It is one derived from the literature, debates and practice of New Public Management (NPM). NPM stresses the utility of markets in restructuring the territorial and administrative dimensions of the public domain.</p> \n<p>Functional decentralisation and the increased role for the private sector in the restructuring of the public domain, at sub-national levels, are important factors that cut across all the participants' perspectives, who are drawn from the UK and overseas.&nbsp;The implications of these factors for policy makers and practitioners are also a consideration for the series.</p> \n<p>The four seminars are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Seminar 1:&nbsp;The Rise of Multi-Level Governance and Meta-Governance in an International Context : (Aston University) </li>\n <li>Seminar 2: Beyond New Public Management: Prospects for New Regional Management (Open University) </li>\n <li>Seminar 3: Post Democracy and the New Regional Management (University of Newcastle) </li>\n <li>Seminar 4: The New Regional Management: A sustainable concept?
