A new manuscript of the complete text, including the missing section, has now been found, and it is from this manuscript that this new edition and translation, which is being jointly prepared by myself and Dr. Charity Scott-stokes, will be edited. Oxford Medieval Text has agreed in principle to publish this new edition. A substantial introduction will also investigate the process of new-dissemination in late medieval England.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112669/1","grantId":"112669/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Given-Wilson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
