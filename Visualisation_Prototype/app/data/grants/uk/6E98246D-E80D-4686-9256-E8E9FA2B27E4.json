He was an assistant to Henry Moore, and his work and life intersected with key artists, curators, and critics of the period, including Sir Anthony Caro, Alan Davie, Dame Elizabeth Frink, Barbara Hepworth, Eduardo Paulozzi, and the artists of Gallery One (run by Victor Musgrave and which collection has been preserved by Monica Kinley). Over 300 works by King survive, the bulk of which are in the collection of his estate, while others are in the Arts Council, Henry Moore Institute, and private collections. He also produced an experimental animated film, funded by the BFI, and first screened in 1956 at the ICA.\\n\\nThis project will provide the definitive electronic archive of King's work for deposition with the Arts and Humanities Data Service. These steps are the first stage in providing resources for scholars interested to establish his critical reputation, and to view this crucial period in recent British Art History through the prism of an as yet undiscovered artist of the time.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F008414/1","grantId":"AH/F008414/1","fundValue":"12951","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Ralph King","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
