{"id":"898A3AFC-3C66-46F0-AD66-528366379FE7","title":"Genetic analysis of actin dynamics at epithelial wound edges in vivo","abstractText":"The surfaces and cavities of our bodies are covered by protective outer layers called epithelia, which consist of sheets of cells tightly adhered to one another. For instance, the outer layer of our skin is an epithelium, as are the linings of our gut and lungs. Epithelia function as barriers that protect our bodies against infective agents, toxic substances and fluid loss, therefore it is essential that if damaged, epithelia are rapidly repaired. Repair of epithelia, for instance during healing of a wound or recovery from surgery, can take several weeks, during which time the wounded individual is at increased risk of infection. In some circumstances epithelial repair fails completely, leaving the individual at constant risk of infection. Therefore the development of therapies to accelerate or improve epithelial repair would be of great benefit to human health. In order to develop such therapies, it is necessary to understand how epithelial repair occurs at the molecular and cellular level. Previous research has shown that there are two methods by which epithelial wound repair can occur. In the first method, cells at the wound edge extent protrusions into the wound. Using these protrusions, the cells grab hold of fibres within the wound and gradually pull themselves forward across the wound. In the second method of epithelial repair, the cells at the edge of wound construct a contractile cable around the wound edge. This cable then constricts like a purse-string and pulls the wound closed. The protrusions required for the first method of closure, and the cable required for the second, are both assembled from a protein called actin. Therefore in either case, a possible way of accelerating epithelial wound healing would be to develop a drug that altered the assembly of actin by wound edge cells, for instance causing them to make more protrusions or a thicker cable. To do this we need to understand how actin assembly is controlled in wound edge cells, as this would reveal ways in which actin assembly could be manipulated using drugs. The mechanisms controlling actin assembly will differ between cells forming protrusions and cables, so we would need to understand how actin is controlled in both situations. It is probable that we would need different drugs to accelerate protrusion-based and cable-based wound closure, therefore we need to be able to identify which type of closure is occurring if we are to select the appropriate method of treatment for a particular wound. We currently do not understand why some wounds heal using protrusions while others heal using a purse-string. The aims of this project are to identify what determines whether a wound heals using protrusions or a cable, and to establish how control of actin assembly differs between cells forming cables and protrusions. Our experiments will be performed using embryos of the fruit fly Drosophila. The advantage of using Drosophila for this research is that we can easily observe epithelial wound healing occurring in live embryos and we can use genetic techniques to determine which genes are important in the two forms of epithelial wound healing. We will study wound healing in two different epithelial tissues in the embryo, one of which forms an actin cable at wound edges, while the other forms protrusions. We will compare wound healing in these two tissues, and investigate why actin assembly at wound edges differs between them. We will use genetic techniques to identify the molecules that control actin assembly in wound edge cells in these two tissues. Our findings will greatly improve our understanding of how epithelia heal and will therefore assist in the development of therapies to accelerate epithelial wound healing. Spreading of cancer cells around the body involves changes in actin assembly by epithelial cells, therefore this work could also aid the development of therapies to treat cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I007288/1","grantId":"BB/I007288/1","fundValue":"360893","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our research has important medical implications as it has the potential to direct the development of new wound healing therapeutics. Given the importance to the economy of healthcare and pharmaceuticals, this clearly has potential economic benefits. It is not realistic to expect these economic benefits to be felt within the three years of the research starting, but we have taken measures to communicate the research to other parties who could aid in the realization of these economic benefits. For example, we have presented our findings at numerous conferences attended by clinicians including the annual meeting of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS) and have a review article in press in the journal Advances in Wound Care. \n\nOur research is excellent for engaging the public with scientific research as it is in an area of general interest and generates striking images and movies of biological processes in action. This has societal and economic impact, through improving understanding and support for scientific advances, and encouraging the uptake of scientific careers by school children and students. We have been active in publicizing our research to the public through events at museums. One feature of our research that makes it useful for encouraging public support for scientific research is that we study a medically-important topic using an invertebrate model organism. This is useful in engaging individuals uncomfortable with the use of animals in research.

Our main model system was the Drosophila embryo, allowing wound healing to be studied in vivo in a genetically tractable organism. The main findings of our research concern the events that occur immediately after a tissue has been wounded and process whereby the process of wound healing is activated. These early wound healing 'trigger' events are medically important as if they could be therapeutically manipulated, we could potentially accelerate wound healing or activate healing in situations where it fails completely, such as chronic wounds.\n\nOur first key finding is that the adherens junctions that link cells together within wounded tissue have to undergo substantial changes before wound closure can commence. These changes are necessary for the cells bordering the wound to form a motile front edge that allows them to move across the wound and occur by the process of endocytic recycling.\n\nOur next major finding was the identity of one of the key signals that triggers wound-edge cells to become motile. We found that a lipid called PIP3 strongly accumulates at wound edges and triggers wound-edge cells to form protrusions, which the cells use to move across the wound. By manipulating levels of PIP3, we were able to show that its formation was important for wound closure. We also investigated the process by which the formation of PIP3 is triggered following wounding. We found that the changes in the structure of cell junctions discussed above directly lead to PIP3 formation.\n\nThe movement of cells during wound healing is primarily driven the actin cytoskeleton. The final major element of this project was an investigation of how the wound healing triggering signals we had identified led to the activation of actin assembly to drive cell movements. We identified a number of proteins that control actin during wound healing. Each of these proteins has a different role in assembling the actin structures (such as cell protrusions) needed for movement, so co-ordination of all of their activities is required for wound closure.\n\nOverall, our research yielded important new information about the molecular events of wound healing. Our identification of a number of new processes and proteins that are important for wound closure will help the development of new wound healing treatments by revealing a set of new therapeutic targets. In addition, while conducting this research, we developed new techniques for studying wound healing in Drosophila, which will greatly aid future research by ourselves and others in the scientific community. This research has the potential to impact on the development of new treatments to improve wound healing. Our research was largely conducted in Drosophila, so the next step towards realizing this potential is to test whether the mechanisms we have identified are conserved in more complex organisms, and ultimately humans. To do this, we are working closely with colleagues in the faculty. Research conducted by the group of Enrique Amaya has already validated some of our findings in Xenopus. We are now working with Mat Hardman to move this work to mice. Notably, Mat Hardman has links with clinicians and biotech companies, providing potential routes to the clinic. We have used a yearly exhibition at Manchester Museum called 'The Body Experience' to engage the public with our research and the field of wound healing in general. In addition, through the Manchester Drosophila facility, we have been involved in outreach activities aimed at explaining the uses of Drosophila in medical research and have a review article in press, explaining how Drosophila can be used in the study of wound healing.
