{"id":"8865B854-C622-413E-B90C-FCA73582DBD4","title":"Developing a broader measure for economic evaluation","abstractText":"We aim to develop a new measure that looks at all aspects of quality of life, not just health, and can be used to assess value for money (cost-effectiveness). Such a measure will be important for estimating the cost-effectiveness of health interventions that impact on quality of life generally.\nThe National Health Service has a set amount of money to spend on providing services. Because of this it has to decide which services to provide and which services not to provide. Many of these decisions are made by thinking about whether the amount of money spent is worth the extra health that is achieved. For some services, especially public health interventions, looking just at health is problematic because these services do not just affect people’s health. For example, teenage pregnancy services might result in better education and life opportunities.\nThis new measure for use in cost-effectiveness studies will be developed by talking to people to find out what is important to them and why. The resulting important aspect of people’s lives will then be valued using survey techniques. These values can then be used in assessments of cost-effectiveness.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701027","grantId":"G0701027","fundValue":"449102","fundStart":"2008-09-29","fundEnd":"2011-03-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanna  Coast","coPersons":["Samantha  Clemens","Timothy James  Peters","Terry Nicholas Flynn","Stirling  Bryan","John  Brazier"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
