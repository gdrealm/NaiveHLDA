Nevertheless, spectators tend to remember the relatively few occasions when it all goes wrong and athletes perform badly under the pressure of competition. Despite such memorable incidents of performers choking under pressure, relatively little is known about the causes of such dramatic drops in performance and, importantly, whether choking can be prevented by the appropriate training methods.</p>\n\n<p>Our previous research has improved our understanding of how people perform under pressure and how they can be trained to remain robust under pressure. We have developed a brain training protocol that uses state-of-the-art brain-computer-interface technology for teaching novice golfers to learn how to putt like pros, both under pressure-free practice and pressure-laden competition conditions.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the project was to discover whether our brain training protocol could teach relative novices to produce patterns of brain activity associated with the best performances of experts and thereby ensure that their performance is as optimal as possible and robust under pressure.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4523","grantId":"RES-000-22-4523","fundValue":"79301","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Ring","coPersons":["Maria  Kavussanu","Rich  Masters"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" Our project evaluated the utility of our customised neurofeedback brain training protocol designed to facilitate optimal psychomotor performance under low (control) and high (competition) pressure conditions. Adopting a multi-measure approach (i.e., by assessing behavioural, cortical, autonomic and kinematic activity) we characterised recreational golfers during a golf putting task before and after electroencephalographic (EEG) training designed to emulate expert performers. \n\nStatistical analyses of the cortical data showed that our neurofeedback training protocol taught recreational golfers to control their brain activity. Specifically, we found that theta, alpha and beta power were lower after the training in members of the neurofeedback group compared to members of the control group. However, these differences in brain activity between the two groups did not help members of the neurofeedback group to further improve their performance or remain robust under pressure compared to the control group. Accordingly, our neurofeedback training protocol was partially successful. Neurofeedback training protocols can be tailored to help improve skill learning and performance under pressure in a number of non-academic contexts. Training could be used to help elite athletes and military personnel who are required learn and execute skills under pressure. Neurofeedback training can also help patients during rehabilitation to relearn skills. We showed that after only three hours of frontal alpha/theta neurofeedback training, young adults can learn to reduce their cortical activity widely across a broad spectrum of frequency bands. The potential implications of these findings are important in a number of ways. With an eye on exploitation of our findings, our protocol can be easily adapted to provide neurofeedback training for different groups (e.g., athletes, patients, learners) and requirements. For example, our protocol can be use to improve the use brain-computer-interfacing in society. ","dataset":"gtr"}
