To the extent exceptionalist thinking was significant during the Bush administration, and to the extent it informs US policy afterwards, this project also explores the impact it has had on our understanding of war as an institution of international society. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G027331/1","grantId":"ES/G027331/1","fundValue":"77926","fundStart":"2009-02-16","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The main publication is an Oxford University Press book, which has been used for teaching and research.
