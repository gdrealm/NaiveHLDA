During this period, key services and initiatives in the areas affected by the conflict have often been taken over by national and international NGOs. Over the same period local religious institutions have been centres of refuge, occasionally targets for attack, and sometimes resources of comfort or hope for those seeking to heal the wounds of conflict. </p> \n<p>The research will try to unravel the broader questions raised by such a picture: it is primarily focused on the issue of religion and faith-based public action, but with substantial overlap with the theme of security, violence and exclusion. Are religious or faith-based interventions particularly well suited to conflict situations? Can they be used as resources in peace-building? Can their activities actively fan the flames of conflict?</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-155-25-0096","grantId":"RES-155-25-0096","fundValue":"155545","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Spencer","coPersons":["Jonathan  Goodhand","Benedikt  Korf"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
