These cells are very much like the cells of the early embryo and they retain the ability to make all the different specialized types of cells in our organs and tissues e.g. blood cells, brain cells, skin cells etc.&nbsp; By culturing hESC in laboratory conditions we can study how these cells develop into the specialised cells of our organs and tissues. There is also the future prospect of using hESC to generate specialised cells that can be used to treat degenerative diseases that would benefit from stem cell transplantation (e.g. in diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson disease etc) or accidental injuries (e.g. skin burns). We have been able to derive hES-NCL1 embryonic stem cell line in 2004. However, the derivation and culture process for this cell line was done in the presence of foreign (mouse) cells and/or chemicals derived from animals. Although this cell line provides an excellent tool for basic research, it is unsuitable for clinical applications.&nbsp; \n\nThe object of this application is to develop specialised laboratory and culture techniques so that new lines of hESC can be isolated and expanded under conditions whereby they are not exposed to animal cells or to animal products. Such cells would then have the potential to be used in treating patients (stem cell therapy).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0301182","grantId":"G0301182","fundValue":"260028","fundStart":"2004-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Majlinda  LakoMiodrag  Stojkovic","coPersons":["Tom  Strachan","Alison  Murdoch"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
