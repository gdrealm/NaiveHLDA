Despite this, and the fact that bacterial infection causes significant losses to the farming industry, the technologies designed to protect humans against bacterial infections have often not been available to combat animal disease. The biggest reason for this is cost. This proposal aims to harness genes from a bacterium that causes significant sickness and mortality in pigs. In preliminary experiments we discovered two genes from a pig pathogen called Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and found that they were responsible for making a sugar structure (polysaccharide) on the surface of this bacterium. We have been able to transfer these genes into a safe laboratory strain of Escherichia coli and to make a first generation of vaccine. This vaccine is based on the linkage of a protein to this sugar component. Crucially, the genes coding for this polysaccharide are present in all A. pleuropneumoniae strains. We believe that this may be a chink in the armour of this pig pathogen and would like to generate several vaccine formulations to test this theory. The method used to make this type of vaccine, called a glycoconjugate, is much cheaper than traditional techniques, which have prevented their widespread use in animals.\nOur interests will also go beyond using the genes to make a vaccine against A. pleuropneumoniae. We are also going to explore if the protein responsible for making this vaccine has potential to be used as a tool to unlock current technological limitations. And make possible the assembly of novel vaccine formulations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M01925X/1","grantId":"BB/M01925X/1","fundValue":"134399","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jon  Cuccui","coPersons":["Brendan  Wren"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
