{"id":"3E9BEFF4-4B04-4A0C-A664-DD2C8BD4B148","title":"Discerning dynamics for understanding chronic illness","abstractText":"When clinical and self assessment is taught to health professionals and patients, there is little mention of the assessment of dynamics, that is change over time, the pattern of change and what influences this pattern. Social scientists seeking to understand the experience of illness include descriptions of dynamics in illness narratives, but the analysis has not focused on dynamics. This project aims to increase our understanding of the dynamics of living with chronic illness in order to improve assessment and tailoring of interventions for better health outcome. An analysis framework will be developed which identifies the emergent dynamics of individuals and the complex networks of bio-social interaction influencing this dynamic. The framework will be used to analyse existing interview data from people living with type 2 diabetes or chronic low back pain. Research User Groups will advise on the analysis. To assess the meaning and utility of the results, focus groups will be held with people living with the health conditions, with health professionals and with educators of patients and health professionals. Finally, a workshop will launch the method of assessing dynamics to those teaching clinical assessment and self assessment of chronic illness.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F032765/1","grantId":"ES/F032765/1","fundValue":"80584","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frances  Griffiths","coPersons":["David S Byrne","Jeffrey Michael Borkan","Jacqueline  Sturt","Michael L Parchman","Shmuel  Reis","Benjamin  Crabtree","Sallie  Lamb","Antje  Lindenmeyer"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
