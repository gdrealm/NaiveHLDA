The effects of touching with more than one finger.","abstractText":"<p>The surface texture of an object has a significant effect on many of our daily activities. For instance, the texture affects the way in which we hold the object. Smoother objects are more slippery and therefore require greater gripping force to stop them slipping from our fingers. Object textures also affect perception, for example affecting judgements about whether the object is pleasant or unpleasant to touch. </p>\n\n<p>Most scientific research about how humans process information from the skin to perceive different textures has focused on touching using one finger. However, in everyday life textures are typically sensed by two fingers, yet it is unknown whether information is combined across the fingers when textures are processed or whether the brain processes the information from each finger alone.</p>\n\n<p>This question will be examined in the present project. Preliminary work has shown that texture felt on one finger influences the sensations of texture felt on another finger. The experiments that will be conducted will provide answers about whether information from two or more fingers is truly averaged, whether this pooling process is constrained by factors such as the distance between the fingers and their posture, and whether<br />the fingers are on the same hand.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F040318/1","grantId":"ES/F040318/1","fundValue":"77600","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Glyn  Humphreys","coPersons":["Roberta  Roberts"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
