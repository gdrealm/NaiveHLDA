Paradoxically, cell senescence can also contribute to tissue ageing, by preventing tissue renewal and causing tissue inflammation. Triggers of cell senescence include DNA damage and dysfunctional mitochondria (sites of cellular energy production). Appropriate healthy ageing (i.e. a healthy lifespan without cancer) depends on appropriate balance of the senescence program. \n\nAutophagy is a cellular recycling process that degrades and eliminates damaged structures from the cell. Our preliminary data indicates that autophagy serves to suppress accumulation of DNA damage and dysfunctional mitochondria in the cell. Hence, we hypothesise that autophagy controls - and perhaps dampens - onset and/or maintenance of cell senescence, and so tissue and organismal ageing. \n\nBy exploiting the complementary strengths of Drs. Passos and Adams we will investigate this hypothesis in cell culture and mouse models. \n\nProgress in these studies will facilitate development of biomarkers of interventions to promote healthy ageing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K017233/1","grantId":"BB/K017233/1","fundValue":"334200","fundStart":"2013-11-25","fundEnd":"2016-11-24","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Not yet.
