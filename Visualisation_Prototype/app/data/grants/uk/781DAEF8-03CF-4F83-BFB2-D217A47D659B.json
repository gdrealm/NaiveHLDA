{"id":"781DAEF8-03CF-4F83-BFB2-D217A47D659B","title":"Optical Proteomic Technology for In-Situ Analysis of Protein Interaction Networks","abstractText":"The proteomics research programme will aim at the development of radical new technologies to address the major outstanding challenges in our understanding of the functional interactions of proteins. Non-invasive analysis of intact/live biological cells is made possible by optical techniques . This will enable the study of protein function within a truebiological context, which is not possible with existing approaches. A high-speed high-throughput implementation of the new technologies will allow the extended network of protein-protein interactions that regulate cell function and determine specific physiological responses to be unravelled. Optical technology development will focus on robust high-speed imaging and methods for the detection of protein interactions occurring specifically on the cell surface, which offers many potential drug targets. These new proteomic technologies will benefit a number of important biomedical issues, including stem cells, cancer, allergy and asthma. This research programme builds on the availability of the human genome to bridge the gap between advanced optical cell imaging, cell biology and clinical medicine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C546113/1","grantId":"EP/C546113/1","fundValue":"509096","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Continued use for further development of predictive cancer markers Other ","person":"Borivoj  Vojnovic","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" We have developed novel imaging and image analysis methods which are able to quantify interactions of key proteins in patient tissue samples (biopsies). This allows us to determine the likelihood of success of particular cancer treatments applied to specific patients. No two cancers/patients are alike and the methods developed have been applied retrospectively to breast cancer patient data, and the findings show how the genetic/protein profile of the tumour can affect the success of the treatment Too early for non-academic use at present Several versions of the instrumentation developed under the grant have been deployed in laboratories at Kings College London and the University of Oxford Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
