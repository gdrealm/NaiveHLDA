Many of these kits use enzymes that modify DNA and RNA. Improving the accuracy and sensitivity of these enzymes can provide a kit with the unique selling point. In BBSRC-funded research, we have developed a novel approach to study DNA or RNA modifying enzymes using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). This rapid, low-cost method was used to identify factors that improve the activity of DNA polymerases used in PCR, and RNA ligases used in kits that capture small RNAs (sRNAs). We plan to develop a High-Definition (HD) method that more accurately captures RNA molecules, which have been linked with cancers and disease. Funding is also requested to develop a PCRmax technology to generate diagnostic kits with increased sensitivity. PCRmax technology is a rare opportunity to develop a method leading to a step change in PCR efficiency.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021601/1","grantId":"BB/J021601/1","fundValue":"119930","fundStart":"2012-08-30","fundEnd":"2013-08-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are in negotiation with the leading company in the field (Illumina) to develop a kit based on our results Agriculture, Food and Drink,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Economic","person":"Tamas  Dalmay","coPersons":["James  Gray"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" We discovered that ligation of small RNAs to adapter molecules is biased and that this bias is determined by the ability of a small RNA to anneal to the adapter molecule. With hindsight, it is not surprising because it is common sense that two molecules are more likely to be ligated to each other if they are physically next to each other. If a small RNA can anneal to an adapter, their ends are close to each other and have a better chance to get ligated than molecules that are not annealed to each other. Current commercial kits contain adapters with a fixed sequence therefore some sRNAs can anneal them and others can't, introducing a bias at the ligation step. We developed an approach that uses a pool of adapter sequences (by introducing degenerate nucleotides into the adapter) therefore more sequences can anneal to at least one of the adapter sequences.
