The Storegga Slide offshore Norway covers an area larger than Scotland and contains enough sediment to cover all of Scotland to a depth of 80 m. This huge slide occurred 8,200 years ago and extends for 800 km down slope. It produced a tsunami with a run up &gt;20 m around the Norwegian Sea and 3-8 m on the Scottish mainland. The UK faces few other natural hazards that could cause damage on the scale of a repeat of the Storegga Slide tsunami. The Storegga Slide is not the only huge submarine slide in the Norwegian Sea. Published data suggest that there have been at least six such slides in the last 20,000 years. For instance, the Traenadjupet Slide occurred 4,000 years ago and involved ~900 km3 of sediment. Based on a recurrence interval of 4,000 years (2 events in the last 8,000 years, or 6 events in 20,000 years), there is a 5% probability of a major submarine slide, and possible tsunami, occurring in the next 200 years. Sedimentary deposits in Shetland dated at 1500 and 5500 years, in addition to the 8200 year Storegga deposit, are thought to indicate tsunami impacts and provide evidence that the Arctic tsunami hazard is still poorly understood.\n\nGiven the potential impact of tsunamis generated by Arctic landslides, we need a rigorous assessment of the hazard they pose to the UK over the next 100-200 years, their potential cost to society, degree to which existing sea defences protect the UK, and how tsunami hazards could be incorporated into multi-hazard flood risk management. This project is timely because rapid climatic change in the Arctic could increase the risk posed by landslide-tsunamis. Crustal rebound associated with future ice melting may produce larger and more frequent earthquakes, such as probably triggered the Storegga Slide 8200 years ago. The Arctic is also predicted to undergo particularly rapid warming in the next few decades that could lead to dissociation of gas hydrates (ice-like compounds of methane and water) in marine sediments, weakening the sediment and potentially increasing the landsliding risk. \n\nOur objectives will be achieved through an integrated series of work blocks that examine the frequency of landslides in the Norwegian Sea preserved in the recent geological record, associated tsunami deposits in Shetland, future trends in frequency and size of earthquakes due to ice melting, slope stability and tsunami generation by landslides, tsunami inundation of the UK and potential societal costs. This forms a work flow that starts with observations of past landslides and evolves through modelling of their consequences to predicting and costing the consequences of potential future landslides and associated tsunamis. Particular attention will be paid to societal impacts and mitigation strategies, including examination of the effectiveness of current sea defences. This will be achieved through engagement of stakeholders from the start of the project, including government agencies that manage UK flood risk, international bodies responsible for tsunami warning systems, and the re-insurance sector. \n\nThe main deliverables will be:\n(i) better understanding of frequency of past Arctic landslides and resulting tsunami impact on the UK\n(ii) improved models for submarine landslides and associated tsunamis that help to understand why certain landslides cause tsunamis, and others don't.\n(iii) a single modelling strategy that starts with a coupled landslide-tsunami source, tracks propagation of the tsunami across the Norwegian Sea, and ends with inundation of the UK coast. Tsunami sources of various sizes and origins will be tested \n(iv) a detailed evaluation of the consequences and societal cost to the UK of tsunami flooding , including the effectiveness of existing flood defences\n(v) an assessment of how climate change may alter landslide frequency and thus tsunami risk to the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K000187/1","grantId":"NE/K000187/1","fundValue":"31723","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Findings have been used to inform academics and othere stakeholders on the frequency of large landslides around the polar North Atlantic, with implications for tsunami hazard Environment Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Julian Andrew Dowdeswell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The project has made considerable scientific advances in understanding the recurrence times of past large submarine landslides, which is a key part of assessing associated tsunami hazards. A paper in Geology (Clare et al., 2014) showed that large submarine landslides may have a common frequency distribution of recurrence times that is temporally random, suggesting that they are not strongly correlated with non-random processes (such as climate or sea-level change). The time to the next slide is independent of the time since the last slide. Analysis of an updated global database of submarine landslides ages concluded that there is either no statistically significant correlation between landslide frequency and sea-level, or the error bars on available ages are too great to tell (Urlaub et al., QSR). A paper currently in review (Pope et al., QSR) suggests that it is the latter, and that combination of locations or\nsequential triggering processes can easily generation temporally random landslide recurrence intervals. Initial field work analysing tsunami deposits in the Shetland Islands suggests that a tsunami may have occurred ~5,000 years ago. This suggests that since the large Storegga Slide tsunami 8,150 years ago, two additional and more localised tsunamis at 5,000 and 1,500 years BP may have affected northern UK coastlines. Rapid progress has been made in tsunami modelling, with the adaptive-mesh fluidity model results now benchmarked against other tsunami models and field data on Storegga Slide tsunami deposits.\n\nAn innovative process has been trialled to identify the geographical location of tsunami sources that will cause greatest impact for a given site on the UK coastline. Initial work is analysing how ice unloading affects stress patterns on faults, and its implications for future seismicity. A PDRA is now working on how gas hydrates may affect the mechanical behaviour of generalised types of sediment at high latitudes. Recent publications have explored whether the sudden loss of structure within marine sediment can lead to large-scale slope failure (Urlaub et al., 204, in review). The project has just submitted an\ninitial case for the inclusion of tsunami hazards on the UK National Risk Register, through the Natural Hazards Partnership. Stakeholders have been engaged at annual and project meetings, with a particularly productive workshopheld in Edinburgh with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). The project is also now also well connected to European tsunami warning stakeholders through the F7 ASTARTE project, which started in 2013, through attendance at ASTARTE meetings.
