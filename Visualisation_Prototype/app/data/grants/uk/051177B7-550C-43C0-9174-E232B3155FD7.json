{"id":"051177B7-550C-43C0-9174-E232B3155FD7","title":"High Spec Raman Spectrometer Regional Facility","abstractText":"The most common spectroscopic methods for providing chemical fingerprints of molecules and materials are Raman and Infra-red (IR) spectroscopy. Raman and IR spectroscopy are complementary techniques; generally when a material is Raman active it is IR inactive and vice versa. Advantages of using Raman over IR include the minimal sample preparation required, the increased spatial resolution achieved and the fact that analysis of wet samples is possible since water is not significantly Raman active but water features are dominant in IR when present. \n\nCommonly available Raman spectrometers consist generally of one or two laser lines, restricting the type of characterisation that can be carried out. The instrument proposed here will provide a Raman microscope-spectrometer with lasers that cover the spectrum from the deep UV into the Infra-red. This allows the widest range of sample materials to be analysed. Additional features of the proposed system will allow temperature controlled studies, and high speed Raman chemical imaging of large area samples.\n\nBy providing chemical fingerprints of materials, Raman spectroscopy, can offer sample identification down to submicron spatial resolutions. Information on sample composition, interactions between materials, distributions within composites, and charge distribution can be provided non-invasively. The programme of work enabled by the proposed facility spans the areas of: energy conversion technologies such as reverse electrodialysis and fuel cells, energy storage (e.g. batteries and supercapacitors), electrocatalysts, nuclear fuel recycling, heterogeneous catalysis, CO2 conversion, forensic analysis, sensors, and biochemistry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M022749/1","grantId":"EP/M022749/1","fundValue":"23577","fundStart":"2015-08-26","fundEnd":"2018-08-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Carol  Crean","coPersons":["John Robert Varcoe"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
