The D0 Collaboration comprises about 550 researches from 18 countries and 90 institutions. One of its main objectives is the search for the Higgs boson, a cornerstone of the current theory that describes fundamental particles and their interactions. In other theories, such as Supersymmetry, more than one Higgs boson can exist. The D0 Experiment is ideally placed to search for these particles and to make a statement about the validity of our current understanding of the Higgs mechanism. The role of the Research Assistant will be to support the scientific research of the Principal Investigator who is currently leading the collaboration as D0 Spokesperson. He/she will concentrate on the search for the Higgs boson with special emphasis on tau lepton final states.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I002782/1","grantId":"ST/I002782/1","fundValue":"47950","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Stefan  Soldner-Rembold","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
