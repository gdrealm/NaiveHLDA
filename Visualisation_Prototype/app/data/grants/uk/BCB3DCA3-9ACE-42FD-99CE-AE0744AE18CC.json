{"id":"BCB3DCA3-9ACE-42FD-99CE-AE0744AE18CC","title":"Rapid, on-chip, multiplexed detection of sepsis-causing organisms from blood samples","abstractText":"This proposal brings together BioGene's expertise in development of rapid PCR, instrument design &amp; manufacture and\nsoftware development, with the University of Hull's proven track-record in microfluidic chip design &amp; optimisation, and\nfabrication of devices with real world interfaces, e.g. scene of crime or point of care. Together the group will build a rapid\nand portable, highly-accurate, system capable of extracting pathogen DNA from a blood sample, to determine the presence\nof multiple bacterial species with relevant sub-type specificity, e.g. coagulase status for Staphylococci. All reagents for DNA\nextraction, PCR amplification and separation will be preloaded in the device. The operation and stability of this instrument\nare based on published work from the Hull team.\nBioGene have a proven optical system capable of separating more than 10 dyes, and when this technology is coupled with\nthe ability to electrophoretically separate PCR products down to 2 base pair resolution, using Hull's microfluidic device, the\nnew instrument will be able to discriminate 1000s of distinct PCR fragments. The detection system is based on optical\ndeconvolution of the fluorescence signal generated by the multitude of differentially-labelled products. This method enables\nthe detection of many more targets than is currently possible with conventional sequencers. In this proof of concept study\nwe intend to characterise at least 10 specific factors, i.e. 8 organisms and two species-specific factors; it is anticipated\nhowever that a considerably greater level of multiplexing will be achieved.\nBlood is widely recognised as a &quot;difficult medium&quot; for pathogen nucleic acid amplification, both due to the presence of a\nwide range of PCR inhibitors and the vast excess of human genomic DNA present. The blood sample will first be treated to\nlyse red blood cells and facilitate collection of bacterial cells, initially by filtration, followed by recovery of the concentrated\ncells to provide the starting material for the DNA analysis. The aim is to produce a platform suitable for handling microlitre\nvolumes as this would allow detection of sepsis in neonates and children where blood collection is via capillary tubes. An\nadditional benefit of using smaller volumes of blood is a reduction in complexity and cost of the overall unit.\nThe focus of the PCR system will be to maximise sensitivity and speed. Optimal PCR primer pairs for each target will be\nidentified after extensive in silico modeling before being tested in a real-time PCR format and for compatibility in a multiplex\nmix. A selection of the most common organisms will be chosen from a list of sepsis-cuasing organisms in Hull &amp; East\nYorkshire patients during 2010. Other key factors that will be addressed to deliver the system are: an effective sample\ninterface and automation of DNA extraction; incorporation of the ultra-rapid PCR unit and optical system onto a microfluidic\nplatform; and bespoke control software that includes data storage and user-friendly operator display.\nEach part of the system will be tested extensively during design of the assays themselves as well as construction of the\nproof of concept unit using blood samples from donors spiked with genome equivalents of the targets in order to test\nfunctionality. Testing of the fully-functional device will be completed on blood drawn from patients: i) newly-presenting at\nAccident &amp; Emergency with classic symptoms of sepsis (n=50) or ii) on the Intensive Care Unit (n=15). The pathology\nreports, obtained for clinical assessment, will give a &quot;gold-standard&quot; for comparison. Dr W Townend (Emergency Medicine),\nDr S Bennett (Cardiothoracic Anaesthesia and Intensive Care) and Dr R Meigh (Microbiologist), all Consultants at Hull &amp;\nEast Yorkshire NHS Trust, will act as a clinical advisory team. Appropriate certification, eg. CE marking and IVD\ncertification (98/79/EC), will be applied for once the clinical trials have been completed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K503629/1","grantId":"EP/K503629/1","fundValue":"64620","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The device has not yet been full built and thus no tests have been conducted on patient samples.
