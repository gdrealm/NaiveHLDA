As top 10 Global Cities, London, New York and Toronto are key places to explore educational trends. For example, London and other Global Cities are experiencing headteacher shortages due to headteacher retirements and teacher disinterest in leadership. As a result, leaders are taking up deputy and headteacher roles before they are 38 â€“ younger than ever. This marks the entrance of a new generation of school leaders most of whom are from GenerationX (GenX) born between 1960-80. While GenXers are often described as flexible, globally engaged, technologically savvy, accepting of diversity and collaborative, there is little previous research related to age and leadership.<br /><br />To explore this next generation of leaders, city-based Advisory Groups policy/practice experts and cohorts of 35-45 GenX leaders will be recruited for annual meetings. Annual leader interviews will examine career development; challenges and opportunities; relationships between age, experience, gender, ethnicity, nationality and leadership; and, school-level leadership practices. Outcomes will include City-based leadership profiles, policy briefs, within and across city interview analysis and school-level studies. Evidence will support policy and programme decision-makers and the leaders themselves. Findings, including reports, papers and resources, will be available at: www.globalcityleaders.org.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0532","grantId":"RES-061-25-0532","fundValue":"326165","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We are in the process of completing our final analysis and reporting which will be presented in March 2014. However, the interim findings have led to considerable policy and practice interest. Several examples of each are included below.\n\n\nIn the UK, the findings from the study have been used by the National Fellowship Commission in their deliberations related to teacher recruitment and retention. Local Authorities (incl Camden) and several teaching school alliances are working with our team to consider the implications of the findings for their own recruitment, development and retention strategies for young leaders. In Camden, for example, we are currently designing a strategy, based on our findings to work with women leaders to support their professional development and promotion. We have also been invited to present our findings to middle leaders and teaching school alliances in Hackney, Walthamstow, Camden and other local authorities.\n\nIn Ontario, Canada, our findings have informed a government Think Tank session on district-level succession planning and have informed the Ontario Principals Council's research strategy related to worklife balance. We have also been asked to deliver an Alumni Keynote at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education.\n\nIn New York City, a member of our advisory group is now the Deputy Chancellor of Education for the City and is regularly updated on our findings.

We will have research reports, papers and a book emerging from the analysis between March and December 2014 that will provide a more complete view of the evidence and impact of the study. \n\nHowever, based on our early analysis of Year 1 and 2 data, we identified some surprising patterns in the experience and aspirations of young (under 40-year-old) principals and vice-principals in London, New York City and Toronto. These patterns include but are not limited to: 1) increased prioritisation of work life balance and consideration of alternative careers beyond school leadership if work conditions are counter to a balanced work/life; 2) gendered patterns in leadership experience with London leaders perceiving potential barriers to promotion linked to gender; 3) a large number of our young leader study participants appear to be considering leaving their school leadership positions in the near to mid-term future; and, 4) the challenges and opportunities faced in urban systems in relation to the level of decentralisation and level of responsibility assumed by the school leader. Our final reports and tools will be published by March 31, 2014. We are confident that our findings will point to several key areas of future work including: 1) future research to examine the career paths, leadership and influence of Generation X (under 40 year old) school leaders; 2) expansion of the study to include additional cities and potentially rural areas; 3) policy considerations related to work conditions, equality and leadership retention; 4) local and national policy and professional consideration of the implications of Generation X career patterns and choices; 5) redesign of current approaches to professional development for young leaders; and, 6) redesign of recruitment, development and retention strategies for young leaders Education","dataset":"gtr"}
