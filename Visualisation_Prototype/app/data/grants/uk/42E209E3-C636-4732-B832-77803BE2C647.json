The biological catalysts or enzymes that speed up the reactions in which sugars are linked to other molecules are known as glycosyltransferases. Although these enzymes and are industrially and biologically important, they have not been extensively studied because they are difficult to produce in large amounts. In this project we will take advantage of our ability to produce significant quantities of glycosyltransferases that catalyse the transfer of the sugar mannose onto other molecules. The three dimensional structure of these enzymes will be determined and the information will be used to synthesise inhibitors of these biological catalysts and to use molecular engineering techniques to manipulate their biological properties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E001696/1","grantId":"BB/E001696/1","fundValue":"288868","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gideon John Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
