These measures will be statistically analysed and followed by a perception study in which listeners are asked to rate German and English speech (which is low-pass filtered to filter out verbal content and some voice quality but preserve f0) on how German/English it sounds. </p>\n\n<p>The strength of correlations between speakers' judgements and the various measures of cross-language difference will then be examined. This will determine which measures of pitch range are perceptually relevant in cross-language comparisons.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1858","grantId":"RES-000-22-1858","fundValue":"79959","fundStart":"2006-09-18","fundEnd":"2008-10-17","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This grant finished more than 5 years ago and does not require a report.
