How much is experienced without sight? What can be achieved that is significant within rock climbing by a blind climber and how we can use that experiential activity to learn more or construct new models of our experience of landscape and our representations of that space?\\n\\nThis project begins with the idea that the climbers' landscape is not predicated on the priority of sight but is predicated on a balance of senses. Climbing is a useful methodology because it expands the tactile and physical experience of landscape and because it embodies a level of problem solving and creativity.\\n\\nThe project will further practice based research into experiential landscape to produce new spatial narratives (landscape) stemming from a developmental process of working one to one with a blind rock-climber using new technology, performance and studio based methodologies.\\n\\nIt will develop innovative video techniques incorporating multiple video lenses and WIFI technology (mini lenses and systems already available for security systems) to develop 'finger tip' video documentation of climbing based methodologies - visualising a tactile relationship between the body and it's environment but, combined with other research such as audio, physical construction, also might offer a more complex relational representation of place and being. \\n\\nThe project combines;\\n\\nin-situ research - working outside on specific rock-climbs and in particular noted (within a climbing context) locations producing performative and documentary research incorporating and developing video/audio technologies to gather 'finger tip' research material.\\n\\nand\\n\\nstudio-based research - analytical research developing the in-situ methodologies - including the use of new technologies- and creative research proposing and prototyping outcomes. This will experiment with research materials gathered through in-situ research. It will explore the development and presentation of this material using audio and visual digital editing, reprographic production, textual/braille experimentation, physical construction and installation.\\n\\nIt is exploratory research working towards a variety of contemporary art-based outcomes (but developed to have relevance beyond) predicated on research into spatial engagement and experiential landscape and presenting new landscape artworks and alternative models of spatial narrative construction.\\n\\nThe project will produce outcomes which will be presented and have relevance across fields such as visual arts, geography studies, blind interest groups and outdoor sports/pursuits.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E502563/1","grantId":"AH/E502563/1","fundValue":"43759","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel  Shipsides","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
