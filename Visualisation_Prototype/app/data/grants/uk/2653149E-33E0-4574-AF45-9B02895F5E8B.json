Different regions or ?zones? of the glands produce different steroids, some of which control blood pressure and others stress and glucose regulation and thus the correct development of these zones and the regulation of their steroid output are essential for health. Understanding the processes leading to the formation of the different zones will potentially allow better management of adrenal disorders, which can be fatal. We have shown that a controller of embryonic development, a protein called sonic hedgehog (Shh), is produced in the outer zone of the gland where it is thought the stem cells are located. These are cells which can give rise to all the other cells in the organ and it is thought that the correct regulation of their growth is essential for normal development, with defects leading to disease, including cancer. Shh is a ?morphogen?, a secreted protein which acts upon other cells to affect their behaviour and development, and has been shown to affect stem cells in other tissues. We aim to define the relationship between the stem cells and those that produce and respond to Shh within the adrenal in rats and mice and demonstrate that by altering the activity of Shh we can cause changes in the appearance of the adrenal zones and the amounts of steroids that they produce. These studies will be a great advance as to date we have little insight into how these processes are controlled.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700767","grantId":"G0700767","fundValue":"284256","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  King","coPersons":["Ed  Laufer"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
