High-chromium martensitic steels (such as P91, P92) have been developed for elevated temperature applications and are being used increasingly in supercritical power stations, but there are early signs of cracking around weldments in service. The underlying physics and micro-mechanisms contributing these failures needs to be understood and quantified so that new design and life assessment methods can be developed. The aim of this training research proposal is to exploit the potential of neutron and synchrotron radiation measurement techniques at Central Facilities. The techniques will be applied to measure fabrication residual stresses at multiple length-scales in high Cr weldments and quantify how they relax during service high temperature exposure, to measure and spatially resolve plastic and creep deformation across weldments, and to quantify volumetrically the evolution of creep cavitation leading to cracking. The project will use ENGIN-X, LOQ and SANS_2D instruments at ISIS and JEEP at Diamond and involve the student spending four training placements these instruments. The project fits closely with a programme of high temperature materials for energy research at the Open University where the student will have access to complementary test facilities. Welded test specimens will provided by European Technology Development Ltd whose involvement will facilitate dissemination of the results and capabilities of advanced measurement techniques to the power generation industry worldwide.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G068305/1","grantId":"EP/G068305/1","fundValue":"134870","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have attracted the interest of power sector SME and UK based fossil power generation industry partners.

The research examined the effectiveness of post weld heat treatments and discovered how (Type IV) cracking is influenced by both the heat treatment process, locked in stresses that remain after the treatment, and the weld geometry. A digital image correlation (DIC) technique was applied to resolve tensile and time- dependent creep deformation properties along the length of P91 cross-weld samples for the first time. A confirmatory programme of creep testing is desirable so that the benefits of the new understanding relating to the significance of weld residual stress, post-weld heat treatment and creep damage can be incorporated in new life predictive models. The full field DIC technique can be applied to study welded components in far more spatial detail than previously possible. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
