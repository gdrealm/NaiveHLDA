Such reductions reduce the recalcitrance of cellulose to break down by enzymes and so are relevant to production of biofuels from wood feedstocks.\n*A network of expertise covering the range across the Tree of Life of breakdown mechanisms employed in the release of sugars from woody materials. The review article in preparation will provide an authoritative perspective over the diversity of breakdown mechanisms. The novelty will be to bring current understanding of all the mechanisms together in a single overview. The interest in combining mechanisms from widely different organisms in a single chimeric protein has already lead to a promising new line of enquiry and initial results.
