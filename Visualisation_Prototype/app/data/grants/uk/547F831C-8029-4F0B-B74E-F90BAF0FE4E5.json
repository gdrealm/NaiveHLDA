It will focus, in particular, on four media systems that are significantly different: the market-based, entertainment-centred media of the US, the more public service-orientated media of Finland and Denmark, and the intermediate media system of the United Kingdom. </p> \n<p>It will measure both how much attention the four media systems give to different topics and areas of news, and how much citizens of these four countries know in relation to these. It is hypothesised that Americans will be more informed about celebrities and other areas of ‘soft news’ than Finnish and Danish citizens, but less informed about international events and domestic public affairs, with British citizens falling between these polarities. In-country differences, including the magnitude of the public affairs knowledge gap between different social groups in the US and UK, will also be examined.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1594","grantId":"RES-000-22-1594","fundValue":"25024","fundStart":"2007-01-17","fundEnd":"2007-12-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Curran","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
