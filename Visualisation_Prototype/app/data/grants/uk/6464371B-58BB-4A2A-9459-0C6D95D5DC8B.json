The pilot project is designed to rectify this situation. It will review the development of parks and open spaces in Liverpool from the early-nineteenth century onwards, examine the scale of open space provision, and assess how its role has changed over time. The historical context will provide a framework for reviewing current policy. </p> \n<p>The project will examine the current condition of parks and open spaces, assess the impact of different management regimes, and incorporate the views of different users groups in formulating a policy for the future development of these important community assets. It will lay the basis for a more detailed analysis of the development of parks and open spaces in Liverpool, raise public awareness of their historical and contemporary importance, and inform future strategy by focusing on conservation issues and development priorities of relevance to Liverpoolâ€™s role as European Capital of Culture (2008) and beyond. The pilot project involves a significant degree of collaboration and co-funding with English Heritage and Liverpool City Council.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1571","grantId":"RES-000-22-1571","fundValue":"44917","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2007-01-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"William Robert  Lee","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
