{"id":"FE7D3B38-60D5-4D68-BFCF-A1C20B0542BB","title":"Strongly correlated electron physics in novel materials","abstractText":"The basic physical theories of matter have been known for many decades but increasingly scientists are uncovering materials that challenge some of these accepted tenets, and within these new classes of compounds there is considerable potential for technological innovation. However, before we can run we must walk and a full understanding of the physics of these novel properties is required so the materials can be bent to our will. Notably, recent research has pointed to glaring errors in our standard theory of metals, the underlying cause of which are strong interactions between the constituent electrons. Traditionally, electron-electron interactions have been treated as negligible within metals and generally ignored. However, over the last few decades novel materials have been uncovered in which electron interaction energies are comparable to the electronic kinetic (or translational) energies; the electrons are said to be 'strongly correlated'. As well as appearing to defy the standard theories of metals these systems quite often display striking magnetic phenomena. A particularly exciting aspect is that these phenomena offer us excellent opportunities for technological development. Indeed, several new correlated electron systems discovered in the last few decades have been adapted for solid state devices. Examples include substations for mobile phone networks that incorporate the high-Tc cuprate superconductors and new magnetic read head technologies that exploit the giant magnetoresistance properties of the Fe/Cr/Fe trilayers. This scientific research proposal is centred on producing and studying exotic materials with the goal of discovering new correlated electron quantum states. It focuses two unexplored families of materials, the niobates and iridates that we believe should provide new and interesting avenues of research in the correlated electron field. The research is fundamental in nature but benefits from a very clear connection to electronic device development since new electronic quantum phenomena offer excellent opportunities for applied science.On a broader view, the physics of materials represents a new frontier for scientific pioneering. Physicists are analogous to the intrepid explorers who, in their thirst for discovery and adventure, set out to explore and map the world. In their course of their adventures, those pioneers discovered some startling facts about our planet that challenged many long-held conceptual viewpoints, for example the world was not flat, as had been previously supposed, but spherical. In a similar manner (although with considerably less danger!), we hope to uncover exciting new phenomena that challenge our current perceptions of nature and enhance our understanding of the universe that we live in. It is this thrill of discovery that drives people in materials physics to explore and quantify strange new compounds that will hopefully one day benefit all.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G007357/1","grantId":"EP/G007357/1","fundValue":"286570","fundStart":"2009-09-14","fundEnd":"2013-03-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  My findings have been cited by researchers in the field. 24 publications in peer reviewed journals have been published as a direct result of this work.

Establishment of crystal growth procedures for a wide variety of complex transition metal oxide materials. We have successfully determined crystal growth procedures for the following materials: Mn-doped Sr3Ru2O7, Lu2V2O7, Yb2V2O7, MgV2O4, SrIrO3, Sr2IrO4, Sr3Ir2O7, CaFe2O4, BaNi2V2O8. Two crystal growth techniques were used; optical floating zone (using the infrared image furnace purchased by the grant) and high temperature solvent growth. Crystal masses ranged from milligrams to ~10grams depending on the system and technique employed. Crystal quality was determined by Xray and neutron refinement and electron probe micro analysis (EPMA). \n\nFinally, the oxide-crystal growth laboratory funded by the EPSRC is fully operational and will continue to support UK research and industry for the foreseeable future. \n\n2. Determination of the magnetic ground state and excitations of the materials stated above. Collaborations were established with scientists from University College London, Bristol, Edinburgh, La Plata (Argentina), Goettingen (Germany) and St Andrews. Specific measurement projects include (these projects will be updated regularly as new measurements are performed):\n\na. Measurement of the strength of the Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interaction in the pyrochlore ferromagnets Lu2V2O7 and Yb2V2O7 using inelastic neutron scattering. Measurements performed at ISIS (UK) and ILL (France).\n\nb. Observation of a magnetic memory effect across the structural phase transition in MgV2O4 using inelastic neutron scattering (FRMII (Germany) and ISIS (UK)) and dc magnetometer (MPMS, Quantum Design).\n\nc. Study of the effect of pressure on the lattice structure of MgV2O4. Project to search for proposed metal insulator transition using Xray scattering in a diamond anvil cell. Measurements to be made at Diamond (UK); the beamtime is confirmed.\n\nd. Determination of the magnetic ground state of Sr3Ir2O7 using x-ray resonant magnetic scattering. Measurements performed at ESRF (France) and Diamond (UK). Work published.\n\ne. Investigation into the effect of impurities on the antiferromagnetic state in layered perovskite Sr3Ir2O7. Project to determine the effect of crystal quality and growth conditions on the magnetic ground state.\n\nf. Project to study the effect of chemical and physical pressure on the layered perovskite Sr3Ir2O7. Project aim was to attempt tp suppress the antiferromagnetic state and search for novel correlated electron behaviour. Doping studies using Lanthanum substitution are in progress and beamtime has been awarded to study the effect of pressure in a diamond anvil cell using x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (Diamond, UK).\n\ng. Synthesis and measurement of platinates materials including the discovery of new palatinate CaKPt2O4. Measurements include inelastic neutron scattering at ISIS (UK) to observed the crystal field levels and determine the strength of the spin-orbit coupling in these materials. The potential use of the research will be to supply complex single crystalline oxide materials to UK companies. Typical sectors include thermoelectric (crystals for energy generation), optical (e.g. laser components) and electronic (e.g. substrates for electronic devices). The main route to exploitation of the research support by this grant is through the establishment of a crystal growth facility at Edinburgh for synthesis of oxide materials. We are seeking links with UK industry and academia to provide services to produce high quality single crystals of relevant oxide materials. We have established a partnership with European Thermodynamics Ltd. to explore the possibility of production of novel oxide thermoelectrics in single crystalline form.
