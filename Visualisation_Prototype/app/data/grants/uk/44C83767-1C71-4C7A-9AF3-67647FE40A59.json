But because of its complexity we have very little idea of how the brain works or how it is wired up during development. \nWe are using zebrafish to understand how the brain performs one of its many tasks, namely the processing of visual information. Even at early stages of development zebrafish use vision to hunt small prey and avoid predators. \nWe have generated zebrafish that express fluorescent indicators of neural activity in nerve cells within the visual system. Active neurons fluoresce brightly while silent neurons are dimly fluorescent. Thus, the neurons themselves can tell us when they are active and when they are not. Because young zebrafish are translucent we can see these fluorescent signals inside the brains of living intact larvae. We are using these fluorescent fish to see how nerve cells within the brain respond to different visual stimuli and how these responses change as the larval brain develops.\nInvestigating how the normal brain develops will give us insight into the causes and consequences of disorders of the brain, many of which (schizophrenia, epilepsy and Alzheimer?s for example) place a major burden on society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100162","grantId":"G1100162","fundValue":"485358","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Meyer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
