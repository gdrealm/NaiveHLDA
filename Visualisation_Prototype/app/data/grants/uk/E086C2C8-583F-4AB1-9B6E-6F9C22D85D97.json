The regulation of T-cell activation is a critical step in the immune response. CD28 and CTLA-4 are cell surface molecules which play central roles in the regulation of T-cell function. While CD28 augments T-cell responses, CTLA-4 generates potent signals that dampen the immune response. The importance of CTLA-4 is demonstrated in mice lacking this receptor. They develop a massive lymphoproliferative disorder and die at an early age. In contrast to CD28, most of CTLA-4 is localized inside the cell. This application proposes to investigate how CTLA-4 is transported to the cell surface and controls T-cell responses.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E015395/1","grantId":"BB/E015395/1","fundValue":"299322","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Helga  Schneider","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" CTLA-4 potently inhibits T-cell activation, and yet primarily resides in intracellular compartments. We previously showed that the transmembrane adapter TRIM associates and facilitates the transport of CTLA-4 to the cell surface. This finding identified a novel function of transmembrane adapter proteins (TRAPs), and raised the question whether other related non-raft adapters play a similar role. We identified another adapter termed LAX which binds, co-localizes and facilitates CTLA-4 transport to the cell surface through binding to Rab8, a member of the Rab GTPase superfamily that coordinate intracellular trafficking. Disruption of LAX/Rab8 binding or reduction of LAX or Rab8 expression by small hairpin RNAs resulted in reduced CTLA-4 surface expression. Our findings on LAX suggest that CTLA-4 and possibly other receptors are transported by TRAPs to the cell surface. Optimal regulation of surface expression of the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 is crucial for the balance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals to elicit proper immune responses. Minor changes in surface expression levels could have major effects on the outcome of T-cell activation. Our finding is of potential importance for the development of new therapeutics that will be designed to enhance anti-tumor immunity, or to increase CTLA-4 surface expression in the control of autoimmune disease (i.e. type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis).
