The project aims to investigate how visual salience dynamically affects attentional and oculomotor selection and how these effects are related to the functional properties of the primary visual cortex (V1) and other brain areas. As a focus so far disregarded in psychological research and modelling, we will concentrate on temporal dynamics. We will experimentally probe salience effects within single fixations as well as those occurring over longer periods of time extending over multiple eye movements, to find out when salience derived from different visual feature dimensions affects visual selection and when not. We will develop a neurophysiologically plausible computational model incorporating the dynamics of salience effects. The model will be based on a salience model of V1 and extended to account for differential salience effects as a function of feature dimension and, importantly, time.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006509/1","grantId":"ES/K006509/1","fundValue":"278253","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Li  Zhaoping","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
