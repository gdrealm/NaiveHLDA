{"id":"1350E625-F254-4598-ACA2-586ABEECAA13","title":"Support for the CTA Project Scientist","abstractText":"The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a global (27 nation, &gt;1000 person, ~&pound;150M capital) project to construct the first facility-level ground-based gamma-ray observatory. CTA is in a prototyping/preparatory phase with heavy UK involvement and will be completed ~2020. CTA has a very broad science case (see the pro-forma submitted to the Programmatic Review) and builds on the success of current generation Cherenkov telescope arrays such as HESS (which received the Rossi and Descartes prizes). I have recently been appointed as the Project Scientist of CTA, and here a request financial support for a post-doctoral research assistant to support me in my research whilst I hold this post, to strengthen UK scientific impact early in the CTA programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K006452/1","grantId":"ST/K006452/1","fundValue":"112808","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"James Anthony Hinton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
