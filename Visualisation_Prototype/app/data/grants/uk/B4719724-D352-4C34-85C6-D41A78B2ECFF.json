{"id":"B4719724-D352-4C34-85C6-D41A78B2ECFF","title":"Enfolded Identities: Cloth and Material Presence","abstractText":"This (single author) book explores the intimate associations of cloth with touch, skin, the body, and modes of thinking, feeling and being. It will consist of a series of original essays, each starting with a (textile-related) word touch, weave, fold, stain, stitch, matter, and materiality. \nCentral will be an analysis of contemporary art that explores the emotive qualities of cloth, including the work of internationally recognised contemporary artists such as Chohreh Feyzdjou, Doris Salcedo, Mona Hatoum, Cecilia Vecuina, Anne Wilson, Zoe Leonard, Sooja Kim, and Maria Chevska. This will take an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon visual culture, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and anthropology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113110/1","grantId":"113110/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Pennina  Barnett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
