{"id":"E6A72BA6-4DBD-4D17-A38D-E3FB9365553C","title":"Isotype revisited","abstractText":"This project is about the Isotype movement. Isotype (International System Of Typographic Picture Education) was a method for assembling, configuring, and disseminating information and statistics through pictorial means. It was known first as the Vienna Method, and was developed by Otto Neurath (and colleagues) in 1920s Vienna at the Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum where it assisted in explaining social and economic issues to the general public.\\n\\nThe work of the Isotype movement has played a major role in twentieth-century graphic design thinking. Otto Neurath is being increasingly identified as a key figure in twentieth-century design history, and so his activities and Isotype need re-evaluation. This project is concerned with Isotype in representative contexts. It aims to clarify better-known dimensions of Isotype, explore its less well-understood interests and innovations, and evaluate its legacy. It seeks, through comparative means, to make known the progress of Isotype and re-calibrate its significance to design history and information visualisation.\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E008895/1","grantId":"AH/E008895/1","fundValue":"380680","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Eric  Kindel","coPersons":["Sue  Walker"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
