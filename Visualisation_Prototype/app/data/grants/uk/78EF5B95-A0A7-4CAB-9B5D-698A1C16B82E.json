One important example is the field of Atto-second Science where laser light and the electrons of matter interact on the atto-second time-scale making possible, for example, the shortest-ever pulses of VUV light. One atto-second is only one millionth-millionth-millionth of a second but electrons driven by strong laser light collide violently with others and move distances large compared to the size of an atom on the atto-second time-scale of several hundred atto-seconds. Another important example is the recent appreciation that ionizing radiation damages living animals and plants by bringing about strand breaks in the DNA molecule through a multi-electron interaction.Such newly emerging areas of Science involve large experimental teams in the UK and around the world who publish their research findings in top journals such as Nature and Science. Despite this, there does not yet exist anywhere in the world a set of computer codes capable of calculations of sufficient sophistication to be useful in conjunction with the laboratory experiment effort, in driving the Science forward. Such calculations demand the full power of present (and prospective) High Performance Computing - available through machines which presently can cost 100M and upwards.The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a suite of high-quality computer codes that will be widely used; will harness such high performance computing machines most effectively over many years; and will relate directly to areas of Science (brief descriptions of two such areas given above) where a detailed account of multi-electron dynamics in electrons and molecules is essential to driving the Science forward.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G055416/1","grantId":"EP/G055416/1","fundValue":"416088","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The most immediate non-academic impact is found in the training of young researchers in large-scale parallel computing.

Recent laser technology has enabled experiment to influence the electronic motion on a timescale corresponding to orbit time of an electron around the nucleus. The computer codes developed enable us to investigate these processes computationally in an accurate fashion by taking the interactions between all electrons into account.\n\nThrough development of this code, we have made significant computational advances in atomic physics. We have combined the capability of basis-set techniques to describe multi-electron atoms with the computational efficiency of finite-difference techniques once an electron has moved away from the nucleus and the remaining electrons. This technique has been demonstrated to be extremely promising for efficient high-accuracy calculations, and is portable to other areas of computational science.\n\nThe codes have been specifically designed with high-performance computing facilities in mind. We have therefore explored new parallelisation schemes, in which the basis-set description is parallelised over symmetry first, and then distributed further\nover MPI tasks within each symmetry. The finite-difference region has been separated into sectors associated with MPI tasks, and then\nfurther parallelised using OpenMP threads. The resulting code has been demonstrated to efficiently exploit up to 3000 cores working simultaneously on a single problem.\n\nThe codes have been applied to a range of scientific problems of topical interest. We have been able to invetigate photoionization time delays and have provided benchmark data for time delays in Ne. The time-dependent R-matrix codes have been applied to harmonic generation, where we have been able to demonstrate that the interplay between channels can be important in atoms, and that harmonic generation is not always associated with the lowest ionization threshold. Using the newly developed codes, we have been able to extend our description of harmonic generation into the highly challenging mid-IR regime, which is increasingly attracting experimental interest. Most recently, we have applied the codes to the study of double ionization processes, of importance at newly opened VUV and X-ray free-electron laser facilities. The prime aim of theoretical atomic physics is to provide understanding of basic atomic processes. These processes play a key role in the commissioning of VUV and X-ray free-electron laser facilities to demonstrate that these facilities perform as planned. Theoretical support is key, as validation of experiments on atoms in entirely new circumstances. Hence the findings are of prime use in the development of new laser technology.\n\nThe code development has proven to inspire planned code developments to understand ultr-fast dynamics in molecules. The demonstration that techniques work well for atoms will encourage molecular physics researchers to adapt their codes along similar\nlines to extend the techniques to molecular systems. In the future, this may lead to a better understanding of charge-transfer processes in particular, a type of process critical in vision.\n\nThe computational techniques have proven to be very accurate indeed. The combination of basis-set techniques and finite-difference techniques works well, and may be taken forward by other computational scientists in their areas of research. The need for accuracy in the time-dependent codes has necessitated improvements in the accuracy of the underlying basic R-matrix codes, and researchers using these codes can therefore obtain more\naccurate data on electron-scattering processes and photoionization processes of importance in all areas of plasma physics, including fusion science.
