{"id":"D4A55F5E-807C-469D-BA4E-5075BDE3D050","title":"Optical Music Recognition from Multiple Sources","abstractText":"Digital images of scores are now available in very large numbers from services such as IMSLP (International Music Scores Library Project), which has images of about a quarter of a million scores of over 70,000 pieces of music. Most of this information is opaque to computers, because a score image is a picture rather than a source of musical information. To get at the musical information, the score needs to be 'read'. While software to read digital images of words, turning them into encoded text (Optical Character Recognition, OCR), is now common and underlies such services as Google Books, the equivalent task for music (Optical Music Recognition, OMR) has proven to be a very difficult. The accuracy of the results is often low, and some researchers have reported that the time taken to find and correct errors is so great as to make it just as quick to enter the data by hand. In other cases, considerable time is required in training OMR software to get good results from a particular source.\n\nThis project aims to turn the problem of large quantities of inaccessible data into an advantage, and make use of the quantity of information available to improve the accuracy of OMR. Multiple images of the score of a piece of music are often available, and to use more than one image increases the information available for the OMR task. This project will take two approaches to improving OMR through the use of multiple sources. The first, post-processing, approach will result in software to take the outputs of multiple runs of OMR software on different sources for the same piece of music, and combine these outputs into a single, more accurate, representation of the piece. The second approach will use multiple information within the OMR software (adapting existing open-source software) to improve the accuracy of recognition. A part of one score which is difficult to read will become easier if information can be used from part of another score which represents the same part of the piece.\n\nThe outcome will be new techniques and software modules for OMR (both post-processing of results and new multi-input OMR software), protocols for the use of OMR with multiple sources, and information about the levels of accuracy which can be expected from OMR software.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L009870/1","grantId":"AH/L009870/1","fundValue":"77811","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan Alexander Marsden","coPersons":["Kia  Ng"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":" This project is still on-going.
