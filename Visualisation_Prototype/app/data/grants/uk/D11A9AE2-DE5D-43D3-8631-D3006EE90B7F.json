{"id":"D11A9AE2-DE5D-43D3-8631-D3006EE90B7F","title":"International Workshop on Advanced Particle Science and Engineering","abstractText":"The Institute of Particle Science and Engineering (IPSE) at the University of Leeds is a world-leading centre of expertise in the engineering science of particulate systems. Members of IPSE have a very strong international profile and the wider UK community in particle technology is recognised as being probably the strongest in the world. Given the importance of particle products to the world economy, estimated at $10T per year, this strength provides many important research opportunities for the UK science and engineering community. To build upon this leading position, we are proposing to host an international workshop on Particle Technology involving leading researchers from all of the major centres of expertise around the world. The workshop will be held over 3 days from December 15th to 17th and will bring together world-leading researchers in particle technology together with the next-generation of researchers. Leadership of the workshop and its outcomes will be led by expert delegates in this field from Japan, Australia, Germany, US and the UK. The workshop will include presentations of cutting edge research from selected researchers followed by active discussion sessions which will explore how we can exploit this research and build upon it further through international collaborative research programs. A session on the future research trends in particle technology and how these can be developed in a collaborative framework will also be held. The workshop will further develop existing links between particle scientists as well as initiating important new collaborations between young researchers. A major focus of the workshop will be to give the opportunity to the next generation of particle scientists to interact and build strong collaborative relationships.IPSE has an international reputation for its academic excellence and a large number of state-of-the-art devices for multi-scale particulate science and engineering research. The research groups within the Institute are world-renowned for their work on particle technology. Hence, the Institute provides a ideal candidate for organising and chairing this workshop. All research groups from IPSE would participate, primarily through the post-doctoral research fellows and group leaders to add to the international expertise to the discussions taking place during the workshop.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H030204/1","grantId":"EP/H030204/1","fundValue":"11978","fundStart":"2009-11-16","fundEnd":"2010-02-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Richard Biggs","coPersons":["Olivier Jean CAYRE"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
