In addition, cancers induce inflammation to create an environment that helps support their development and progression. We are interested in understanding these links between cancer and inflammation at the level of individual molecules. Our research has focused on the migration of white blood cells into tissues from the blood, a key component of all inflammation. These cells normally provide protection from infection and help repair damaged tissue, but they also bring with them a host of molecules that inadvertently help support cancers. If we could understand how white blood cell migration occurs, we may be able to develop medicines that interfere with it. This is a relatively under-explored area of cancer biology, but could yield new medicines for treating cancer patients. Excitingly, we have found that a molecule called CXCR2, which is critical for the migration of white blood cells into tissues during inflammation, plays an indispensable role in assisting the development of cancers in the skin and colon of mice. The proposed work plans to build on these observations and aims to fully understand how and why CXCR2 has such profound pro-cancer activity. Significantly, medicines that block the function of CXCR2 are already under development and, using mouse models of cancer, we plan to test whether they have real therapeutic potential. We believe these studies will not only advance our understanding of the interactions between inflammation and cancer, but also have the potential to lead to the development of novel approaches to cancer treatment in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900992","grantId":"G0900992","fundValue":"404388","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Nibbs","coPersons":["Owen James  Sansom"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
