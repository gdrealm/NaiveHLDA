Following approval from Brunel University Research Ethics Committee, a randomised control trial will be conducted to measure the effectiveness of the decision aid design, by identifying if novices who receive the training are able to make decisions more like experienced professionals.</p>\n\n<p>Educational resources will be hosted on a dedicated research website.These will include podcasts of professionals giving their perspective on case examples of financial abuse and discussing the challenges of decision making in this field. In addition seminar training activities will be designed so that the findings can be used to inform small group training.These resources will be evaluated to ensure suitability for practice education.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-189-25-0334","grantId":"RES-189-25-0334","fundValue":"98402","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Priscilla  Harries","coPersons":["Mary Lynn Gilhooly","Kenneth  Gilhooly"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
