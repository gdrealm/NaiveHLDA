In some individuals, gambling spirals out of control and takes on the features of an addiction. Research into the causes of drug addiction in humans is hampered by the fact that the drugs themselves often have a damaging effect on the brain, so that it is very difficult to separate the causes from the consequences of the addiction. As a ?behavioural addiction? where no drug is consumed, problem gambling may offer some important insights into the mechanisms by which all addictions develop. The current proposal is concerned with ?pathological gambling?, the most severe form of the disorder, and we will recruit a large group of these subjects as they begin a treatment program at a specialist NHS clinic in London. Little is known about the psychological make-up of pathological gamblers in the UK, because few treatment facilities were available until recently. We will compare pathological gamblers (n=100) against healthy non-gamblers (n=50) on questionnaire measures and a computerised assessment of impulsivity (the tendency to make quick or unplanned actions) and compulsivity (the tendency to repeat an action when it is no longer productive). These psychological constructs are central to recent theories of addiction. We expect that around half our gamblers will also be addicted to either alcohol, nicotine or illicit drugs, and we will compare gamblers with and without substance addictions on the psychological assessment. We will monitor how the gamblers? symptoms improve with treatment, at a 12- and 24- week follow-up, in order to test whether psychological function at the beginning of treatment can be used to predict which gamblers will respond best. Finally, we will recruit 6 gamblers and 6 non-gamblers for a brain scan using a radioactivity-labelled dopamine drug, in order to measure levels of dopamine function in the gamblers. Changes in dopamine function are a robust finding in the substance addictions, but have not been examined in the behavioural addictions. The brain imaging data will constitute a feasibility pilot study for a larger funding bid to look at brain chemistry in problem gambling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802725","grantId":"G0802725","fundValue":"207046","fundStart":"2009-09-28","fundEnd":"2011-09-27","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Luke  Clark","coPersons":["Ulrich  Muller","Henrietta  Bowden-Jones"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
