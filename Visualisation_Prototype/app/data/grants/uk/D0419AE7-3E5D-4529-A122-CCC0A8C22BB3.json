The proposal is designed around three components:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Preparing two backing papers to inform and frame an expert seminar discussion</li>\n\n <li>An expert seminar on the topic of ‘mobilising communities for social control’ to be held at Cardiff University</li>\n\n <li>Writing a paper distilling the findings and dissemination.&nbsp;</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The concept of co-production is central to current debates around ‘the Big Society’ and attends to how communities and individuals connect and collaborate with public service providers to design and deliver solutions to social problems.</p>\n\n<p>This proposal seeks to develop conceptual resources that might help to better frame understandings of how and why citizens are involved in the provision of local social control, and what factors facilitate or impede such participation. This work will be informed by previous empirical studies by the applicants looking at the interface between police and communities in Neighbourhood Policing. In adopting this focus, it also speaks to wider debates about the intersections between formal and informal modes of social control, and the extent to which effective policing is needed to catalyse community mobilisation</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-193-25-0007","grantId":"RES-193-25-0007","fundValue":"13903","fundStart":"2011-02-10","fundEnd":"2011-08-10","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Innes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
