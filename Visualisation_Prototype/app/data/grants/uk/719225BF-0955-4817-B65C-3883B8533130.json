The first is to extend and deepen theoretical understandings of the processes involved in policy interpretation and enactments in schools. The second is to produce detailed, critical and contextualised accounts of the enactment of three different policies in three 'similar but different' school contexts.The study will contribute to debates in policy analysis about processes of policy 'implementation' and serve to inform policy stakeholders concerned to understand the relationships between policy making and what happens in practice in settings where multiple policies are being simultaneously interpreted and enacted. It will provide a grounded account of the complexities of policy enactments and a practical understanding of the challenges presented to schools in the current policy context within which many teachers express a sense of policy overload and constant change. The study will generate new knowledge about policy enactment through a grounded exploration of the localised nature of policy actions and hence differences between schools. The study will also begin to 'explain' the differences between schools in their enactment of policies taking into account contextual, historical, material and interpretational features of the schools.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1484","grantId":"RES-062-23-1484","fundValue":"268606","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Ball","coPersons":["Margaret (Meg) Mary Maguire"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
