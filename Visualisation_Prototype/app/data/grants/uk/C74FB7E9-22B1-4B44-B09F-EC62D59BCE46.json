{"id":"C74FB7E9-22B1-4B44-B09F-EC62D59BCE46","title":"The European Commission in Question: Challenge, Change and Performance","abstractText":"The European Commission is one of the world's most powerful international administrations.&nbsp; It occupies a central position in the political system of the European Union, and exerts far-reaching political and policy influence in the member states and beyond. Yet much about the officials who work for it, how it operates and the way it has responded to the challenges of administrative reform and enlargement, remains unknown.&nbsp; This project addresses these questions.&nbsp; It investigates: how the Commission functions as an administration; the extent to which Commission officials are distinctive in terms of their work or background; and how the Commission compares with other bureaucracies, national and international. It will assess the impact of enlargement on the internal functioning and values of the administration, and examine the effects of administrative reform on its operation and management.&nbsp; The project team will conduct the largest survey of Commission officials ever carried out by independent researchers, followed by a programme of interviews across the organization. The dataset thereby created will provide primary source material for an original and detailed analysis of the organization.&nbsp; It will inform a rigorous assessment of the Commissionâ€™s capacity as a modern twenty-first century administration.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1188","grantId":"RES-062-23-1188","fundValue":"209656","fundStart":"2008-08-19","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Hussein  Kassim","coPersons":["John  Peterson","Andrew Gordon Thompson"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
