In South Asia, high rates of CVD are observed at a younger age than in other countries, causing a greater loss of productive life years with severe economic consequences. High blood pressure (BP) confers the greatest attributable risk to death and disease associated with CVD. \n\nOur Wellcome Trust funded Control of Blood Pressure and Risk Attenuation (COBRA) trial (2004 to 2007) in Karachi, Pakistan, suggested the combined strategy of family based home health education (HHE) delivered by trained community health workers (CHW) plus care of patients by trained private general practitioners (GP) to optimally manage hypertension had the most marked beneficial impact on BP compared to usual care, or single interventions. However, the COBRA intervention was designed for an urban South Asian setting, where private GPs cater to over 75% of the patients seeking care. Therefore, the trial did not use the public health infrastructure per se, nor did it evaluate whether mid-level providers (MLP) can deliver first steps of hypertension care including prescribing first and second line anti-hypertensive medications. \n\nMost of South Asia is still rural (64% Pakistan, 85% Sri Lanka) where prevalence of hypertension is high and healthcare infrastructure and provider characteristics are very different compared to the urban setting. About 40-50% patients in rural Pakistan and Sri Lanka seek care (including prescription medications) from MLPs (visiting nurse, dispenser, assistant medical officer) at the government community clinics. Thus whether hypertension management by this cadre of MLPs is effective, especially when rolled out using government healthcare infrastructure is not known. Our proposed study is designed to answer this question in rural Pakistan and Sri Lanka. \n\nWe propose a cluster RCT in 30 rural communities in Pakistan and Sri Lanka including 2500 individuals with hypertension with 2 year follow-up to evaluate the effectiveness of &quot;triple approach&quot; of combining intervention by 1) HHE plus 2) trained government primary health center MLP plus 3) trained private practitioners or &quot;dual approach&quot; of combining intervention of 1 and 2 only compared to no intervention (or usual care) on lowering blood pressure, and to determine whether these approaches are incrementally cost-effective. \n\nThe delivery of care by the various public providers and the private sector is now recommended by the World Health Organization in several communicable disease control programs, such as Directly Observed Treatment (DOTS) for tuberculosis and management of malaria. However, evidence on the effectiveness of using the same platform for chronic non-communicable disease management is rather scarce. \n\nMoreover, wider discussion among the relevant stakeholders in South Asia to refine and implement the proposed activities would be beneficial, and would increase the likelihood of up-scaling the cost-effective strategies which could also be extended to other chronic diseases (and even infectious diseases) in an integrated manner that is potentially sustainable and applicable in rural settings across many Asian countries with similar ethnic populations and healthcare infrastructure. Comparing and contrasting the experiences from Sri Lanka and Pakistan should also provide valuable lessons not only for these two countries but also for other countries in the region and beyond.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L004224/1","grantId":"MR/L004224/1","fundValue":"201807","fundStart":"2014-05-17","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tazeen  Jafar","coPersons":["Truls  Ostbye","Benjamin Adam Haaland","Imtiaz  Jehan","Aamir  Hameed","Asita  De Silva","Ananda Rajitha  Wickremasinghe","Shah  Ebrahim","Eric Andrew  Finkelstein"],"organisation":"National University of Singapore","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
