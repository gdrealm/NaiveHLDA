How do we explore a range of photographic practices, from the language of backdrops and the presentation of the self in studios, the circulation of carts-de-visit, the spread of collective and institutional photographs, news photography and amateur photography to 'art' photography from 1844 to 1978, and can we locate sufficiently meaningful material in private, corporate and museum collections, photographic archives and rare libraries to envisage a much broader project?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119190/1","grantId":"119190/1","fundValue":"42535","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Dikotter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Oriental & African Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
