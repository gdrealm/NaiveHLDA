The surveys are distinctive from previous studies in the lengths to which each has gone in establishing and screening the population of MNCs, making them the most comprehensive investigations in each country. They were closely coordinated, presenting the opportunity to shed unprecedented light on the crucial, yet poorly understood, role of MNCs as employers in the global economy.<br /><br />http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wbs/projects/mncemployment/</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2080","grantId":"RES-062-23-2080","fundValue":"123299","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tony James Edwards","coPersons":["Paul Kerr Edwards","Paul  Marginson","Olga  Tregaskis","Anthony  Ferner"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
