At synapses, one neuron releases chemical neurotransmitters, which activate receptor proteins on the other neuron. In this way, the electrical signal can &quot;jump&quot; the synapse in the form of a chemical intermediate. This idea - of synapses being a dedicated site for neuron to neuron communication - has been a bedrock concept in neuroscience for more than a century. In recent years, however, the simplicity of this idea has been challenged. One of the challenges has come from the discovery that neurons can release neurotransmitter from many parts of the cell, not just the synaptic terminal. This form of release has been termed &quot;ectopic&quot; transmission, as the neurotransmitter will not be targeted to the synapse, but will instead enter the bulk medium surrounding the cells. \n The role of ectopic release in brain physiology is largely unknown. One concept that has good supporting evidence is that ectopic release of transmitter activates receptor proteins on non-neuronal cells termed glia. Glial cells outnumber neurons in the brain by ten to one, and are crucial for the maintenance of a healthy microenvironment. Key roles played by glia are the control of ion concentration gradients, the clearance of neurotransmitter from the extracellular space after release, and the supply of nutrients to neurons. Breakdown in any of these functions leads to disease, and glial dysfunction has been implicated in many neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis.\n Ectopic release is thought to promote the interaction of glial cells with neurons, both physically and functionally. In particular, evidence suggests that ectopic release promotes the projection of the glial cell membrane around synapses, encouraging the clearance of neurotransmitter that escapes the synapse. Other evidence suggests that ectopic transmission may alter the electrical properties of the glial cells, altering their ability to redistribute potassium ions from sites of high neuronal activity to sites of low activity. \nRecent work from our laboratory has shown that the strength of ectopic release can vary according to the frequency at which neurons are stimulated. As such, it appears that the extent of ectopic transmission will continually change over time, and that the strength of coupling between neurons and glia will similarly change. We also have evidence that ectopic release can activate receptors on neurons, altering the strength of transmission at the synapse. \n Understanding the interplay between stimulation frequency, the strength of ectopic release, the strength of synaptic transmission, and the strength of neuron-glial coupling is a formidable puzzle. It is also difficult to make sense of this puzzle, as there are currently too many unanswered questions about ectopic transmission to make informed judgements about the importance of the phenomenon in healthy brain function. We wish to answer some of the questions - specifically: where precisely does ectopic release occur, does ectopic release activate receptors on neurons as well as glia, and what short-term and long-term effects does ectopic transmission have on glial cells? Answering these questions will give us a much better chance of understanding what the purpose of this previously uninvestigated form of neurotransmitter release is in normal brain function, and whether dysfunction in ectopic transmission may have a role in the onset of brain diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J015660/1","grantId":"BB/J015660/1","fundValue":"409112","fundStart":"2013-01-15","fundEnd":"2016-04-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tomas Cynric Bellamy","coPersons":["Stephen  Coombes"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
