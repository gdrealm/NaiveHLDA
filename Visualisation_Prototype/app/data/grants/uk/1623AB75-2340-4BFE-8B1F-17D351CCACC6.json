Such failures produce false negative results, which are not acceptable when screening critical samples, for instance during outbreaks of epidemic viral disease in animals or humans. It is therefore highly desirable, if not essential, to include control RNA at the earliest possible step in the process, so that a positive control signal can validate every step from sample acquisition to final amplification and detection. However RNA is a fragile molecule and an unprotected RNA standard is very rapidly degraded. We have shown that this degradation can be prevented by encapsulating the RNA within a plant virus particle (N-cap RNA) and, furthermore, that such particles can act as highly effective in-tube controls. We now need to develop methods for the rapid production of such controls for a wide range of target diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K01093X/1","grantId":"BB/K01093X/1","fundValue":"137513","fundStart":"2012-11-06","fundEnd":"2013-11-05","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used to develop standards for use in diagnostic PCR reactions and for proficiency testing.

These controls are based on a disabled version of cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV). The use of a disabled virus means that the controls can be deployed without the need for containment. Originally the controls were intended for use in conjunction with veterinary diagnostic reactions but it is now clear they can be deployed in the human health sector.
