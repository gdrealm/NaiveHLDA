Digital models currently isolate the designer in the closed digital world, taking attention away from these important connections. A new mode of design is necessary in the UK construction industry for it to sustain its competitiveness and address major 21st century issues such as climate change. Engineering research is often focused on tools, either those to add increasingly detailed data to a finite set of building components; or those to encode algorithms for simulating processes and behaviours. Yet Dr Whyte found that the introduction of integrated models on major projects and programmes has not improved effectiveness, but has instead had unintended and negative consequences. In some instances these include generating too much data; making work progress harder to track and displaying designs in ways that make them look reliable before they have been fully tested. There is a need to transform the research field by focusing on effective visualization of design data in both digital and physical design environments.Rapid developments in visual interfaces, largely driven by the gaming and entertainment industries, provide an opportunity to develop more intuitive interfaces, taking 3D digital models out of the 2D screen and making them visible within physical design environments. The aspiration is to make digital models central to the conversation between engineers, manufacturers, fabricators, assemblers, clients and users. There is the potential to sit around a model; to walk around it together; to overlay and interrogate multiple environmental simulations and to compare and contrast design intent with scanned as-built models. The proposed Design Innovation Research Centre (DIRC) will develop new ways of visualizing data for shared design inquiry. The team will scientifically study design activities; and develop novel engineering solutions. DIRC's scientific study team will capture best-practice on major international projects. DIRC's engineering solutions team will create new tools and processes for design innovation. As an open and networked laboratory, the Centre will be the hub of intellectual activity, spanning across disciplines with a virtual and physical presence and nodes in both university and industry. Through inter-disciplinary research and its strong connections with industry, DIRC will be able to react quickly, will operate at the forefront of the research area and will add value by developing skills that are needed within academia and industry. Challenging Engineering funding enables the applicant to bring together and develop a multidisciplinary team of researchers (from engineering, design, ICT, building science and management) to address the challenges of design in the digital economy. The Centre will extend Dr Whyte's trajectory of work, recognizes the importance of shared 3D visualization in decision-making and the need for flexible solutions that do not lock designers into particular approaches too early in the design process. It will thrive through strong research and through deep engagement with industrial partners and associate members. At the end of the Challenging Engineering funding period the Centre will be an internationally-excellent, sustainable, and actively-disseminating, centre of excellence in the UK for 21st century design innovation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H02204X/1","grantId":"EP/H02204X/1","fundValue":"1050340","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings inform the delivery of major infrastructure projects in the UK, and have been included in the learning legacy programme from the London 2012 Olympics; Institution of Civil Engineers events, advice and briefing sheets; and reports to Crossrail. They contribute to the delivery of BIM Level 2 in the UK construction industry; and to the shaping of BIM Level 3. Our work has changed discourses in industry, which now sees projects as delivering both physical and digital outputs; and have brought into view new challenges, such as configuration management - an area that we brought Airbus, CERN and Crossrail together to address; and transnational design practices - where we worked with colleagues in India and a number of UK-based engineering design firms with offices in India. We have recently been working with major infrastructure owners, through the Infrastructure UK Client Working Group collaborative teams project, looking at how the use of digital asset information can enable collaborative working and thus add value to clients. We have also piloted the mobile visualization environment that was developed through the grant with our major industry partners including Crossrail; and as well as disseminating outputs through publication in international journals, we have sought to disseminate findings to key stakeholders through the Centre advisory boards and workshops related to particular areas of our work.

We have examined how project delivery is changing; developed new techniques for visualizing large data-sets and managing change control; and new knowledge about how reliability can be achieved across the organizations involved in the delivery of complex engineering projects. Achievements include:\n\n1. Significant new knowledge about managing complex projects using digital information, with specific outputs on data hand-over to owners and operators, building on work with the London 2012 Olympics, and on configuration management, through work with Airbus, CERN and Crossrail. Major projects, in civil engineering, aerospace, and oil and gas, now deliver both a physical and virtual output; and their delivery may involve globally distributed teams.\n\n2. New technologies and processes for collaborative working. While these are developed and tested off-line for the delivery of major projects, we have worked with our industry partners to make sure they are valuable to industry. These include a Mobile Visualization Environment (3D-MOVE); work-flows for rapidly generating immersive visualizations from Building Information Modelling (BIM) data; techniques for evaluating construction safety in immersive environments.\n\n3. New insights regarding new modes of design in the digital economy and value to infrastructure clients. We have developed new understanding of transnational design work; the visual nature of design work; and the diffusion and impact of BIM in engineering and architectural design practices. Our work with the Infrastructure UK Client Working Group collaborative project teams programme has led to new understanding of the role of digital information in supporting collaborative behaviours. This work opens up new research questions about the better use of digital information in operations and maintenance. Our industry partners are building on the outputs of our research to develop their digital data and visualization strategies. The research provides an academic foundation for new areas of research on delivering projects using digital information. The BIM agenda in construction is a major pathway to impact, but the work has also involved engagement with and impact on major infrastructure projects and partners in areas such as aerospace and manufacturing. For example, in the USA, the formation of the ASCE digital project delivery committee referenced this research as a source; and there are also related activities at the Transport Research Board (an international conference held in Washington) which similarly reference this work.
