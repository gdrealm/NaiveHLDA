{"id":"64801D71-A14E-4C07-9B2F-6FFBAFD47C4E","title":"Liverpool Telescope Operational Phase","abstractText":"The Liverpool Telescope is the world's largest robotic telescope. As a robotic telescope, it operates on its own every night, carrying out a queue of observations defined by a wide community of astronomers. Robotic telescopes are particularly suitable for making repeated sequences of observations of time variable sources (monitoring), or for rapid response to objects which last only a short time, such as Novae, Supernovae and Gamma Ray Burst sources. This application is for continuation of funding for the maintenance and operation of the Liverpool Telescope, both in its role as a national facility and also as the primary component of RoboNet.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E003303/1","grantId":"PP/E003303/1","fundValue":"1791360","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"MF  Bode","coPersons":["Iain Allan  Steele","Christopher Alfred Collins","David  Carter"],"organisation":"Liverpool John Moores University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
