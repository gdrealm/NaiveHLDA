{"id":"23D41952-726B-4EB8-9B37-72CEB3AA21CD","title":"Confronting Tragedy in Modern Literature","abstractText":"The aim of this study is to present an innovative view of literary responses to tragedy in the modern era. Though tragedy has and continues to be much discussed by critics, with major studies by George Steiner, Raymond Williams, and more recently Terry Eagleton, this study will argue that it is not productive to try to establish a concept of tragedy that will be generally applicable to modern writing but rather stresses the variety of positions that modern writers have adopted towards tragedy, some rejecting it, others producing a new conception of tragedy based on modern pessimistic perspectives, or reconstructing tragedy in the light of Nietzsche's revisionist view of Greek tragedy. It will also consider whether tragedy is reconcilable with the Theatre of the Absurd and also will discuss its relation to the postmodern. \nIt will differ from the studies by the critics mentioned above not only in its general perspective but by focusing in greater detail on the analysis of representative texts in order to bring out the implicit debate and confrontation among modern writers on the issues, both philosophical and artistic, raised by tragedy. I hope this study will contribute to and further critical debate on the subject of tragedy in the modern period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E503381/1","grantId":"AH/E503381/1","fundValue":"29823","fundStart":"2007-01-15","fundEnd":"2007-05-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kenneth  Newton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
