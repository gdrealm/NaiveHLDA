{"id":"E18D3B29-0FF3-4262-B60A-9A9B6CAE5F14","title":"Adaptive mesh simulation of different scale flood inundation","abstractText":"Flood disasters, including coastal flooding and river inundation are a major threat to human life and assets. In the UK, a combination of climate change and increasing socio-economic vulnerability mean that the risk of flooding is expected to increase significantly during the 21st century unless the current policies for flood management and investment levels can be modified.The Flood Risk Management Research Consortium (FRMRC) has been funded by EPSRC and other government departments and agencies to improve understanding of the cause of flooding and to develop tools for flood risk management. The development and assessment of flood simulation tools has been one of the consortium's research topics. This proposal extends the work in FRMRC by proposing to assess and improve a computer model of flood flows that can adapt to local topography and obstruction, efficiently generating accurate solution even where the flow is very complex. This will mean that, for the first time, very accurate simulation can be applied at a range of different scales (from small to very large), including broad scale interactions of flood flow. This proposed project is consistent with the FRMRC research aims, yet is original in that this is the first time the adaptive model will be applied to simulate large-scale real world flood scenarios. The model will take advantages of modern numerical techniques including adaptive mesh methodologies for efficiency and accuracy, a local time step approach for efficiency, a simplified diffusion wave method for efficiency, and fully 2D shallow flow solution for accuracy. It will result in a robust, efficient and accurate numerical tool for flood simulation at different scales for a wide range of applications. Particularly, the model will allow simulation of very large scale flood inundation (e.g. the whole Thames Estuary area) whilst also resolving the effect of local flows at flood defences. This task is currently beyond most of the existing numerical tools as the scale of the floodplain is very large and the topographic features are complicated, including urban structures.The proposed project, involving further developing an existing adaptive quadtree grid based shallow flow model for flood simulation in different scales by including some model numerical techniques, will be completed in 3 years. The first two years of the project will focus on further developing and accessing the computer model. Problems related to scale effects, accuracy of approximations, etc. will be properly addressed. The efficiency, accuracy and robustness of the model will be confirmed by comparing with existing computer models for flood simulation recommended by FRMRC. In the last year, the improved computer model will be applied to predict future flood inundation scenarios in the whole Thames Estuary area due to extreme tidal conditions with different return periods, including broad scale interaction of flooding waves.The computer model resulted from this project can be used by engineers and researchers to predict flood risk in different situations and provide a reliable basis for improved flood risk assessment. Therefore this research will directly benefit engineering consultants and insurance business involving assessment and management of flood risk. The Environment Agency and local authorities will benefit in that larger scale flood simulation and related risk analysis resulting from this work will provide further information for better flood risk management and alleviation. This will in turn benefit the general public in terms of flood risk reduction and improved communication of flood risk.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F030177/1","grantId":"EP/F030177/1","fundValue":"247430","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research outputs from the projects, e.g. the new numerical methods and resulting models, have been widely recognised and used and led to national and international impacts:\n\n1.

It has turned out to be a very successful project and the research has moved far beyond the boundary as it was originally proposed. The key achievements from the project may be summarised into two aspects:\n\n1. Model development\nNovel numerical methods have been developed for handling complex domain topography, wetting and drying and bed friction terms. The new methods are easy to implement and do not affect computational efficiency. Their validity can be mathematically proved and so stable simulations are guaranteed. The new techniques were published by Liang and Marche (2009) in Advances in Water Resources, 32: 873-884. The paper has been among the top three most cited papers published by this highly respected journal in the last 5 years. The methods have been successfully tested for real-world inundation and dam break simulations.\n\nA new adaptive grid system has been developed, which possesses all of the advantages of the traditional quadtree grids but provides a much simplified tool for a general user without specific computational background. Published by Liang (2012) in International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids, 69: 442–458, the inundation model based on the new grids can be up to 18 times more efficient than its fixed grid counterpart.\n\nThe new computational methods have also been extended to solve other governing equations for modelling solute transport, geomorphological change and tsunami.\n\nMajor contributions have been made to improve the Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method. The RKDG method was introduced in late 1980s. Being a more accurate numerical scheme, the method has been extended to solve the fully dynamic governing equations for inundation modelling in recent years. However, most of the existing RKDG models can be only used for reproducing highly idealised test cases. By incorporating the aforementioned new computational techniques developed originally for a finite volume method, the RKDG method has been improved and tested for real-world applications. This has led to one of the first RKDG models of this kind. Also our work pioneers the adaptive grid based RKDG models.\n\n2. Issues related to practical inundation modelling\nResearch effort has also been made to investigate a few issues related to practical inundation modelling, leading to the following general conclusions:\n1) Diffusion-wave models are much less stable and could be actually computationally much more demanding than fully dynamic models;\n2) Due to the great uncertainty associated with data, the benefit of implementing higher-order numerical scheme cannot be justified for real-world modelling practice;\n3) depending on applications, implementing local time-stepping may save 1.5 ~ 2 times of computational cost. \n\nAs a summary, new developments in computational methods have resolved a number of challenging issues in flood inundation modelling, which include representing complex domain topography, handling moving wet-dry interface, stable calculation of bed friction terms and reducing computational cost for large-scale simulations. The resulting modelling tool is therefore more accurate, stable and computationally efficient, and represents the state-of-the-art in flood simulations.\n\nThe research project has directly led to 19 refereed papers in international leading journals and 9 conference articles/presentations. A number of users of the research outputs resulting from the current project have been identified in the previous section. The work has led to substantial academic impacts, which will certainly propagate through a longer timeframe. Apart from the academic route, we have also been trying to expose the new flood modelling tools to:\n\n1. Local governments and public sectors\nEfforts have also been made to further improve the hydrodynamic modelling systems for real-time flood forecasting, working with Met Office. Other possible government users are also being identified and explored, (e.g. the Environmental Agency). \n\n2. Commercial users\nThere is a great potential that industrial partners may be interested in adopting the new models for their consultancy work. For example, discussion has been made with JBA on how to explore opportunities of jointly supervising student projects using our models. This may lead to potential opportunity of knowledge exchange. A project funded by the Northumbrian Water Limited to model the flow pass an urban drainage screen chamber has been completed, using the 2D hydrodynamic models resulting from the current project.
