{"id":"94B3CFC2-22AD-45C0-86FF-895783169E52","title":"Opportunities, Challenges and Tensions: Linking the Ageing and Disability Rights Agendas","abstractText":"<p>For much of the 20th century ‘old people’ and ‘disabled people’ were dealt with as distinct and separate groups of ‘dependent people’ by UK Government departments and welfare agencies. Signs of change are now plentiful in today’s demographic, socio-economic and political climate. Current thinking about the overlapping interests between older and disabled people has drawn attention to common needs for dignified supported living arrangements as well as human rights that transcend age boundaries. These overlaps will expand as groups within the disabled community (with physical, sensory and intellectual impairment) survive into their 60s and beyond on the one hand; and as increasing proportions of healthy adults become chronically ill as ‘deep old age’ approaches on the other.<br /><br />Facilitated by some of the key thinkers, policy-makers and activists in this field, this seminar series aims to open up opportunities for original and innovative debate on key issues for policy and practice in the UK that will have wider resonance for the developed world. It will explore the opportunities, challenges and tensions involved in the formation of closer links between the ageing anti-discrimination and disability rights agendas. In doing so, the series provides space for dialogue and interdisciplinary debate designed to enhance more critical and innovative thinking on disability and ageing research; paying particular attention to other dimensions of social ‘difference’.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I001999/1","grantId":"ES/I001999/1","fundValue":"15299","fundStart":"2011-01-31","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Milligan","coPersons":["Carol  Thomas"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
