{"id":"7186F1E0-4564-4DC7-8D55-ABC9757F39C8","title":"Ambulatory microdialysis sampling system","abstractText":"Prof Stafford Lightman (Univ Bristol) has developed a medical device for the minimally invasive automated collection of regular samples from a subject 24 hours a day, including during undisturbed sleep. For the first time, this will enable the detailed study of clinical and biological analytes known to vary over the day. The device has potential applications in basic research, for prognosis and diagnosis of disease in animals and man, in clinical trials and drug development and for therapeutic monitoring. This project will deliver commercial proof of principle by developing a pre-production prototype of the device which is more user-friendly, flexible enough to be used in a range of research scenarios, and robust enough to be used on large animals as well as in man. This will be fully tested and validated, and ready for trials in man and CE marking. Achievement of a CE mark will pave the way for the device to be sold as a research tool, either through a licensee or a spinout company.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M019268/1","grantId":"BB/M019268/1","fundValue":"179379","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stafford Louis Lightman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
