{"id":"840D21CA-11F4-4D88-8703-C58CDF2E0F69","title":"Glow Worms, Crime Scenes and Laser Beams","abstractText":"<p>We propose a workshop to communicate the basic principles of light/optics, showing their application in biology and chemistry. The workshop is split into two parts: a series of simple, interactive experiments, and a presentation by practising researchers to relate the basic principles to current research and everyday life in an accessible, inspiring manner.</p>\n\n<p>‘Glow Worms, Crime Scenes and Laser Beams’ will be held at Glasgow Science Centre on Saturday 15th and Sunday 16th March. The centre is visited by approximately 1200-1600 people in a weekend; it is hoped that the majority of these attendees, composed mostly of families, will take part in the activity. The interactive component will run as an open event, so the visitors are able to drift in and out, with 6 stations; the spectrum and waves; communicating with light; reflections, shadows and rays; the eye; lenses and microscopes; and light in nature. Each having accessible experiments for the audience to try with the guidance of volunteers from the research community, providing a unique opportunity for interaction between the public and practising researchers. There will be 8 presentations from active researchers split over the 2 days, with visual aids and a demonstration of luminescent chemical reactions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0151","grantId":"RES-168-26-0151","fundValue":"1367","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Hannah Diane Collins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
