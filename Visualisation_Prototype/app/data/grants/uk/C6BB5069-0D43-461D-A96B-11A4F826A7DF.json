We believe the findings from this study will mark a\nmajor leap forward into understanding of manufacturing low cost and efficient CCMs with unique properties and\napplications. A systematic investigation will be carried out to examine the performance of the molecularly imprinted\npolymers (MIP) synthesized for CO2 capture through suspension polymerisation technique. This research involves the\napplication of a powerful set of complementary techniques to the study of synthesis and performance of prepared MIPs\ncomprising: HRSEM,TEM, XRD, adsorbing/desorbing rig, gas analyser. A substantially better understanding of the\nsynthesis process and performance of MIPs is likely to yield important economic benefits, e.g. better process control,\nefficiency, improved reproducibility and the capacity to modify products for specific applications. Such a step forward to a\nnew level of understanding would open the way to innovative applications in both residential and industrial emission emitter\nsystems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508615/1","grantId":"EP/N508615/1","fundValue":"147622","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vasilije  ManovicSai  Gu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cranfield University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
