Over recent years, the group has established an internationally pioneering role in the highly active field of microwave plasmonics and metamaterials, and this recent success has lead to a significant increase in the number of projects requiring the use of more advanced microwave experimentation methods. We have been reliant on aging scalar analysis equipment and microwave sources, and besides providing a much-needed upgrade to one of our existing facilities, the acquisition of the microwave vector network analyser will broaden and enhance the current capability of our research programme. Specifically, the advantages of a microwave vector network analyser for our research projects, over our existing scalar systems are three-fold: it will permit (1) determination of phase and group delay, and the dispersion of surface modes, (2) improvement in measurement accuracy of scalar properties, and (3) will permit material characterisation in terms of permittivity, permeability and loss tangents. These improvements will enable our researchers and students to extend their contribution to an internationally competitive research field, and maintain collaborations with industrial partners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G04841X/1","grantId":"EP/G04841X/1","fundValue":"85891","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alastair Paul Hibbins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
