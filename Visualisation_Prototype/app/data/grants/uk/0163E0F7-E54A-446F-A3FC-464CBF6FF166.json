To date, little attention has focused upon the changing composition and structure of households through both time and space. This research will provide a major study of the modifications in form and use of houses through this period of transformation. Uniquely, this project utilises digital visualisation to investigate the evolution of domestic space and how this related to the creation of different notions of identity and selfhood across the ancient Greek world through time.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112875/1","grantId":"112875/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew  Fitzjohn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
