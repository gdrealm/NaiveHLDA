Demonstrations and trials have played a significant role in advancing renewable technologies in Germany, Japan and the USA, while the UK has recently established a number of demonstration programmes in the low carbon and renewable energy field. The EU also has major plans to develop and promote renewable energy. This project will provide a better understanding of the opportunities these programmes create for accelerating innovation, and how to maximise their impact through good management, accompanying measures, and follow-on activities.<br />&nbsp;<br />The research will build a comprehensive database of demonstrations and trials for fuel cells, wind, and photo-voltaics in Europe, USA and Japan, where major growth in installations has taken place, and develop case studies of successful and less successful programmes. The project will show what part demonstration and trials have played in this, what other policies have been effective, and what external factors have affected success. It will also explore how companies have achieved successful innovation through these. This will be valuable to managers and policy makers for making effective use of trials, as a general instrument in improving innovation, and in accelerating the development and adoption of sustainable technologies. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-180-25-0019","grantId":"RES-180-25-0019","fundValue":"277140","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"C  Hendry","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
