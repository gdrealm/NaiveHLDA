{"id":"D23D792D-6F20-4FDC-9AA8-DD76498FEF51","title":"The Subject of Murder: Criminality, Identity, Gender in Nineteenth-Century France","abstractText":"The project is an investigation on the ways in which the figure of the murderer was constructed in the French nineteenth century within two disciplinary frameworks; the burgeoning sciences of criminology and alienism (psychiatry) on the one hand, and the aesthetic philosophies of Romanticism and Decadence on the other. The extent to which these models co-exist and inter-penetrate within the cultural imaginary of the century is explored via an analysis of representations and self-representations of the murdering subject in a selection of nineteenth-century writing, (literature, popular, fiction, the criminal memoir, the medical case study).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113146/1","grantId":"113146/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lisa Michelle Downing","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
