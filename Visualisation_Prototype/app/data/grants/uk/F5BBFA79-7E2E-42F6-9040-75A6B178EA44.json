One of them is a classical Malcev's problem about the embedding of group rings into skew fields. A classical example of this kind is an embedding of the ring of polynomials over a field into the field of rational functions. Here a skew field is a (noncommutative) ringwhere each nonzero element can be inverted (think of the ring of integers being embedded into the field of the rationals: every nonzero integer n gets its inverse 1/n).But to invert all elements of the group ring when a group is noncommutative is essentially harder. Although many believe that the group ring of a torsion free group is always embeddable into a skew field, quite a few classes of groups are known where this fact was proved. One of the aims of this project is to extend this class of examples using groups of strings. This class of groups has alreadyproved to be very useful in algebraic topology, physics, and combinatorial theory of groups. In this project we will analyze very subtle combinatorial structure of groups of strings to invert the elements of the corresponding group ring.Another objective of this project is to investigate the model theory of modules over noncommutative valuations that appear from this embedding. A peculiar property of these rings is that the right and left ideals of them are linearly ordered by inclusion. Moreover, the order on the set of right ideals is tightly connected with the geometry of the underlying group, and is usually in a `generic' position to the corresponding left order. These rings were used to construct examples of modules with a very strange decomposition theory. For instance, one can construct a module which is a direct sum of uniserial modules, but admits a direct summand with no indecomposable decomposition. In this project we are going to applymodel theory of modules over noncommutative valuations constructed by string groups, to analyze this strange decomposition behavior and find new even more elaborated examples of `bad' direct summands of serial modules.In general this project aims to develop new connections between algebra, algebraic topology, model theory of modules, and a classical ring and module theory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D077907/1","grantId":"EP/D077907/1","fundValue":"11805","fundStart":"2006-09-08","fundEnd":"2006-12-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gennady  Puninskiy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
