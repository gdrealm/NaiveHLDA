Despite this, it is still needed today because of the fear of bioterrorism with variola virus, the virus that caused smallpox. In UK the vaccine has been used recently to vaccinate some healthcare workers against smallpox, so that if there were a case of smallpox sometime in the future, these workers could care for the patient(s) without contracting and spreading smallpox themselves. Some research programmes in UK, USA and elsewhere are trying to develop safer vaccines and new drugs for smallpox, that might be used in the future.\n\nThe research proposal aims to understand more about the genes of VacV, the smallpox vaccine, and to use this information to build safer vaccines for smallpox. In addition, because VacV can be modified to express genes derived from other microbes that cause disease, it can be used as a vaccine against those diseases too. Indeed it can be used against some cancers also. There is therefore a compelling need to understand more fully the VacV genes, how they work and how their manipulation can give rise to new vaccines that are safer and induce stronger immune responses in those vaccinated.\n\nThe applicant has communicated the results of his research and the purpose of this research to the public in several ways. Like all staff at Imperial College London, research findings are published in international scientific journals and are described at scientific conferences in UK and abroad. Unpublished research data are frequently used in teaching undergraduate students at Imperial College, other UK universities and research institutions overseas. In addition, the applicant has been interactive with national newspapers, TV and radio. As Chairman of the WHO committee on variola virus research, he is responsible for helping to shape policy for WHO. Similarly, he has done this within UK, by contributing to committees from the Royal Society, Academy of Medical Sciences, the Department of Health and Ministry of Defence. He contributes to policy on microbiology nationally by being a council member of the society for general microbiology, and internationally by being vice-president (and president-elect) of the virology division of the international union of microbiological societies (IUMS).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501257","grantId":"G0501257","fundValue":"1400360","fundStart":"2005-11-26","fundEnd":"2010-11-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey L Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
