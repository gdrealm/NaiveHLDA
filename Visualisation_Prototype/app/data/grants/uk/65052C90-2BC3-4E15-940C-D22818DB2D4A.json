Current methods for the generation of optimal acoustic fields generally rely on a linear process within the transducer. This linear transduction process influences the resultant properties in terms of spatial resolution and maximum intensity, noting that there are fundamental limits on the spatial resolution and power densities that can be achieved in such focal regions. In recent work in the area of acoustics, it has been demonstrated that a new type of acoustic signal can be generated via non-linear effects in chains of particles, which act as a kind of waveguide. These are based on the propagation of solitary waves. These have been studies at low frequencies, but this study will look at the posibility of using these new structures for use in biomedical ultrasound. Materials that support solitary waves are not used in standard ultrasonic work; little has been published on their use, despite the fact that a step change in performance may be possible. In this proposal, such waves will be generated within ultrasonic sources containing multiple solitary wave chains, at frequencies in the 500 kHz - 5 MHz range. To our knowledge, this has not been investigated before. Arrays are also possible, where each chain forms a single element. Because the chains would be primarily coupled along their length, but not laterally between each chains, issues arising from mechanical cross-coupling might be avoided. Pre-compression of each chain would alter the propagation velocity within it, so that beam-steering/focussing to be created. The propagation charaistics also change with signal amplitude, leading to the possibility of an acoustic diode. These new innovations would have applications in such areas as ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery, High Intensity Focussed Ultrasound (HIFU) for the treatment of tumours, and harmonic imaging.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K032070/1","grantId":"EP/K032070/1","fundValue":"287563","fundStart":"2013-11-29","fundEnd":"2016-11-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  As this project started in January 2014 at UCL (This is part of a collaboration with Leeds and Warwick), there has been insufficient time to assess any impact.

Of paramount importance was the ability to solve mechanical contact problems and to fully couple structural and acoustic domains. Piezoelectric element capabilities was also a requirement. The chosen software package fulfilled the above criteria and was subsequently purchased. Subsequently static contact problems involving spheres in Hertzian contact with known analytical solutions were investigated. Agreement within 5% of the analytical solution was obtained. Transient analyses of a chain of six pre-stressed spheres in Hertzian contact were carried out (in vacuum), in which convergence of the solution was investigated as a function of the analysis input parameters and numerical solution scheme. Applying a 70 kHz sinusoidal pulse (with a Gaussian envelope) along the axis of the chain confirmed nonlinear behaviour of the displacements, predicted both by the corresponding analytical solution and experimentally.\n\nWhilst the selected software package possesses structural/acoustic coupling, it cannot account for effects of nonlinear propagation within the acoustic medium. Hence, strategies for one way coupling to nonlinear acoustic solvers have been investigated. Open source nonlinear acoustic solvers have been identified and tested. As this is a collaboration with two other research groups (at Warwick and Leeds universities) the findings of our modelling activities have been fed into the experimental work being carried out by our collaborators. The design of their experiments and the analysis of their results have been informed by our modelling work. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
