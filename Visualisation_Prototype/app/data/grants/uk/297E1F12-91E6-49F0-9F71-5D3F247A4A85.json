It is based on current inter-disciplinary behavioural change work to generate practical insights to inform policy and institutional design.</p>\n\n<p>It begins by assessing interventions to mitigate public harm or detriment in other unrelated spheres. Secondly, it looks at how far attitudinal change and behavioural change are interconnected, and specifically the degree to which attitudinal change serves as a pre-requisite to behavioural change. Thirdly, it considers the implications for policymaking in three regards: sustaining behavioural change relevant to equalities outcomes; relationships between background factors that indirectly shape decision-making and choices and foreground factors that can be influenced through policy; and third, targeting hard-to-move individuals, groups and interests.</p>\n\n<p>The project will be based on multiple methods. These include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>a desk-based interim analytical report, using published and grey literature</li>\n\n <li>engagement with GEO senior officials and existing projects (eg Public Sector Equality Duty)</li>\n\n <li>stakeholder discussions with OGDs and regulatory agencies</li>\n\n <li>exchange with academic and practitioner experts</li>\n\n <li>dialogue with ministers and others to shape future equalities strategy.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005464/1","grantId":"ES/K005464/1","fundValue":"116388","fundStart":"2013-01-09","fundEnd":"2014-01-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Shamit  Saggar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
