Although debt, civil war, and poor government are partially responsible for the resurgence of malaria, the emergence of drug resistant parasites and insecticide resistant mosquitoes are also to blame. New methods of combating this blood borne parasite are therefore required. One promising method is to use antibodies. Antibodies are flexible molecules found in blood and are produced during a natural malaria infection and in response to vaccination. They bind and neutralize malaria parasites and prepare them for uptake and destruction by killer cells, which are also found in blood. However, the parasite can evade killing by constantly changing the molecules on its surface that are seen by antibodies, a process known as antigenic variation. Modern technologies now enable us to identify regions on the surface of the parasite that don?t change or change very slowly. Human antibodies that see these regions can then be made artificially in the test-tube and tested for their effectiveness at killing parasites. We have shown that one particular type of antibody, termed IgA, is very effective at recruiting killer cells to kill malaria parasites outside of the human body. We will test if this is also true in humans suffering from malaria. Through fieldwork with collaborators in Africa we hope one day to test the effectiveness of these antibodies at curbing malaria in trials with human volunteers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300145","grantId":"G0300145","fundValue":"438987","fundStart":"2004-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Pleass","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
