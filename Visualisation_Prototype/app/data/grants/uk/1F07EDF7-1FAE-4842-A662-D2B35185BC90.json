{"id":"1F07EDF7-1FAE-4842-A662-D2B35185BC90","title":"Developmental genes in the life cycle of a parasitic flatworm","abstractText":"Tapeworms are a group of more than 10,000 known species adversely affecting the health of both ourselves and our domesticated animals. Their complex life histories centre on the maintenance of a germinative 'neck' region that produces a continuous chain of segments throughout their lives, each replete with male and female reproductive organs capable of producing an enormous number of new infections. Genetic mechanisms underpinning their development are unknown, but have implications for both understanding novel means of therapeutic intervention as well as understanding basic developmental processes in the animal kingdom. This research will examine the roles of Hox and other developmental genes that act to coordinate embryonic axial patterning and other aspects of development throughout the animal kingdom (e.g. establishing which end will develop into the 'head' and which into the 'tail'). By understanding the actions of these genes, this research will resolve fundamental questions regarding how tapeworms became segmented to enable their parasitic lifestyle and how Hox genes are used in the complex development of a parasitic animal. In turn, this will provide a platform for future research on development in other parasitic flatworm groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G003815/1","grantId":"BB/G003815/1","fundValue":"270588","fundStart":"2009-03-02","fundEnd":"2012-03-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our research has provided the first comprehensive, fully annotated suite of genomic data of a tapeworm: a cosmopolitan and ubiquitous group of helminth parasites that include 2 of the world's neglected tropical diseases. These data greatly accelerate the pace of research in both basic and applied fields of bioscience and have direct impact on anti-helminthic drug development for species infecting ourselves and our domesticated farm and pet animals. Our research has already resulted in high impact publications and data produced as a direct or indirect result of the grant are already being seen in recent publications by the laboratories around the world.

This provides insight into potential targets for chemotherapy and a context with which to understand how their development relates to free-living animals. We have developed tools for culturing and assaying gene function in the model system. Through collaboration we have made the complete genome and multiple transcriptome (expressed gene) profiles of the model parasite available to the public. Our empirical work provides both tools for others to adopt as well as hypotheses about gene function that can be tested or related to other systems. Complete genome and transcriptome data are available for download (including models of over 10.5K tapeworm genes) to the public and these data have already been used in published research articles by international research labs.\n\nMore information can be found on www.olsonlab.com Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
