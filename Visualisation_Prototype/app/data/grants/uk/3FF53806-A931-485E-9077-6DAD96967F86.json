{"id":"3FF53806-A931-485E-9077-6DAD96967F86","title":"Open Economy Models: An Empirical Investigation","abstractText":"<p>A major activity in open economy macroeconomics is the development of ‘second generation’ models, based on sound foundations in maximising behaviour by households and firms, to replace more ad hoc models in general policy use. There is much ongoing work on this front but little systematic testing of alternative frameworks against the data, so that policy-makers may justifiably suspect that the new models, while theoretically attractive, fail to fit empirically.</p> \n<p>A second concern is the formulation of optimal monetary policy in such models, in a policy context where exchange rate issues have seemed at times (eg, in the euro-zone and Japan) to interfere with the successful prosecution of monetary policy.</p> \n<p>The objective of our research proposal is to contribute to knowledge in these two areas by developing alternative open economy second generation models of the UK, for the purpose of testing them against the data; to embed the best of these in a 3-economy ‘world model’ consisting of the UK, the euro-zone and the rest of the world (the ‘dollar zone’); to consider optimal monetary policy within this 3-economy model, compare its implications with those of first generation models.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-165-25-0020","grantId":"RES-165-25-0020","fundValue":"207909","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Patrick Minford","coPersons":["Michael Roden Wickens"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
