{"id":"1D718E86-65BF-4061-8EB7-6BD565AA67FB","title":"Temporary site: an exploration of alternative models in curating","abstractText":"In recent years, much artistic practice has moved away from traditional sites of artistic production and reception. Artist are exploring, and indeed exploiting, new ways of working that challenge contravention boundaries, and confronts the complex relationships between artist, environment and spectator. The proposed research project takes this scenario as a starting point. It will endeavour to examine the dynamic of the group exhibition and ask how as artist-curators we may speculate on creating alternative formations and develop sensitive exhibition models. The aim of the research is to draw on models that promote the opening of divergent spaces. It is a search for micro-utopias that permit an everyday temporal experimentation. The commissioned Bookwork's publication will focus on such an example; 'Sealand' a micro-nation sited on the island platform in the North sea, was established in 1967. Throughout its near forty-year existence it has generated a vast of myth potential ; a pirate-utopia, a legal example on the verge of sovereignty, an archaic dream image, a contemporary ruin and data haven. Sealand exist in the imaginary and presents the possibility of a state guided by different principles. Within the narrative of this research, I will reveal a subjunctive model for conjecture, a 'what if' scenario. It is the idea of a free unrestricted space that will be posited as analogous to the construction of exhibitions. The curated exhibition, to be hosted in Berlin, will employ a curatorial strategy configured from discussion held as part of the research. The curated exhibition will be inextricably linked to the publication as both a research outcome and as a piece of practice-based research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D501520/1","grantId":"AH/D501520/1","fundValue":"16980","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alun  Rowlands","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
