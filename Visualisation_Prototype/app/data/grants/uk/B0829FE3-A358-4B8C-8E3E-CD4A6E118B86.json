The reasons behind this increase are unknown but\none explanation is that a reduced exposure to infectious agents may be\nresponsible.We have previously shown using a mouse model of type 1\ndiabetes that extracts of a parasite are able to inhibit development of\ndiabetes in this mouse strain. It is not necessary to have a live\ninfection to achieve diabetes prevention. Our studies furthermore show\nthat prevention is achieved by increasing regulation of the immune\nresponse. We have preliminary data showing that a purified product of the\nparasite is able to induce a population of cells involved in immune\nregulation. We propose to see whether this product can inhibit diabetes in\nour mice, whether it can also induce human regulatory cells and dissect\nhow a single molecule can do this. The importance of this work is that it\nmay lead to the development of a novel biomodulator that can be used to\nprevent diabetes onset in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001737","grantId":"G1001737","fundValue":"445302","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Cooke","coPersons":["Paola  Zaccone","Mark  Peakman"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
