Judgment always has some role to play and is often the sole basis of forecasts. Judgmental forecasts from time series data are systematically biased. First, forecasts from data containing linear or positively accelerating trends tend to be below the trend line for upward trends and above it for downward ones. Second, forecasts from un-trended independent data tend to lie between the last datum and the mean rather than on the mean. Cognitive psychologists have argued that these biases occur because people use the last datum as a judgment anchor and adjust away from it to produce their forecast. Biases arise because adjustment is insufficient. This under-adjustment could be regarded as a rational process. Time series that people experience in their ecology tend to be negatively accelerated and contain some positive autocorrelation. Forecasters expect series to contain characteristics typical of their ecology and use presented data to modify these initial expectations. However, modification is insufficient because of uncertainty about the patterns in the data. A series of experiments will be carried out to test this account. The research may have implications for forecasting practice and the design of forecasting support systems.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E010911/1","grantId":"ES/E010911/1","fundValue":"77709","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Harvey","coPersons":["Stian John Reimers"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
