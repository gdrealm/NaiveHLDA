Often the staff teaching students statistical analysis have only rudimentary skills themselves; this typically leads to low levels of student (and staff) satisfaction with such courses. Consequently, students are discouraged from quantitative topics and skills. Thus, addressing staff skills levels is crucial to addressing the issue of poor numbers skills among undergraduates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to address this issue by adopting an integrated approach to staff training and support. It will develop and deliver two quantitative methods training courses, one for staff that have only a basic level of knowledge, thus developing core skills and the other for staff with prior training; it will focus on advanced skills. Staff will receive academic credit for their participation. In addition to the development of core skills, the project will also support staff specifically in relation to the teaching challenges presented by 'numbers' work, via teaching workshops and peer coaching.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J011703/1","grantId":"ES/J011703/1","fundValue":"51154","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie  Scott Jones","coPersons":["John Edward Goldring"],"organisation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
