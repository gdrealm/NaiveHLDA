{"id":"CF601756-31F0-42D1-ADA0-18C18EBDBD77","title":"The role of PI 3-kinase/AKT/mTOR and interacting pathways in haematological cancers","abstractText":"In this proposal, the leading pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca teams up with two groups at the Institute of Cancer at St Bartholomew?s Hospital in London, namely the Centre for Experimental Cancer Medicine and the Centre for Cell Signalling. The aim of this proposal is to facilitate the transition of new anti-cancer drugs into the clinic, with a focus on cancer of the white blood cells. The Centre for Experimental Cancer Medicine has a long-standing expertise in both research and clinical trial work in this type of cancer. The Centre for Cell Signalling has world-class expertise in a group of molecules termed PI 3-kinases, which are new targets that AstraZeneca is aiming to block in cancer cells. Together they will provide new methods to assess how blockade of PI 3-kinase will affect the internal wiring of signals that allow cancer cells to survive and multiply. Jointly, the teams are looking for new ways to monitor the impact of drugs againts PI 3-kinases in patient samples, to better assess and predict potential responsiveness, with a view to selecting patients that may respond to these new therapies and to facilitate entry of these potentially new drugs into the clinic.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800914","grantId":"G0800914","fundValue":"445452","fundStart":"2008-11-03","fundEnd":"2010-11-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Bart  Vanhaesebroeck","coPersons":["Sabina  Cosulich","Rajesh  Chopra","Sylvie  Guichard","Simon P Joel","Pedro Rodriguez Cutillas","John  Gribben"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
