{"id":"F0F847FB-B5CE-4CE1-B49C-13BDEBDB3184","title":"A Network for Regional e-Infrastructure Centres","abstractText":"This proposal is for the resources required to grow a collaborative environment within which the EPSRC-funded Regional Centres can:\n\n* work with funding bodies as one cohesive set of organisations to support their member organisations and to reach out both to industry and to those HEIs that are not already associated with a Regional Centre;\n\n* share their experience and expertise, and agree and disseminate best practice for delivering a crucial national infrastructure that is built on rapidly changing technology;\n\n* clarify those aspects of the national e-Infrastructure, and its use, that are best delivered through Regional Centres, rather than local or national facilities, and learn how to optimise provision in these areas; and\n\n* share and co-ordinate tasks which benefit the whole high-end computing community (whether compute- or data-intensive), while still retaining their individual identities, focus and missions.\n\nA common, cohesive approach for the Regional Centres interfacing with other e-Infrastructure centres in the UK ecosystem is a key enabler to a more effective national, integrated e-Infrastructure. A number of important common issues are already apparent, including: training, outreach to new users and organisations, common access and authentication methods, engagement with UK industry and commerce, and shaping the UK strategy for providing and exploiting a national cutting-edge e-Infrastructure. A major component of the proposal is to to explore these issues, map a way forward and, where resource implications permit, implement common or cooperative structures to address them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M02010X/1","grantId":"EP/M02010X/1","fundValue":"238506","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"P Mark Rodger","coPersons":["Chris John Taylor","Martin Travis Dove","Simon James Cox","Steven David Kenny","Anne Elizabeth Trefethen","David  Hogg","Richard  Martin","Paul Alexander Mulheran"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
