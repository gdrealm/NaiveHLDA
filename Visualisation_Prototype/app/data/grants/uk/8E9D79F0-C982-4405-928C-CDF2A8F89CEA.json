{"id":"8E9D79F0-C982-4405-928C-CDF2A8F89CEA","title":"Understanding the 'Impact' of Migration Research Within Non-Academic Organisations","abstractText":"<p>This pilot study will explore the meaning, process and ‘impact’ of migration research. COMPAS (Centre on Migration, Policy and Society)&nbsp;aims to improve its understanding of how research evidence influences the way users within particular institutions understand and interrogate key issues and the role research has in policy formation, implementation and evaluation.</p> \n<p>We wish to explore ways of developing relationships with users as gateways to ‘institutional knowledge’ in order to maximise when, how, and whom to approach to ensure greatest impact. This will enable us to develop a series of knowledge transfer chains through which research findings and insights can most effectively be taken up within such institutions.</p> \n<p>Now mid-way through the first five-year phase of ESRC funding, COMPAS is therefore at an ideal point at which to assess the impact of user engagement and findings dissemination and still implement change. To this end we have started an internal audit of user engagement processes, successes and challenges which will form the basis of the proposed project. The research will be based on a combination of interviews, site visits, an online questionnaire and focus group meetings. The project will serve a crucial function in shaping the Centre’s user-engagement and dissemination strategies for future development.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-172-25-0007","grantId":"RES-172-25-0007","fundValue":"40000","fundStart":"2006-04-19","fundEnd":"2006-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven  Vertovec","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
