{"id":"6A27F2E3-3FAB-4C1B-9BA5-CAC61A4525D7","title":"Replacement of hamsters with physicochemical analytical methods for Leptospira vaccine batch potency testing","abstractText":"Leptospirosis is the fourth most common zoonotic (transmitted from animals to man) disease worldwide and has a number of major farmed, companion and feral animal reservoirs. Vaccination has been widely used to control disease in animals and consequently incidence in humans. Each vaccine batch must be tested for potency before market release. Hamsters are particularly sensitive to leptospirosis and consequently used as a model species to test the potency of vaccine batches. Typically five vaccinated and five unvaccinated hamsters are challenged with virulent (lethal) Leptospira bacteria. Four of the vaccinates must survive and four unvaccinates must show signs of leptospirosis or die. The effects of the disease on hamsters are severe (usually death), the test is time consuming (minimum duration 40 days) and expensive. The RSPCA, pharmaceutical industry and government recognise the pressing need to replace this hamster vaccine batch potency test with a humane alternative. The current proposal seeks to replace the hamster model with alternative generic in vitro (test tube) tests. These will exploit recent technological developments in mass spectrometry enabling the analysis of large biological molecules found in vaccines.\n\nThe protective components from virulent and avirulent Leptospira bacteria and a commercial vaccine preparation will be separated and detected with antibodies from vaccine immunised hamsters. Active components will be purified, identified and measured by mass spectrometry. This will enable the active components to be compared between batches of vaccines to ensure consistency. A similar approach has been attempted using antibodies to measure vaccine components but these are not widely available and the molecules they measure are poorly defined. In contrast, mass spectrometry is now widely applied across the biological sciences, such methods are transferable and analytes can be readily identified. \n\nThe Veterinary Laboratories Agency has unique expertise in Leptospira vaccine batch testing and key contacts with industry. This expertise will provide a unique environment for the current project which will focus on the two component canine vaccine, the twin batch test for which is considered to be particularly severe. Dissemination of information will be a critical success factor for the uptake and implementation of any replacement test by vaccine manufactures. This will be achieved by publication in peer reviewed journals, presentation at conferences and discussion with industry contacts. Finally, this new approach to vaccine batch testing could provide an alternative to some of the 35,000 animals currently used for this purpose each year.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700633/1","grantId":"G0700633/1","fundValue":"181060","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  Coldham","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Animal Health & Veterinary Lab Agency","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
