This computing power is spread over large central clusters (Tier-1) and based in individual University departments (Tier-2). Hundreds of thousands of computers will be needed. Everything is connected together using the Internet and jobs are run automatically in such a way that the computers are used in the most efficient manner.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E003095/1","grantId":"PP/E003095/1","fundValue":"218896","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Anthony Houlden","coPersons":["Themistocles  Bowcock"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
