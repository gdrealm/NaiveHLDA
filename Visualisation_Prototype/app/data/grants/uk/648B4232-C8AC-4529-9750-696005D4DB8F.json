Crucial to this process is the recognition of small pieces of the organism by a specialised immune cell called a T cell. These pieces are presented to the T cell on the surface of a so-called antigen presenting cell (APC). The T cell and the APC form an unique contact region called an immune synapse (IS) which is divided into concentric rings of molecules specialised for different functions such as recognition, binding together and signalling. We will use a well-accepted model of the IS, in combination with sophisticated microscopical methods to visualise the molecules at the cell surface, to understand how it is organised into these different domains and how they play a role in the efficiency and specificity of recognition and activation between the T cell and the APC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700771","grantId":"G0700771","fundValue":"400012","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Ian Magee","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
