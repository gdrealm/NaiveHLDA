A recent influential theory has suggested that many age-related cognitive deficits might be due to impaired inhibitory mechanisms. Three studies are planned to investigate the impact of old age on low-level, non-voluntary perceptuo-motor control mechanisms. Mainly employing the 'masked prime' paradigm, our main objectives will be to (1) assess the extent to which low-level control is influenced by older adults' perceptual limitations and/or generally slower processing; (2) investigate the effect of old age on each of the component processes involved (activation, inhibition, and disinhibition); and (3) explore the relationship between low-level inhibitory motor control and top-down cognitive control processes in older adults. The results are expected to provide insight into some of the most fundamental mechanisms underlying normal age-related performance deficits by illuminating the extent to which low-level inhibitory motor control is impaired in old age, and the extent to which such impairment correlates with and contributes to the overall age-related decline in cognitive performance.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F033869/1","grantId":"ES/F033869/1","fundValue":"76713","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth Ann Maylor","coPersons":["Friederike  Schlaghecken"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
