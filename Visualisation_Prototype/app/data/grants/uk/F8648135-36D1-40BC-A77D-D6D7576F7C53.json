In this state many features of fully drag-reduced flow are observed (i.e. features associated with Virk's Maximum Drag Reduction Asymptote MDRA Virk (1975)); weak streamwise structures, reduced Reynolds shear stresses and, as a consequence, enhanced mass flux (at constant driving pressure) i.e. drag reduction occurs. The aim of this project is to search for experimental verification of this hibernating turbulence and extract the coherent structures within it over a range of Reynolds numbers. Ultimately, enhanced knowledge of hibernation can pave the way for novel flow-control strategies to maintain this hibernating state and therefore substantially reduce skin friction drag.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J018163/1","grantId":"EP/J018163/1","fundValue":"214634","fundStart":"2012-07-09","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert John Poole","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
