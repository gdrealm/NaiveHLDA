It is jointly sponsored by ESRC, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service and the Policy Studies Institute. </p>\n\n<p>The current survey contains many innovations relative to its predecessors, most notably: information on workplaces with five to nine employees; new questions on union-management partnership; a financial performance questionnaire; improved measures of technology; an expanded range of questions on governance; a re-design of the worker representative questionnaire; and new and revised questions on job stress, worker satisfaction, skills and earnings. The aim of the project is to highlight these innovations, the rationales for their development and the potential they offer for new research. It will be undertaken by members of the specialist teams established by the WERS2004 sponsors to advise on questionnaire design and development, and will be coordinated by the ESRCâ€™s Senior Academic Consultant to the WERS2004 project.</p>\n\n<p>Dissemination will involve the publication of an edited volume and a formal launch involving a media briefing.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1433","grantId":"RES-000-22-1433","fundValue":"11735","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Whitfield","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
