{"id":"83157B6A-84E2-4D90-BDCE-2AEC8482ED15","title":"An analysis and review of British South Asian engagement in minority ethnic arts","abstractText":"The aim of this research project is to provide a critical review of the place and value of minority ethnic arts in the lives of British South Asians by examining literature on the development of South Asian arts in Britain as well as exploring what has been written about British South Asian engagement in the arts. By using British South Asians as a case study rather than trying to examine cultural and creative engagement across all BME communities, this research will present a focused analysis of the development of and contemporary place of South Asian Arts in Britain. Given that British South Asians are a well established community in Britain this review will aim to present a chronological investigation of the emergence and development of South Asian arts in Britain. The key research question being examined is 'Why and in what ways do members of the British South Asian community engage with the arts and what value do they attach to this engagement?'\n\nWithin this main research question a number of further questions are addressed: How has the South Asian arts scene developed in Britain? Which factors influence British South Asian engagement with particular types of art (e.g. age, gender, religiosity, language, socioeconomic background etc)? What role is played by South Asian arts organisations and which sorts of arts do these organisations offer? How does engagement with minority ethnic art impact on religious identity and conversely how does the strength of religious identity influence engagement with the arts? What cultural value do South Asians themselves place on the arts and how is this manifested in career choices among young South Asians? Who beyond members of minority ethnic communities engages with minority ethnic arts? Why are many of these organisations defined as 'South Asian' as opposed to Indian / Pakistani / Hindu / Sikh / Muslim? Are South Asians aware of any inherent value in engaging with arts relating to their own ethnic and/or religious backgrounds as opposed to engaging with 'mainstream' arts?\n\nThis research project will also look to uncover examples of 'hidden' minority arts events which are often only advertised within particular networks and which usually take place in venues owned or run for members of minority ethnic communities including religious institutions and cultural centres. As well as undertaking a review of research and reports into South Asian Arts, an online survey will be used to investigate these hidden events through the networks created with South Asian Arts organisations. The survey will be hosted on the project website and advertised through South Asian networks and social media.\n\nThe expected outputs from this project will be:\n1. A report consisting of a critical review of the literature on minority ethnic arts;\n2. Findings from the quantitative and qualitative online survey made available on the project website;\n3. A journal article targeted at the journal &quot;South Asian Popular Culture&quot;, authored by the PI;\n4. Conference presentations including the BASAS (British Association of South Asian Studies) 2014 conference;\n5. Community presentations to take place at venues arranged by the South Asian Arts organisations participating in the research;\n6. Policy briefings for South Asian Arts professionals and relevant policy makers containing a digest of the critical review and recommendations for future practices available on the project website;\n7. Possibility of dissemination via the BBC Asian Network and/or BBC Radio 4's 'The Culture Show'\n\nThe audience of these outputs will be academics working on cultural value and on minority ethnic arts, South Asian Arts professionals, policy makers who need a nuanced understanding of how different parts of British society engage with the arts, and ordinary people with an interest in understanding the history and place of South Asian arts in Britain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L013517/1","grantId":"AH/L013517/1","fundValue":"21514","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  This award examined the cultural value of South Asian Arts in Britain by reviewing relevant literature about the place of South Asian Arts and their impact on individuals and society.

Although not all South Asians in Britain engage with South Asian Arts, the analysis of reports into the uses of South Asian Arts found them playing an important role across the generations. For older South Asians engaging in culturally relevant arts with which with they are familiar can be used to transmit public health messages to otherwise hard to reach groups. For some young South Asians, South My findings highlight that although Cultural Value is often measured by its impact on economic, societal, health and education, for individuals from a minority heritage background, the arts can play an important role in allowing them to engage with their heritage. Could the arts be regarded as one of a number of strategies through which some South Asians engage with their cultural heritage to make sense of their place in the world?
