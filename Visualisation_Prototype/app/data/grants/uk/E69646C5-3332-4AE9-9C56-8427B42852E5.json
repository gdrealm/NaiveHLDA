The principal objective of the project is to enhance the teaching of quantitative research methods to undergraduate social science students in UK universities. This will be achieved with a course that covers the entire process of research, from the formulation of theory, the design of a programme of research, the collection of numeric data and finally the application of statistical techniques for analysing data. A course that includes all of these components will instil in students a greater understanding of the need and suitability of statistical analysis to address many interesting questions in social science. In order to increase the studentsâ€™ interaction with this material a further inquiry-based model of learning is proposed. This will involve teaching a selection of students more advanced methods of statistical analysis in order to complete a dissertation in political analysis.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E016928/1","grantId":"ES/E016928/1","fundValue":"44784","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sean  Carey","coPersons":["Katharine Saskia Adeney"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
