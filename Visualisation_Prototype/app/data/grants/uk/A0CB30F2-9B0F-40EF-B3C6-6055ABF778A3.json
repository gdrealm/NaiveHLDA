However, it may also be the first and most persistent symptom of many inflammatory airways diseases, including, asthma, COPD, post viral infections, pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Chronic cough can also be present when a cause can not be identified. At present there are no effective treatments for this condition. Therefore, the identification of new drugs for the treatment of chronic cough will be of immense benefit and will greatly enhance the quality of life of many patients and sufferers. The reflex action of coughing is initiated when sensory nerves in the airway are activated. Our research looks into whether agents which prevent the sensory nerves in the airway from being activated, will also inhibit the cough reflex. This project in particular looks at cyclodextrin as a possible agent. Previous pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the inhibitory effects of cyclodextrin in preventing cough. This project seeks to take this work further and to test the inhibitory activity of cyclodextrins on the cough reflex in man.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0502019","grantId":"G0502019","fundValue":"349220","fundStart":"2007-03-31","fundEnd":"2009-10-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria Gabriela Belvisi","coPersons":["Kazuhiro  Ito","Mark  Birrell"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
