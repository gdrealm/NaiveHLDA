Sodium reabsorption by these cells is primarily dependent upon the activity of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (EnaCs) seated on the apical side of the epithelium. Consistent with a pivotal role of EnaCs in Na+ reabsorption, the activity of these channels is controlled by a number of hormones and other endogenous factors. However, channels kinetics of native EnaCs corresponding to the regulators are rarely studied due to the technique difficulties. This project will investigate the regulation mechanism of EnaCs under different hyposmolality by employing a novel technique. The results would contribute to knowledge of mechanisms of sodium reabsorption in kidney epithelial in response to osmolality change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D524032/1","grantId":"BB/D524032/1","fundValue":"271736","fundStart":"2006-01-05","fundEnd":"2009-01-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Yuchun  Gu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
