{"id":"F5A856A0-1962-4264-87D4-F1E0C9E4093E","title":"Regenerative Therapies and Devices","abstractText":"The Innovation and Knowledge Centre in Regenerative Therapies and Devices will provide a sustainable regional and international platform to address the creation of new technologies in Regenerative Therapies and Devices and their accelerated adoption within a complex global market place with increasing cost constraints. Therapies and devices which facilitate the regeneration of body tissues offer the potential to revolutionise healthcare and be a catalyst for economic growth, creating a new business sector within healthcare technology (Foresight Healthcare 2020). This centre is focused on emerging novel technologies in biological scaffolds, nano-biomaterials and self assembling peptides. These hybrid technologies utilise novel physical and biological functionality to enhance and accelerate the regeneration of tissues by harnessing the potential of endogenous stem cells in vivo. These novel technologies will also provide a vehicle for the delivery of exogenous stem cells to patients in the future and can be used to generate neo-tissues in vitro. The delivery of these emerging technologies to patients will be accelerated by improved diagnostics and imaging for enhanced patient targeting and by new complex simulation methodologies (patient in the lab) for improved short term predictions of the long term clinical outcomes. The life expectancy and average age of the population continues to increase as a result of advances in biomedicine and healthcare and this is generating additional social and economic burden. The Regenerative Technologies and Devices IKC will address the needs and quality of life of the ageing population, and address their expectations of an active lifestyle for fifty more years after fifty . It will specifically, but not exclusively, focus on areas of clinical need in musculoskeletal disease, dentistry, cardiovascular disease and cancer, which have been strategically prioritised by the University and the Leeds Hospitals Trust. The centre will build upon and develop substantial clinical, academic and industry partnerships. Additional new collaborative funding of over 58 million has already been confirmed to match the IKC award, and the centre has plans which have identified research and innovation funding in this area of over 100 million during the initial five year period of its activities.This rapidly growing multidisciplinary area will require innovative scientists and engineers who can cross disciplinary boundaries, work in broader systems based projects and work flexibly and collaboratively with industry and clinicians at different stages of the innovation pipeline. The centre and its partners will develop new and different approaches to innovation at an early stage of the innovation cycle, to substantially accelerate innovation, shorten the time period to clinical trials and market, and mitigate technology risks associated with this emergent sector. Collaborators in the Leeds University Business School will develop and evaluate open innovation methodologies. The University of Leeds is ideally placed to take advantage of this EPSRC call for four important reasons. First it has considerable competency in technology and science, as well as capabilities in managing collaborative innovation and entrepreneurship. Second it has the capability to both manage facilitate and create accelerated innovation in emerging healthcare technologies. Third the University already has excellent facilities and a track record (WRHIP) for innovation and is working with Yorkshire Forward to establish an Innovation Hub in Healthcare Technologies. Fourth the strategic partnership with the Clinical Trials Research Unit and the Unit of Health Economics will enable transition into NHS practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G032483/1","grantId":"EP/G032483/1","fundValue":"4893970","fundStart":"2009-10-12","fundEnd":"2014-10-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  High quality research and innovation platform\n?95m new research income\nEstablished academic supply chain and translational capability across 250 researchers\nActive collaborations and technology validation with 9 UK HEIs, 18 academic and clinical partners\nNew Medical Technologies building and a new post of Director of Innovation in Medical Technologies\n\nSuccessful sustainable innovation\nDefined robust sustainability model \nStrategically identified and prioritised key market sectors that offer significant opportunity\nDeveloped a culture of innovation across academic, industry and clinical partnerships\nSharing innovation good practice with 9 UK HEIs and other innovation hubs at Leeds\n166 collaborative projects, 66 industry co-investors\n\nEstablished profile and reputation\nRobust brand identity and reach across the UK and beyond through targeted marketing and communications\nStrategic alignment with Regener8 giving access to a 240 industry members, 328 academics and 21 clinicians across UK\nHigh profile events with national partners to engage the community in issues that impact on medical and regenerative technology innovation.\nSignificant political visits and media coverage\n\nSuccessful innovation and translation \nEstablished Innovation system, pipeline, stage gates and criteria for progression \nDefined IP portfolio and directly funded 42 Proof of Concept and 6 Co-Development projects \nPipeline of 166 collaborative innovation projects with industry, of which 48 directly IKC funded\nContributed to the development of 46 new products that have reached the market. \nGenerated ?57m investment in private sector partners for development of our IP/technology and a further ?30m plus investment in private sector for development arising out of collaborative projects Healthcare Societal,Economic","person":"John  Fisher","coPersons":["Louise Mary Jennings","Xuebin  Yang","Paul  Ko Ferrigno","Richard Mark Hall","Christopher J McCabe","Derek  Magee","David Peter Towers","E  Ingham","Roy  Ruddle","Philip Gerard  Conaghan","Sophie  Williams","David  Barton","Alexander Giles Davies","Zhongmin  Jin","Joanne Lisbeth Tipper","Christoph Paul Walti","Ruth K Wilcox","Jennifer  Kirkham","Anne  Neville","David John Wood","Stephen  Smye","Sotirios Anastasios Korossis","Dennis  McGonagle","Philip Henry Gaskell","Anthony Charles Redmond","DARREN  TREANOR","Edmund Harold  Linfield","Catherine Elizabeth  Towers","Aleksandra  Radjenovic","Julia  Brown","Amalia  Aggeli","Philip  Quirke","Richard  Thorpe","Todd Dale Stewart","Mike  Ries","Andrew  Bulpitt"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" High quality research and innovation platform\n?95m new research income\nEstablished academic supply chain and translational capability across 250 researchers\nActive collaborations and technology validation with 9 UK HEIs, 18 academic and clinical partners\nNew Medical Technologies building and a new post of Director of Innovation in Medical Technologies\n\nSuccessful sustainable innovation\nDefined robust sustainability model \nStrategically identified and prioritised key market sectors that offer significant opportunity\nDeveloped a culture of innovation across academic, industry and clinical partnerships\nSharing innovation good practice with 9 UK HEIs and other innovation hubs at Leeds\n166 collaborative projects, 66 industry co-investors\n\nEstablished profile and reputation\nRobust brand identity and reach across the UK and beyond through targeted marketing and communications\nStrategic alignment with Regener8 giving access to a 240 industry members, 328 academics and 21 clinicians across UK\nHigh profile events with national partners to engage the community in issues that impact on medical and regenerative technology innovation.\nSignificant political visits and media coverage\n\nSuccessful innovation and translation \nEstablished Innovation system, pipeline, stage gates and criteria for progression \nDefined IP portfolio and directly funded 42 Proof of Concept and 6 Co-Development projects \nPipeline of 166 collaborative innovation projects with industry, of which 48 directly IKC funded\nContributed to the development of 46 new products that have reached the market. \nGenerated ?57m investment in private sector partners for development of our IP/technology and a further ?30m plus investment in private sector for development arising out of collaborative projects The IKC has a proven system to identify larger collaborative projects with industrial partners. In these larger-scale projects the costs are split equally between ourselves and the Centre's industrial partners. Some of the larger co-development projects include:\n\n-- Working with Simulation Solutions to develop an electromechanical knee simulator\n\n-- A partnership with Tissue Regenix in the creation of a product for the repair of\n\ndamaged or worn knees using Tissue Regenix' proprietary technology platform\n\n-- Working alongside credentis ag to further develop self-assembling peptide biomimetic scaffolds for dental repair\n\n-- Working with NHS Blood and Transplant to improve processes for allograft tissue banking\n\nThe IKC also works with companies to support the development of technology beyond Technology Readiness Level 5 with direct, industry-funded projects that draw upon our unique capability to deliver projects demanded by industry. These are referred to as &quot;late stage innovation&quot; projects where a company directly accesses our expertise to support the development of their IP or to progress product development through independent, validated data from an ISO 9001 accredited and internationally-recognised laboratory\n The IKC leads the acceleration of new technologies and innovations to help them reach the marketplace faster. In the first three years the IKC has been involved in 136 projects that have direct industrial investment and engagement.\n\nWhilst our core capabilities in medical device research and development are in great demand, accounting for more than 70 per cent of our projects, our partners are increasingly interested in our knowledge of emerging markets, particularly in the areas of biosensors, stem cell and biological scaffold technologies.\n\nDeveloping relationships with centres of expertise across the UK has also been central to growth over the past year and we have seen further development of collaborative arrangements with a number of universities, including the Bristol Urological Institute, the University of Cambridge and St Andrews University. We have formed a strategic alliance with Regener8 - the partnership of academics from the eight leading research-intensive universities of the North of England (the N8 Research Partnership) - further strengthening our pool of expertise and resources and increasing our reach to more than 169 companies and more than 30 clinicians Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
