It not only results in considerable personal suffering but also has major economic and social impact. In spite of many years of research we still have very little understanding of what causes the disorder. Perhaps the best clue comes from the fact that that we know that genes appear play an important role in influencing who develops schizophrenia from studies of families, twins, and people who have been adopted. However at present, of the 30 000 or so genes each person carries, we do not know which contribute to the disease. Broadly speaking, the main aim of study is to use modern molecular genetic methods to identify some of the specific genes involved in schizophrenia. Identification of these genes should, through further studies, enable researchers to understand what brings schizophrenia about and then to develop more effective treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9309834","grantId":"G9309834","fundValue":"5361270","fundStart":"1993-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael John Owen","coPersons":["Michael Conlon O'Donovan","Peter  Holmans","Nigel  Williams","George  Kirov"],"organisation":"University of Wales College of Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
