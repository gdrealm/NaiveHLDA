{"id":"EE71162A-5A4A-4120-B414-9AC2B2DE20A4","title":"SANDPIT: TOTeM Tales of Things, Electronic Memory","abstractText":"The principle aim of the research project is to provide a platform to allow memories to be attached to objects that already exist in the world. The project identifies a significant gap in the emerging aspect of the digital economy known as the 'internet of things', which as new objects are tagged there is a real danger that old ones will not be. The TOTeM project is concerned with the memory and value of 'old' objects. It has been suggested that people surround themselves with between 1,000 and 5,000 objects. Of those thousands of objects many of them are probably not truly cared for and end up in rubbish bins or in storage. But for every owner, in almost every household there are a selection of objects that hold significant resonance, and will already connect them to an Internet of memory and meaning. An intrinsic human trait is the process of imbuing meaning onto objects so that they provide connections to people, events and environments. Artefacts across a mantelpiece become conduits between events that happened in the past, to people who will occupy the future. These objects become essential coordinates across families and communities to support the telling of a stories and passing-on knowledge.The TOTeM project is located within the emerging technical and cultural phenomenon known as 'The Internet of Things'. The term is attributed to the Auto-ID research group at MIT in 1999, and was explored in depth by the International Telecommunication Union who published a report bearing the same name at the United Nations net summit in 2005. The term, 'internet of things', refers to the technical and cultural shift that is anticipated as society moves to a ubiquitous form of computing in which every device is 'on', and every device is connected in some way to the internet. The specific reference to 'things' refers to the concept that every new object manufactured will also be able to part of this extended Internet, because they will have been tagged and indexed by the manufacturer during production. It is also envisaged that consumers will have the ability to 'read' the tags through the use of mobile 'readers' and use the information connected to the object, to inform their purchase, use and disposal of an object.The implications for the Internet of Things upon production and consumption are tremendous, and will transform the way in which people shop, store and share products. The analogue bar code that has for so long been a dumb encrypted reference to a shops inventory system, will be superseded by an open platform in which every object manufactured will be able to be tracked from cradle to grave, through manufacturer to distributor, to potentially every single person who comes in to contact with it following its purchase. Further still, every object that comes close to another object, and is within range of a reader, could also be logged on a database and used to find correlations between owners and applications. In a world that has relied upon a linear chain of supply and demand between manufacturer and consumer via high street shop, the Internet of Things has the potential to transform how we will treat objects, care about their origin and use them to find other objects. If every new object is within reach of a reader, everything is searchable and findable, subsequently the shopping experience may never be the same, and the concept of throwing away objects may become a thing of the past as other people find new uses for old things.Spimes are manufactured objects whose informational support is so overwhelmingly extensive and rich that they are regarded as material instantiations of an immaterial system. Spimes begin and end as data. They're virtual objects first and actual objects second.

The Oxfam press release read as follows:\nEver wished an object could tell its story? That's the idea behind Oxfam's unique pilot scheme, Oxfam Shelflife, launching on 27 February in 10 Oxfam shops across Manchester. The Oxfam Shelflife app uses QR codes to enable the public to discover the stories behind Oxfam's donated, ethical and Unwrapped products, and even share their own stories for the items they donate.\n\nThe project is the latest innovation from Oxfam which promotes sustainability by encouraging people to look beyond disposable consumerism. The stories behind vintage and second-hand items are all part of their desirability. At the moment these stories can be lost when an item is acquired by a new owner but Oxfam Shelflife enables the stories to stay with the items in a more long-lasting way.\n\nOxfam's Sarah Farquhar, Head of Retail Brand said: &quot;Every item has a story to tell and Oxfam Shelflife enables people to share these stories. We've found that items with an interesting story behind them are instantly more appealing to our customers so we hope Oxfam Shelflife will encourage people to love items for longer. This commitment to sustainability is an important part of what Oxfam shops bring to the high street.&quot;\n\nThe scheme allows donors to 'tag' a QR code to their donated object, using the free Oxfam Shelflife app on their iPhone and share the story behind the item for the next owner to discover. Shoppers who visit the participating Oxfam stores can then scan the QR code on the item, via the app, which will take them to the unique story behind the object. Usually QR codes direct users to a website or URL but the Oxfam Shelflife app enables users to engage and interact with the technology, taking QR codes on to a new level.\n\nThe concept behind Oxfam Shelflife is based on an original idea developed by the Tales of Things initiative (TOTeM: Tales of Things and Electronic Memory), a collaboration between five British universities: University College London, The University of Edinburgh/Edinburgh College of Art, Brunel University, the University of Dundee and the University of Salford. The TOTeM initiative was funded by a ?1.4m grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.\n\nDr Chris Speed from the Edinburgh College of Art and part of the TOTeM team said: &quot;Oxfam Shelflife has the potential to transform shops from places of consumption into places of stories and reflection. Shopping is no longer about buying things from unknown people in unknown places, instead the Oxfam Shelflife app will allow people to 'write' their stories on to products and help prevent them heading for the landfill.&quot;\n\nTo find out more about the Oxfam Shelflife project and find a participating shop visit http://shelflife.oxfam.org.uk/how_it_works/ Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Transport Cultural,Societal,Economic","person":"Chris  Speed","coPersons":["Maria  Burke","Jon  Rogers","Angelina  Karpovich","Andrew  Hudson-Smith"],"organisation":"Landscape Institute","findingsText":" Since the launch of the www.talesofthings.com public platform for attaching memories to physical objects, that was part of the RCUK funded TOTeM project, the Design Informatics team (University of Edinburgh) have been exploring the relationship between physical objects and their data shadows. Using a wide variety technologies from RFID tags, GPS and barcodes the team has helped Annie Lennox attach her memory of Nelson Mandela to a dress, museums let the public write their memories on to Singer sewing machines, history of local food to be distributed across every barcoded product in Liverpool and residents of Wester-Hailes use their memories to build their future. Smart phone Apps such as the Tales of Things, Mr Seels Garden, Ghost Cinema and Take Me I'm Yours all use data to disrupt the perception of places and physical objects. By altering the value, recovering ghosts from the past, or constraining access to a local context, the research practice has opened up new ways of understanding how data changes our relationship with physical 'things'.\n\nThe ability to offer experiences and solutions that produce new relationships between material and immaterial 'things' has led to a unique engagement with a wide variety of companies and organisations who want data to change the way that they and they audiences/clients see the world. Features in the BBC Digital Human programme, NYTimes and WIRED (there have now been over 80 print, broadcast and on-line articles published, internationally, on the research) have helped position the creative and technical team develop innovative projects for Oxfam, National Museums of Scotland, English Heritage, National Trust for Scotland, Edinburgh City Council and Lothian Buses. Our research in to the use of QR codes in museums picked up a lot of interest and we have been invited to do several talks in this area as well as our research in to how people respond to storytelling through the use of objects.
