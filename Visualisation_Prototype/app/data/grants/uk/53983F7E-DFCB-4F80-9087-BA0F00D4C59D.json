Labour sought to control speculative forces which were becoming powerful in an increasingly interdependent world economy. Its weapons were exchange controls and international financial co-operation: it sought a managed market at home and in the international environment. Devaluation was resisted up to 1967 because up to then the economic case was unconvincing. </p>\n\n<p>The government has been criticised for introducing austerity packages to impress international creditors willing to provide support for sterling - but it is arguable that these would have been required even if there had been an early devaluation. In 1967 it appeared that the emergency measures were working until international political and economic crisis led to a poor set of trade figures, a run on the currency and ultimate devaluation. In 1968 Labour successfully fought off further speculative attacks on sterling while over the following year its management of the economy led to a large balance of payments surplus. By the time it left office in 1970 it had freed Britain from its 'balance of payments constraint'&nbsp;and had built a platform for sustainable growth.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1354","grantId":"RES-000-23-1354","fundValue":"92335","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Scott  Newton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
