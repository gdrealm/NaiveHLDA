{"id":"CE69519B-8821-4003-BFB5-64823D5F96AC","title":"Class Differences in Gender Employment Equality in Six Countries","abstractText":"<p>The gender gaps in education, employment, and domestic tasks persist, despite the implementation of equal opportunity and other policies to reduce them. Women's labour force participation increased in the second half of the 21st Century, but men's domestic hours have not kept pace. This suggests a shift between hours in paid and unpaid labour occurring at macro as well as micro levels, from homes of high-wage workers to low-wage jobs in the service sector, jobs frequently dominated by women. Consequently, the potential for greater gender equality in employment among upper-income households derives from persistent class inequality that minimises the potential for gender equality within lower-income households.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This research uses data from the Luxembourg Income Study to compare relative work hours and wages between women and men, and also across groups of women within Australia, East Germany, Spain, West Germany, the UK, and the US. These countries codified diverse equality structures in their initial welfare provisions, structuring class relations and varying women's access to paid work. Subsequent equal opportunity laws painted over the historical foundation, changing the hue but not the bases of equality. The analyses will map the present intersection of class and gender employment equality built on these bases.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2819","grantId":"RES-000-22-2819","fundValue":"35722","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lynn Prince Cooke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
