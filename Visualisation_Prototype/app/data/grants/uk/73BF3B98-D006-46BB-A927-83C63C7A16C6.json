Within the brain there are two major visual networks, the ?ventral stream? for identifying patterns, objects and faces, and the ?dorsal? stream which registers the movements and positions of objects to control actions such as reaching. We have found that the ?dorsal stream? is particularly vulnerable in children with certain genetic developmental disorders e.g. Williams Syndrome, autism, and in children who have suffered brain damage, often due to periods of oxygen lack around birth. \n\nWe will devise new ?brain wave? measures for infants and children alongside child-friendly computer tests to measure the normal course of relative development in dorsal and ventral streams. We will use different types of motion (dorsal) e.g. the outward movement that occurs when we move forwards, and the relative movement by which we see an object move against its background. We will compare these to children?s ability to see similar but static versions of these patterns, which are processed in the ventral stream. \n\nWe will apply these tests to study development in infants born very prematurely, who are at risk of lifelong problems, ranging from attention deficits (ADHD) to severe cerebral palsy. As clinical trials of therapies in the newborn periodwith special intervention therapies are introduced, a major difficulty is the long delay between intervention around birth, and much later ages at which these children?s abilities can be measured. We will bridge this gap by designing safe, effective tests for babies in the first months of life, to measure visual processing in the dorsal and ventral streams. We will compare our test results with MRI brain imaging analyses carried out at birth) and with development up to 18 months, to identify which brain systems are most vulnerable to damage, which can recover or be substituted, and which infant tests are the best predictors of later abilities.\n\nOur longer term goal is to design and use these sensitive tests for specific aspects of vision to evaluate the effectiveness of early treatment in children at high risk of later problems, whether they arise from genetic disorders or early brain damage, so that effective therapies can be introduced as early as possible to reduce lifelong mental health problems and reduce healthcare and educational costs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601007","grantId":"G0601007","fundValue":"878732","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Janette  Atkinson","coPersons":["Oliver John Braddick","John Richard Wattam-Bell"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
