The interactions and transactions of everyday life were conducted through, and recorded by, a host of ephemeral printed documents - eloquent witness to the development of patterns of modern life. Their rich and varied configurations, colours, and texts made-new demands on newly literate audiences. Victorian 'information design' - a graphic equivalent of engineering, and done before the emergence of professional designers - is the most intelligent, but secret, ancestor of today's graphic design. This research reveals and explains what we can learn from it.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119215/1","grantId":"119215/1","fundValue":"387074","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Stiff","coPersons":["Sue  Walker"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
