{"id":"DCEE30B8-F70A-4D7B-BFB6-8F11D7520BBE","title":"Performance of Cellular Composite Floor Beams under Severe Fire Conditions","abstractText":"Despite the current popularity of long-span composite flooring systems, the current structural fire engineering design codes EC3/4 Part 1.2 and BS5950 Part 8 do not contain rules or guidance on the fire resistance of composite floors employing cellular steel beams. The purpose of this project is to investigate the performance and failure mechanisms of full-scale composite cellular floor beams at elevated temperatures over a range of spans, including the influence of both flexure and shear, alone and in combination. Emphasis will also be placed on examining the development and influence of the additional compression forces caused by axial restraint to thermal expansion ensuing from the surrounding structure when a beam is heated in a fire. The proposed research is based on a programme of physical model fire tests at Ulster, to provide a wealth of data which will greatly enhance the level of understanding of behaviour of composite cellular steel beams in fire. This approach will be extended and enhanced by the integration of computer modelling with the testing, initially for validation and rationalisation of the behaviour, but leading to an extensive parametric study aimed at developing a design methodology for such members in fire. The availability of sound design guidance on composite floors using steel CBs exposed to fire would make it possible to calculate fire protection requirements on a rational and trustworthy basis which does not exist at present, and would lead to possible worldwide export opportunities for UK consultants and fabricators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F001525/1","grantId":"EP/F001525/1","fundValue":"404764","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The significance of the New European Fire Design Guidance, ( http://www.ife.org.uk/about/events / \nInnovative Construction Design for Fire Safety Engineering: European Training Course) has been emphasised by Euro Coal Steel supported by the Institution of Fire Engineering and industrial partners.

Concerning European Design Guidance, the underpinning research, in particular the results from the major compartment fire test and findings from the fire resistance of long span cellular beams project have directly led to the development of a new design code for single cellular beams submitted to fire and extended design guidance concerning the whole floor structure The significance of the design guidance to industry is highlighted by Arcelor Mittal which highlights benefits concerning fire protection and economic designs. Likewise, the findings of the research are directly applicable to manufacturers with for example ASD Westok confirming the impact upon potential market share and cost savings to the company. \nCommercially there has been benefit to long span construction and an increased market share of steel. As an illustration of the commercial benefit, ASD Westok suggests a cost saving of circa &pound;3 to 5 million per annum. Construction,Creative Economy,Education,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
