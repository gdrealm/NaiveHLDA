{"id":"75F597EA-E7ED-42B8-9FD7-849974FEF2C1","title":"Acquisition of a rich annotated corpus of binocular eye-movements from dyslexic readers","abstractText":"<p>In this project representative numbers of high-achieving (ie university student) dyslexics will be studied reading 5000 words of English text on a screen. Their precise eye-movements will be monitored and recorded, showing the exact locations and durations of the fixations of the right and left eye on the text. This information will be compared with that from an existing large corpus of the eye-movements of more typical readers. </p>\n\n<p>The goal is to understand the differences between these two populations of readers, in terms of the effects of a range of different aspects of the text, such as the length of a word, its frequency in the language, or the details of the adjacent words, which have all been shown to affect individual fixations in reading. These data will speak to ongoing controversies about both normal and impaired reading, such as the degree of high-level control exerted during reading, how many words are being processed at any one time, and the ways in which the two eyes relate to each other behaviourally. </p>\n\n<p>The dyslexic readers will be tested on a range of language and visual processing tasks to confirm their status as dyslexics.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H002839/1","grantId":"ES/H002839/1","fundValue":"80579","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We have continued to work on the corpus of eye-movements, using it to inform our own theorising about the reading capacities of dyslexics. The database is complex and is closely tied to the computational and methodological infrastructure in which the data were acquired, together with theoretical assumptions concerning the binocular reading of multiline text. These considerations have meant that we have restricted the analysis of the database to our own group.

Dyslexic and typical readers behaved comparably in that the final binocular disparity within a fixation was about 90% of the initial disparity.We have concentrated on exploring the movements of the two eyes within fixations. We have discovered that in dyslexics there are more directionally variable horizontal movements, particularly left-to-right ones, compared with more typical readers, and beginning from a more leftward position within the word. Dyslexic reader, particularly males, move their left eye more variably. This variability is interpretable within our own hemisphere-based analysis of eye-movements in reading.We have also demonstrated precise coordination between the two eyes in the first published eye-tracking of an individual with Duane's Syndrome, in which the left eye is inhibited from moving to the left of the middle of the page. We are continuing to work on the statistical analysis of the full dataset, which will allow us to test various hypotheses about the dyslexics' reading behaviours. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
