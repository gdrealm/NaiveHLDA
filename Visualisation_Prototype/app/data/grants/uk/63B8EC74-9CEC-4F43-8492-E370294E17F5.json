This has greatly improved communication between researchers at the two locations, which will further strengthen research links between the two partners At least 3 ongoing scientific collaborations have already arisen out of the grant. This has resulted in scientific manuscripts that are being prepared for publication, on circadian rhythms, on protein trafficking and on Golgi function, in discipline of cell and developmental biology. At least one substantial collaborative research grant application is planned. Additionally, exchange of researchers between Manchester and Beijing in the future is likely.
