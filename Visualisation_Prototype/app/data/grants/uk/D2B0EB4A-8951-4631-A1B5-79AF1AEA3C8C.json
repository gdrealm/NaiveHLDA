The seminar series brought together journalists, practitioners and academics with diverse and competing disciplinary perspectives about the links between emotional well-being, social justice and how we regard the human subject from sociology, philosophy, history, international relations and politics. Our seminar series illuminated important gaps in public and academic awareness of this overlooked area of education policy and practice. The seminar series has been highly productive, leading to public debates, publications and further funding bids. It has also led to international collaborations. With government policy continuing to emphasise the emotional well-being of children, young people and adults and to regard educational settings as prime sites for intervention, our work in this area has continued to have a high profile, and to attract a lot of interest.
