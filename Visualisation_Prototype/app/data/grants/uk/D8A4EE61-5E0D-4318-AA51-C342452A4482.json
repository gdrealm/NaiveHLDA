Science and technology are advancing rapidly but with uneven benefits. Navigating complexities, while meeting moral and political imperatives for poverty alleviation, social justice and environmental sustainability, is vital.</p>\n\n<p>The STEPS (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) Centre works with partners in Africa, Asia and Latin America to address these challenges and build pathways to sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>In phase 2, the Centre will build on and further enrich its unique ‘pathways approach’ to research and policy engagement. Integrating development studies with science and technology studies, and in thoroughgoing engagement with natural scientists and users, it will develop new understandings of how the themes of ‘dynamics’, ‘governance’ and ‘designs’ interact. It will advance theory and processes of pathway-building through eight new projects across the domains of food and agriculture, health and disease, water and sanitation, and energy and climate change. Cross-cutting workstreams will develop a repertoire of novel interdisciplinary Methods and Methodologies, and expand Impact, Communications and Engagement activities geared to building pathways to sustainability and social justice in diverse local, national and global contexts.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-588-28-5001","grantId":"RES-588-28-5001","fundValue":"3835830","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Melissa  Leach","coPersons":["Ian  Scoones","Lyla  Mehta","Erik Paul Millstone","Gerald  Bloom","William  Wolmer"],"organisation":"Institute of Development Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
