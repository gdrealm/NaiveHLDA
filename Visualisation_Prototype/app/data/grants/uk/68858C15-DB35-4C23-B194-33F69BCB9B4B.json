It comprises two pieces of linked research that will use identical methodologies and research questions: a multi-sited investigation into gambling and problem gambling in betting shops in London, and an inquiry into the understanding of gambling and problem gambling among the Chinese community in London's Chinatown. Gambling is a social activity that fulfils a number of different roles in particular societies. It is therefore intrinsically cultural. In order to understand what goes wrong when gambling negatively impacts people's lives it is first necessary to understand what gambling means to them and to their families and communities. The length of time spent in betting shops and in Chinatown will enable the researchers to collect data that cannot easily be gathered via questionnaires and interviews.</p> \n<p>The project will culminate in an international interdisciplinary conference bringing together qualitative approaches to problem gambling from all over the world. The primary outcome of this conference will be an international blueprint for the culturally sensitive study of problem gambling.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-164-25-0005","grantId":"RES-164-25-0005","fundValue":"83124","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca  Cassidy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
