The purpose of this project is to understand how international sustainability policies are changing in response to these conditions.</p>\n\n<p>With the aim of reconciling economic development and environmental sustainability, some policy actors have adopted new concepts and strategies such as ‘green growth’ and ‘green economy’. But there are other competing and overlapping understandings of the environment-economy nexus captured in such terms as inclusive wealth, de-growth, steady-state economy, and buen vivir. This project will assess innovations in international environmental policy in terms of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>how they are informed by these multiple understandings</li>\n\n <li>the degree to which these innovations have brought policy into line with the conditions necessary to prevent further environmental degradation.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>International organisations frequently take a leadership role in advancing new sustainability concepts and strategies; therefore, these organisations are the focus of this study. Methodologically, this is an interpretivist, case study-based project informed by three methods:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Q methodology</li>\n\n <li>document analysis</li>\n\n <li>semi-structured interviews with international civil servants and stakeholders.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009761/1","grantId":"ES/K009761/1","fundValue":"197567","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  I am only 12 months into my research, so this is not relevant.
