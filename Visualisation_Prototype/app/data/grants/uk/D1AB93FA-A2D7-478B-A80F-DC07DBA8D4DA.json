{"id":"D1AB93FA-A2D7-478B-A80F-DC07DBA8D4DA","title":"Comparing for Improvement: the development and impact of public services audit and inspection in UK local government","abstractText":"<p>Local government has been subject to more intensive scrutiny than ever before and devolution has meant that different approaches to inspection have begun to emerge in England, Scotland and Wales. This study will analyse these emerging differences.&nbsp; It will consider how inspection regimes have evolved in the three countries, describe and account for the differences, and analyse which approaches work best.&nbsp; The study will also reflect upon whether developments in local government reflect wider trends in other sectors and in other countries.</p> \n<p>The findings of this study will be of considerable interest to academics who are interested in the role of inspection in improving services and the impacts of devolution on public policy and management.&nbsp; They will also provide policy makers at national and local level with much needed independent analysis of alternative approaches to performance improvement and their likely impacts.</p> \n<p>The researchers will conduct a detailed analysis of the different approaches by reviewing academic literature, Government reports and through in-depth interviews with ministers, civil servants and inspectors. The potential impacts of these different approaches will be assessed through a detailed statistical analysis of rates of improvements in the quality and efficiency of services over the last five years.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-166-25-0034","grantId":"RES-166-25-0034","fundValue":"77542","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen James Martin","coPersons":["James Daniel Downe","Sandra Margaret Nutley"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
