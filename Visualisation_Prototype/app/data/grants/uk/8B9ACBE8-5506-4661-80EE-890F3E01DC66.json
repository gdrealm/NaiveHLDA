{"id":"8B9ACBE8-5506-4661-80EE-890F3E01DC66","title":"Survey of users' views of unlinked anonymous testing of blood","abstractText":"<p>Unlinked anonymous testing of blood for HIV was introduced in many countries in the late 1980s and provides valuable public health information, but it does not usually involve gaining explicit informed consent for the blood test. Although justified when introduced by the public health emergency of the time, it has been argued that the difficult balancing of public health needs with patients' rights needs re-examining.<br />&nbsp;<br />The aim of this research is to undertake a survey of sexual health service users' knowledge of, and attitudes towards, unlinked anonymous testing of blood for HIV and other diseases in the United Kingdom (UK). The survey will comprise 400 self-completed structured questionnaires, and 20 face-to-face in-depth interviews of service users, complemented by in-depth interviews of key stakeholders in the UK. This work will be supplemented by in-depth interviews with stakeholders in three countries chosen because they represent the spectrum of national policies adopted around unlinked anonymous testing, from 'no consent required' through to refusal to implement unlink ed anonymous testing.<br />&nbsp;<br />The results will inform infectious disease services and policy in the UK. Comparisons of findings between the countries will provide insights to gaining consent in different settings. The overall results will provide valuable information about involving the public in infectious disease monitoring of this kind.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E015689/1","grantId":"ES/E015689/1","fundValue":"79602","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Kessel","coPersons":["Kiran  Nanchahal","Kaye  Wellings","Dalya  Marks"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
