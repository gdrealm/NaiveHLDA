{"id":"E32C7655-F9F3-49F7-85AD-7C76A0D64DD3","title":"Bulk culture of commercially viable embryonic stem cells.","abstractText":"Dr Ward has developed and patented an enabling technology that permits the growth of embryonic stem cells in high density 3D cultures without the need for potentially harmful mouse feeder lines and expensive growth factors. The technology helps maintain ES cells in an undifferentiated state for prolonged periods (at least 30 days) and can significantly reduce the technical burden associated with current methods. By offering a route to simple, cost effective large volume culture of both mouse and human ES cells we will help to transform the utility of stem cells and widen their use as research tools and ultimately as therapeutic treatments of degenerative diseases. The objectives of this study are:- 1) Optimize and refine methods fro 3D stem cell culture; 2) Construct ES cell lines and media formulations for sale to the research community; 3) Produce a 'best practice' translatable manufacturing process; 4) To promote and market the technology to potential development partners and licensees.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E527239/1","grantId":"BB/E527239/1","fundValue":"90274","fundStart":"2007-05-14","fundEnd":"2008-05-13","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  2 x patents filed from this technology and a spin-out company formed Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Societal,Economic","person":"Christopher Michael Ward","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" Peptides developed for the culture of human and mouse ES cells in suspension culture Spin-out company formed to exploit project outcomes Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
