This is a very common disease and when it occurs the chances of survival are rather poor. Major issues in sepsis are that the patients' blood pressure becomes very low and their blood vessels become leaky. Together this causes a lot of harm and many of the bodies organs are not supplied with enough blood and so they become injured. Recently we identified a new pathway that lowers blood pressure and promotes vessel leakiness in healthy people, and have now we have found this is over-stimulated during sepsis resulting in organ damage. In these studies we hope to develop and test new drugs that prevent this pathway being actuated during sepsis. Such therapies are predicted to prevent organ damage and ultimately enhance patient survival during sepsis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L009684/1","grantId":"MR/L009684/1","fundValue":"502927","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2018-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Eaton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
