As with almost all classes of insecticides, major problems of resistance have now developed in insect field populations. A particular emphasis of this research proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of action of spinosad and to explore mechanisms of resistance to this insecticide. In parallel, studies will be undertaken to investigate the role of proteins involved in generating functional nAChRs. A goal of this second aspect of the proposed research project is to facilitate research aimed at elucidating the pharmacological diversity of insect nAChRs. Insect nAChRs are closely related to nAChRs expressed in the nervous system of vertebrates. Such receptors in humans have been implicated in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Indeed, some of the research proposed in this application will focus on mammalian nAChRs and it is expected that the research findings may, in the longer term, have relevance to research aimed at discovery of drugs targeting human nAChRs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G009392/1","grantId":"BB/G009392/1","fundValue":"312174","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Several of the cell lines generated during this research project have been made available to the agrochemical company Syngenta to aid with research and development.

A further goal was to examine the interaction of macrocyclic lactone pesticides (such as spinosad and ivermectin) on insect nicotinic receptors. Expression studies with insect nAChRs have focussed on the alpha5, alpha6 and alpha7 subunits from Drosophila. These are believed to co-assemble with one another and are be the target site for spinosad. By co-expression with molecular chaperones we have successfully demonstrated the functional expression of several novel nAChR subtypes (for example homomeric alpha5 and heteromeric 'triplet/ alpha5/alpha6/alpha7 nAChRs). This work has been published. \n\nWe have also isolated a full length cDNA clone of alpha6 from the important insect pest species Frankliniella occidentalis.We have also identified a resistance-associated point mutation in a strain of F. occidentalis that is resistant to spinosad. By heterologous expression studies (with cloned molecular chaperones) we have demonstrated that this resistance-associated point mutation alters allosteric modulation of nAChRs by spinosad and ivermectin. This work has been published. A better understanding of mechanisms of resistance to insecticides will help in managing crop protection strategies. Thirty cell lines expressing recombinant nicotinic receptors have been generated at during this project and transferred to our industrial partner under our collaborative Industrial Partnership Award agreement. The information we have obtained concerning mechanisms of resistance to insecticides will help in understanding their mechanism and site of action - an important aspect required for studies aimed at development and discovery of new compounds.
