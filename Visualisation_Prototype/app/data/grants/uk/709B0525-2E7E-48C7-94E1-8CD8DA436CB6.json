In so doing, deep insights will be gained about the origin and evolution of the Universe, especially in the first moments after the Big Bang.\nThe Lancaster research programme covers all the main types of accelerator facilities and is based on hadron collider physics with the LHC (CERN) machine, and the observation of long baseline neutrino oscillations in Japan and elsewhere. All of this work will be underpinned by Lancaster's expertise in characterising and understanding the properties of heavily irradiated silicon particle detectors, in operating high performance computing facilities on the Grid and in writing offline event reconstruction software.\nThe hadron collider physics is expected to reveal detailed properties of B hadrons (containing heavy b-quarks) including the mixing of neutral B mesons containing strange quarks, and CP violation which is related to the existence of the matter- antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Searches for new physics at the LHC will focus on understanding role and nature of the Higgs boson, the existence of new symmetries of nature (e.g. supersymmetry) and extra spatial dimensions.\nThe neutrino oscillations programme is expected to provide important information about the masses of and the amount of mixing amongst the three known species of neutrinos. If the appearance of electron neutrinos can be well measured in a muon neutrino beam then it may be possible, in a further phase of the research, to establish the existence of CP violation in the neutrino sector of the Standard Model. This could have wide reaching implications for the understanding of the matter- antimatter asymmetry of the Universe.\nThe development of new particle accelerator technology for high energy particle physics and a broad range of alternative applications is the mission of the Cockcroft Institute. The Lancaster group were co-founders of the Institute and remain committed to supporting its evolution. Equally, we work to develop particle detectors (silicon strip, pixel, LAr TPC) and technologies (CMOS) to benefit the field, but also with potential spin-out benefit to science and society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N001230/1","grantId":"ST/N001230/1","fundValue":"17930","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Roger William Jones","coPersons":["Guennadi  Borissov","Vakhtang  Kartvelishvili","Helen Mary  O'Keeffe","Iain  Bertram","Harald  Fox","Jaroslaw Andrzej Nowak","Laura Lee Kormos"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
