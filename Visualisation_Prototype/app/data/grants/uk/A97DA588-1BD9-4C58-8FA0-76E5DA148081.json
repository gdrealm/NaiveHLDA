These measurements present a major technological problem caused by diffraction of THz waves. The diffraction limit prevents the use of the recently developed THz spectroscopic instrumentation for studies of objects smaller than approximately a wavelength. Near-field surface probing methods have shown potential solutions in overcoming the diffraction limit. However all the existing THz near-field techniques exhibit another fundamental limitation due to significant perturbations in the electric field caused by the near-field probe. The probe invasiveness and a non-uniform frequency response across the THz spectrum prevent the use of the existing near-field probes for mapping of electric field distribution in THz devices. In addition, THz near-field imaging systems with spatial resolution better than ~1/20 of a wavelength suffer from a severe reduction in sensitivity.To mitigate these problems and to allow high spatial resolution studies with THz waves we propose to develop a THz imaging and spectroscopy system with a novel near-field probe. The probe concept exploits the non-invasive nature of the electro-optic detection method and utilizes an optical micro-resonator to enhance the detection sensitivity. The proposed electro-optic micro-resonator will be integrated into a fibre-coupled near-field probe. It will allow THz wave and signal probing with a spatial resolution of ~5 microns (~1/100 of the wavelength) and it will offer full spectroscopic capabilities in the THz range (0.1-2.0 THz). The novelty of this approach is in exploiting the optical cavity resonance for electro-optic detection of THz waves by an extremely small near-field probe. The goal of this research programme is to develop and build the THz near-field probing system and apply it in device research on the sub-wavelength scale. The proposed technology will expand the spectrum of THz studies to micrometre-scale objects. It will aid in the progress of THz device research and will facilitate studies of THz phenomena in physics, materials science and other disciplines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G033870/1","grantId":"EP/G033870/1","fundValue":"305141","fundStart":"2009-08-28","fundEnd":"2013-02-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our contribution to THz near-field microscopy is making the UK competitive in the world arena in this area of research and technology development, where Germany, S.

SWs play a key role in many devices, including waveguides, antennas, plasmonic filters. SWs typically remain undetected due to their localised nature. Our investigations demonstrated that THz SWs can be detected and visualised with the integrated sub-wavelenght aperture probe that we have been developing. We explained the coupling mechanism and developed a high-spatial resolution method for mapping THz SWs. We demonstrated application of this method for studies of planar metallic antennas (commonly used for improving efficiency of THz sources and detectors). We also developed and demonstrated a novel THz near-field microscopy method using THz surface waves. \n\n- Waveguides are essential for enabling applications of THz technologies. Development of efficient waveguides for THz frequencies remain a challenging problem due to high signal transmission losses at THz frequencies. We developed a method for characterising modal properties for THz waveguides (transmission losses, dispersion and spatial mode profile). The method was instrumental in the development and demonstration of dielectric-lined hollow cylindrical metallic waveguides, which exhibit some of the best THz transmission properties reported to date (in collaboration with Rutgers University (USA)). \n\n- Near-field microscopy and spectroscopy technology is essential for applications in fundamental scientific and engineering research as well as for practical applications. Building blocks of THz technology are often of sub-wavelength size (metamaterial unit cells, Josephson Junction oscillators, high-speed electronic elements, such as the transistor); many potential applications of THz technology also require probing sub-wavelength size samples (biomedical applications, sensor applications)\nTo enable applications of THz spectroscopy for sub-wavelength objects, we developed and demonstrated broadband (non-resonant) concentration of THz waves to deeply sub-wavelength volumes. We have achieved one of the highest THz wave confinement demonstrated experimentally to date. The potential of THz high-resolution microscopy for broader scientific applications allowed us to establish a fruitful research collaboration with universities and industrial research laboratories. The developed technology and methods can also be transferred to other universities to enable studies which were not possible before.
