Television could provide an important resource of information, interpretive frameworks and debate about the social, political, economic and cultural dimensions of young peoples lives. However, there is evidence of a problem of disconnection between television news, current affairs and young people. Using content analysis, audience research and interviews with programme makers, this study will explore the extent to which factual programming tums off young viewers and what imaginative changes in programming provision might combat this disconnection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112169/1","grantId":"112169/1","fundValue":"108393","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Wayne","coPersons":["Julian  Petley","Lesley  Henderson"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
