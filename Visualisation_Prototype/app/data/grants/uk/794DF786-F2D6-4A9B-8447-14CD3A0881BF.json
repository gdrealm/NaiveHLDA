The process is called hybrid liquid phase epitaxy(HLPE). We are beyond the proof-of-concept stage and now need to show cost-effective, demonstrator lengths of quality technical conductor. As well as the practical development of a conductor, by the end of the project, we also aim to have a business plan formulated, with key patent applications also in place.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D503167/1","grantId":"EP/D503167/1","fundValue":"54043","fundStart":"2006-03-24","fundEnd":"2006-12-23","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Yes- the technology is being used in an EU project and by a Korean company Electronics,Energy,Environment Societal,Economic","person":"Judith Louise Driscoll","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" In this 6 month long grant, we demonstrated the method of making HLPE coated conductors of the superconductor YBCO. We did this on metallic substrates. HLPE is a fast process which the PI first published the initial signs of in 1995. We continue to use this method and I am trying to rekindle it in a new EU project so that the EU has a chance to compete with the Koreans. We made a patent together with Nexans when we went on to develop the method further as part of an EU funded project.\n\nNexans stopped working on making superconducting coated conductors but a company in Korea are now using this method very succesfully and are leading the world. The PI was unable to get any more funding from EPSRC as the field became unfashionable in the UK. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
