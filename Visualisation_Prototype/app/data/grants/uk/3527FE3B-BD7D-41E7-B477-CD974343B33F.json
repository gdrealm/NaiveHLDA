Two of these academics are chemists based in chemistry departments at two different universities, whilst the third is a chemical engineer based in a chemical engineering department at a third different university. The idea is for all the applicants to learn new approaches to their research from the others. To do this, they will work on a project which will develop new catalysts which are able to utilise sunlight to effect chemical changes. This area of research is of potential importance for the clean-up of contamined water supplies. Some of these catalysts may also be able to directly split the water, producing hydrogen fuel from sunlight and water. As well as increasing the expertise of the researchers involved, the combination of people with such different backgrounds/approaches may identify new areas of research or new approaches to be taken to tackle existing problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E012167/1","grantId":"EP/E012167/1","fundValue":"52759","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Justin Stephen James Hargreaves","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
