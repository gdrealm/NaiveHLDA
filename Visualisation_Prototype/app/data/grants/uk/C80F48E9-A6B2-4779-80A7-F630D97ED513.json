Despite low ppt concentrations of these compounds in environmental matrices, PACs pose considerable environmental concern as many of them are active at very low concentrations. Additionally, PACs are present in the environment as multi-residue mixtures, and therefore synergistic effects of PACs should also be considered. Due to the non-volatile nature of the majority of PACs, and their continuous introduction into the environment, their environmental impact cannot be underestimated. PACs have also been detected in drinking water, which poses a direct risk to humans and raises the issue of contaminated water sources and especially water reuse.\n\nWater is a limited resource in an expanding global economy and population. In the future its accessibility will be significantly impacted by changing climate. Reclaiming water for non-potable (irrigation, urban, industrial) or potable purposes is therefore considered to be an important element of sustainable water resource management. There are, however, certain risks associated with water reuse including microbiological and chemical risks (e.g. the presence of PACs in reclaimed water). They have to be verified before water reuse is to be implemented on a wider scale.\nSeveral groups of PACs such as beta-blockers, antibiotics or analgesics have been studied before in the environment but surprisingly their chiral character, despite its great importance in the pharmaceutical industry, has been overlooked by environmental researchers.\n\nMore than half of the drugs currently in use are chiral compounds and many of those are distributed as racemates consisting of an equimolar mixture of two enantiomers. Enantiomers of the same drug have the same chemical formula and physicochemical properties but they differ in interactions with chiral environments such as enzymes. Therefore in biological systems they have to be recognised as two different substances that elicit different responses: one enantiomer of the same drug may produce the desired therapeutic activity, while the other may be inactive or even toxic. The ratio of active/inactive enantiomer of the chiral drug can change significantly after its administration, metabolism in and excretion from the body. It can be subsequently altered during wastewater treatment and when the drug is already present in the environment. This is because degradation of enantiomers can be stereo-specific and can in some cases lead to an increase in the drug's toxicity. As a result chiral PACs might reveal different environmental persistence, fate and toxicity. Currently, the environmental fate and toxicity of chiral drugs are assessed without taking into consideration their enantiomeric form. This might lead to a significant under or overestimation of toxicity of chiral drugs and to inaccurate environmental risk assessment.\n\nAs a consequence there is an urgent need to identify chiral drugs, which are resistant to currently used wastewater treatment technologies, are characterised by stereoselective degradation during wastewater treatment and can as a result be released into the environment or remain in reclaimed water in the form of non-racemic mixtures. This project will tackle this issue as it aims to test the hypothesis that degradation of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters is stereoselective and will be undertaken at the laboratory scale with the usage of microcosm protocol and in a full scale wastewater treatment plant. \n\nThis research project has the potential to provide significant advances in understanding of the mechanisms of the distribution and fate of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters and open up a new area of research directed at the stereoselective behaviour of drugs in the environment. It will also be of vital importance for the verification of risks associated with water reclamation","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I038608/1","grantId":"EP/I038608/1","fundValue":"75337","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This research project provided advances in understanding of transformation mechanisms of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment and opened a new area of research directed at stereoisomerism of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters. The phenomenon of chirality is of critical importance in assessing the possible risk chiral drugs might pose to human health and the environment. With a growing population and changing climate limiting accessibility of clean water and forcing new solutions based on water reuse, an understanding of stereoselective pathways of chiral drugs in the environment is vital to provide safe sustainable water resource management solutions for future generations.\n\nOutcomes of the project were used to inform new procedures utilized in the newly-emerging interdisciplinary field of wastewater-based epidemiology which aims to provide an integrated approach towards public health monitoring at a community level based on innovative epidemiology techniques.

The project tested the hypothesis that two enantiomers of the same chiral drug, due to their different interactions with biological systems, should be recognised in environmental studies as two different substances that can elicit different responses potentially leading to changes in environmental fate and ecotoxicity of the drug. The groups of chiral drugs studied during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters included: amphetamine-like compounds (amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA and MDA), beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol, alprenolol, sotalol and metoprolol), antidepressants (fluoxetine, citalopram, mirtazapine and venlafaxine) and others (ephedrines, terbutaline, salbutamol and tramadol). \nThe set project objectives were fully met. New methods utilizing chiral chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry were developed for both liquid and solid environmental matrices.\nThis project proved the hypothesis that two enantiomers of the same chiral drug, due to their different interactions with biological systems, should be recognised in environmental studies as two different substances that can elicit different responses potentially leading to changes in environmental fate and ecotoxicity of the drug. Several chiral drugs were found, for the first time, to be subject to enantioselective degradation taking place during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters. Microcosm experiments revealed that stereoselective degradation occurs due to microbial metabolic processes utilised during wastewater treatment. Toxicity studies revealed that two enantiomers of the same drug show different toxicity towards certain aquatic organisms such as daphnia magna and algae. \nThe above is of critical significance in the environmental risk assessment of pharmacologically active compounds, which currently does not take into account enantiomerism of pollutants and potentially leads to a significant under or overestimation of toxicity of chiral drugs and to incorrect environmental risk assessment as chiral drugs are released into the environment in their non-racemic forms. This research project provided significant advances in understanding of the mechanisms of the distribution and fate of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters and opened a new area of research directed at the stereoselective behaviour of drugs in the environment. The project provided strong evidence that degradation of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment is enantioselective. The nature of the research is likely to mean that outcomes will be of interest to government bodies, such as the Environment Agency and DEFRA, in addition to the water industry (Wessex Water, see letter of support) and the general public.
