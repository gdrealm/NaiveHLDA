Our objectives are to understand the acceptance or marginalisation of BVI musicians within professional, amateur and educational musical communities; their involvement with different musical styles, instruments, practices and roles; opportunities and barriers they perceive in relation to personal development and participation throughout the life-course, along with their adaptive strategies; and their learning practices, both when they were children and into adult life, including how, for example, a blind professional musician prepares for a concert. Findings from our pilot study have indicated that BVI musicians tend to feel, on one hand, excluded and discriminated against; and on the other, highly respected amongst musicians generally for their abilities. Overall, there is a pressing need to develop and share information and increase understanding. The findings will be relevant for many parts of the musical community, including employers such as orchestras, educational providers including conservatoires and schools, music therapy organisations, community music groups, and others.\n\nOur investigation will begin with a questionnaire survey extended to 700 musicians who are currently registered with the RNIB (Royal National Institute for Blind People) as being BVI musicians. The survey will explore the demographics of musical participation (e.g. age, gender, instrument choice, reasons for starting or stopping musical participation, musical idiom, training background, and so forth). A purposive sample of approximately 40 of the adult participants will then be invited to contribute detailed life history interviews. The interviewees will represent a range of genres and instrumental disciplines, with a mix of professional and amateur performers, composers and teachers. They will be of various ages and sight-loss backgrounds. The study will look at their musical pathways from childhood to adulthood, their life-course issues, their musical practices, perceived barriers, and successful adaptations to musical participation. \n\nThere will be two half-day seminars held at the Institute of Education, University of London to allow respondents to network, reflect on preliminary findings and offer feedback, and feedback will also be sought throughout the fieldwork process. Our pilot interviewees highlighted the need to belong to a community of music practitioners who share a disability, since this augurs for gaining information necessary for musical development. A website will be created that is accessible both to sighted and BVI visitors. It will be search-engine optimised and linked to the RNIB site and other prominent music industry sites; and the aforementioned survey will be linked to this site. The website will assist in recruiting participants and sharing information about the reflective seminars, our main conference event and findings. There will also be a blog to which the research participants can contribute, thus assisting in building a national network of BVI musicians. These blog reflections will become part of the analysis with respondents' permission. Finally, the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) have agreed to invite the PI, CI and RNIB colleagues to present findings within the LRAM diploma and Open Academy programmes; from this platform, outreach days will be formed that engage music undergraduates in powerful, life-enhancing practical experiences with BVI adult musicians and children.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K003291/1","grantId":"AH/K003291/1","fundValue":"182717","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  David Baker has published an article for a peer-reviewed music education journal (please refer to Publications) and a second (i.e. Baker and Green), focussing specifically on learning, pedagogy and visual impairment is in the pipeline. Additionally, David Baker and Lucy Green are drafting a co-authored book concerning the various aspects of visually impaired musicians' lives. These publications are explained under Future Steps. Findings on learning and pedagogy have also been fed into training at the Royal Academy of Music, London (see Engagement Activities), with talks to staff members and students by the research team, and this is leading to musical outreach within the visual impairment unit of a London primary school. We will also be disseminating findings through a two-day international conference held at the Institute of Education, University of London in March 2015, presentations at other conferences, the dissemination of summary reports, and planned visits to other teams and groups vested in this field (e.g. the Music Technology Lab for the Visually Impaired at Berklee College of Music, Boston, USA).

Across the project thus far, we have been in contact with approximately 250 visually impaired musicians and 100 organisations, including major charities and educational institutions concerned with visual impairment and music (e.g. World Blind Union, Vision Australia, the National Federation of the Blind [USA], European Blind Union, Berklee College of Music [USA], BLENNZ [New Zealand], etc.). We believe there is scope for a major international investigation with the support of the global contacts we have developed across this current research.\n \nThere are traditions of visually impaired musicianship across the world, e.g. within the Limba ethnic group in Sierra Leone, minstrelsy in the Ukraine, in the early jazz of the US Southern States and in Japan reaching back to feudal times, e.g. the Biwa H?shi (lute) priests. Prominent jazz and popular musicians in recent years, such as Art Tatum, George Shearing and Ray Charles have, undoubtedly, also amplified society's interest in the connection between visual impairment and music, in addition to quirky, notable characters such as Moondog (The Viking of Sixth Avenue, Louis Thomas Hardin) who wrote poetry and music on the streets of New York from the 1940s to the 1970s. There are some world-famous visually impaired musicians alive today (e.g. pop musician, singer and writer Stevie Wonder, concert pianist Nobuyuki Tsujii, classical singer Andrea Bocelli). Surrounding all this, too, is social lore such as, in the past, higher religious wisdom in itinerant minstrels or, in current society, the sighted person's assumption, correct or otherwise, that in the absence of one sense another is augmented. We have discovered there is a thriving disability arts scene of blind ensembles worldwide, which includes: the Inner Vision Orchestra, a UK world music ensemble; the British Para-orchestra, which played at the London 2012 Paralympics; the Al Nour Wal Amal (Light and hope) Chamber Orchestra in Egypt, which is comprised entirely of women; the Korean Traditional Music Orchestra of the Blind; the Argentinian National Symphony Blind Band (Maestro Pascual Grisolia); and, in Chennai, India, the St. Louis Blind Orchestra, which performs music from Tamil cinema (informally known as Kollywood). Against this rich backdrop, then, some visually impaired musicians today are clearly more comfortable with an identity as a blind musician (marketing themselves as such) than others, and our research has unearthed strong insider arguments from this socio-musical group surrounding issues of employment discrimination, problems with independent mobility and marginalisation across the life-course (e.g. in educational contexts and learning, as amateur musicians, due to relatively inaccessible musical contexts such as orchestras, due to problems with the acquisition of music score formats such as Braille from translation services, technology issues, and so on). All this impinges upon amateur and professional musical participation alongside sighted musicians, leading to the formation of visually impaired ensembles like Inner Vision in some cases. \n \nThere is also a global network of visually impaired musicians (amateurs and professionals) that we have come across. These disabled musicians are drawn together by common interests, problems and they also seek to share solutions; they network via e-bulletin lists on music, musical societies and charities, disability ensembles and social gatherings. The VIML project has been an opportunity to engage with this community deeply and further develop networking by putting people with specific areas of experience and expertise in touch.\n \nThe accessibility technology used by visually impaired people today (e.g. text-to-speech screen reader programs, Braille hardware devices like refreshable displays, magnification software and other devices, etc.) is opening up new possibilities for visually impaired music-making, participation and learning. However, the use of general music production software (for recording and audio editing, engraving music or the creation of scores, MIDI sequencing and electronic music production) relies heavily on its compatibility with accessibility tech. With commercial software ever changing, with new versions of programs constantly released, this can be problematical for visually impaired users, as is access to appropriate training. For example, typical software in mainstream recording studios has, until very recently, been inaccessible to screen readers; thus it has locked many of the visually impaired electronic music producers we have come across into home studios (rather than commercial ones). The project team have been in touch with various innovators endeavouring to make popular music software compatible through the development of computer scripts (both for commercial and non-commercial reasons). \n \nWe have identified complex relationships amongst sight condition, how music is approached and learned, and some onward connotations for musical participation (particularly in contexts where an emphasis is placed on sight reading from printed scores such as orchestral settings). Despite the preconception (on the part of the sighted researchers) that, in the absence of functional vision, visually impaired musical participation would gravitate towards styles and genres that rest on playing by ear, improvising and oral learning traditions, musical participation in the visually impaired community is surprisingly diverse. There are particular ways of approaching music, through ear playing, sight reading from print (even enlarged materials), by tactile means, chunking and memorisation (such as with Braille music), technology use, or indeed combinations of these. How music-making is approached is dependent on educational background, visually impaired people's preferences, and sight condition (e.g. whether or not they have some functional vision). \n \nThe current trend in the UK (and other countries, e.g. Australia, Canada and the US) is to educate visually impaired children without developmental or cognitive delay in mainstream schools. The project has unearthed some powerful, contrasting viewpoints on the merits and issues relating to different types schooling (that is, special or blind schools as compared to mainstream sites). These include matters of social interaction and musical opportunity (formally and informally), or concerns about teachers' knowledge and skills (e.g. relating to the different learning processes and needs of visually impaired people, of score formats such as Braille music or modified stave notation, accessibility tech use, its compatibility with music software, etc.). Alongside this, the project has generated (from the voices of visually impaired musicians and sighted specialist teachers) some pedagogical considerations for visually impaired learners (adults or children), which include matters of: flexibility and differentiation based on sight condition; gesture (or its relative absence in learning processes); metaphor in music and appropriate language use; the influence of light in learning environments for pupils with light perception, even non-functional vision; and the importance of tactile learning (as part of multisensory experience). \n \nOverall, the VIML project has illustrated a gap between equality as affirmed in law (as in the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act, or SENDA) and visually impaired people's experiences/perceptions. Information gathered on technology use (both accessibility technology and music technology) evidences a need for wider training (of pre-service and in-service teachers and visually impaired people alike); it also bids cooperation in the technology industries and further software development. Academics and researchers in fields of education, sociology, psychology and popular music studies will wish to build on findings on visually impaired musical acquisition approaches so as, for instance, to ascertain the benefits or downsides to specific strategies for general musical development. Findings on schooling, centring on access and inclusion, teachers' knowledge and skills, will be of great interest to policymakers and stakeholder groups too (e.g. charities like the RNIB, National Foundation for the Blind, World Blind Union, European Blind Union, etc.); as will be the existence of disability ensembles and surrounding qualms about employment discrimination, independent mobility and marginality. Finally, discoveries about pedagogy and learning can be used by teacher trainers (in schools, universities, music conservatoires and teacher-training establishments) for engagement in reflective practice and the development of sound teaching practices for the future (please also see Engagement Activities).
