When stop signals are introduced in a gambling task, people not only become more cautious when executing their choice responses, they also prefer lower bets when gambling. Here we examined how stopping motor responses influences gambling. Experiment 1 showed that the reduced betting in stop-signal blocks was not caused by changes in information sampling styles or changes in arousal. In Experiments 2a-2b, people preferred lower bets when they occasionally had to stop their response in a secondary decision-making task, but not when they were instructed to respond as accurately as possible. Experiment 3 showed that merely introducing trials on which subjects could not gamble did not influence gambling preferences. Experiment 4 demonstrated that the effect of stopping on gambling generalised to different populations. Furthermore, two combined analyses suggest that the effect of stopping on gambling preferences was reliable but small. Finally, Experiment 5 showed that the effect of stopping on gambling generalised to a different task. Based on our findings and earlier research we propose that the presence of stop signals influences gambling by reducing approach behaviour and altering the motivational value of the gambling outcome. [this study is accepted for publication in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied; the work also lead to two further publications that focus on the general effects of stopping on approach behaviour ]\n\nWe noticed that there were large individual differences in proactive control in our experiments. Some subjects slowed more than others, and the degree of slowing did not always correlate with changes in decision-making. To increase our understanding of how proactive motor control interacts with decision-making, we conduct a study to examine how people prepare for stopping. Subjects performed a speeded go task, but they were instructed to withhold their response when a visual stop signal was presented. The stop signal could occur in the centre of the screen or in the periphery. On half of the trials, perceptual distractors were presented throughout the trial. We found that these perceptual distractors impaired stopping, especially when stop signals could occur in the periphery. Furthermore, the effect of the distractors on going was smallest in the central stop-signal condition, medium in a condition in which no-signals could occur, and largest in the condition in which stop signals could occur in the periphery. The results show that an important component of stopping is finding a balance between ignoring irrelevant information in the environment and monitoring for the occurrence of occasional stop signals. These findings highlight the importance of sensory detection processes when stopping and could shed new light on a range of phenomena and findings in the response-inhibition literature. Importantly, the study demonstrates that proactive control can be implemented in various ways, which could explain the large individual differences in our previous studies. \n\n[this study is accepted for publication in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance]\n\nAs part of our effort to develop better methods to study online inhibitory control, we also ran a series of simulations. The stop-signal paradigm, which we use in this sub-project, is a popular method for examining response inhibition and impulse control in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical domains because it allows the estimation of the covert latency of the stop process: the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). In three sets of simulations, we examined to what extent SSRTs that were estimated with the popular mean and integration methods were influenced by the skew of the reaction time distribution and the gradual slowing of the response latencies. We found that the mean method consistently overestimated SSRT. The integration method tended to underestimate SSRT when response latencies gradually increased. Thus, skewing and response slowing can lead to spurious inhibitory differences. This underestimation bias was absent when SSRTs were estimated with the integration method for smaller blocks of trials. [We published the outcome of this study in Psychological Science]. \n\nFinally, the third sub-project focuses on long-term after-effects of stopping. We had shown that short-term training in response inhibition can make people more cautious for up to two hours when making decisions. However, the longevity of such training effects was unclear. Therefore, we tested whether training in the stop-signal paradigm reduces risky gambling when the training and gambling task are separated by 24 hours. Two independent experiments (Experiment 1: N=60; Experiment 2: N=48) revealed that the aftereffects of stop-signal training are negligible after 24 hours. This was supported by Bayes factors that provided strong support for the null hypothesis. These findings indicate the need to better optimise the parameters of inhibition training to achieve clinical efficacy, potentially by strengthening automatic associations between specific stimuli and stopping. [This study is published in PLOS One. ] Collaborators are currently testing our novel theory in clinical populations. This could lead to the development of new behavioural treatments for impulse-control disorders (e.g. gambling, substance abuse) and obesity (by training people to inhibit their responses to food). \n\nOur framework will also be used in a psychopharmacological project that will start soon at the University of Exeter.
