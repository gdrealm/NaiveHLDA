However, there is little acoustic data on this sound as it is acquired and this project aims to fill this gap in research knowledge.&nbsp;In particular the researchers hope to see if any children use a ‘labiodental approximant’ for /r/.&nbsp;This labiodental (articulated with the lower lip and upper teeth) sound is not historically a part of Standard British English, but research shows that more and more adults now use this sound when they speak.&nbsp;The researchers would like to see if any children use this sound and if they later replace it with a more typical /r/ sound.&nbsp;Finally the research aims to investigate the link between children’s production and perception of /r/ sounds, and compare these results to those of adults.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The project will test forty children at three points between the ages of 36 and 48 months.&nbsp;Children will be given an assessment typically used by speech and language therapists, and will also play picture matching games to encourage them to say words containing /r/.&nbsp;Finally they will play a computer game where they listen to /r/-like sounds and press buttons to indicate which ones are most similar.</p> \n<p>It is hoped that this project will gather useful data about the acoustics of /r/ in young British children and begin to answer questions about why some people use a labiodental approximant for /r/. Finally the project will investigate the wider theoretical issue of the link between production and perception of speech sounds.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E001548/1","grantId":"ES/E001548/1","fundValue":"73119","fundStart":"2006-07-17","fundEnd":"2007-11-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings have mainly been used by an academic audience, but have also been used to influence the teaching of Speech and Language Therapy students. For example, findings from this grant demonstrate the type of error patterns that are used for /r/ by young learners of English, and therefore what is typical. This information has been incorporated into teaching at City University London, and also discussed with others (at Belfast and Plymouth) who are also utilising this information in teaching.

All children behaved differently, with some showing a high number of adult-like /r/s at the start of the study, some making progress towards this over the course of time, and some showing little change. Even children who produced clear adult-like /r/s sometimes The research into children's production could be used in speech and language therapy to work out what is typical for /r/ in children between 3 and 4 years old.\n\n\n\nThe perception data could be used in speech recognition software to indicate how it should deal with speech from speakers of different accents of English. This research tells us more about how children learn to say /r/, which is one of the latest sounds to be learnt in childhood.
