We know in theory how this happened: spontaneous mutations in the genes of earlier organisms caused small changes in the developmental program of their off-spring. This sometimes resulted in an improved adult that more successfully reproduced, and therefore gradually replaced the earlier form. However, to really understand this process and prove that it actually occurred, we have to trace back which genes were mutated and how this mutation changed gene function and consequently the developmental program. Because it is difficult to obtain such detailed information for complex organisms like ourselves, we investigate this problem in the social amoebas. Social amoebas feed as single cells on bacteria in forest soil. However, when starving, they come together and form a fruiting structure, in which a proportion of cells is preserved as spores. The other cells are sacrificed to form a stalk that aids in spore dispersal. This life style depends on mutual collaboration and specialization of cells. In the course of evolution the social amoebae have progressed from basal species that form structures with 10-100 cells and only two cell-types, to advanced species that form structures with over 100.000 cells and up to five cell types. One advanced species, Dictyostelium discoideum, is used widely as a model system to understand how cells move, feed and propagate and how they communicate with each other to achieve multicellularity. The D.discoideum genome has been completely sequenced, which means that we have a complete inventory of all the genes that control these processes. D.discoideum uses cyclic AMP (cAMP) as the major signal molecule for cell-cell communication. It acts as a chemoattractant to bring starving cells together, and then continues to guide cells to build a fruiting body. cAMP also induces the differentiation of the spores and regulates the process of spore germination. In previous BBSRC-funded research we constructed a family tree of the social amoebas, which shows that they are subdivided into four major groups. D.discoideum belongs to the most evolved group 4. From species in all four groups, we obtained fragments of the genes that are necessary for cAMP signalling by gene amplification. This suggests that many roles of cAMP are conserved. However, between groups, we observed changes in the stage of development at which these genes are active. One such as change gave rise to the use of cAMP as chemoattractant in the group 4 species. Gene amplification can only be used for very deeply conserved genes and only provides information on small regions of DNA. For many reasons it would be much better to compare species evolution at the level of the entire genome. With this project we therefore propose to sequence the genome of Polysphondylium pallidum to completion. This work will be performed in collaboration with a German team, who already obtained funding for draft sequencing of the P.pallidum genome. P.pallidum is particularly suitable for evolutionary studies because it occupies a basal position in the family tree and it is one of the few Dictyostelids that is readily accessible for gene manipulation. The complete P.pallidum genome sequence will give us the complete inventory and sequences of all cAMP signalling genes, and very importantly, will also tell us which genes are missing. By identifying gene losses and gains, and by comparing genes that are conserved between D.discoideum and P.pallidum, we can detect the genetic changes that occurred in the course of evolution. The completed P.pallidum genome will also be of great benefit for the Dictyostelium and broader research community. For instance, it can be used to identify conserved regions in proteins with important roles, that are thus far not well characterized.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E016308/1","grantId":"BB/E016308/1","fundValue":"397334","fundStart":"2007-05-07","fundEnd":"2011-01-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Three Dictyostelid genomes were sequenced, assembled and finished to a very high standard.

This project was part of a larger initiative for comparative genome analysis in the Dictyostelid social amoeba, organisms which still live at the boundary of uni- and multicellularity\nThe goal of the research project was to sequence and assemble the genome of one Dictyostelid, Polysphondylium\npallidum, to completion.\nWe sequenced this genome to 15-fold coverage together with our collaborator Gernot Gloeckner in Jena, Germany and\nfinished the assembly to a very high standard (only 52 gaps left). We electronically assigned gene models and performed\nextensive manual gene model annotation and bioinformatic analysis of conservation of genes and gene families. The\ngenome sequence has been deposited in the public domain (Genbank). We also contributed to the sequencing of the Dictyostelum fasciculatum genome in Dr Gloeckner laboratory, by providing cultures, genomic DNA, cultures and a developmental time course of messenger RNA for RNA sequencing and we performed extensive annotation and bioinformatics on the D.fasciculatum genome \nIn addition we have also completely sequenced and assembled the genome of Dictyostelium lacteum. Gene annotation and bioinformatic analysis of this genome is still in\nprogress\nTogether with the previously completed genome of the model species Dictyostelium discoideum, we have now obtained\ncomplete genome sequences from a representative species from each of the four major groups of Dictyostelia. Comparative genomics is crucial to understanding how genes evolved and assumed novel roles. The sequence genomes are a crucial resources for evolutionary biologist who aim to understand the evolution of multicellular complexity. They are also an important resource for cell biologist, who can use them to assign core proteins in the processes of interest.\nIn addition, the Dictyostelids genomes showed large and highly varied families of polyketide synthesases, enzymes which produce a large array of secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites are often used as antibiotic or biocides in defence strategies of soil organisms. The dictyostelid polyketide synthases can potentially be exploited by pharmaceutical industries for synthesis of bioactive compounds Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
