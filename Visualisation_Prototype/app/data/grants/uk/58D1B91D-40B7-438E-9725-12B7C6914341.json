NCD offers superior performance to silicon for MEMS due to its extreme Young's modulus, but it is also compatible with silicon CMOS technologies, offering a key advantage over other potential MEMS materials. High performance NCD growth and planarization will be optimised for MEMS applications. The realisation of continuous, smooth, pin hole free NCD over large areas exhibiting bulk diamond properties will enable a multitude of applications at drastically reduced cost to currently available bulk diamond technologies. The resulting material will have applications outside the MEMS field such as in tribology, optical coatings, electrochemical electrodes (when doped with boron), heat spreading etc. The development of clean room processing technologies of NCD will allow the fabrication of new devices and result in new ideas exploiting this novel material.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J009814/1","grantId":"EP/J009814/1","fundValue":"107085","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The processes developed during this grant are currently being exploited by commercial companies (currently under Non-Disclosure Agreements).

This process, termed Chemical Mechanical Planarisation in the silicon industry was not known to work on diamond and can reduce surface roughness of diamond films to less than 1nm rms over several microns. The technique relies on a chemical oxidation of the diamond surface at room temperature and can be used to make thin, flat films of nanocrystalline diamond on silicon with identical properties to bulk diamond at a small fraction of the cost.\n\n\n\nThis process makes these films prime candidates for high frequency mechanical systems. We also demonstrated acoustic wave filters with higher then 16 GHz resonant frequency, a world record. We published several high profile papers with collaborators in Boston University on dissipation in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) as well as with the University of Madrid. Flat, smooth diamond films have use in many areas such as Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (NEMS/MEMS), tribology, biosensors, wafer bonding (integration with silicon, GaN electronics etc). We are currently working under NDA with a large telecoms manufacturer to develop high frequency filters. We have also built new collaboration with Element6 in the UK.\n\n\n\nWe have attempted to patent the technology but it is difficult due to a lot of silicon industry IP being close in scope.
