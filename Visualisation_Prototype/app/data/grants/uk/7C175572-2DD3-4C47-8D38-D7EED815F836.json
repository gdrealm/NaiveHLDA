{"id":"7C175572-2DD3-4C47-8D38-D7EED815F836","title":"Dissecting the mechanisms underlying lifespan extension in insulin signalling mutant mice","abstractText":"Our population is ageing rapidly, and by 2050 there will be an estimated 250000 centenarians in the UK compared to only 10000 in 2004. Ageing is accompanied by a physical decline which can result in disability, a profound loss of independence and a resultant decrease in quality of life. In addition, ageing is the major risk factor for a number of diseases including Alzheimer's, various cancers, osteoporosis and type-2 diabetes. Therefore, identifying the processes that cause ageing is of fundamental importance if we have any hope of maintaining quality of life into old age. Currently, it is not understood what processes cause ageing, although the ability of cells to withstand stress, the ability of cells to protect against damage and repair this damage, and how the cells consume energy all appear important. To examine this I will use a novel mouse model in which a specific gene (insulin receptor substrate protein 1, Irs1 null) has been removed from all tissues. I have previously shown that these mice are exceptionally long-lived and are resistant to the infirmities of old age. In addition I will expose these mice to caloric restriction (CR). CR also extends lifespan and improves health in many animals and by using this comparative approach I will identify common genes and pathways across both life-extending treatments. I suggest that these overlapping genes/pathways are likely to be central to ageing in mammals. The information generated by this proposal will provide new insights into the fundamental biology of mammalian ageing and may ultimately help identify potential therapeutic pathways for treatment of the diseases of ageing in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H012850/2","grantId":"BB/H012850/2","fundValue":"123866","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This research has initiated new collaborative opportunities with scientists in Europe and in North America.

We used mice that carry a single mutation in a single gene involved in the insulin signalling pathway. We previously reported that these mice were long-lived and enjoyed a greater period of their life free from age-related disease, but we did not understand how these positive effects came about. We investigated several potential mechanisms thought to be important in ageing in these mice. We showed that tissue and cell damage by free radicals did not differ between our long-lived mice and normal living control mice. It has also been suggested that longevity both within and between species is determined by the ability of cells to withstand chemical stressors. We again showed that this was not a conserved hallmark of ageing because cells from our long-lived mice were no more resistant to stress than control animals. However, we have shown that endoplasmic reticulum stress sensitivity is a highly conserved hallmark of ageing, although we see some mechanistic differences in how this comes about compared to other published work in long-lived mice. We have also discovered that our long-lived mice respond metabolically to another life-extending intervention dietary restriction (DR), suggesting that DR and our specific genetic mutation do not work in exactly the same manner; that is we predict that if we put our long-lived mutants on DR we would get a further extension of lifespan. Finally we have generated some exciting new RNAseq data from our long-lived mice on a normal diet and on a DR diet in order to identify novel candidates that may underlie lifespan extension. Our findings show that neither cellular stress resistance nor oxidative damage appear to underlie the longevity in long-lived insulin signalling mutant mice. This work is important as debunks somewhat the most dominant theory of ageing. The RNAseq data is likely to be an important data set for future data mining by researchers interested in ageing and disease. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
