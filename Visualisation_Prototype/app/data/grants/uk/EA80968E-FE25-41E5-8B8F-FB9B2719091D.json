However, the vulnerability of young people, and concerns about their plight, is not a new phenomenon. In 1984 unemployment among 16-24 year olds reached 19.6 per cent and in the 1980s, as with other recessions, youth unemployment (which is always two to three times higher than all-age unemployment) was a major cause of concern, leading to talk about a ‘lost generation’.</p>\n\n<p>Using a secondary analysis of data from a contemporary UK dataset, Understanding Society, combined with secondary analysis of two ‘historical’ datasets from the UK in the 1980s (Young Adults and the Changing Structure of Youth Labour Markets) this research aims to answer the question - In what ways have the experiences of unemployed, insecure and vulnerable 18-25 year-olds changed between two key periods of economic instability in the UK?</p>\n\n<p>In this paper we will reflect upon our initial attempts at comparing the experiences of 18–25 year-olds in the 1980s and c2010 (two periods characterised by high youth unemployment) and consider how we intend to capture changes in the landscape of precarity over the last thirty years.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K003755/1","grantId":"ES/K003755/1","fundValue":"142428","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John David Goodwin","coPersons":["Henrietta Sophie O'Connor","Andy  Furlong"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":" 1. Data from Understanding Society wave 1 was used to assess the numbers of young people aged 18-25 in precarious labour market positions. Making a distinction between 'deep precarity' (the formally unemployed, other workless groups - such as those in caring roles and the long-term sick and disabled - and part-time workers working so few hours that they lacked legal protections (&lt;16 hours per week)) and 'shallow precarity' (part-time workers (16-34 hours) plus those working full-time on temporary contracts we found that 36% of young people were in the deep precariat and a further 21% in the shallow precariat: showing that 57% occupied marginal positions in which they either lacked work or lacked legislative security. Among the deep precariat, 19% had never been in paid employment. Females were more likely than males to occupy precarious positions, as were those who lived in areas of high unemployment. There were clear associations between labour market precarity and negative well-being.\n\n2. Using data from Young Adults in the Labour Market (1983) and The Changing Structure of Youth Labour Markets (1986), we devised a framework for classifying young people's position in the labour market retrospectively. This was operationalized via the characteristics of each local labour market and on the respondent's then current and/or first labour market position. The labour markets were defined as 'prosperous', 'declining' and 'depressed'. The young people were categorized by 'types of precarity'. We found that at the point of their first/current labour market position, young people were more likely to be traditional employees in prosperous labour markets but that this type of employment declined as the labour market conditions deteriorated. Those in the depressed labour markets were less likely to be in traditional employment and most likely to belong to the deep precariat group. However, considering precarity alone young people were more likely to be in the deep precariat group than the shallow across all the labour market types.\n\n3. Much of the literature on precarity carries an assumption that the phenomenon is relatively new; predating the recent recession by around a decade but severely accelerated by recession. Using the same definitions of precarity to compare the legacy data with USoc, we found that levels of precarity among young people in the 1980s were very similar (55% in either deep or shallow precarity in the 1980s compared to 57% today). The key difference being that more young people in the 1980s were workless rather than in insecure forms of employment.\n\n4. Repurposing original interview schedules from past 'legacy project' offers much analytical potential but is also a complex and often problematic approach to research. Complexities include: i) coding errors, inconsistencies in the use of terms, definitions and abbreviations; ii) usability mediated by the clarity of handwriting; iii) the absence of contextual information makes data interpretation more challenging. While none of these complexities in and of themselves limit the overall value of the legacy data, each took considerable time to resolve. This needs to be considered fully by future secondary analysts. We envisage that the findings and data may be taken forward by ourselves and others in numerous ways. First, we have created, for the first time since their original collection, two complete datasets from the 'legacy' projects -- Young Adults in the Labour Market (1983) and The Changing Structure of Youth Labour Markets (1986). These datasets will be deposited in the UK Data archive for wider research use thus enabling further engagement with 'original data'. Second, our findings have fed into various dissemination and engagement events with academics, practitioners, employers and policymakers. The dissemination activities will continue via normal academic channels (publications, book launch, conferences) and continued attendance at public engagement events. Third, the findings have relevance for the academic and policy communities given that our results question existing assumptions relating to the longevity of the 'precarity phenomenon'. This has implications for policy formation especially relating to youth employment in times of economic hardship. Finally, the experiences of combining legacy and contemporary data have significant implications for research practice and secondary analysis. Our experiences have been translated into research training activities and offer significant potential for future training and the promotion of secondary analysis of existing data.
