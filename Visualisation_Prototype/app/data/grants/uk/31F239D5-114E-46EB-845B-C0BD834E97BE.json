{"id":"31F239D5-114E-46EB-845B-C0BD834E97BE","title":"CONSORT guideline for experiments of psychological, social, and environmental","abstractText":"<p>This project will develop and disseminate a guideline for reporting experiments of psychological, social, and environmental interventions. To coordinate and publicise the initiative, Steering Group of experts in core social science disciplines has been assembled. With their guidance, we will first conduct an international Delphi process with researchers, journal editors, and other stakeholders to generate a list of important reporting standards to consider for inclusion in the guideline. Results from two reviews we have conducted indicate that publications often omit information that would allow readers to assess internal validity (eg blinding and level of randomisation). Such reports may overestimate intervention effects by as much as 30 per cent. Secondly, reports should include more information relevant to the external validity of experiments (eg participant selection, intervention implementation). We will then host a consensus meeting to finalise the list of minimal reporting standards for inclusion in the guideline.<br /><br />The outputs from this project will help authors write clear reports, create a framework for reviewers to assess publications, expedite funding evaluations, provide a pedagogical tool for understanding these experiments, and help consumers evaluate study validity and applicability. In these ways, the guideline will facilitate efficient and effective transfer of research evidence into real-world use.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00087X/1","grantId":"ES/K00087X/1","fundValue":"279681","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Montgomery","coPersons":["Evan  Mayo-Wilson","Susan Fiona Michie","Sean Patrick Grant","Geraldine Mary Macdonald"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
