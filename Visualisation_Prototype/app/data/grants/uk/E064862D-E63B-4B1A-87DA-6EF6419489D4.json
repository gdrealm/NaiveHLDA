This process (commonly referred to as learning) can be effectively studied in the laboratory with nonhuman animals whose environmental experience can be carefully controlled and whose behaviour can be rigorously recorded and measured. Such studies (using a procedure known as conditioning, introduced by the Russian physiologist Pavlov) have established that much learning can be explained in terms of the formation of links (or associations) between events (or more correctly, between the central representations of events) that occur together in the environment. Learning thus depends on the animal experiencing pairings of stimuli. The associative principle has dominated our view of learning for at least a hundred years. More recently, however, it has become clear that an important form of learning can occur without pairings. It has long been known that simple exposure to a single stimulus will produce a learned change in behaviour (the phenomenon known as habituation), which shows most clearly as the waning of the response initially evoked by the stimulus. But this procedure turns out to have more complex and interesting consequences. Preexposure to a stimulus not only reduces its ability to evoke its normal response, it also changes the ability of the stimulus to function normally when it comes to association formation / association formation proceeds slowly when either of the paired stimuli has been preexposed. In addition, the animal's ability to discriminate between similar stimuli appears to be enhanced when these have been preexposed. The aim of this project is to elucidate the nature of the learning that is responsible for these preexposure effects. The starting point for the experiments is the observation that the effects of preexposure on subsequent associative learning can be modulated by the presence of other events during preexposure / specifically, the effects produced by preexposure differ in the target stimulus is either preceded or followed by some other event during the preexposure phase. What the target stimulus predicts or how well it is itself predicted during preexposure determines the outcome of the procedure. What learning process is responsible for this? The experiments will investigate the hypothesis that in fact two learning processes are involved. One of them (that responsible for the simple habituation phenomenon) produces a reduction in the effective salience of the stimulus during preexposure (as if a loud noise gradually becomes effectively softer with repeated presentation). Our experiments will investigate the suggestion that this process operates best when the target stimulus is presented alone (or with a constant associate) during preexposure, but can be reversed when the target stimulus is predicted unreliably by some other event. The second process is one that changes some aspect of the attention paid to a stimulus (something distinct from salience / it is clearly possible to learn attend to a soft noise, and even, possibly, to learn to ignore a loud one). Our experiments will explore the suggestion that animals learn to attend to a stimulus the consequence of which are uncertain, but learn, eventually, to reduce the attention paid to one followed by inconsistent consequences. Our interest in these exposure-learning processes does not mean that we want to deny the central importance of associative learning itself. To the contrary, it is because we think that associative learning is a mechanism of fundamental psychological importance that we think it necessary to explore in detail the subsidiary learning processes that determine the operation of the associative mechanism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D009855/1","grantId":"BB/D009855/1","fundValue":"208918","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings have contributed to our understanding of the basic mechanisms that modulate the ease with which external events can be learned about.

The research method made use of the standard associative learning paradigms that have been devised for laboratory animals (conditioning with auditory cues and shock; with flavour cues and illness). The basic experimental design was to examine the effects of giving the animals exposure to the one or other of the critical stimuli prior to the conditioning phase. In addition we monitored the unconditioned (initial) response (the UR) to the stimulus, and how this changed (habituated) over the course of preexposure.\n\nThis work confirmed the hypothesis put forward in the Original Summary, that exposure to a stimulus will modify its effectiveness in two different respects. The first may be termed associability - the readiness with which a stimulus will enter into association. Our new experiments (using flavour learning techniques) have confirmed the supposition that associability will decline when a stimulus is followed by reliable consequences and have gone on to elucidate the mechanisms responsible. They have shown how this loss of associability depend itself on associative learning, specifically learning just what the preexposed stimulus predicts (which, in many of our procedures, may be no event at all). The second aspect of a stimulus that may be modified by experience we have termed its salience. This too will change with exposure to the stimulus and will influence subsequent association formation; but it can also be assessed directly by monitoring habituation of the UR. In experiments using shock as the critical stimulus and monitoring post-shock freezing as the UR, we have found that loss of salience is influenced by stimulus consequences during preexposure. Consistent consequences can retard the development of habituation; inconsistent consequences appear to enhance the loss of salience. The learning process responsible for changes in associability is well specified; we have, as yet, no well-formed account of the mechanism by which inconsistent consequences act to enhance habituation.\n\nTo have two forms of 'attentional learning', one modifying salience, the other associability, complicates theoretical analysis. But there is independent evidence for both from these studies of simple conditioning; and we hope to develop the hybrid account of attention that is emerging to deal with the results of more complex studies of transfer in discrimination learning in order to explain why attentional changes should sometimes help and sometimes hinder such transfer. The processes identified in the basic work have general relevance and should operate in tasks in which people have to learn to attend to and ignore different aspect of external events.
