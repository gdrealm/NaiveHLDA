Correspondingly, prey species have evolved a wide variety of defensive strategies, often including protective coloration. Perhaps the most widespread anti-predator defence is animal camouflage. Camouflage works by preventing detection or recognition of an object, and is also valuable to human applications and recreation. It has long been a key textbook example of natural selection, but in the last decade there has been a substantial increase in research investigating what types of camouflage exist, how they work, and the survival benefit conferred. This work has been undertaken by evolutionary and behavioural biologists, computer scientists, experimental psychologists, art historians, and the military, and represents a highly interdisciplinary subject. Several types of camouflage have been studied, including background matching (resembling the colour and pattern of the background environment), disruptive coloration (high contrast markings at the body edges that break up the shape of the body), and distractive markings (high contrast isolated markings that may draw the predator's attention towards them and away from the body edge).\nDespite numerous advances most work has focussed on how different camouflage types prevent initial detection in predators that have not seen the prey before. However, in reality, most predators will encounter similar prey types repeatedly over a period of hours and days, allowing them the opportunity to learn to discriminate prey from the background, and giving them the opportunity to form 'search images' (by selectively paying attention to particular features of the prey's appearance). These search images temporarily increase a predator's ability to find one prey type but decrease its ability to find other prey types. Currently, although learning and search image effects have been investigated in some camouflage studies, almost no work has specifically tested how different types of camouflage and specific features of prey patterns facilitate and affect predator learning and search image formation. Because the success of a camouflage strategy will be affected by how it prevents both initial detection as well as learning and search image formation, there is currently a major gap in our understanding of how camouflage works and the value of different camouflage types.\n Here, we use humans searching for hidden targets on touch screens, and domestic chicks searching for hidden artificial prey in arenas, as model predator systems to test how the value of different types and features of camouflage are affected by predators' experience of different prey types. These systems allow us to precisely control prey features and the experience of the subjects acting as predators. Specifically, we will: 1) Determine whether some camouflage types are easier to learn than others by presenting human and chicks with prey types and measuring how effectively detection times decrease over repeated encounters. 2) Determine whether some camouflage types are more resistant to predator search images than others by presenting humans and birds with sequences of the same prey type to test how quickly they form search images, and whether this affects their ability to find prey of other types later. 3) Determine what specific prey features (e.g. pattern contrast, pattern size, and disruptiveness) facilitate search image formation. 4) Test whether findings are consistent between humans and birds by using comparable experiments with birds and humans to determine how the principles about camouflage and visual search and detection can be applied across species. \nThis project would answer key questions in camouflage research, including how different types of concealment affect learning and search image formation, the nature of search images and which prey features predators attend to, and whether the principles are consistent among taxonomic groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L017709/1","grantId":"BB/L017709/1","fundValue":"302199","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Stevens","coPersons":["John  Skelhorn"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
