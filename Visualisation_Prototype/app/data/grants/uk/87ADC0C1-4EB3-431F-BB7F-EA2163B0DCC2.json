{"id":"87ADC0C1-4EB3-431F-BB7F-EA2163B0DCC2","title":"Developing a 'how things work' research agenda in education","abstractText":"<p>This grant supported a series of seminars held at universities across England in 2009. The guiding theme of the ESRC Seminar Series was to reflect on current demands for evidence-based practice and research on “what works” in education, examining the issues from both theoretical and practice-based perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>The aim was to systematically and collaboratively examine the ways that theory could inform understandings of teaching and learning practices, and vice versa, to better understand theoretical perspectives in light of pertinent questions posed in relation to educational practice.</p>\n\n<p>The series provided structure for these discussions by focusing on two theoretical perspectives at each session (eg Activity Theory, Communities of Practice theory, Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), Bernstein and Bourdieu) in relation to a level of the educational system (eg individual, classroom, school, district and national levels). These theories were chosen because they typically take ‘learning environments’ and systems as the unit of analysis, as opposed to individual learners and teachers.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the presentations are reproduced in a book edited by Valerie Farnsworth and Yvette Solomon, <em>Reframing Educational Research:&nbsp; Resisting the ‘what works’ agenda</em> (Routledge, June 2013).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0576","grantId":"RES-451-26-0576","fundValue":"11311","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Valerie Laura Farnsworth","coPersons":["Julian  Williams"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
