As the Framework-7 Programme is approaching and the first call-for-proposal is expected in January, 2007, we wish to request for travel funding again from EPSRC and enable us to participate in FP-7 programme, and bid for EU funding to support our research activities in the next four years. The Digital Imaging Research Group has extensive research track record at EU level, including: (i) evaluating EU proposals for networked audio-visual home platform, E-ten Programme, knowledge and content, and FET etc. (ii) editorship for three internationally leading journals; (iii) multi-disciplinary research expertise across the boundaries of image processing, video processing, video mining, pattern recognition, mixed reality, data encryption, security, artificial intelligence and machine learning etc. These would add significant values to our efforts in competing at EU level for funding under FP-7 programme and continue our success in FP-6. To this end, we wish to request for funding from EPSRC to cover the necessary travalling expenses and enable us a full participation in FP-7 programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E061419/1","grantId":"EP/E061419/1","fundValue":"57804","fundStart":"2007-04-18","fundEnd":"2010-04-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jianmin  Jiang","coPersons":["Jinchang  Ren","Ying  Weng"],"organisation":"University of Bradford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
