This knowledge data system is needed because existing agri-forest databases, which tend to be yield-only based, lack the appropriate technical and economic parameter information necessary for downstream biorefining modelling (e.g. hemicellulose composition, recalcitrance indicators, geographic distribution and concentration of residue materials, residue prices and seasonality, etc.). The development and structuring of this knowledge and data is highly relevant to both academic and industrial research on biorefining and for policy and decision-making.\nThe research findings have been assimilated into the first authored advanced level textbook 'Biorefineries and Chemical Processes' in the field of biorefinery engineering, published by Wiley, being adopted as textbook or main reference book in many universities: Manchester, Huddersfield, Oxford, Imperial College, Nottingham Malaysia and universities in Hong Kong, China, Iran, South Africa and India. We foresee wide adoption of the book as the textbook.\nIn Surrey, this is going to be the textbook in many modules in Chemical Engineering: e.g. Biorefinery Engineering, Bioprocess Engineering, Sustainability etc.\nProfessor Grant Campbell (Huddersfield) says about the book 'It looks so substantial (in the literal sense of containing a lots of tangible substance) and so high quality! The scope and quality of the resources, including the additional web material, are extensive, and the pedagogical innovations and presentation are creative and empowering. I believe it has the potential to be a game-changer by giving a basis for educating the biorefinery engineers who will actually bring about the power and contribution that biorefineries, correctly conceived, designed and operated, can deliver.'\nProfessor Nilay Shah (Imperial College) says about the book 'Very comprehensive!' He sees the book to serve as the textbook for some Chem Eng modules in Imperial College.\nProfessor Colin Webb (Manchester) is using the book as a reference book for Biorefinery Engineering module he teaches.\nDr Carol Lin (Hong Kong) is using the book as the textbook in her courses.\nThe Engineering course in the University of Oxford is adopting the book to teach process simulation approaches.

This becomes effective when overall mass and energy integration through a centralised utility system design is undertaken. An approach combining process integration, energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission analyses is developed for non-food waste based biorefinery design, primarily producing biodiesel using oil-based heterogeneously catalysed transesterification or green diesel using hydrotreatment. The global warming potential from GHG emissions of the net energy produced (i.e. after covering energy requirements by the biorefinery systems) was 29 g CO2-eq per MJ output energy production, before accounting credits from displacement of fossil-based energy by bioenergy exported from the biorefineries. Using a systematic integration approach for utilisation of whole biorefinery, it is shown that global warming potential and fossil primary energy use can be reduced significantly if the integrated process schemes combined with optimised whole life cycle economic and environmental costs are adopted in waste-based biorefineries. The work provides multi-scale simulation tools as well as systems optimisation tools.\n\nImportant systems tools and observations include:\n\n1. Differential economic and environmental impact analyses from units to systems.\n2. Analysis across the scale linking process to system variables and design objectives.\n3. Biorefinery Computer Aided Process Engineering (CAPE) tool in Excel-VBA platform http://biorefinerydesign.webs.com.\n4. Cradle-to-grave environmental impact costs and credit values of streams are estimated.\n5. Equivalent economic indicators are the cost of production and value on processing.\n6. A novel economic value and environmental impact (EVEI) analysis methodology emerged from the combination of the value analysis method for maximisation of economic potential with environmental footprinting for impact minimisation.\n7. Tighter policy directives can be in place if EVEI tool is employed.\n8. The proposed tool is effective to target for stricter climate change mitigation policy.\n9. A biofuel facility must be supplied with in-process generation of utilities.\n10. Integrated biofuel with on-site raw material production is more sustainable.\nFor the multi-scale simulation, the following project goals were achieved.\nWe produced a framework for kinetic reaction and diffusive transport modelling of the heterogeneously catalysed transesterification of triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). In particular, the work makes recommendations on multicomponent diffusion calculations such as the diffusion coefficients and molar fluxes from infinite dilution diffusion coefficients using the Wilke and Chang correlation, intrinsic reaction kinetic studies using the Eley-Rideal kinetic mechanism with methanol adsorption as the rate determining steps and multi-scale reaction-diffusion process simulation between catalytic porous and bulk reactor scales.\nAn entire book chapter in the First Advanced Authored Textbook of its kind (Biorefineries and Chemical Processes: Design, Integration and Sustainability Analysis) on the subject has been devoted. This textbook is designed to bridge a gap between engineering design and sustainability assessment, for advanced students and practicing process designers and engineers. Chapter 18: Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reaction Kinetics and Diffusion Modeling: Example of Biodiesel: \n&amp;amp;quot;Biodiesel is fast becoming one of the key transport fuels as the world endeavors to reduce its carbon footprint and find viable alternatives to oil-derived fuels. The chapter presents material pertaining to various aspects of the multiscale modeling of heterogeneously catalyzed reaction systems. Modeling of the intrinsic kinetics has been shown for Eley-Rideal (ER), Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) and Hattori mechanisms with assumptions of rate limiting steps. The UNIQUAC model for activity and concentration correlations for a non-ideal reaction system has been shown with calculations for transesterification reactions between triglyceride and methanol for fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) production. Analytical integration by Taylor's series first-order expansion can be done to estimate concentration versus time profiles of species. A simulation framework for implementation of a multiscale diffusion-reaction model has been provided.&quot; Enabling biorefinery process design tools for advanced researchers, practicing process designers and engineers and policy makers.\nAll you need to learn about Sustainable biorefinery design.\nA very comprehensive textbook on the subject can be found here:\nhttp://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119990866.html#instructor\nEVEI analysis tool can be found here:\nhttp://biorefinerydesign.webs.com/eveianalysistool.htm\nBiorefinery Computer Aided Process Engineering (CAPE) tool in Excel-VBA platform http://biorefinerydesign.webs.com.\nA framework for heterogeneous catalytic reactor multiscale diffusion-reaction simulation can be found here: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118698129.ch18/summary Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
