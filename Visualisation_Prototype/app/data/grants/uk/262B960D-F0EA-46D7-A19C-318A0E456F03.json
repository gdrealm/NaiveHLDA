Surprisingly, this reduced ability with other-race faces emerges very early in infancy: 6-month-olds can tell the difference between faces of other ethnic groups but 9-month-olds cannot. This loss of ability is thought to be a consequence of experience with faces in our environment. That is, experience with one's own race results in expertise in identifying individuals within that group. In contrast, a lack of experience with individuals outside our own race results in relatively poor discrimination and recognition abilities for those faces.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The current research will determine whether additional learning experiences might enable infants to maintain their face processing ability at 9-months of age. In two studies, we will investigate whether a few minutes of exposure is sufficient to allow infants to develop the skill of discriminating individual other-race faces, or whether a prolonged period of exposure is necessary to retain a flexible processing system. This research will shed light on the plasticity of face-processing skills early in development and determine how infants learn to recognise and categorise different people in their environment.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G027188/1","grantId":"ES/G027188/1","fundValue":"67293","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This work has been cited 17 times to date in research publications, and has been viewed over 3000 times.

The ORE is assumed to be a consequence of experience with faces from races that are typically found in our environment. Overall, this research demonstrated that training via picture books is effective in producing a change in the face processing system at 9 months of age when the stimuli are other-race faces. The present study is unique in demonstrating that training on other-race faces can prevent the ORE from developing in the first place. Knowing about the ORE can help people (i.e., employers, justice system) understand that extensive experience with one's own race results in expertise in identifying individuals within that group, whereas lack of experience with other-race individuals results in relatively poor discrimination and recognition abilities for these faces.
