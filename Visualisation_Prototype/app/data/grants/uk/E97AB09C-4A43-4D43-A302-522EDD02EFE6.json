About 6-8 characters of text typically fall within the fovea, or central high-acuity area of vision. Outside this area, the parafovea, visual acuity decreases the further the distance from fixation. Nevertheless, useful information is extracted parafoveally, as demonstrated in reading tasks where such information is denied and the reading rate is significantly slowed. The perceptual span is that region of text from which useful information can be extracted, extending from approximately 3 characters to the left to 14 characters to the right of fixation. The asymmetry of this span is taken to reflect attentional demands of reading – in left-to-right languages, like English, new information is located to the right of fixation. This proposal devises a 'parafoveal magnification' paradigm. Text will be modified contingent on the position of the reader’s fixation location with parafoveal information enlarged, functionally equalising its perceptual impact with concurrent foveal information. Results will address whether the limits of the perceptual span are due to purely visual constraints of acuity or to attentional constraints of reading.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E005756/1","grantId":"ES/E005756/1","fundValue":"81003","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sara Crescentia Sereno","coPersons":["Sebastien  Miellet","Patrick Joseph O'Donnell"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
