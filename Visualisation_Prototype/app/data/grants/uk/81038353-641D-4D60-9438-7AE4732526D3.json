The\npriority in this work will be to eliminate residual systematics in the Planck polarisation likelihood at high multipoles. In addition, we will contribute\nto the validation of the Planck high frequency instrument polarisation data at low multipoles using novel cross-spectrum quadratic estimators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N000056/1","grantId":"ST/N000056/1","fundValue":"78326","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"George  Efstathiou","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
