{"id":"5F273DDB-CDDF-457C-9B2F-A5C88FCA4CD1","title":"COMPPACT: Compression of Video using Perceptually Optimised Parametric Coding Techniques","abstractText":"It is currently a very exciting and challenging time for video compression. The predicted growth in demand for bandwidth, especially for mobile services is driven largely by video applications and is probably greater now than it has ever been. There are four reasons for this: \n\n(i) Recently introduced formats such as 3D and multiview, coupled with increasing dynamic range, spatial resolution and framerate, all require increased bit-rate to deliver improved immersion; \n(ii) Video-based web traffic continues to grow and dominate the internet; \n(iii) User expectations coninue to drive flexibility and quality, with a move from linear to non-linear delivery; \n(iv) Finally the emergence of new services, in particular mobile delivery through 4G/LTE to smart phones. While advances in network and physical layer technologies will no doubt contribute to the solution, the role of video compression is also of key importance.\n\nThis research project is underpinned by the assumption that, in most cases, the target of video compression is to provide good subjective quality rather than to minimise the error between the original and coded pictures. It is thus possible to conceive of a compression scheme where an analysis/synthesis framework replaces the conventional energy minimisation approach. Such a scheme could offer substantially lower bitrates through reduced residual and motion vector coding. \n\nThe approach proposed will model scene content using combinations of waveform coding and texture replacement, using computer graphic models to replace target textures at the decoder. These not only offer the potential for dramatic improvements in performance, but they also provide an inherent content-related parameterisation which will be of use in classification and detection tasks as well as facilitating integration with CGI. \n\nThis has the potential to create a new content-driven framework for video compression. In this context our aim is to shift the video coding paradigm from rate-distortion optimisation to rate-quality modelling, where region-based parameters are combined with perceptual quality metrics to inform and drive the coding and synthesis processes. However it is clear that a huge amount of research needs to be done in order to fully exploit the method's potential and to yield stable and efficient solutions. For example, mean square error is no longer a valid objective function or measure of quality, and new embedded perceptually driven quality metrics are essential. The choice of texture analysis and synthesis models are also important, as is the exploitation of long-term picture dependencies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J019291/1","grantId":"EP/J019291/1","fundValue":"547101","fundStart":"2012-08-08","fundEnd":"2015-08-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The work of this project is likely to only have real impact during the next stage of video standardisation.

Instead of encoding whole images or prediction residuals after translational motion estimation, our algorithm employs a perspective motion model to warp static textures and utilises texture synthesis to create dynamic textures. Texture regions are segmented using features derived from the complex wavelet transform and further classified according to their spatial and temporal characteristics. \n\nThe project has also developed low complexity perceptual quality metrics that have the potential to be used in the coding loop to prevent warping and synthesis artefacts, as well as outside of it. The new perceptual video quality metric (PVM) out performs all previously published work. This work is now under final review for IEEE Trans CSVT. \n\nThe proposed algorithm has been integrated into an H.264 video coding framework. The results show significant bitrate savings, of up to 60% compared with H.264 at the same objective quality (based on AVM) and subjective scores. It is currently being integrated into the new HEVC video coding standard.\n\nCOMPPACT is currently undertaking further data collection exercises including various textural content acquired at high spatial resolution and high frame rates. \n\nResults of enhanced Rate Quality Optimisation have also been researched that have demonstrated significant improvements over the latest coding standard - HEVC. A number of important collaborations have already arisen from this work where the findings and datasets are already being used. These include:\ni) an EU Marie Curie Training Network, collaboratively with Fraunhofer HHI Berlin, Univ. Aachen, Univ. Nantes, BBC, Microsoft, Technicolor and Purdue Univ. This project builds on COMPPACT in the area of perceptual video coding and quality metrics and is targeting the next generation of video coding standards.\nii) An EPSRC Platform grant awarded to Bristol Vision Institute (Bull PI), 'Vision for the Future'. A key theme in this is visual immersion where compression techniques will be investigated that achieve compression ratios exceed 1000:1 while preserving the immersive properties of the format. Collaborators include the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Aardman Animations, BBC, and ARRI.\niii) A joint facility, 'The Bristol BBC Immersive Technology Laboratory has been established that is investigating compression for high frame rate and High Dynamic Range content.
