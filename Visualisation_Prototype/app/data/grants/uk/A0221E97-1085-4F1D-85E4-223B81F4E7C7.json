Cells perceive many of these challenges as environmental stresses. They first detect these environmental stresses, and then transduce these signals via biological circuitry that culminates in the activation of the appropriate cellular response and ultimately cellular adaptation. Key components of this biological circuitry are evolutionarily conserved from yeasts to humans. They include proteins called stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) which become chemically activated (phosphorylated) in response to a stress, and subsequently chemically activate (phosphorylate) their targets, thereby leading to the activation of the cellular response. \n\nThese SAPKs are central to stress adaptation, responding to many types of stress and triggering the appropriate cellular response. This is the case in human cells (e.g. for the p38 SAPK) and in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans (e.g. for the orthologous Hog1 SAPK). The interesting conundrum is how a SAPK is able act as a regulatory hub, distinguishing different input signals and then activating the appropriate stress-specific cellular response. What specifies the different inputs, allowing the programming of the differential outputs? We address this conundrum in this project, by dissecting the Hog1 SAPK in the major fungal pathogen of humans, Candida albicans.\n\nRecently we discovered that the Candida albicans Hog1 SAPK is subjected to additional chemical modifications and that these newly discovered modifications occur in a stress-specific manner. Therefore, we hypothesize that these stress-specific modifications provide the molecular code that programmes the accurate regulation of specific downstream cellular outputs. In this project we will exploit a powerful combination of high throughput genomic technologies and precision molecular tools to test this hypothesis and dissect the molecular activation and function of this Hog1 SAPK.\n\nThis is important because it will increase our understanding of stress signalling in eukaryotic cells. Furthermore it is important because this stress signalling promotes the ability of Candida albicans to cause infection. Most individuals carry Candida in their microflora where it causes minimal damage in most healthy individuals. However this yeast is a frequent cause of &quot;superficial infections&quot; (thrush) in individuals when host defences become disturbed, and in intensive care patients it can cause life-threatening system-wide infections of the bloodstream and internal organs, over 40% of which are fatal. A limited repertoire of antifungal drugs is available, and clinicians require more effective therapies to help their patients. Research efforts to develop such therapies are enhanced by a greater understanding of the pathobiology of Candida, revealing potential weaknesses that can be targeted by these therapies. This is why the company Novabiotics is interested in the output of this project. By revealing how the Hog1 SAPK works, there is an excellent chance that we will uncover how Candida resists host defences and antifungal drugs, and how this resistance can be circumvented.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K017365/1","grantId":"BB/K017365/1","fundValue":"429137","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-12-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project has only been underway for one year.
