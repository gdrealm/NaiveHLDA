{"id":"D14B55BC-131F-412F-8C88-DCA9D399CB66","title":"Structure function analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors in angiogenesis","abstractText":"Heart attack or stroke can block blood vessels leading to local tissue damage or even death; there is therefore a need to increase blood flow and promote circulation by making new blood vessels. In contrast, inhibiting blood vessel growth prevents cancer and blindness respectively. The formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) is complex: They are lined with endothelial cells, which divide and re-arrange themselves into new tube-like vessels. Vascular endothelial growth factor is an essential protein for the blood vessel formation and works by binding to receptors on the endothelial cells. This project will determine how these receptors signal to co-ordinate new vessel formation. Discoveries from this study will provide new insight for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to promote or block the growth of new blood vessels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600270","grantId":"G0600270","fundValue":"295722","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2009-10-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Asif  Ahmed","coPersons":["Peter William Hewett","Shakil  Ahmad","Ashley  Martin"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
