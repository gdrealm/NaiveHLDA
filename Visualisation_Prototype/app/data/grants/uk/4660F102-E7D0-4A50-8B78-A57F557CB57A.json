{"id":"4660F102-E7D0-4A50-8B78-A57F557CB57A","title":"Cardiff PATT Rolling Grant","abstractText":"The astronomers at Cardiff University are involved in many innovative world-class research programmes. These involve the use of both STFC and international ground-based telescope facilities. These include JCMT, UKIRT, (e)MERLIN, INT, GMRT, VLA, Arecibo and Kitt Peak. We have been active in observations across the electro-magnetic spectrum from the visible to the radio. In particular we have participated in several large-scale surveys, including the radio AGES survey, the infra-red UKIDSS survey, and the JCMT HARP Gould Belt Survey. Over the next 2 years we anticipate the advent of the new SCUBA2 camera on JCMT. Several of our members of staff are heavily involved in many of the different legacy surveys using SCUBA2. Therefore our telescope usage will inevitably increase over the period of the next rolling grant, as we are called upon to fulfill our part of the telescope staffing for the surveys. We note that we have not used our entire quota for the last rolling grant period. Therefore, in the light of our expected increase in telescope usage, we request level funding for the next 2 years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H00470X/1","grantId":"ST/H00470X/1","fundValue":"22497","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Derek  Ward-Thompson","coPersons":["Enzo  Pascale","Jonathan Ivor Davies","Haley Louise Gomez","Kate  Isaak","Walter  Kieran  Gear","Stephen  Eales","Philip  Mauskopf"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
