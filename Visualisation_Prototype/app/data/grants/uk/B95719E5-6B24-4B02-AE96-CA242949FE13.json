General theory of optimal stopping: L. Snell, E. Dynkin2. Optimal stopping and free boundary problems: A. Friedman, S. Jacka3. Methods of solution: A. Shiryaev, L. Shepp4. Applications I (mathematical finance): F. Delbaen, H. Gerber5. Applications II (sequential testing, quickest detection, optimal prediction): D. Siegmund, M. DavisDuring the Symposium there will be rooms available for privatediscussions and other spontaneous group activities. Participantswill have access to all academic facilities (library etc.) and inaddition to that there will be a reading room where all participantscan display their recent preprints/reprints and/or posters.Special funds will be available for UK-based postgraduate students.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D035333/1","grantId":"EP/D035333/1","fundValue":"23757","fundStart":"2006-01-17","fundEnd":"2006-04-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Goran  Peskir","coPersons":["Andreas Eou Kyprianou","Saul Domenico Jacka"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
