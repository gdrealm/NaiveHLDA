{"id":"8AB7D111-1F16-4BAB-B9FA-BE93ADDE04E4","title":"Increasing the Competence and Confidence of Social Work Researchers II: An Action-learning Programme to Develop Research Capacity (AMENDED)","abstractText":"<p>This project builds on a successful bid to the Round 2 ESRC Researcher Development Initiative in 2006 aimed at increasing the research capacity of social work researchers. Pioneering work on the application of scoping studies and systematic reviews to social work and social care by SCIE will be used as one of three platforms to launch this intensive development programme over two years. The second platform will explore the value of mixing methods specifically to build the evidence base for the discipline. The third platform will focus on quasi-experimentation and instrument design. SCIE and other research organisations will provide a number of 'placements', offering participants the experience of learning first-hand about systematic reviews. An innovation is the use of action-learning sets to support participants transform fledgling ideas into fully designed and costed proposals, ready for submission to funding bodies (especially the ESRC). Participants will join one of a number of action learning sets over the two years. They will also be offered regular support through the use of a buddy system, and a list of mentors which will include experienced social work researchers with a record of securing and managing high-quality, externally-funded research.<br /> </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F037139/1","grantId":"ES/F037139/1","fundValue":"57532","fundStart":"2008-01-08","fundEnd":"2010-01-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Shemmings","coPersons":["Carol  Lewis","Joan Elizabeth Orme","Ian F Shaw","Donald McColl Forrester","John Samuel Carpenter"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
