This is because the downward movement of the body has to be halted every time the foot hits the step and our ability to do this depends on many factors, including muscle strength, joint mobility and our sense of balance, all of which deteriorate with age.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this programme is to understand the role played in stepping performance by musculoskeletal and sensory functions and their deterioration with ageing and to find ways of improving the ability of older people to descend stairs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first approach will be to examine the design of stairs, specifically the combination of step-rise and step-going, since older people may lack the strength to cope with high steps or have difficulty landing safely on narrow steps. </p>\n\n<p>The results of this study could lead to alterations of the current building regulations relating to stair design.</p>\n\n<p>The second approach is to see to what extent &quot;tailor-made&quot; exercise training, for both strength and skill deficits identified in older people, can minimise the age-related deterioration of stepping ability. It is anticipated that this investigation will result in guidelines concerning the efficacy and cost effectiveness of training interventions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-356-25-0037","grantId":"RES-356-25-0037","fundValue":"296469","fundStart":"2009-11-12","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Constantinos  Maganaris","coPersons":["Vasilios  Baltzopoulos"],"organisation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
