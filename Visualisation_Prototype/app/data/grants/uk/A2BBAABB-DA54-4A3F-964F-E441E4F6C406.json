{"id":"A2BBAABB-DA54-4A3F-964F-E441E4F6C406","title":"British participation in the European Values Study","abstractText":"<p>The European Values Study (EVS) is a large-scale, cross-national, longitudinal survey research programme on basic human values. It is a unique investigation into how Europeans think about life, family, work, religion, politics and society. </p>\n\n<p>The EVS started in 1981, and the survey has been repeated every nine years since then in an increasing number of countries. The fourth wave in 2008/2009 will cover no fewer than 45 European countries, from Ireland to Azerbaijan and from Portugal to Norway. In total, about 70,000 people in Europe will be interviewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This grant supports British participation in the current round of the EVS. The central research question is whether values are changing in modern European society, to what extent and in what direction. In addition to the key domains mentioned above, topics include national identity, tolerance, social solidarity and life satisfaction. Many of the questions posed replicate previous surveys, thus enabling analysis of change over time.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>Researchers will be able to use the data to study a wide range of issues, looking either at Britain alone or in comparison with other European countries, with a focus either on the present or on how values and attitudes have changed. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H005536/1","grantId":"ES/H005536/1","fundValue":"87765","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Voas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
