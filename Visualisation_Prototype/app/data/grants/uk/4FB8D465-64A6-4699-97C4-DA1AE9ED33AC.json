Their use is growing rapidly in preference to\nconventional casting because the process produces parts in the precise final shape required with little or no machining\nrequirement combined with fine grained (nano-micro scale), homegeneous microstructures of enhanced strength. However\nthere is a lack of production quality control as little in-line inspection is performed. End-of-line inspection, not often\nperformed, leads to scrapping of 6-8% of components yet fails to detect micro sized defects, which can grow in service to\nproduce major in service failures and recalls. THE PROJECT VISION is an in-line quality control system (QUALINET) using\n3D microfocus x ray imaging with AUTOMATION INNOVATIONS (A) Detection and characterization of volume and surface\nmicro-scale defects at the pre and post sintering stages. (B) Decision making: (i) component acceptance or (ii) send for recycling or (iii) send with a prescription for defect healing treatment. QUALINET will eliminate waste, increasing line\nproduction, reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions, all by 8%. The benefit will be optimal for state of the art\nPM component lines including additive manufacturing by laser deposition, nano-powders and injection moulding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505195/1","grantId":"EP/L505195/1","fundValue":"336550","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tat-Hean  Gan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
