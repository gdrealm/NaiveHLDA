NASC proactively seeks out and absorbs key Arabidopsis genetic resources from the many tens of thousands of new seed stocks and other materials generated every year from laboratories worldwide. We provide a safe depository/repository for these materials and strive to ensure a cost-effective and rapid bulking and distribution of these materials to the wider plant research community. The coming five years will see a substantial enlargement of the stocks held in the centre but will also become a period of consolidation as the focus of the centre moves towards a more intensively characterised and predominantly fixed/inbred collection. this will require increasingly sophisticated material and data management and some development in physical tracking of materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E022758/1","grantId":"BB/E022758/1","fundValue":"1157210","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sean Tobias May","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
