{"id":"2B3DD97B-BE76-4DDD-9443-D33B5B1F9032","title":"Reading and Writing in Albrecht's 'J&uuml;ngerer Titurel'","abstractText":"The proposed monograph will provide a new line of interpretation for a land-mark of Middle High German literature. Albrecht's 'Jungerer titurel' is a lengthy and rhetorically ambitious narrative written ca. 1270 as a prequel and sequel to the more famous Arthurian text by Wolfram Von Escenbach. Part One of the monograph will consider the protagonist's obsessive engagement with the written word in all its manifestations. Part Two will focus on the narrator as a reader and a writer who seeks to distinguish his own uses of the written word from those of the protagonist as well as those of Wolfram.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111683/1","grantId":"111683/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Annette  Volfing","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
