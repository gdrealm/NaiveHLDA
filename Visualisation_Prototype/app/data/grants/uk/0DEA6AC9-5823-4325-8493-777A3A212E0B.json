On the one hand, the last missing element of the Standard Model, the Higgs boson, needs to be found, and on the other, the LHC experiments may find new particles and processes that go beyond the standard model. At the same time, in the theoretical physics community there are a number of outstanding problems that will benefit from the information that we expect to arrive from the LHC. This project will investigate two key problems in modern theoretical physics. \n\nFirstly, we will investigate strongly coupled gauge theories using the so-called gauge/string correspondence. Much remains to be learnt about strongly coupled gauge theories. In recent years, there have been significant breakthroughs in understanding certain gauge theories using the gauge/string correspondence. In particular, the mathematical tools known as integrability have provided an incredibly precise analytic handle on certain supersymmetric strongly interacting gauge theories. These tools have been shown to extend to certain settings with relatively little supersymmetry. Low-supersymmetry gauge theories have also been shown, through the so-called dimer models to have intimate links to the mathematics of algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory. In this project we will significantly build on these results to develop new mathematical tools and methods to understand the strong-coupling dynamics of less supersymmetric gauge theories and their gauge/string dualities.\n\nSecondly, we will explore beyond-the-Standard-Model physics that can be obtained as a consistent low-energy theory from string theory. String theory has provided a framework for unifying gauge and gravity interactions into a single consistent quantum theory. One of the key challenges has been to identify particular examples of string theory compactifications which will lead to realistic low-energy physics. Our group will systematically search through the very large number of consistent string vacua, for those models which are consistent with the Standard Model and any new physics found by the LHC. Our past experience suggests that stringy geometries which could give the Standard Model are very rare. This in turn hints at the uniqueness, rather than the huge degeneracy, of string vacua, and we aim to extensively test this hypothesis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L000482/1","grantId":"ST/L000482/1","fundValue":"72692","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Bogdan  Stefanski","coPersons":["Yang-Hui  He"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
