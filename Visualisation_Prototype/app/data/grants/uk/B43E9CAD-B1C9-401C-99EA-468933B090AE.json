The production of proteins, essential cell components that represent a significant proportion of the cell mass, is essential for cell growth. The ribosome is a molecular factory in the cell responsible for the synthesis of proteins. The cell regulates protein production by changing the activity and/or the levels of ribosomes. In cell transformation, the initial stage in the generation of tumours, the basic regulation of cell growth and division is lost allowing the cell to continue growing unchecked. It has recently been shown that many proteins that either cause or regulate cancer are also linked to the regulation of protein synthesis in the cell. This often involves the regulation of the synthesis of new ribosomes in a specific compartment in the cell known as the nucleolus. The production of the ribosome is a highly complicated process that is at present poorly understood. The cell has natural tumour suppressive agents such as the protein p53. The activation of this protein inhibits cell growth and division and is linked to the function of the nucleolus. We have found that chemical inhibitors that activate p53 also block the production of ribosomes. We propose to investigate the mechanisms by which these inhibitors block to production of ribosomes. The information gained from this approach will provide important information on how the cell activates the tumour suppressor p53. This research will provide important information on how the cell regulates cell growth and division and should provide new targets for anti-cancer therapeutics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501666","grantId":"G0501666","fundValue":"354835","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas James Watkins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
