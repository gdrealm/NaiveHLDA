{"id":"90C83F5C-6178-4442-9ACE-B20497ADD60E","title":"The Pharmaceuticalisation of Sleep and Wakefulness: A Social Scientific Investigation of Stakeholder Interests, Policies and Practices","abstractText":"Concerns are frequently expressed in scientific, professional and popular culture about the personal and social costs and consequences of poor sleep. At the same time concerns are being voiced about the 'appropriate' role and use of pharmaceuticals in the management of sleep problems, both inside and outside the doctors' surgery and the sleep clinic. This project provides a timely and topical social scientific investigation of these developments and debates. It focuses on sleep and wakefulness promoting drugs in contemporary Britain since 2000, framed in terms of the role of pharmaceuticals in the medical, social and personal management of sleep problems. The project will examine both 'upstream' issues regarding the development and regulation of sleep and wakefulness promoting drugs and 'downstream' issues regarding their meaning and use in medical practice and everyday/night life. These issues will be investigated through a qualitative, multi-method study comprising documentary sources, semi-structured interviews, focus groups and detailed case-studies with key stakeholders in field - ranging from sleep scientists, doctors and policymakers to patients, pressure groups and other key members of the public with an interest in these matters. Results will be communicated and disseminated to both academic and non-academic audiences and user groups, including scientists, doctors, patients, pressure groups and policymakers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2456","grantId":"RES-062-23-2456","fundValue":"314572","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Gabe","coPersons":["John William Abraham","Simon Johnson Williams"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
