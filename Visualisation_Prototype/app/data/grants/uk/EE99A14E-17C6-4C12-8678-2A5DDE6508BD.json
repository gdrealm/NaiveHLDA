There is no substantial impact beyond academia to report on any of the projects at this time. However there has been early impact in the form of knowledge transfer between researchers and technology companies including a short term special interest group network which developed strategies for research in the creative industries.  ","person":"Ann Melanie  Brown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" This grant was used to fund several small, short life projects in subject areas including art and design, engineering and biochemistry. The projects focused on knowledge exchange and impact activities including the dissemination of information via websites, workshops, focus groups, information sheets and mobile phone applications. \n\nThe majority of the projects sought to establish links with commercial partners. It became apparent that in many cases either the technology was too immature or the level of investment required was too high for sucessful partnerships to be developed at that time. The PIA grant funded a number of short life projects many of which aimed to facilitate knowledge exchange and impact for technologies which were approaching maturity via interaction with industrial partners. During the course of the projects it became apparent that some of the technologies were not sufficiently developed to attract industrial investment. Further research funding has been awarded which has enabled some of these projects to advance. Creative Economy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
