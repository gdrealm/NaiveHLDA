During development nerve cells (neurons) often overgrow \nforming many branches, each of which makes connections with many \ndifferent cells. Some of these branches are redundant or inappropriate \nand need to be removed for neural circuits to work well. This removal \nof branches is termed pruning. We have shown that during metamorphosis \nfruit flies prune back the branches of their sensory neurons by a \nlocal degeneration. This pruning looks very similar to degeneration \nfound in nerves following injury or that seen in diseases like \nAlzheimer?s. Circulating blood cells remove branches by engulfing \n(eating) them. Our preliminary data shows that the molecular machinery \nnormally used by a cell to commit ?cellular suicide? (apoptosis) is \nactivated locally in the branches that need to be removed. During \napoptosis a cell disassembles itself in an orderly manner and signals \nto other cells in the body to eat it whole. In pruning neurons this \nmachinery appears to be tightly regulated to prevent the cell dying. \nBlocking the machinery suppresses the removal of the branches, \nsuggesting that it is important for flagging branches to be eaten by \nblood cells. The work described here will establish how the ?apoptotic \nmachinery? is switched on in these branches and how this tells the \nblood cells to eat only those regions of the cell. We hope this will \nalso tell us something about way which neurons degenerate during \ndisease, which could ultimately help cure people. We will make our \nresults available to the public by publishing significant advances on \nour website, through press releases and by giving talks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600182","grantId":"G0600182","fundValue":"549912","fundStart":"2007-03-19","fundEnd":"2010-11-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Darren William Williams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
