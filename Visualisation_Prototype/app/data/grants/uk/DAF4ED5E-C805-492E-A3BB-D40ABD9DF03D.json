Pinned down and virtually stationary, the atoms can be examined and manipulated like never before. Deterministic quantum mechanics dominates their behaviour; collisions are reversible; and molecules can be formed and then broken with exquisite remote control.

Unfortunately, only single, tiny traps are usually possible, and, because the cooling process only works with a limited range of species, most atoms and all molecules that enter the trap retain enough kinetic energy to leave shortly after.\n\n\n\nThis project addresses the use of nanofabrication techniques, developed in Southampton, to produce arrays of concave mirrors whose foci, when illuminated with a laser, each become a tiny trap. Such arrays offer to store many more species than a single trap, and each trap can easily be distinguished under a microscope. Confining species within a few wavelengths of a surface allows new interactions and techniques that enhance the trap strength and enhance the sensitivity with which the species may be detected and observed. The extent and proximity of the surface also present exciting new mechanisms for cooling a far wider range of species than previously possible.\n\n\n\nOur research has investigated a range of trapping and cooling geometries, from modifications to conventional magnetooptical traps that allow them to be formed close to highly scattering surfaces, to novel cooling mechanisms based upon the retarded interaction of an illuminated particle with its own reflection: a form of dipole-dipole binding between the particle and its reflected image. The ultimate aim of the research is to extend to molecules, nanoparticles and the remainder of the periodic table of elements the control currently limited to a few lucky atoms. It hence promises techniques and technologies to underpin atom-on-a-chip devices and single-atom detection, enhanced atomic and molecular sensors, and ultimately a workbench for molecular measurement and manipulation that could open up new realms of ultra-cold chemistry. The extension of laser cooling to a wider variety of species potentially allows greater control of atomic and molecular reagents, with implications for studies and control of chemical reactions and synthesis. Combined with trapping near nanostructured surfaces, it could enhance the sensitivity of chemical and isotopic detection. Applied to micromechanical systems, our cooling techniques could increase the sensitivity of MEMS-style accelerometers, gyroscopes and electric/magnetic field detectors. These techniques will be of direct interest to others studying and developing optomechanically cooled and trapped species and samples for spectroscopy, quantum physics, inertial and electromagnetic sensing, quantum information processing, and investigation of the quantum-classical transition.
