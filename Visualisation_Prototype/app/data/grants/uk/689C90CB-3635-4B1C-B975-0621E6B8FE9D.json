Many cellular processes such as communication with the environment, defense from pathogen attack, and uptake of molecules are mediated by membrane proteins. Several recent discoveries show that not all proteins diffuse freely within the plane of the cell membrane. Inhomogeneity in membrane protein distribution is called membrane sub-structuring and concentrates proteins and protein complexes such as pores in a way that is vital for cell function. Work in our laboratories has demonstrated that, in plant cells, both the cytoskeleton, a scaffolding structure inside cells, and the cell wall, a supporting structure outside of cells, play roles in membrane sub-structuring. We do not know how the majority of membrane proteins interact with the cell wall or whether alterations in cytoskeleton structure will affect membrane protein distribution.\n \nOur approach to the study of membrane protein distribution and diffusion is to tag individual proteins with a fluorescent colour so that they are observable in living cells using high resolution microscopes. One recently developed technique now lets us observe single molecules within the cell membrane. Refinement of this technique should allow us to determine if molecules follow tracks or are restricted to small regions of the membrane as they diffuse. To determine what components of the cell wall interact with membrane proteins, we will examine diffusion of proteins in plants that are altered or deficient in different aspects of cell wall structure. Cell wall components that might affect membrane protein organisation and diffusion include cellulose, pectin, and hemicellulose. To examine the effect of cytoskeleton rearrangement on membrane protein movement, we will produce plants that have altered amounts of FORMIN1. This protein causes a very drastic, highly branching rearrangement of the cytoskeleton when it is overly abundant. Because this phenomenon kills seedlings, we will alter FORMIN1 levels in such a way that seedlings can grow to an appropriate stage for study before inducing a reduction or increase in FORMIN1 levels. Finally, we have recently observed that a protein called VAP36 plays a role in stabilising points in the cell membrane that are important for structuring of an internal membrane system known as the endoplasmic reticulum. The distribution and movement of VAP36 will be studied in altered cell wall and cytoskeleton conditions using the techniques described so that we can determine whether alterations in these structures affect processes within cells as well as those at the cell surface.\n\nAs a practical application of this research, we will use these techniques to study the diffusion of cell membrane proteins when plant defense mechanisms are activated. Plant cells sense when they are under attack by pathogens using elaborate signalling mechanisms but the effect of the early stages of pathogen attack on cell-membrane sub-structuring have not been studied. This work will provide insight about the role of cell membranes in fending off attack from bacterial and fungal pathogens that destroy a large percentage of food crops annually.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K009370/1","grantId":"BB/K009370/1","fundValue":"377075","fundStart":"2013-06-28","fundEnd":"2016-06-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  At this point, research is ongoing so findings are preliminary.

Research to date has concentrated on development of tools that will be used to meet the outcomes proposed.\n\nMore than 15 different plasma membrane and cell wall proteins have been cloned as fusions with fluorescent proteins. Many of these have been transformed into Arabidopsis lines with mutations for cell wall structure.\n\nA technique has been developed for making stable, long-term timelapse images of the actin cytoskeleton in living cells so that organisation of its microfilaments can be studied in cell wall mutant lines.\n\nData has been collected in FRAP and TIRF experiments on plasma membrane proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. Our first attempts to image these proteins in plants that have been chemically treated to alter cell-wall structure have been made. A large collection of fluorescently-tagged proteins has been produced and these will be made widely available to the cell biology community. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
