The original aims and objectives were met.<br /><br />The two studies on which this project based developed and tested a model of work based professional learning for interagency working. This is the inter-professional learning that is necessary for, in our case, welfare services to provide joined up responses to complex problems. We enhanced research capacity through our use and development of an Activity Theory driven perspective on learning and Developmental Work Research (DWR) methods with practitioners and our discourse analysis techniques with research staff.<br /><br />We identified a number of specific findings which are of direct interest to the academic community and whose implications are of&nbsp; interest to the policy field. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-139-46-0002","grantId":"RES-139-46-0002","fundValue":"13589","fundStart":"2008-01-11","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Harry Richard Daniels","coPersons":["Tony  Gallagher","Anne  Edwards"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
