{"id":"B7049404-0FB2-4FE8-95A3-E4DB845C8923","title":"The Making of Gypsy Diasporas","abstractText":"This project aims at investigating the notion of diaspora in discussions among Gypsies about their Indian origin. Its primary objective is to analyse images and expressions through which the Gypsies construct themselves as a diaspora people. \nThe project focuses on Gypsies' self-accounts of their diaspora situation and asks to which extent they mirror or challenge the fictional representations of the majority society. It investigates both 'official' (written) versions of Gypsy diaspora, produced by the new Gypsy intelligentsia, and traditional narratives and oral accounts by non-academic Gypsies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119488/1","grantId":"119488/1","fundValue":"9124","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Paola  Toninato","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
