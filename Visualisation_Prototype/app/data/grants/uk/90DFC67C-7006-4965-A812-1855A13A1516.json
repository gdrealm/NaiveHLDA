{"id":"90DFC67C-7006-4965-A812-1855A13A1516","title":"The New Ontology of the Mental Causation Debate","abstractText":"When we reflect upon our relation with the world, little seems more obvious than the claim that some mental events (such as beliefs, desires, etc.) cause physical events (bodily behaviour). Hence, it seems natural to suppose that my belief that it is going to snow causes me to put on a pair of gloves when I go outside and that my desiring not to be late is the cause of my running for the bus. Suppositions such as these lead to a belief in the causal efficacy of the mental in the physical domain. However, if we are truly committed to this belief, mental events must cause physical events in virtue of their mental properties. This is because all events stand in the causal relations that they do in virtue of their properties. So, for example, my door key causes the lock to open in virtue of the shape of the key and the shape of the lock. \\n\\nNow, according to most philosophers of mind, mental properties are not physical properties. This is because mental properties are arguably realisable by different physical properties. Though the property of pain, for example, might be realised in humans by one physical property, it might be realised by a different physical property in animals, and still yet another in extra-terrestrial beings. But if mental properties are not physical properties, we are faced with a problem. Arguably every physical effect has a sufficient physical cause. Consequently, non-physical causes and, moreover, non-physical properties are never needed to give a complete causal account of the physical domain. It follows that the non-physical can only be causally efficacious in the physical domain by systematically causally overdetermining physical effects. This seems highly implausible. It thus seems that the causal efficacy of the mental in the physical domain must be rejected and this had led to a long-running debate between philosophers.\\n\\nDespite numerous attempts to solve this problem, several philosophers have claimed that we are no closer to a solution and that, given the current form of the debate, we have reached an impasse. However, it is our claim that the apparent insolubility of the debate stems, in part, from the fact that it has been framed with insufficient metaphysical precision. Basing the debate within a plausible metaphysical framework will constitute, we contend, a significant step towards its resolution. \\n\\nMetaphysics is the branch of philosophy that is concerned with the fundamental structures of realty. Insofar as all branches of philosophy deal with aspects of reality they all involve, whether implicitly or explicitly, metaphysical issues. This is no less true of the philosophy of mind and, in particular, the debate about mental causation. This debate involves three groups of metaphysical issues. The first centres upon the question of what causation is a relation between. To assess the claim that mental causes have physical effects, it is necessary to have a plausible account of what causes and effects are. The second group of issues concerns the nature of properties. To know what it is for a mental property to exist and whether mental properties are identical with physical properties an account of the existence and identity conditions of properties is necessary. The third group of issues concerns the nature of the causal relation. Different accounts of the nature of the causal relation will have different implications for the claim that all physical effects have sufficient physical causes. \\n\\nOur project will begin with a detailed study of recent developments concerning these three groups of metaphysical issues. We will then proceed to apply the findings of this study to the mental causation debate. By locating this debate within a plausible metaphysical framework, we aim to focus the discussion and to shed new light on an old and much debated subject. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F009615/1","grantId":"AH/F009615/1","fundValue":"165974","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings have been published in an OUP book, academic philosophy journals and edited books.

In particular, our hypothesis was that new developments in ontology would provide new interactive dualist solutions to the problem of mental causation. Our research confirmed this hypothesis. Much of this research was devoted to studying how new power ontologies impacted on the mental causation debate. Sophie Gibb's most important discovery was a new dualist account of psychophysical causation which emerged from her acceptance of a powers theory of causation. During the project, E. J. Lowe further developed his substance dualist account which is based in a powers ontology. And Valdi Ingthorsson's work on powers helped to advance several debates on the metaphysics of causation and powers. Sophie Gibb's findings are being taken forward with her work on the Durham Emergence Project which is led by Robin Hendry and funded by the John Templeton Foundation. For this project she is writing a book that develops and defends the dualist account of psychophysical causation that she proposed during the AHRC project. Valdi Ingthorsson has just gained a research grant to work on the topic of Aristotelian Essentialism, and the research that he completed for the AHRC project will feed into that. Very sadly, E. J. Lowe, the co-investigator for the project, passed away early this year. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
