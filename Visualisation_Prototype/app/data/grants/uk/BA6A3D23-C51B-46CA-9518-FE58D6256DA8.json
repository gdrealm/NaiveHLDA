They allow developers to enhance familiar applications such as terrain modeling and photography by rendering 3D scenes in a physical-3D manner and open opportunities for novel applications in collaboration, tangible entertainment, and accessibility.\n\nWhile there is strong progress in the development of technological approaches to shape-change, researchers lack the fundamental understanding of low-level user interactions with these devices. Specifically, the performance impact of shape-change on atomic touch interactions (object selection and manipulation) is unknown. Similarly, the perceptual impact of coupling high-resolution, high-refresh rate visual output and low-resolution, low refresh-rate physical output on the same surface is also unexplored. Understanding these fundamental interactions and perceptions will lay the foundation for development of efficient and fluid interactions for this next generation of displays.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M016528/1","grantId":"EP/M016528/1","fundValue":"96898","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jason  Alexander","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
