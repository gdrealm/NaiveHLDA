It is clear that commercial potential is enormous for new types of sound-generating algorithms--less obvious is that there are deep scientific issues behind the development of these algorithms.Synthetic sounds (i.e., generated by a computer or commercial synthesizers) often mimic real acoustic instrument sounds; until recently, most sound-producing algorithms algorithms were makeshift, and tuned by ear to give a desired result. (e.g., a clarinet-like sound composed of digitally-produced sine waves).Recently, there has been work on synthesis methods which model the physics of a real acoustic instrument. In addition to giving much higher-quality (i.e., realistic-sounding) output, they allow a simple means of control; for a clarinet model, for instance, the opening or covering of a hole is mapped directly to a parameter in the algorithm. This is difficult for non-physical models. Other bonuses are the ability to build digital models of imaginary instruments, and the simulation of even the most delicate quirks of real instruments.The most prevalent and commercially successful physical modeling synthesis algorithm is the digital waveguide technique. It is based on a simplified representation of wave propagation, and is extremely efficient, computationally; real-time implementations of many musical instrument sounds are available. It has become apparent to this researcher, however, that these methods are limited in several fundamental ways:1) They cannot be extended to deal with more realistic nonlinear models of sound production (pitch glides and twangs in strings, as well as piercing brightness in brass instruments at high blowing pressures)2) They are inefficient in two or more dimensions (i.e., in order to model vibrating drum heads or gongs)3) They are insufficiently accurate, leading to mistunings of modal frequencies, (perceived as a harsh inharmonicity or beating)In short, digital waveguides do not generalize well beyond a first approximation of musical sound. One might ask whether there are other ways of applying physical models for musical sound synthesis, given that computation speeds have increased enormously.In fact, more sophisticated approaches exist, and are related to methods in use in other fields, such as electromagnetic and fluid dynamic simulation. The most straightforward of these is finite difference approximation to a set of partial differential equations representing the physics of the musical instrument. These methods can be as detailed as desired, allowing for very high fidelity modeling.But the finite difference schemes used for sound synthesis to date are only the simplest schemes (1970s era); there have been many recent advances in mainstream simulation technology, and some appear to be directly relevant to musical sound synthesis. Two, in particular, stand out, and circumvent the three difficulties mentioned above:1) Spectral methods are highly-accurate finite difference schemes, which can be used for a wide variety of problems in one or multiple dimensions; efficient realizations making use of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) exist.2) Energy-conserving methods are essential in dealing with nonlinear problems, in one or multiple dimensions.We propose an investigation of the above techniques as applied to a wide range of musical acoustics problems involving strings, bars, horns, the vocal tract, membranes, and plates/in short, we would like to assemble a general-purpose musical toolbox based around these methods, in the Matlab prototyping language. This adaptation of existing techniques to new musical problems is highly nontrivial, as there are many special issues and constraints which do not arise in mainstream applications. These algorithms should serve as the first step towards a newer generation of expressive and potentially lucrative sound synthesis tools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C007328/1","grantId":"EP/C007328/1","fundValue":"83492","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stefan Damian Bilbao","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
