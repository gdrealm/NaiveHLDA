It is for this reason that there is great hope in using them to cure a variety of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. One of the main problems we have is how can we control this ability in a culture dish so that we only form the correct type of cells we need. The nervous system may be especially problematic because there are many different types of neurons. So the problem is not just to form neurons, but if we are going to use them in the future as therapy, we need to form the correct type of neuron. We have evidence that during normal development, the neural precursors may in fact be turning genes on and off very rapidly over time. We hypothesise that these oscillations are important for the neural precursors to decide when they are going to respond to external signals and become a particular type of neuron. We now wish to study this further by combining mathematical models of the system with experimental manipulations in chick embryos. This will enable us to identify both the key regulatory genes that control neural development and cellular markers that will tell us how far along the neural lineage pathway a progenitor has progressed. In the long term this will allow us to control neural stem cell differentiation in a culture dish.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D014840/1","grantId":"BB/D014840/1","fundValue":"416640","fundStart":"2006-07-03","fundEnd":"2009-08-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Penny  Rashbass","coPersons":["Nicholas Alexander Monk"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
