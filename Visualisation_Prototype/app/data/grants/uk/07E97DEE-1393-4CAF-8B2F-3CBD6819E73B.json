{"id":"07E97DEE-1393-4CAF-8B2F-3CBD6819E73B","title":"Towards Quantitative fMRI for Serial Studies of the Normal and Diseased Brain","abstractText":"The relatively new technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided a uniquely non-harmful way of studying the way the human brain works. We are able to use this technology to study both healthy people, and people with brain diseases. To date, however, it has been difficult to make rigorous comparisons of brain activity in the same person across different points in time (for example, from week to week) or across different people (for example, between healthy people and patients). This is because of the complexity of the signals that are measured by fMRI. In this proposal we will work to improve our understanding of the factors that influence the fMRI signal that we measure, with the intention of being able to make better comparisons between scanning sessions and between different people. We will make measurements and test theories in healthy human volunteers who will undergo MRI scans, and towards the end of the grant period we apply the procedures that we develop to patients with blocked blood supply to the brain. Once this is accomplished the results of this proposal would make fMRI a much better tool for doctors and scientists to use in order to monitor brain diseases, and to develop new treatment methods.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0100811","grantId":"G0100811","fundValue":"566542","fundStart":"2003-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Jezzard","coPersons":["Paul M Matthews"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
