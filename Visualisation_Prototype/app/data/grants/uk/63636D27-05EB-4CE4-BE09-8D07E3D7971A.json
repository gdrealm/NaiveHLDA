These populations have arisen through rapid medical progress in tandem with changes in social attitudes to issues surrounding disability and chronic illness.This has led to increasing numbers of people with rare and/or complex disease or disability living considerably longer lives than was historically possible. Many are pioneers; facing issues as they age that have never before been encountered, either by themselves or by professionals leading their treatment and care.<br /><br />One such new ageing population is the first cohort of paediatric liver transplant recipients in the world. Childhood liver transplantation began in the early-mid 1980s in Britain and North America.Thirty years later, many of the British pioneers, still receiving specialist care, are living adult lives. While clinical outcomes are documented, social and ontological issues for these adults, who have lived their whole lives within the context of their body as a project, have never been studied. Through in-depth interviews with transplant recipients and clinicians, we aim to explore both the health and social implications of living with transplanted livers from infancy and wider existential questions surrounding such transforming ‘experimental’ surgery.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-3363","grantId":"RES-062-23-3363","fundValue":"134772","fundStart":"2012-01-03","fundEnd":"2014-01-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Lowton","coPersons":["Paul Frederick Higgs"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":" Our study is the first to investigate how the pioneer cohort of British childhood liver transplant recipients experienced growing up and growing older, through using a narrative approach with 27 now-adult survivors who had lived for up to 28 years since their first liver transplant. Interviews with 8 clinicians involved with childhood liver transplant served to provide a historical and contemporary context to our emerging analysis. Our findings and recommendations highlight how experiences of growing up and growing older have changed significantly over the past 30 years for members of 'new' ageing populations, influenced by significant medical advances and changes in societal attitudes. Our research contributes new knowledge and advances sociological thinking in five key intellectual areas: \n1. Managing a long-term condition \nWe found that family care and support is regular and ongoing in adulthood. However, participants reported lengthy (re)negotiation with their families over how members could 'fit' into a hospital transition structure that moves patients from paediatric to adult care. Here, the 'joint project' of family care and support was juxtaposed with the hospital's focus on the individual gaining 'independence' in managing their condition. Of note, no participant reported knowing another now-adult childhood liver transplant recipient, bar two siblings and one young person who had been introduced to another at university. This was reported to lead to feelings of isolation or 'being the only one', and is in stark contrast to more common or established long-term conditions where advice and support from similar others comes through a number of avenues such as hospital waiting rooms, charities, and 'self-help' groups. \nKey recommendations: To consider the extent of care and support that families provide these 'new' ageing populations throughout adult life; to incorporate these groups into Department of Health policy concerning the management of long-term conditions [Evidence submitted to Health Select Committee] \nKey output: NHS Choices 'Childhood Liver Transplant' video series \n2. Constructing self- and social identities \nBecause they were recipients of cutting edge biomedicine at the time, our participants, as part of a 'pioneer' cohort, had no template from which to gauge what was 'normal' in constructing their individual narratives. Self-identity and social identity were constructed and reshaped through two key influences: 1) the evolving clinical interventions that accompanied participants' early years and maintain a strong presence in adulthood; and 2) the 'normal' developmental processes associated with infancy, childhood and adolescence. Comparisons of self with others began at an early age and continued to the present day. Being a pioneer cohort and feeling relatively isolated as a now-adult survivor of childhood liver transplant led participants to frequently consider their feelings of being 'normal' and 'different' across their lifecourse. This was most often in the context of their body image pre- and post-transplant, and in experiences both reported and imagined for the future. \n3. Biographical disruption \nMuch has been written about the way in which the presence of chronic and disabling conditions can be viewed either as a form of 'normal ageing' or as disrupted biographical narrative; the latter approach being based upon normative expectations of health at different stages of life. The concept of biographical disruption is predicated mainly on illness acquired during adulthood; conditions occurring at birth or early childhood have largely been neglected, despite their being 'integral to an individual's biographically embodied sense of self' (Williams, 2000). This is set against the 'diversity of normativity' (Beck, 2007) whereby it cannot be asserted that there is a simple or default 'normal life'. We provide new empirically based knowledge to refine these theoretical debates. Compared to cultural notions of 'normality', our participants' biographies may seem disrupted; at the time of their first transplant, this group of recipients was at only one of a number of points in their emerging patient careers. What lay before them were both unintended and unanticipated post-transplant consequences and contingencies. Briefly, we suggest the biographical narrative here is constrained by transplant and its ongoing effects rather than being a disruption to a normal lifecourse. \n4. The transplant scar \nRecipients' interpretations of their transplant scar and their disclosure strategies related to this were complex and reported to change over the lifecourse. The liver transplant scar is one of the largest surgical scars a patient can receive, and although surgeons refer to it as a 'Mercedes' or 'Lexus' incision, our study participants more commonly referred to its physical appearance as a 'map', 'maze', or 'war zone', signifying both the number of operations and other scars they had received and their interpretation of the treatment process. Significant symbolic and moral meanings were ascribed to the scar, including for example the scar being 'badge of honor' or a reminder to 'live life well', and whether it was 'right' to request cosmetic revision in adulthood. \nKey recommendation: To include scar management (its appearance, significance to recipients, and the possibility of cosmetic revision) in clinical guidelines for long-term care of organ transplant \n5. Moral deservedness of liver transplant recipients \nDiscussions regarding notions of moral obligations and expectations have to date focused on adult transplant recipients as being deserving or undeserving, for example in assuming that recipients should behave in ways that take care of the donor organ as a way of acknowledging the benefactor's act. These issues are often the focus for moral controversy regarding who should be deemed suitable for liver transplantation, with alcohol abusers often being viewed as unsuitable recipients. Our analysis suggests that those with conditions conventionally associated with childhood create a new terrain for discourses of morally deserving recipients as well as expectations for moral conduct post-transplant. Although some participants stated they did not drink alcohol, others drew on contemporary British youth culture and the social acceptability of alcohol when talking about drinking as part of their own social life. However, those known to be a liver transplant recipient who consumed alcohol in public reported overt disapproval from the lay public. Overall, we found that conventional discourses of deserving and undeserving recipients remain resonant, with no counter-discourse as yet available to this 'new' ageing population. 1. Our evidence submitted to politicians (Health Select Committee, June 2013; All Party Parliamentary Hepatology Group, October 2013) calls for recognition of the ageing and related health and social care problems of adults with long-term conditions who historically did not survive childhood in health and social care policy, service configuration and practice. Additionally, our video calling for people living in England who have had organ transplant to be exempt from prescription charges included an interview with Shaun Woodward MP, who highlighted the injustice of the current Exemption from Prescriptions List. \n2. Working with NHS staff (NHS Choices Video; Liver Disease nurses) we have produced a series of short videos to inform others affected by liver disease and the need for transplant of the pertinent issues related to growing up and growing older with a liver transplant. These are available on the open-access NHS Choices website in order to reach the widest audience possible. Through speaking about the implications of our findings for healthcare delivery to a large group of liver nurses, we aim to influence healthcare practice to be more mindful of the key issues affecting now-adult recipients of childhood liver transplant. \n3. We are working with Dr Alexander Gimson, Chair of NHS Blood and Transplant's Liver Advisory Board, to ensure that our study findings (for example the significance to adults of their childhood liver transplant scar) reach a wide and relevant clinical audience. We aim to achieve this through submitting presentations and papers to professional journals and providing evidence to underpin revisions of clinical guidelines. \n4. We have remained in contact with a number of our study participants who are keen to promote the study messages and provide contact mechanisms for their cohort, plus consider working in an advocacy capacity.
