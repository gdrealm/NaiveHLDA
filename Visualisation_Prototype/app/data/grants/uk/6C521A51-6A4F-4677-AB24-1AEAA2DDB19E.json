The main emphasis will be to characterise a special set of lymphocytes (regulatory T cells) that act to prevent transplant rejection and to establish ways by which they can be selectively primed by the graft. We will use transgenic mice that express a uniform receptor committed to just one transplantation antigen, so eliminating the ?noise? from the vast majority of irrelevant lymphocytes from the analysis. These mice, and T cell clones and lines derived from them, will be used to follow the cell biology and key signalling mechanisms of these regulatory T cells. This information should lead to improved strategies to achieve tolerance in clinical transplantation, and to re-establish it in autoimmune disease.\n\nWe have exhibited at Royal Society soirees and exhibitions, and have given lay lectures on ?reprogramming? and therapeutic antibodies to the Royal Institution and to school parties visiting Oxford. We maintain an active website http://www.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/pathology/tig/welcome.html that lays out our research activities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G7904009","grantId":"G7904009","fundValue":"8387140","fundStart":"1980-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Herman  Waldmann","coPersons":["Stephen P Cobbold"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
