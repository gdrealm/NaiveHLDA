In that last category, we find the causes of some of the most deadly threats that mankind has ever been faced with, such as the Black Death epidemic that killed half of the European population in the Middle Ages, or the tuberculosis global pandemic that currently affects a third of the worldwide population, killing over a million people every year. Significant diversity is often observed within a given bacterial species and not just between species. For example, E. coli is well known as a source of serious food-associated disease outbreaks, like the one that occurred in Germany in 2011. However, E. coli is also a normal inoffensive inhabitant of our guts, and can even benefit us by producing a vitamin or protecting us for example from Salmonella infections. Another example is S. aureus, which can cause hospital-acquired infections, but is also carried asymptomatically by a third of healthy humans. \n\nUnderstanding the cause for this diversity in virulence is important, but there are also many other properties of interest. For example, resistance or sensitivity to a given antibiotic can make the difference between a treatment being successful or not. Another important property is host-specificity which for species like Salmonella or Campylobacter determines the likelihood to infect a cow, pig or bird and therefore to end up in the human food chain. There are indeed many such properties that vary within each bacterial species, in the same way that we see many important differences between one person to another in the human population. In bacteria, many of these properties are of major biomedical importance, and yet their genetic basis are not always fully understood. \n\nBacterial genomes are relatively short compared to other organisms, being made of one to ten million letters. The first bacterial genome to be fully sequenced was H. influenzae in 1995, shortly followed by E. coli in 1997. Sequencing a single representative genome from a species is however not useful to study variation of a property within the species. In the past few years, the sequencing technology has made huge progress in cost, speed and accuracy, to the point that very large numbers of genomes can now be sequenced. This genomic revolution enables a new strategy to study the genetic basis of properties, and this is the strategy we are proposing to implement. The basic idea is simply to take some bacteria that exhibit the property, and some that do not, and scan their genomes to find the elements that are present in the former and not in the latter. \n\nIf this simple strategy was implemented naively, there are several reasons why it could lead to wrong results. We have identified these pitfalls and suggest ways to avoid them. To ensure that the method we will develop reliably gives correct results, simulations will be used where an artificial dataset is generated in which we know what is causing the property, and we apply our method as if we did not know it. This will allow to determine exactly when the method works and when it does not, and to improve it accordingly. \n\nThe method will be applied to two large genomic datasets in Campylobacter and E. coli, two important human pathogens for which many questions are still open. Most importantly, the method will be released freely online as a user-friendly software package called BassoMapper. This will enable other scientists to apply the method to other genomic datasets, to help them discover the genetic basis for many other properties in many organisms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L023458/1","grantId":"BB/L023458/1","fundValue":"187872","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Xavier  Didelot","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" not applicable this year not applicable this year Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
