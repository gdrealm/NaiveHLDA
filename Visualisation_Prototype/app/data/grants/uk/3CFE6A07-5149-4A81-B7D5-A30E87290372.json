Since low levels of physical activity may partly contribute to higher risks of heart disease we will also examine associations between physical activity and mortality in this population.\nThis research will be performed using the 1994-2004 Health Survey for England (HSfE) and follow up data on all cause and cardiovascular related death. \nPrior research into physical activity and heart disease has been mainly conducted in white populations. From our results we hope to be able to understand the minimal and optimal amounts of physical activity that can be prescribed for the primary prevention of heart disease in South Asians. Since South Asians living in England appear to be at greater risk of heart disease this work will have implications for public health policy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701859","grantId":"G0701859","fundValue":"95190","fundStart":"2008-07-23","fundEnd":"2010-02-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Hamer","coPersons":["Tarani  Chandola","Emmanuel  Stamatakis"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
