However, there is a major gap in the kinetic database, in that there is little or no data for sub ambient temperatures and where data is available the picture is far from clear, and thus does not allow the full atmospheric importance of the coupling of halogen chemistry with peroxy radicals to be assessed. An integrated programme of laboratory and modelling studies is proposed to study a key set of peroxy radical reactions, namely RO2 + XO. A state of the art experimental system, a turbulent flow chemical ionisation mass spectrometer, that enables direct experimental acess to atmospherically relevant teperatures and pressures will be used to determine kinetic and mechanistic parameters. The experimental results will be raionalised using state of the art ab - intio calculations and then be incorporated into a global atmospheric model which allows the atmospheric importance of the interacttion of peroxy radicals with XO radicals to be assessed. The proposed work will be invaluable for the rationalisation of the effect of halogen chemistry on atmospheric pollution and climate change","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E005268/1","grantId":"NE/E005268/1","fundValue":"302566","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The temperature dependence of the rate coefficients for the reactions of RO2 + XO (where R = CH3 or C2H5) and X (where = I, Br or Cl) were investigated over the temperature range of 195 to 298 K and the pressure range 75 - 200 Torr using the turbulent flow technique with a chemical ionisation mass spectrometry detection system. \n\n\n\nAn Arrhenius expression was obtained for the overall rate coefficient of k(T) = ( ) x 10-13 exp [(810 ? 127)/T] and cm-3 molecule-1 s-1 where the uncertainty associated with the rate coefficient is given at the two standard deviations level for CH3O2 +ClO, CH3O2 +BrO respectively.
