We are using this technique to study three common diseases: left cerebral hemisphere stroke; mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease; and a form of chronic epilepsy, know as temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nStroke\nWe are investigating patients who have impaired communication (aphasia) after a left cerebral hemisphere stroke. About 25,000 patients each year are left with persistent aphasia after stroke. Treatment for this condition is far from perfect, and in many instances largely of unproven benefit. It mostly takes the form of behavioural retraining, under the supervision of speech and language therapists. A particular difficulty is the problem of predicting the degree of natural recovery that will occur. This is usually maximal by three months, but the amount of recovery can be very variable. The size of the stroke does influence outcome. However, other factors seem to be involved, and what these are are not knowm. Many people believe that recovery is because language 'switches' from the left to the right cerebral hemisphere, but the evidence that this happens is slender. There is much better evidence that recovery is due to wide reorganisation of undamaged parts of the left hemisphere, and our prediction is that if critical pathways remain intact then recovery is much better. Therefore, we are recruiting 50 patients after aphasic stroke, and in the first phase we are assessing their language abilities within the first week of stroke. We are particularly interested in speech production, as patients find an impaired ability to express themselves the most frustrating aspect of their condition. We then reassess them at three months, and so we have a measure of their 'trajectory' of recovery: good, bad or indifferent. We also do detailed MRI, early and late, to assess the boundaries of the stroke, the function of the whole brain as the patients try to speak, and the integrity of pathways (white matter tracts) throughout the brain. We predict that this will give considerable insight into the factors necessary for good natural recovery, and this knowledge will be essential in informing improved future therapeutic strategies.\n\nAlzheimer's disease\nThe cardinal feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is forgetfulness, particularly for verbal information. There are three stages for remembering what one has just been told: registering the information (that is paying attention to the speaker to understand what is being said); encoding the information as a longer lasting memory; and then retrieving that memory when required. These different stages rely on very different networks in the the brain. Most research has concentrated on the encoding and retrieval stages. We are researching the first stage, and specifically the role of attention. In the early stages of AD, language functions are intact, so undertanding speech is not the problem. Rather, we argue, the patients are inattentive. Attention depends on a right cerebral hemisphere system. We are investigating this system during communication, using functional and anatomical MRI sequences. We are also observing whether the drugs used to alleviate some of the symptoms of AD have a particularly strong action on this right hemisphere system.\n\nEpislepsy\n\nSome patients with epilepsy have surgery to prevent their attacks. One common operation is to remove the front pary of one lobe of the brain, the temporal lobe. Surprisingly, this has a relatively minor effect on the patient's higher mental functions. We are invetigating the hypothesis that frequent seizure activity throughot the lifetime of the patient has resulted in reorganisation of the temporal lobe networks, thus protecting the patient from a major deficity after the surgery has been completed. This will inform us more about the protective 'plasticity' of the brain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K014129/1","grantId":"MR/K014129/1","fundValue":"695400","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Wise","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
