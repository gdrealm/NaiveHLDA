{"id":"57C84AD7-1115-4EAC-BDBF-38C7A50FB8EB","title":"Widening Participation in Higher Education in Ghana and Tanzania: Developing an Equity Scorecard","abstractText":"<p>This three-year project will investigate interventions for widening participation in one public university and one private university in Ghana and Tanzania. Taking widening participation as a focus, the aim is to interrogate what universities are doing in relation to poverty reduction and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The project aims to explore factors that facilitate or impede participation in higher education, and to examine approaches taken by state and private providers to widen participation. This will involve examination of policy frameworks and codes of practice for widening participation of under-represented groups in higher education in Ghana and Tanzania. It will also include evaluating the success of widening participation initiatives via scrutiny of statistical data and interviews with key staff, policymakers and community advocates. Life-history narrative research will also be pursued to capture the experiences of students from 'non-traditional' backgrounds. Local teams will be set up comprising researchers, managers, students and equity advocates to identify datasets that will help them construct equity scorecards for promoting inclusion and achievement of socially and economically excluded groups.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0078","grantId":"RES-167-25-0078","fundValue":"569768","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Louise  Morley","coPersons":["Fiona Elizabeth Leach"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
