Conditions that highlight stereotypes of women as poor at mathematics, for example, have been shown to reliably impair the performance of women on tests within this stereotyped domain. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the research is to investigate the minimal necessary conditions to produce &quot;stereotype threat&quot; and the resultant underperformance. According to the authors' model, when stereotyped-group members find themselves in stereotype-relevant situations, they should activate domain-relevant stereotypes (eg women are poor at maths), but they should only be vulnerable to stereotype threat if they also consider their group membership as relevant. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The proposed model provides a more precise specification of the mechanisms responsible for stereotype threat and subsequent underperformance than previous accounts, and the results of the proposed research will thus be informative to our understanding of the phenomenon. Ultimately, the accrual of insight into the fundamental mechanisms of stereotype threat holds promise for suggesting new or improved interventions to enhance the achievement of members of underachieving groups across a wide range of domains.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F035853/1","grantId":"ES/F035853/1","fundValue":"79964","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Harriet Elizabeth Rosenthal","coPersons":["Kimberly  Quinn"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
