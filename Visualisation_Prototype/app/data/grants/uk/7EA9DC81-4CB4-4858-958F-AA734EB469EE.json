{"id":"7EA9DC81-4CB4-4858-958F-AA734EB469EE","title":"Tractable statistical inference from genomic data using diffusion models","abstractText":"If we were to obtain the sequence of my genome, we'd see a string of three billion letters from the DNA alphabet. Now let's sequence yours and compare the two. At most positions they'd be identical - we are both human - but at a small number, less than 1%, we'd seem some variation. As the costs of DNA sequencing fall, obtaining your own genome will soon no longer be a hypothetical question. We are presently on the cusp of obtaining the genomes of thousands of people, providing a glimpse into the complex pattern of genetic variation across all humans. This data encodes a great deal of biological information such as the rate of mutations, and it also contains information about human demographic history, such as recent historical population size changes and migrations. Can we infer these things just from the genetic data?\n\nGiven its rich and complex source of data, this has occupied statisticians, probabilists, and geneticists for many years. The key to this type of statistical inference is a suitable stochastic model: one important model is known as the Wright-Fisher diffusion. It describes the random fluctuations through time of the frequency of a variant in a large population - that is, it traces a trajectory for how prevalent the variant was at each point in time. Performing inference with diffusion models can be difficult. The purpose of this research is to contribute to making such inference tractable.\n\nThe approach here is to use a computationally-intensive, simulation-based, statistical technique: rather than work exhaustively, we simulate some random, representative samples from the model and average over them. A computer can provide us with a large number of samples, so that the error is expected to be small provided we wait long enough. So successful is this idea that it is used throughout science and engineering. Here, we must simulate paths from the Wright-Fisher diffusion - the random, unobserved trajectories of historical frequencies of genetic variants. Ensuring such simulation can be carried out efficiently on this and related diffusions is a first task of the research. Because of the generality of the models and the techniques involved, this has the potential to aid researchers in many fields outside genetics too.\n\nGiven a method for sampling from the model, our next task is to embed it into an inference algorithm. However, this approach has been little applied to the framework of the Wright-Fisher diffusion, and there are open questions on the design of such an algorithm that this research will address, including some important specific issues. For example, we might simulate our diffusion path by many small, local increments, building up its trajectory in very small time steps based on what the data looks like at that time. We should hope that these trajectories will be consistent with the observed data overall, but ensuring such consistency is a global, not local, problem. The project will also address this issue.\n\nFinally, we must specialize the algorithms for the analysis of genetic data. So that the work can be made accessible, convenient software will also be developed. Analysis of genetic data has the potential to provide a range of benefits: among other things, we can learn about human origins from ancient DNA, the evolution of pathogens, the progression of a tumour, the importance of natural selection, and the recent demographic history of humans. The latter is important as a vital first step in predicting the nature of human genetic variation, which in turn is fundamental in our understanding of the genetic basis of the risk of many complex diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L018497/1","grantId":"EP/L018497/1","fundValue":"92889","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The grant is still in its early stages and has not impacted outside academia yet.  ","person":"Paul  Jenkins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" This grant is still in its early stages, but there has already been some solid methodological progress, with two papers under review and two more drafted. The initial goals of the research were to study simulation methods for a widely used diffusion model in genetics. The model captures the evolution of genes in large, randomly mating populations such as humans, but is complicated to describe and difficult to work with. The key advancements made in this area have been:\n1. To develop simpler, tractable models for sequences of genes spread out along a chromosome (Jenkins, Fearnhead, &amp;amp; Song 2014, arXiv:1405.6863, under review).\n2. To design an algorithm for simulating from the diffusion model exactly - that is, with no approximation error at all (Jenkins &amp;amp; Spano 2014, in preparation).\n\nThe first set of results is important in studying a phenomenon known as linkage disequilibrium, as it predicts how this quantity will vary along the genome. LD is widely studied because it is fundamental in mapping the locations of disease-causing mutations.\n\nThe latter algorithm is expected to reduce the bias in existing - approximate - methods for inference from genetic data; quantifying this will be an important part of the forthcoming research. Further, the methods we have developed are rather general (Jenkins 2014, arXiv:1311.5777, under review) and have the potential to improve algorithmic efficiency in simulating a number of other diffusions, which are ubiquitous in scientific modelling problems.\n\nThe results of these developments have already been disseminated by presentations at four seminars/conferences, with two more invitations to speak in 2015 (one an international conference), suggesting much potential future impact. The research is currently on track with the original plan. If this continues, it is expected that on completion of the grant there will be a set of software tools which are freely available to the community and which can efficiently analyze genetic data. Based on existing related toolsets, this has great potential in particular in the areas of 'genetic time series' and 'allele frequency spectrum' analysis. Uptake by researchers in these areas would mean impacting on diverse areas such as the modelling of human origins, the spatial spread of diseases, pathogen evolution, complex genetic diseases, and cancer growth. In turn, progress by others in these application areas are having long-term benefits in areas such as personalized healthcare, through personal genomics and improved drug-targetting.
