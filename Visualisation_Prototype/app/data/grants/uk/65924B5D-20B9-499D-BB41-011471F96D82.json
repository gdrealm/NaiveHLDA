The key idea is investigate the spinning disc atomisation process, which is the cheapest and most efficient atomisation method applicable to numerous materials, both theoretically and using theory-guided experiments, and incorporte the findings into a technological platform using the help and resources of an industrial company experiences in this kind of upscaling. Besides its main deliverable, the research will also develop a methodology of investigating a multi-faceted industrial problem where the multiplicity of potential outcomes of the technological process is controlled only implicitly by a few operational parameters.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K028553/1","grantId":"EP/K028553/1","fundValue":"296770","fundStart":"2014-05-02","fundEnd":"2017-05-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Yulii  Shikhmurzaev","coPersons":["Grigory M Sisoev"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
