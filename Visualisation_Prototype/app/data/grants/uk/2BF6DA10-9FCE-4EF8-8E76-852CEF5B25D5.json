{"id":"2BF6DA10-9FCE-4EF8-8E76-852CEF5B25D5","title":"Producing Robust Density Forecasts: Applications to Monetary Policy","abstractText":"<p>The objective of the research is to develop and apply methods of model combination so as to build up an understanding of how to produce density forecasts robust to a constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Structural breaks are well known to contribute to the unreliability of point forecasts. But models differ in their sensitivity to structural breaks, and robust point forecasts can be obtained both by combining forecasts from different models and from a given model estimated over different estimation windows. The project extends this work to accommodate instabilities when density forecasting.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed framework for combining the different models' density forecasts is adapted from management science whereby each &quot;expert&quot; uses a distinct model to produce the respective &quot;judgement&quot; which is then aggregated by the decision maker. In its simplest form this involves taking a weighted linear combination of the different models' density forecasts. The weights reflect the decision maker's (post-data) assessment of the experts; we will consider estimating these weights using both in-sample and out-of-sample measures of the fit of the density. The applications will forecast, among other variables, inflation, output growth and the output gap for the UK and US and will use real-time data/vintages. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1753","grantId":"RES-062-23-1753","fundValue":"227988","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Garratt","coPersons":["James  Mitchell","Stephen George Hall"],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
