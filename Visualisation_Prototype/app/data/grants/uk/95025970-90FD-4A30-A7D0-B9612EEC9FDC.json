These include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, scrapie in sheep and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. TSEs are infectious diseases and can be transmitted within and between species. It is thought that the transmission of BSE to humans via contaminated foodstuffs resulted in the emergence of variant CJD (vCJD), which to date has caused 164 deaths in the UK. Four of these cases have occurred following a blood transfusion from an individual who later went on to develop vCJD, indicating that human to human transmission of vCJD can occur, and the potential exists for further human to human spread via surgery, dentistry and other invasive procedures. Although the incidence of BSE and vCJD appear to be declining, new TSEs of animals are constantly being identified, such as atypical scrapie, atypical forms of BSE (H-type and L-type), and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in North American deer and elk. The risks posed to humans from these infectious agents are unknown. For these reasons, continued research into the causes of disease and mechanisms of neurodegeneration are essential. Only by identifying the nature of the TSE infectious agent and how it destroys neurons will effective therapies and pre-mortem diagnostic assays be developed. In order to perform such research, specialised reagents are required. TSE agent strains can only be truly propagated in animals, and such reagents can only be generated or processed in laboratories with specialised facilities. In the UK, three resource centres supply specialised materials for TSE research; the CJD Resource Centre at NIBSC holds tissue from human cases of disease, the TSE Archive at VLA holds an extensive archive of ovine and bovine TSE infected tissues, and the TSE Resource Centre at the Roslin Institute supplies experimental mouse TSE agents, antibodies and cell lines. The provision of material from all three TSE archives is important to sustain TSE research in the UK. In this proposal to The BBR Fund, we are seeking support for the Roslin Institute TSE Resource Centre that will allow its development into a self sustaining resource with improved catalogue and on-line user access. This development will safeguard the future of the TSE Resource Centre and allow the continued supply of high quality reagents produced as a result of the world class TSE research performed by researchers in the Roslin Institute-Neuropathogenesis Division, to the TSE research community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G022666/1","grantId":"BB/G022666/1","fundValue":"282752","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jean  Manson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
