Use of these services has increased the amount and quality of use of census information in research, and in learning and teaching, and reduced the time and effort required to use it by academic users from new undergraduates to seasoned researchers across a broad range of disciplines. Additionally, the CDU provided a range of training that has increased research capacity among academic researchers.\n\nThe CDU also carried out innovative research that has advanced the understanding of UK census datasets and the application of new methods and technologies to their management and dissemination. Some of this research has been enabled using &pound;458,694 of further funding for additional research projects sought and obtained by the CDU. The research carried out by the CDU established it as a centre of expertise within the ESRC recognised by the UK census agencies and other organisations involved in the management and dissemination of census information.

Features include:\n- Matching of zones of one geography (including postcodes) to those of another\n- Population-based reapportionment of data from zones of one geography to zones of another\n- Postcode-related metadata including centroid coordinates, delivery points, etc.\n- Indicators including Indices of Deprivation, and urban/rural and area classifications\n\nInFuse (http://infuse.mimas.ac.uk/) is an outcome of the CDU's research into new data management and dissemination technologies to improve users' ability to find, understand and make use of census aggregate outputs. It offers users simplified search across entire census datasets together with improved integration of data and metadata.\n\nThe additional research projects enabled by the CDU were:\n\nCensus Aggregate Information Resource Demonstrator (CAIRD) project [RES-348-25-0010]\n\nCAIRD2 project [RES-348-25-0023]\n\nCAIRD3 ESRC/ONS 2011 Census Collaboration project [ES/J012505/1] Primarily through continuing use of the services described above that were created and developed by the CDU.
