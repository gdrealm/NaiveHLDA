The aim of this research is to deepen understandings of child protection through focusing on social worker's experiences and methods of doing the work.</p>\n\n<p>The home is by far the most common place where actual child protection work goes on, yet&nbsp; little is known about how social workers behave on home visits, whether or how they interact with children, interview, examine them; or how they relate to parents. New insights will be produced by using qualitative methods of observing social workers doing home visits, audio-recording the social worker-service user encounters in the home and interviews with social workers after the visits about those experiences. Some comparative data will be gathered on how children are related to in other places, such as schools.</p>\n\n<p>The data will provide for the development of theory and effective strategies for negotiating access to the home, how and where to conduct assessments, ensure children are directly engaged with, how to work with parents and intervene to create safety and effect positive change for children.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J006629/1","grantId":"ES/J006629/1","fundValue":"80049","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Harry  Ferguson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
