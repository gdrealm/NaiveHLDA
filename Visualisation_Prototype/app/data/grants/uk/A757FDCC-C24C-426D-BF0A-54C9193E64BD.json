Over 16,000 young people, born in 1989/1990, were tracked between the ages of 13/14 and 19/20. It is the only national longitudinal study focussing on young peopleâ€™s transitions to adulthood and their pathways through the teenage years.</p>\n\n<p>Following a consent-seeking exercise by the DfE, the cohort will be invited to take part in a 45-minute sequential mixed mode survey (involving web, telephone and face-to-face) in 2014/2015 when they will be aged 24/25. A wide range of data linkage consents will be collected, and linkage to administrative data on higher and further education will be carried out as part of this grant. The content of the survey will include education choices, employment, partnership, health, fertility and housing as well as income and finances.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the continuation of this cohort will provide multi-disciplinary longitudinal survey data, and linked administrative data, for a large-scale and nationally representative probability sample of young adults.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000164/1","grantId":"ES/L000164/1","fundValue":"3031120","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lisa  Calderwood","coPersons":["Lorraine Margaret Dearden","Jon  Johnson"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
