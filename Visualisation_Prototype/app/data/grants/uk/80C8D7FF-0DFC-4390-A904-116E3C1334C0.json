He has written popular articles for The Guardian, the New Scientist, The Biologist, Chemistry in Britain, and Biological Sciences Review. He has written commissioned reports for the public about important scientific issues for the Royal Society, the Wellcome Trust and the British Council and selected the shortlist for the New Scientist/Wellcome Trust PhD student popular science essay competition for the last two years. He has given numerous talks about science for the public, most notably the Charles Darwin Award lecture at the British Association Science Festival in 2003. He has been involved in a number of initiatives to introduce school students to science organised by the Wellcome Trust. Thus he is very well placed to communicate future aspects of his research to the general public and explain its potential importance for medicine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500672","grantId":"G0500672","fundValue":"301041","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Parrington","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
