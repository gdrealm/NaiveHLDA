{"id":"B1A8CB35-4D76-4B2E-874E-14B40CB344B9","title":"The Helicobacter pylori-induced regulatory T-cell response","abstractText":"The bacterium (germ) Helicobacter pylori is the main cause of stomach and duodenal ulcers and of stomach cancer. The bacterium is common, but most people who have it never develop either of these conditions and stay entirely well. The infection induces an immune response but this does not usually kill the bacteria, which may persist in the stomach lining for life unless antibiotics are administered. Published data suggest that differences in the type of immune response to H. pylori could protect against or favour the development of ulcers and gastric cancer. Our recent research indicates that immune cells of a suppressive nature (regulatory T-cells) may help to prevent ulceration by reducing inflammation, and these cells might also help the bacteria to remain in the stomach. Our experiments showed that people with peptic ulcers have low levels of regulatory T-cells, and this possibly means that there are insufficient numbers of these cells to prevent the development of severe inflammation of the stomach lining. We now need to prove if reducing the regulatory T-cell response does change the amount of inflammation, by infecting mice and giving a treatment to block their suppressive activity. It is important for us to know more about these suppressive T-cells, how they act, and what induces their production during the immune response. If we have a good understanding of this, we may be able to identify those at risk of developing disease in the future and design effective vaccines. If the work is successful we plan to make the results widely available. Both the University of Nottingham and the MRC inform the press of successful research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601170","grantId":"G0601170","fundValue":"366454","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Robinson","coPersons":["John  Atherton"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
