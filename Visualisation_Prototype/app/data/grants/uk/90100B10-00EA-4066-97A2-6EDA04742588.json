In order for this pain to be relieved we must be able to effectively recognise it and to assess its severity. Although we have made considerable advances in the effective assessment of animal pain our current methods have major limitations that urgently need to be overcome: (1) Effective indicators of pain have been identified for a very limited range of painful procedures in a small number of laboratory animal species, because developing and applying the methods are very time consuming; (2) Current methods may only measure an animals? physical reaction to pain rather than how it makes them ?feel?. In humans, how we feel about our pain is more important than our physical reaction to it; (3) Some routinely used painkillers (e.g. morphine-like drugs) cause changes in commonly used indicators of pain that are similar to those seen in response to pain; (4) We seem to focus on the face of animals when trying to assess their pain, but almost all of the currently used indicators of pain are not observed in the face. \n\nThe assessment of facial expressions exhibited in response to pain may offer a solution to these limitations. Facial expressions are often used in assessments of pain and other emotional states in humans, particularly in those who are unable to communicate verbally (e.g. newborn babies). We will investigate whether facial expressions can effectively be used to measure pain in animals following potentially painful procedures and whether this approach is an improvement on current techniques. We will develop and apply measurement of facial expressions in several different species. We will use it, together with existing methods, to assess the duration and severity of pain after different procedures. We will also test whether facial expressions can be use to evaluate the effectiveness of methods to alleviate pain (e.g. painkiller administration) and to develop and apply more humane endpoints.\n\nInitially we will assess whether facial expressions in mice change following procedures associated with both acute (e.g. post-surgical) and chronic (e.g. cancer) pain. We will then assess whether a similar approach can be used to assess post-surgical pain in rats, rabbits and macaques. It is important to note that we currently have no objective method of assessing post-operative pain in non-human primates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100563/1","grantId":"G1100563/1","fundValue":"247785","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Matthew Clifford Leach","coPersons":["Paul  Flecknell"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
