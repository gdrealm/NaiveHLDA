In Bangladesh, the modernist dream of creating something radically new has been a leitmotif in the various attempts to liberate, develop and transform this part of Bengal. It can be discerned as easily in the politics of donors as in that of its artists. Modernist art practices have been considered particularly politically efficacious and this project focuses on the ideals of modernist art as articulated and practiced by artists within the politics of remaking East Pakistan/Bangladesh.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Exploring the cinema and architecture in particular, I study how ‘cultural activists’ have been at the forefront of important and radical political movements and contests in the new state of East Pakistan that in 1971 became Bangladesh. Exploring struggles around visual arts and cinematic culture as indicative of political contests facing Bangladeshi society in particular, this project will allow me to investigate the relation between modernist ideals and political aspiration in postcolonial society in general.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001000/1","grantId":"ES/K001000/1","fundValue":"174225","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lotte Elisabeth  Hoek","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
