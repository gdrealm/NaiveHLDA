{"id":"AE26DA66-3613-4FF1-9DFF-A5890A633E16","title":"Signal Generator for Antennas Research","abstractText":"The purpose of the proposal is to fund the purchase of a signal generator to support an ongoing, experimental programme of research in antennas and related microwave systems at the Department of Electronics at the University of York. This piece of equipment is needed to facilitate measurements over a wide range of microwave frequencies (to 40 GHz), and to replace an ancient signal generator currently used in the range 26 - 32 GHz. The main research activities which would be supported include a current project investigating multi-beam and scanning lens antennas (with Avanti Communications Ltd and funded through British National Space Centre), and a current project funded privately by the Swiss 'StratXX' consortium developing a stratospheric deployment of wireless networks. Further spin-off benefits include support to student projects (MSc., MEng.) where these entail an experimental, laboratory-based component.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E056571/1","grantId":"EP/E056571/1","fundValue":"23539","fundStart":"2007-06-04","fundEnd":"2010-06-03","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Thornton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
