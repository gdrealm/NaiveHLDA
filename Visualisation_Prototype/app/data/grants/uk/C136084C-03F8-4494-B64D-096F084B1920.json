In official circles, denunciation of Stalin created a need to reaffirm fundamental tenets of Soviet faith (such as collectivism, party-mindedness and love of the motherland), with a particular focus on the upbringing of Soviet youth. Initially a spontaneous and youth-driven pastime, guitar poetry was received with cautious favour by Soviet authorities, who saw it as a genuine expression of the concerns of Soviet youth (if in a raw form requiring professional guidance) and as a potential instrument of cultural-ideological influence. By the early 1960s, however, this favour soured, as individual bards achieved popular stardom and, thanks to dissemination via magnitizdat (home-made tape recordings), songs circulated rapidly and relatively free of censorship. By the late 1960s, a full-scale assault on guitar poetry was underway: individual bards were viciously attacked in the press, and concerts and festivals were banned. By the 1970s the genre was simultaneously suppressed (through persecution of individual bards, on one hand, and critical silence about the genre as a whole, on the other) and co-opted (bards' songs were used in films, on television and in theatrical spectacles, for example). It has long been noted (see Smith 1984) that the majority of bards and the vast majority of songs were apolitical, and also that many bards participated openly in creative life throughout the 1970s and beyond. At the same time, however, a strongly politicised view of guitar poetry persists; and it is reflected in the understanding of increased official hostility as a direct result of songs' lyrics (these being widely accepted as the privileged site of meaning in guitar poetry). This seemingly paradoxical situation--the politically innocuous nature of most songs' lyrics combined with the politically charged response guitar poetry provoked (and continues to provoke)--deserves close scrutiny.\\n\\nThe present project seeks to address this important but hitherto neglected issue, analysing guitar poetry not simply as a means of entertainment or an incarnation of martyred Russian letters, but as a powerful medium of communication, self-fashioning and community-building. The theoretical framework for this project is grounded in marginality theory, which focuses on the peculiarities of 'borderline' social and cultural phenomena. This approach offers a way of viewing guitar poetry's hybridity (its synthesis of literary and musical aspects) and its marginality (its ability to survive and thrive in spatial, cultural and technological 'grey areas') as sites of creative potential and of 'radical possibility' (Hooks); and also as implicit challenges to the Soviet ideological system. The analysis will encompass guitar poetry as a whole, taking in minor and major bards and examining songs in performance as well as in text. Though deemphasised, the role of text will not be ignored, and will be considered alongside issues of context, dissemination, performance and reception that will be foregrounded as key elements in the processes of communication and self-fashioning. By underscoring rather than effacing guitar poetry's complexities and contradictions, this interdisciplinary approach will shed new light on guitar poetry's function in Soviet society of the post-Stalin period, on its vital role in the rehabilitation of the individual and in the shaping of individual personalities after the fall of the 'cult of personality'. By focusing on a genre that is as yet understudied in the West, this project will make an important contribution to the study of non-canonical Russian culture. By drawing on marginality theory, the project will help to bridge the gap between an important body of Western critical theory and Russian cultural studies; and it will also represent an important contribution to the theoretical study of popular culture more broadly.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G006644/1","grantId":"AH/G006644/1","fundValue":"25149","fundStart":"2008-09-22","fundEnd":"2009-01-21","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rachel  Platonov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
