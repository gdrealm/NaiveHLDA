The expeditions of Scott, Amundsen and Shackleton brought to light the importance of technologies to travel. Key decisions - whether to cross the Frozen continent with dogs or ponies - are of course well known, but the use of animals is only one element in the full story of polar technologies. Sleds, motorised tractors, and high performance skis were adopted by later explorers learning from their predecessors.
