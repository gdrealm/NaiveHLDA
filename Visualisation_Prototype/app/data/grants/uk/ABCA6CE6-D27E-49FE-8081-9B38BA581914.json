This interaction \nmay explain the fact that many of the extrasolar planets that have been discovered \noutside of our solar system orbit close to their host stars.\nii) We will use supercomputer simulations to model the atmospheres of giant planets \nin our solar system and in extrasolar systems. These atmospheres display interesting\npatterns of gas flow, and extrasolar planets often orbit close to their stars and so are \nstrongly heated on one side, causing strong winds to arise. The simulations will help \nus better understand these atmospheres.\niii) Using mathematical representations of the laws of physics, we will produce new models\nfor the early evolution of the Universe, shortly after the big-bang, during which time it \nunderwent very rapid expansion known as &quot;inflation&quot;. The models will be compared with \nobservations of the Universe to see which ones are compatible with the data. We will also \nuse mathematical models to examine the late evolution of the Universe to see if there are \nnatural explanations for the observed fact that the Universe's rate of expansion is increasing. \nIn particular, these models will examine whether or not the concept of &quot;dark energy&quot; is \nrequired to explain this accelerated expansion.\niv) We will use computer simulations and mathematical theory to examine the formation of\nblack holes in the early Universe and also supermassive binary black holes that are observed\nat the centres of galaxies.\nv) We will use an observational survey of the Universe being undertaken by the VISTA\ntelescope to search for very distant quasars - galaxies that have supermassive black holes\nat their centres, and which were born when the Universe was less than 10% of its \ncurrent age. We have already discovered the 2nd, 3rd and 4th most distant quasars that\nare known, and the aim is to increase this number to about 14. We will then be able\nto estimate of how many quasars there were when the Universe was very young,\nand we will be able to examine the black holes and the structures of their galaxies.\nvi) We will use supercomputer simulations to examine the evolution of the solar wind - the\nstream of charged particles that is constantly flowing from the Sun into our solar system.\nIn particular, we will examine why this wind develops turbulence as it flows through interplanetary\nspace, and how this turbulence heats the solar wind.\nvii) We will use supercomputer simulations to examine the low density but very high temperature\ngas that lies above the Sun's surface - the solar corona. In particular, we want to understand whether\nor not magnetic fields that pop up out of the Sun in regions called Active Regions can contribute\nto the heating of the solar corona in a significant way.\nviii) We will analyse images from the Cassini spacecraft that is currently orbiting Saturn, to \nexamine how Saturn's moons interact with and disturb Saturn's system of rings. We are \nparticularly interested in the F ring which lies near the outer edge of the ring system, and is \nregularly disturbed by two satellites, Prometheus and Pandora. We will use computer simulations \nto explain the dynamics of this system.\nix) We will attempt to understand more about the formation of the planet Mars. It is believed\nthat the four inner planets of our solar system formed from collisions between smaller bodies\nthat built the planets, and we will use computer simulations to examine this process. We will\nexamine whether a collision can explain why Mars has a crust that is thicker in the southern \nhemisphere than in the north, and we will examine the formation of Mars' m","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M001202/1","grantId":"ST/M001202/1","fundValue":"1237640","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2019-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Paul Nelson","coPersons":["Karim Ali Malik","Carl  Murray","Reza  Tavakol","Craig Bruce Agnor","Sijme-Jan  Paardekooper","David  Burgess","Timothy  Clifton"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
