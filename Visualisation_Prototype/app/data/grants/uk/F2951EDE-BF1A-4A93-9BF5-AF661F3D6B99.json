Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) is one of the commonest indications for referral to a gynaecologist. Management typically involves invasive surgery. Current medical treatment options are often associated with side effects such as unscheduled breakthrough bleeding. We still do not know why some women experience problematic menstrual bleeding. Enhancement of our understanding of the mechanism of normal menstruation will provide an opportunity to identify novel targets for potential therapeutic development. Our proposal aims to examine the cascade of events that occur in cells of the womb-lining (endometrium) and triggered by withdrawal of the hormone, progesterone (P). This occurs at the end of each monthly cycle prior to a period or as a consequence of treatment with long-acting progestogen treatment, such as the levonorgestrel- intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). As a consequence of P-withdrawal, enzymes that are involved in the manufacture of substances known as prostaglandins (PGs) are increased in cells of the endometrium. In turn, other factors in these cells are also switched on. In the context of our study we wish to study the factors that switch on production of the molecule, HIF-1alpha and as a result the end products of this cascade that orchestrate blood vessel growth and repair in the endometrium; both necessary events to prepare for the next menstrual cycle. Further if these events are disturbed abnormal menstrual bleeding is a likely consequence. We therefore will seek participation from women attending with menstrual complaints and ask to examine small samples of the endometrium from these patients for molecular and cellular studies. Information about these molecular and cellular pathways will help us identify points in the pathway which could be new targets for treatment, especially if these treatments could be delivered directly to the uterus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600048","grantId":"G0600048","fundValue":"487225","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Hilary Octavia Critchley","coPersons":["Henry  Jabbour","Nik  Hirani"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
