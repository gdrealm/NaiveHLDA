The most common process for manufacturing plastic bottles is Injection Stretch Blow Moulding (ISBM), which is primarily used to manufacture Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles for the carbonated soft drink (CSD) and water industries, a global market estimated to grow to &pound;57 billion by 2017. Due to environmental concerns and the volatility of resin cost, there is a continual drive to lightweight these containers. However in order to do this manufacturers lack scientific instrumentation that can provide quantifiable data on the manufacturability of preforms and on the subsequent mechanical properties of the bottles they manufacture. This research program will address this issue by developing a novel instrument that will integrate technology in modelling, instrumentation and image analysis that will form the basis for a new approach for the industry towards preform/bottle design, material analysis and quality control. The technology will lead to downstream impacts through innovative manufacturing, including more efficient, customised machines for injecting preforms and blowing bottles for a range of new materials. With better understanding of the impact of processing conditions on preform manufacturability and bottle performance it can be expected that lightweight containers can be developed in shorter times. This will bring environmental and societal impact through reduced material, energy and transport and economic impact through businesses producing cheaper containers and through sales of a new instrument.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M020851/1","grantId":"EP/M020851/1","fundValue":"748791","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gary  Menary","coPersons":["Peter James Martin"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
