{"id":"BDFEAF20-AD17-4814-8F05-EF4C3CE3A23D","title":"High temperature In-situ Monitoring of Power Station Steels using Electromagnetic Sensors - POWEREMS","abstractText":"There are currently no techniques available to monitor the microstructural condition of power station steel components in-service (i.e. at elevated temperatures). This problem will become more acute as coal-fuelled power stations are being developed to operate at higher pressures and temperatures to provide greater efficiency; supercritical power stations could produce output efficiencies of 45 to 50 %, compared to subcritical power stations with efficiencies of 30 to 35 %. Operation at 620 deg C is now possible, with further temperature increases to 700 deg C planned by the year 2014. Supercritical power stations also emit up to 25 % less carbon dioxide into the environment (a one percent increase in efficiency gives a two percent drop in emissions such as carbon dioxide, and nitrogen and sulphur oxides). Currently the condition of power station components is monitored during shut down periods, when insulating lagging layers are removed and replicas from the component surface are made. These replicas are examined to determine the microstructural state (degree of degradation, e.g. through carbide population changes) and whether creep cavitation has initiated. Components are removed from service and replaced when end of predicted service life is reached or significant cavitation is detected. However, as the component condition can only be checked during a scheduled shut down period, sections are often replaced prematurely. If failure of a component occurs the economic impact is severe (an unplanned shutdown is estimated to cost approximately 1.5M per day per power station) and there is potentially significant risk to life and the environment. The proposed project is to investigate the potential of a multi-frequency electromagnetic (EM) sensor system for monitoring microstructural changes in power generation steels (e.g. boiler plate and pipe) due to high temperature exposure and creep for both in-service monitoring and evaluation during maintenance periods. The work will involve development of a sensor system for long term use at elevated temperatures, and analysis and modelling of sensor signals relative to microstructural changes in the steels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H023429/1","grantId":"EP/H023429/1","fundValue":"358553","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The results have been used in interpreting the EM signal from pipeline samples and developing a technique that can distinguish between correctly and incorrectly heat treated material.

Electromagnetic (EM) sensors are sensitive to relatively small microstructural changes in steels during service at high temperatures. \n\n2. Quantitative relationships between individual microstructural parameters e.g. grain size, phase balance and electromagnetic properties of steels have been established, which provides guidance for prediction / evaluation of microstructures from EM sensor signals.\n\n3. Quantitative relationships between EM properties and EM sensor signals of steels through experimental measurements and finite element modelling.\n\n4. Determinant microstructural features to electromagnetic properties of steels of complex microstructures have been identified, which enables interpretation of EM sensor signals into specific microstructural feature changes.\n\n5. Fundamental evidence based on magnetic domain theory and direct observation of interaction between microstructural features and magnetic domain wall movements in applied magnetic fields has been found to support the above findings and provide theoretical basis for further development / improvements of EM sensors. \n\n6. Qualitative correlation between various microstructural features and magnetic properties has been established, which enables selective evaluation of different microstructural features of interests using EM sensors in different applied fields.
