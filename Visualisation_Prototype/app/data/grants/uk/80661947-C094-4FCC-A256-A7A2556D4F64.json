This project addresses this question by bringing together a variety of organisations to pilot innovative approaches to support diverse entrepreneurs (ie, ethnic minorities, women, and young people).</p>\n\n<p>This unique collaboration will work in action learning sets to pioneer new ways of promoting development and growth of diverse SMEs through imaginative and productive relationships with large firms and private and public business service and finance providers.</p>\n\n<p>The participants include senior staff from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Barclays, Business in the Community</li>\n\n <li>The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA)</li>\n\n <li>A.

The lessons learnt will be captured and recommendations made on the wider applicability of the approach. Further, with the active involvement of key partners there are clearly identifiable mechanisms to ensure that the knowledge, networks and impacts accruing from the project are sustained and built upon.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I002898/1","grantId":"ES/I002898/1","fundValue":"68826","fundStart":"2011-01-04","fundEnd":"2012-01-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kiran  Trehan","coPersons":["Monder  Ram"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
