{"id":"73024DAD-8A6A-4B93-91DC-749125C723E7","title":"Cosmic rays in the multi-phase interstellar medium with dynamo-generated magnetic fields","abstractText":"Cosmic rays are relativistic particles (e.g. protons, heavier atomic nuclei and electrons) that propagate through space. Since cosmic rays carry an electric charge, these particles can interact with any magnetic fields that are present. It is believed that supernova explosions in the interstellar medium not only accelerate cosmic rays, but also lead to turbulent flows that drive dynamo action in galaxies. It is now well known that dynamo action of this type produces a complex magnetic field distribution, with very specific properties. The aim of this research is to explore the ways in which cosmic rays interact with the turbulent magnetic fields in the interstellar medium. Using detailed numerical simulations of dynamo action in a realistic local model of the interstellar medium we will explore the ways in which the cosmic ray distribution depends upon the properties of the interstellar gas (density, magnetic field, etc.). Existing propagation and diffusion models of cosmic ray particles rely on outdated models of magnetic fields, which take no account of the fact that these magnetic fields are the product of dynamo action due to supernova-driven turbulence. The gyration of cosmic rays around magnetic fields leads to synchrotron emission, which is one of the main observables in radio astronomy. We intend to use our numerical data to construct synthetic synchrotron maps of galaxies. Hence this project aims to bridge the gaps between radio astronomy, cosmic ray physics, dynamo theory and the physics of the interstellar medium.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L005549/1","grantId":"ST/L005549/1","fundValue":"197218","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-16","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The postdoctoral researcher who is employed on this grant only started in March 2014, so our measurable impact at this stage is relatively limited. However, our work on cosmic rays and the interstellar medium play a central role in our outreach activities. Newcastle University, in partnership with two local museums, is taking part in Phase 2 of the large national Explore Your Universe (EYU) public engagement programme, organised by STFC and the Association for Science and Discovery Centres. One of the project members is the academic lead for EYU at Newcastle and two members of the team have already attended public engagement training sessions run by the national EYU team. In addition, all members of this research project have agreed to help in running the planned activities, in particular School Masterclasses and Workshops and Meet the Expert days in the museums. At these events our research on cosmic rays and their role in the interstellar medium is linked to hands-on experiments and demonstrations, such as a cloud chamber and infra-red camera, to enthuse the public about physics. We have already participated in some events of this type over the last 12 months and we expect to engage with over 7,000 school pupils and members of the public over the next year.

These magnetic fields are generated by a complex dynamo process in which kinetic energy from turbulent motions is converted into magnetic energy. Our aim is to study the ways in which cosmic rays interact with realistic, dynamo-generated magnetic fields. The dynamo process is a very interesting problem in its own right, and we have developed and studied various models over the last twelve months, clarifying (for example) the inner workings of mean-field models of the large-scale galactic dynamo. On scales that are comparable to that of the underlying turbulence, the magnetic field is highly disordered but still dynamo-generated. Simulations of charged particles have been used to study the propagation of cosmic rays through turbulent magnetic fields of this type - we have used these simulations to extract cosmic ray diffusion coefficients that we can then use in our realistic continuum model of the interstellar medium. Initial results from this process are extremely promising. Finally, we have studied the dynamical influence of cosmic rays upon a magnetically-driven buoyancy instability (which is enhanced by the cosmic ray pressure). We have used simulations of this process to generate synthetic Faraday rotation maps that compare very favourably to real galactic observations. The project still has a few months left to run, but we have met our planned objectives during the first period of the grant. The postdoctoral researcher who is employed on this grant only started in March, so it is too early to be commenting on specifics. However, observers have already started to show an interest in our results, and we hope to develop new collaborations based on this. Certainly we would expect our findings to be of relevance to LOFAR, SKA etc. Our intention is to disseminate our findings widely, by publishing in highly regarded international journals as well as by participating in national and international conferences. We are also heavily involved in outreach activities and have already started to use some of our research on galactic magnetism and cosmic rays in this context. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
