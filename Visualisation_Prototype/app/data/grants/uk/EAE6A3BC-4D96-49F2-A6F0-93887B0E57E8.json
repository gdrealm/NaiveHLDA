The emergence of nanoscience as a scientific discipline has been driven by the relentless quest by the electronic device industry over the past four decades for ever-faster chips. The importance of miniaturisation is not just in the fact that smaller devices can be packed more closely together, however: when objects become very small indeed, they sometimes acquire entirely new properties that larger objects formed from the same materials do not normally exhibit. Catalysts have been used for over a century to accelerate chemical reactions, and many catalysts consist of metal particles supported on ceramics. For several decades, catalytic converters in car exhausts have used metallic nanoparticles - particles a few billionths of a metre in size - to clean the exhaust gas because the catalytic activity has been found to be dramatically increased by the small size of the active metal. When semiconductors are formed into structures of the same size, they acquire entirely new optical properties purely as a consequence of their small size - for example, they glow brightly when stimulated by electrical current, and the colour of the light emitted is determined by the size of the particle (and can thus be controlled with high precision). These phenomena are referred to as low-dimensional ones: they are new, unexpected phenomena that result only from the small size of the active objects.There is a very important sense in which biological objects may also be said to be low-dimensional. Cells are tiny objects that are driven by processes that involve small numbers of molecules. Biologists have recognised that single molecules are quite different from large groups of molecules, and there has therefore been a lot of interest in studying them, because they may help us to understand much better how larger systems work. However, there are no established tools for building systems of interacting single molecules, what might be called low-dimensional systems . New tools are required to achieve this, and the goal of this programme will be to develop them.We wish to build a synthetic low-dimensional system, which will incorporate biological molecules and synthetic models for them, that replicates the photosynthetic pathway of a bacterium. Photosynthesis is the basis for all life on earth, so it has fundamental importance. However, there are important other motivations for studying the marvellously efficient processes by which biological organisms collect sunlight and use it to live, grow and reproduce. The current concerns about shortage of fossil fuels, and the problems associated with the carbon dioxide produced by burning them, make solar energy a highly attractive solution to many pressing problems. To best exploit the huge amount of solar energy that falls on the earth, even in colder climates like the UK, we may do well to learn from Nature. By building a ship-based system that replicates the photosynthetic behaviour of a biological organism, we will gain new insights into how Natural photosynthesis works. More than that, however, we will develop entirely new, biologically-inspired design principles that may be useful in understanding many other scientific and engineering problems. At a fundamental level, biological systems work quite differently from electronic devices: they are driven by complex signals, they are fuzzy and probabilistic, where microsystems are based on binary logic and are precisely determined. The construction of a functioning low-dimensional system that replicates a cellular pathway will require the adoption, in a man-made structure, of these very different design principles. If we can achieve this it may yield important new insights into how similar principles could be applied to other technologies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I012060/1","grantId":"EP/I012060/1","fundValue":"4050180","fundStart":"2010-12-15","fundEnd":"2016-06-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Leggett","coPersons":["Stephen  Evans","Jamie  Hobbs","Neil  Hunter","Mark  Geoghegan","Steven  Armes"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" Workpackages (WP) 1-3, focused on &quot;technology development&quot;, occupied the majority of our effort during the first half of the project. Many of the milestones represent significant advances in the state of the art; inevitably, for such challenging work, there have been setbacks. Technology development can be slow, particularly when working at the limits of current capability. Some problems have also resulted from the loss of key staff. However, during the last year, our progress has accelerated and, for WP 1-3, is now close to that envisaged in the original work plan. Examples include the following.\no Construction of a new near-field microscope for nanolithography and the development of new patterning methodologies proceeded more slowly than expected. There were many technical problems that had to be solved, but substantial progress has been made in the last six months. We now have robust methodologies with excellent reproducibility that can be deployed to address WP 4-6.\no Initially, the development of polymer brush supports for supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) proved challenging. However, following a concerted effort over the last few months, suitable materials have been identified and this no longer appears to be an insurmountable technical problem. As a precautionary measure, we have also developed a parallel stream of work based around the formation of SLBs on non-polymeric supports, to mitigate the technical risk.\nWork on WP 4 and WP 5 is now in advance of our original expectations at the mid-way point of the grant. Thus, judged in its entirety, our research programme is approximately on track. However, because WP 1-3 are yet to be completed, there has been some delay in published outputs. We expect this backlog to be corrected in the next six months, although we always expected that the publication profile of the project would be much stronger in the second half of the grant period.\nIntegration\nFertile collaboration across traditional disciplinary boundaries has been extremely important. There has been a significant (and still growing) amount of inter-laboratory mobility by researchers, and all researchers have embraced the cross-disciplinary ethos of the programme with enthusiasm. The following illustrations are based around tripartite collaborations:\no Nanoscale patterns formed from membrane proteins (C?rtron, Hunter) using near-field lithography (Ducker, Leggett) are being characterised by probe microscopy (Mullin, Hobbs);\no Diffusion of novel engineered proteins (Grayson, Hunter) is being studied in Brownian ratchets (Bao, Evans) prepared using novel lithographic techniques (Johnson, Leggett)\no Bacteriorhodopsin (C?rtron, Hunter) is being used to functionalise polymer nanostructures (Chapman, Leggett) and drive nanomechanical change (Hobbs).\nThere are many examples of bipartite collaborations (see Technical Annexe). The majority of work being carried out now relies upon collaboration between two or more investigators from different disciplines, and a substantial fraction of this involves collaboration between three or more groups. It is expected that such interactions will deepen as the project progresses. This Programme grant has thus been critical in enabling us to assemble a network of interconnected collaborations. At the moment, the grant is in progress and it is too early to say. Electronics,Energy,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
