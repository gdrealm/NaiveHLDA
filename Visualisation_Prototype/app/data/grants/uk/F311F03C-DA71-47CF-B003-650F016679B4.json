Policies enhancing school choice may contradict public health efforts to promote walking and cycling. Equally, the built form, urban structure and the local housing markets may determine school travel behaviour, encouraging excess commuting with implications for environmental sustainability and public transport provision.<br /><br />This study will exploit secondary data from Ordnance Survey, HM Land Registry, the Pupil Census, and British Household Panel Survey to examine how the built environment and residential housing markets relate to families’ choices about schools and school travel in a selected case study locality (Sheffield). Spatial analysis techniques will be used to construct spatial measures of the built form (eg density, accessibility and pedestrian ‘permeability’), to classified neighbourhoods by housing market characteristics, and to model the pattern of pupils’ home-school journeys. The generalisability of the findings using BHPS data will be examined.&nbsp; <br /><br />The research will produce outputs tailored to national and local policymakers and practitioners: Local education planners will understand better accessibility to school for different population groups. Land-use and transport planners will be able to understand better the relationships between schools, housing and transport and journey behaviour</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K003720/1","grantId":"ES/K003720/1","fundValue":"144777","fundStart":"2013-04-08","fundEnd":"2015-01-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward Terence Ferrari","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" Project does not complete until January 2014.
