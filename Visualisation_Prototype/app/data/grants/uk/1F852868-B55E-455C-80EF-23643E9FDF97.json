The Background: The green peach aphid (GPA) Myzus persicae, an agronomically important pest worldwide, can colonize over 400 different plant species from more than 50 plant families and holds the world record of insecticide resistance mechanisms, showing resistance to at least 70 different synthetic compounds. Moreover, GPA is remarkably plastic such that one clone consisting of genetically identical females can survive and reproduce on a wide range of plant species. This is in contrast to majority of other aphid species, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), which has adapted to one or a few related plant species within one plant family.\n\n2. The Big Questions: What are the genetic control mechanisms that underlie the phenotypic plasticity of GPA? Is this plasticity related to GPA ability to evolve insecticide resistance to at least 70 different synthetic compounds in the last 60 years, i.e. an &quot;evolutionary blink-of-an-eye&quot;?\n\n3. The Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the phenotypic plasticity of GPA is due to its (1) genomic adaptations in the form of the expansion of certain multigene families that are important for virulence, in combination with (2) epigenetic regulation affecting gene expression levels of gene family members. Depending on exposure to plant hosts and pesticides, certain members within gene families are differentially up or down-regulated, providing the parasite with a versatile &quot;genetic toolbox&quot;.\n\n4. The Supportive Data: The Hogenhout lab has developed research tools for GPA clone &quot;O&quot;, which has predominated in the UK, causing damage to diverse crops in recent years. We maintain this clone as genetically identical females that can survive and reproduce on diverse plant species, including for example Chinese cabbage and tobacco plants, which produce different defense compounds that are toxic to aphids. The GPA clone O whole genome sequence is currently being assembled and annotated using gene expression data. We have evidence that members of specific gene families, such as cathepsins and cuticular proteins, play a role in the phenotypic adaptation of GPA to plant species. We are also interested in cytochrome 450 monooxygenases (P450s), which are detoxification enzymes of organic substances such as phytochemicals and pesticides. Finally, we have developed the plant-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) technology enabling studies of the effect of the knock down of specific GPA genes on GPA survival and reproduction on various plant species.\n\n5. The Objectives:\n\nIn the first objective we will advance the construction of a physical genomic map, identify coding sequences and conduct evolutionary analysis of gene family members of GPA clone O. \n\nIn the second objective we will assess which genes are differentially regulated in GPA clone O reared on different plant species and exposed to various pesticides. We will also sequence the genomes of additional GPA clones that are susceptible and resistant to pesticides and determine if differentially expressed genes are subject to high mutation frequencies. \n\nIn the third objective we use plant-mediated RNAi to knock down the expression of specific genes to assess their effect on the ability of GPA to survive on different plant species and upon insecticide exposure. We will assess if DNA methylation is involved in GPA phenotypic plasticity. \n\n6. The Implications: At completion of this project we will have gained a better understanding of how GPA adapts to multiple plant species and if this relates to mechanisms involved in the development of insecticide resistance of GPA. We will also have elucidated the level of genomic variation amongst GPA clones susceptible and resistant to pesticides. This research is fundamentally important to our overall understanding of how insect adapt to their environments. Ultimately, this could have practical implications for the increasing problem of the evolution of insecticide resistance in crop-pest control.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L001985/1","grantId":"BB/L001985/1","fundValue":"276863","fundStart":"2014-03-03","fundEnd":"2017-03-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Summary\n\nUnfortunately, with current agricultural practices, insecticide resistance is inevitable. This, coupled with changes in the regulatory landscape in the EU on pesticide usage, has resulted in the neonicotinoids class of pesticides being one of the few control methods left that successfully controls sap-feeding insects; as such their use is expanding. Sucking pests are increasingly becoming a major secondary pest problem in Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops, which are not effective against hemipteran herbivores. Due to their wide plant host range, the green peach aphid\n(GPA) Myzus persicae is particularly destructive. Moreover, several geographically distinct GPA clones tolerant to neonicotinoids have been isolated all of which have up-regulated genes and enhanced metabolism. If we can understand, not only the specific genes involved in resistance development, but also the mechanisms by which the expression of these genes are regulated, we can make better assessments of resistance risk, design smarter methods for monitoring and managing resistance and develop more effective practical solutions for insect control.\n\nThis project is an Industrial Partnership Award (IPA) with Syngenta, UK.\n\nThis project will impact society at several levels: (A) Interactions among science disciplines; (B) Collaboration with industry; (C) Training of young scientists; (D) Communication of science to international science communities; and (E) Engagement with the general public.\n\n\n(A) Interactions among science disciplines\n\nWe are having monthly meetings (first Wednesday of the month) with all Norwich team members [David Swarbreck, Thomas Mathers, Yazhou Chen, Sam Mugford (RA in Hogenhout lab), Cock van Oosterhout and Saskia Hogenhout] to discuss project progress.\n\n\n(B) Collaboration with industry\n\nColleagues at Syngenta (Julia Bristow and Andrew Crossthwaite) came visit the John Innes Centre to discuss project progress (Friday 5 Sept., 2014).\n\nWe have agreed with Julia and Andrew to sequence the genomes of two GPA clones (from Spain and France) that have resistance to neonicotinoids and are relevant for Syngenta.

Sequence and annotate the genome of GPA\n2. Identify GPA gene families involved in adaptation to plants and insecticides\n3. Assess the role of specific gene families in GPA adaptation to plants and insecticides\n\n\nAchievements so far (4 Nov, 2014):\n\nGenome assemblies and annotations of GPA clone O and G006 were frozen and made available to the scientific community via AphidBase (http://www.aphidbase.com/Myzus-DB). \n\nAnalyses of orthologous gene clusters among insects with complete genome sequences have started. Gene families that may have expanded/contracted in GPA versus pea aphid and other insect species have been identified and are further analyzed.\n\nA first draft of a manuscript reporting the GPA genome sequence has been generated and is being used to further fine-tune analyses and focus on specific experiments. \n\nYazhou started to rear GPA colonies on 10 different plant species and is analyzing their survival and reproduction rates. DNA and RNA extraction procedures have been optimized. Large-scale sampling of GPAs for RNA-seq and BS-seq experiments will start soon. The genome assemblies and annotations of GPA clone O and G006 genomes are available for downloading by the scientific community worldwide.\n\nThree powerpoint presentations of progress made with the genome assemblies and annotations of GPA genomes of clone O and G006 (prepared by David Swarbreck), gene (family) orthology and phylogenetic analyses (prepared by Thomas Mathers) and GPA colony performance analyses on various plant host species (prepared by Yazhou Chen) presented at the meeting with Syngenta on Friday 5 Sept., 2014 were made available to Syngenta colleagues via a Dropbox link along with the meeting minutes.
