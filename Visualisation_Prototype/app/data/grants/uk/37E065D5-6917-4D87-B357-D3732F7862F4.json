This group will lead a research programme with two broad objectives:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to develop and test cross-disciplinary models of human behaviour and behaviour change</li>\n\n <li>to draw out their implications for the formulation and evaluation of public policy. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Foundational research will focus on three inter-related themes:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>understanding individual behaviour and behaviour change</li>\n\n <li>understanding social and interactive behaviour</li>\n\n <li>rethinking the foundations of policy analysis.&nbsp; </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The project will explore implications of the basic science for policy via a series of applied projects connecting naturally with the three themes. These will include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the determinants of consumer credit behaviour</li>\n\n <li>the formation of social values</li>\n\n <li>strategies for evaluation of policies affecting health and safety.&nbsp; </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research will integrate theoretical perspectives from multiple disciplines and utilise a wide range of complementary methodologies including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>theoretical modeling of individuals, groups and complex systems</li>\n\n <li>conceptual analysis; lab and field experiments</li>\n\n <li>analysis of large data sets. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Network will promote high quality cross-disciplinary research and serve as a policy forum for understanding behaviour and behaviour change.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002201/1","grantId":"ES/K002201/1","fundValue":"3054750","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Starmer","coPersons":["Robin Patrick Cubitt","Daniel  Read","Nick  Chater","Abigail  Barr","Uwe  Aickelin","Simon  Gaechter","Robert Sinclair MacKay","Shaun  Hargreaves-Heap","Theodore Louis Turocy","Enrique  Fatas","Daniel John  Zizzo","Gordon  Brown","Anders  Poulsen","Martin  Sefton","John Peter Gathergood","Graham  Loomes","Robert  Sugden","Neil  Stewart"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
