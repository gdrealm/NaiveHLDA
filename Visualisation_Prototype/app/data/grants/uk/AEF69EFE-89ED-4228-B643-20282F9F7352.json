This computing power is spread over large central clusters (Tier-1) and based in individual University departments (Tier-2). Hundreds of thousands of computers will be needed. Everything is connected together using the Internet and jobs are run automatically in such a way that the computers are used in the most efficient manner.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I000097/1","grantId":"ST/I000097/1","fundValue":"128122","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The findings have improved the knowledge of the fundamental parameters of the universe.
