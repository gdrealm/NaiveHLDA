The EPSRC final report form in Je-S system has been completed. This short report summarises the major achievements of this project and how the benefits of this project will be utilised in the future. \n\nBackground\n\n--------------------\n\nThe project was initially conceived to obtain fundamental insight and develop high fidelity Flame Surface Density (FSD) based reaction rate closure for turbulent premixed flames based on a-priori analysis of DNS data. Although FSD closures are relatively well established for Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations, they are relatively rare for LES, and no detailed evaluation of their performance was done so far. In this project, FSD based reaction rate closures for both RANS and LES have been been developed and simultaneously assessed by a-priori analyses of explicitly filtered Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data, and a-posteriori evaluations of model performance in actual LES, in a number of configurations for which experimental data is available. The models have been proposed so that they account for fundamental physics of flame propagation and scalar gradient alignment statistics along with the influences of Damkohler, Karlovitz, turbulent Reynolds and global Lewis numbers on these statistics. This ensures that the newly proposed models remain valid for both the corrugated flamelets and thin reaction zones regimes. The performances of these models have been assessed based on a-priori analysis of three-dimensional DNS data. The best models identified based on a-priori analysis have been implemented in actual LES simulations in order to carry out a-posteriori analyses of the models in a number of configurations for which experimental data is available in comparison to LES simulation results. Development of high-fidelity FSD-based reaction rate closure will provide a reliable Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based design tool for clean and cost-effective combustion devices where combustion takes place in the premixed mode (e.g. in Spark Ignition/ Direct Injection engines, Lean Premixed Pre-vaporised (LPP) or industrial gas turbine combustors).\n\n\n\nAchievements\n\n----------------------\n\n1. Development of a three-dimensional DNS database of freely propagating statistically planar turbulent premixed flames for different values of root-mean-square turbulent velocity fluctuation, global Lewis number and integral length scales of turbulent velocity fluctuations for a range of different values of turbulent Reynolds number. This provides wealth of important information, which can be used for the purpose of assessing existing FSD-based models and develop new models in the context of RANS and LES. The database developed during the course of this project will continue to be a very useful source of information for gaining fundamental understanding, and for model development, beyond the duration of this project.\n\n2. The performance of the existing algebraic LES-FSD models have been assessed in detail based on a-priori analysis of DNS data for different values of global Lewis number [1,2] and turbulent Reynolds number [3]. The existing models that are the best suited for predicting the FSD in the context of LES have been identified, and a new power-law based algebraic model has been proposed in such as manner so that the effects of Karlovitz, turbulent Reynolds and Lewis numbers on fractal dimension of flame surface and inner cut-off scale obtained from DNS data are explicitly accounted for [1-3]. \n\n3. The statistical behaviours of the different terms of the FSD transport equation have been analysed in detail based on explicitly filtered/Reynolds averaged DNS data [4-6]. Models have been proposed for all the unclosed terms for the transport equation of FSD in the context of RANS and LES based on a-priori analysis of DNS data [4-16]. \n\n4. The models for the tangential strain rate term of the FSD transport equation have been proposed for both LES and RANS in such a manner that the effects of Lewis number and turbulent Reynolds number on local alignment of scalar gradient with principle strain rates are explicitly accounted for, both in corrugated flamelets and thin reaction zones regime combustion [7,15,16]. The validity of these newly proposed models have been substantiated with respect to the tangential strain rate term extracted from explicitly Reynolds averaged/LES filtered DNS data. \n\n5. The models for the curvature term of the FSD transport equation have been proposed for both LES and RANS in such a manner that the effects of curvature on local flame displacement and the influences of Lewis and turbulent Reynolds numbers on this dependence are explicitly accounted for both in corrugated flamelets and thin reaction zones regime combustion [8-14].\n\n6. The effects of turbulent Reynolds number and global Lewis number on the statistics of flame displacement speed and its components in turbulent premixed flames have been analysed in detail [5,8,10,12,14,17,18]. The methodology of extracting actual three-dimensional displacement speed from two-dimensional experimental measurements has also been assessed based on DNS-based analysis [17]. \n\n7. The methodology for obtaining actual three-dimensional Reynolds averaged FSD and the terms of its transport equation from their two-dimensional counterparts, which can be measured experimentally with relative ease, has been devised in the course of this project [19]. The effects of regime of combustion, turbulent Reynolds number and Lewis number on the validity of the aforementioned methodology have been analysed in detail [19].\n\n8. Novel modelling methodologies for turbulent transport of FSD and surface-filtered displacement speed have been devised in this analysis, which accounts for Lewis number effects and local stretch rate dependence of flame propagation.\n\n9. The newly developed models have been implemented in an actual LES code, which has been eventually used for the a-posteriori assessments of the newly proposed models, and for the substantiation of their validity in collaboration with Prof. A. M. Kempf's research group (presently based at University of Duisburg, Germany, and earlier based at Imperial College London until 2011) [20, 21].\n\nIn addition, the models and findings have been shared with the Combustion Research Group in Cambridge University (especially with Prof. R. Stewart Cant, and Dr. N. Swaminathan) and Prof. A. M. Kempf's research group (presently based at University of Duisburg, Germany) who are also engaged in computational modelling of turbulent premixed combustion. The progress made during the project was also communicated to Ford, Rolls Royce and Siemens Plcs. and Electricity Supplies Research (ESR) network.\n\n\n\nFuture work\n\n--------------------\n\nA number of projects are already in motion to exploit the achievements of this project.\n\n1. The fundamental understanding and modelling insight ganined from this project is current contributing to the development of scalar dissipation rate based reaction rate closure in the context of LES in an ongoing EPSRC research project (entitled &amp;quot;Large Eddy Simulation modelling of scalar dissipation rate based reaction rate closure in turbulent premixed flames&amp;quot;, ESPRC Ref: EP/1028013/1).\n\n2.The PhD student, Mr. Mohit Katragadda, who worked on this project, is in the process of applying for funding for postdoctoral research and if his application is successful he will be looking into LES modelling of turbulent premixed flames using DNS database in noncanonical configurations (e.g. V-flame configuration) with detailed chemistry. \n\n3. Three papers on curvature and strain rate term modelling of the FSD transport equation are under preparation and will be submitted to reputed journals for publication. A part of this work will be presented in the European Combustion Meeting 2013. A paper has also been submitted to the International Colloquium of Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems 2013 (ICDERS2013).\n\n4.The research team of Principal Investigator (PI) is in the process of assessing the newly developed models using actual LES simulations in different configurations. The PI is also in the process of communicating the research outcomes to the colleagues in industrial sector (e.g. Ford, Rolls Royce, Siemens Plcs.) so that the research outcomes can be assimilated in an industrial set-up relatively rapidly.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n-------------------\n\n1 M.

The major beneficiaries of this work are Internal Combustion (IC) engine and gas turbine manufacturers, who are engaged in developing new concepts for low-pollution and high-efficiency engines. The design process of combustion equipment in both sectors depends heavily on the predictive capability of engineering CFD calculations. In the UK, Ford as an IC engine manufacturer, and Rolls Royce and Siemens Plcs. as gas turbine manufacturers, have shown interest in the outcome of this work on RANS and LES modelling of premixed combustion. Moreover, the Electricity Supplies Research (ESR) network was also involved in project meetings and the model developments during the course of this project. However, the benefits are not limited to the above-mentioned UK manufacturers, as all automotive manufacturers have a program on Spark Ignition (SI) engines, and all gas turbine manufacturers are interested in LPP combustors. The relevant industrial partners were made aware of the developments that took place in this research during interactions at the aforementioned international conferences and UK based meetings. The present fundamental findings concerning turbulent stratified combustion will be of immediate value to all the industries mentioned above. \n\n\n\nDuring the course of this project, Newcastle University has generated new expertise, which will help its scientific base and attract industrial interest. Finally, CFD software companies, who will be able to incorporate state-of-the-art combustion models in their codes and thereby increase their market penetration, will also be interested in the project outcome. Finally, the PhD student (Mr. Mohit Katragadda) is one of the direct beneficiaries of this work, who used this opportunity to work in this project to become a fine researcher with the potential to actively contribute to the UK and international turbulent combustion research in an independent manner in the future years. During the course of this project Mr. Katragadda received thorough training on turbulence, combustion theories, fluid dynamics, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and high performance computing. Mr. Katragadda collaborated with colleagues based at Imperial College London, and presented his work in a number of progress meetings and conferences, thus enabling him to develop a number of important transferable skills, which will help him immensely in his future assignments. 1.
