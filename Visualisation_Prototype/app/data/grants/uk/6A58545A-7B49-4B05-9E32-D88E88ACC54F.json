Unlike mammals, plants are (1) sessile and have developed adaptive responses to cope with changes in the environment, and (2) are photoautotrophic and therefore synthesise all the necessary macromolecules which have to be efficiently sent to the relevant compartments/destinations in the cell to meet requirements for growth and development. Cells contain intricate scaffolds (cytoskeleton) upon which compartments (organelles) move along with the aid of molecular motors (myosins) to reach their destination in the cell. This process is analogous to the intricate road network throughout the country; vehicles travelling along the motorway is similar to the 'super highway' in cells where cytoplasmic streaming takes place and organelles can move at impressive speeds up to 5-6 microns/second (analogous to an Olympic sprinter running 40kmph), and the smaller byroads and streets are indicative of slower organelle movement where they appear to meander around in a small area within the cell. Organelle movement in the cell is very dynamic and appears almost chaotic and random. However, this apparent disorder is altered upon pathogen invasion where certain organelles appear to cluster around the site of invasion. Also, certain metabolic pathways span several organelles (e.g. photorespiration and the glyoxylate cycle), and these organelles appear to lie close to one another. It was suggested that location/movement of organelles in these instances is to allow a quick and efficient release of components to combat invasion / metabolism, but this has never been experimentally proven. Our model organism is Arabidopsis which contains 17 myosin genes. Over the past 2 years we have shown that mutant forms of six myosin motors appear to indiscriminately control the movement of all types of organelle. By using microscopy of living cells which have fluorescently tagged organelles and mutant forms of myosin, we will be able to understand which parts of the myosin are required for (1) recruitment to the organelle surface and (2) effect movement. A screen for the proteins (signals) involved in recruiting myosins to the organelle surface and mediating the motors' effect on organelle movement will also be undertaken. We have already successfully developed several analytical tools to map and quantify movement of different types of organelles which will be used in these studies. By understanding how organelle movement is controlled at the molecular level, we will in future be able to start dissecting the role of specific types of organelle movement for plant growth, adaptation and development. This fundamental research has several implications including the potential to generate plants which are better able to adapt to changes in the environment and pathogen attack, and will therefore result in increased crop yields, vital for the increasing world population and demand on food and biofuel in the changing global climate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I006184/1","grantId":"BB/I006184/1","fundValue":"355408","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Imogen Averil Sparkes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
