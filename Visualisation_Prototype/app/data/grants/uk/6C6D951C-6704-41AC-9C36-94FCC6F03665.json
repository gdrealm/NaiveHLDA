{"id":"6C6D951C-6704-41AC-9C36-94FCC6F03665","title":"Potato miRNAs and their role in potato tuber formation","abstractText":"Potato is the third most important food crop, and it is cultivated worldwide for its underground storage stems (tubers), rich in starch and other nutrients. Potato is unique among the major world food crops in tuber formation and the processes by which tubers develop are not well understood. It is essential to know the basic biological processes which lead to tuber formation to be able to select better cultivars (with higher yield, specific shape, texture or skin colour) for the future.\nIn this proposal we aim to identify small regulatory RNAs which play a role in tuber formation. These RNA molecules are called 'micro' RNAs (miRNAs). This new, recently discovered, layer of gene regulation involves small RNAs (including miRNAs) as regulatory molecules for post-transcriptional gene regulation. This mechanism is widespread in animals and plants and the discovery of small RNAs has changed our basic knowledge about the regulation of genes. miRNAs play important roles in development and gene regulation upon biotic and abiotic stresses.\nIn our experiments we aim to explore the miRNA transcriptome of potato. Using a photoperiod inducible tuberization system we aim to find miRNAs involoved in this biological process. By generating high-throughput sequence data for small RNAs the availability of the potato genome enables us to identify the miRNA 'genes' using bioinformatics tools. We aim to identify conserved as well as potato specific miRNAs and investigate the role of candidate miRNAs in tuberization. We will characterize the candidate miRNAs and validate them in plants. These miRNAs will help to predict and validate the target molecules for these regulatory molecules. Such genes might play important roles in tuber development or other biological processes connected to tuber formation. The miRNAs and the target genes will help to influence and modify the pathways which lead to tuber formation and we might be able to influence or modify this process, ultimately leading to the ability to breed improved cultivars of this important crop. This knowledge will ultimately help us to produce an important food source with higher yields and improved quality.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J018430/1","grantId":"BB/J018430/1","fundValue":"104610","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  not yet but the work is still ongoing  ","person":"Tamas  Dalmay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" the project is only half-way through We will generate the degradome library to identify miRNA targets Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
