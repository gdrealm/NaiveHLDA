The current achievements of the project have paved the way for a highly ambitious program with 4 major contributions: 1.- Standardization of reagents and methods, as well as generation of new reagents (dozens of isogenic strains lacking single and all combinations of diverse cell membrane or subcellular cation transporters and regulators such as 14-3-3 proteins; new K+-free standard medium). 2.- Set-up existing in-house technologies and implementation of new approaches to solve specific problems connected to the necessary time resolved data acquisition (real-time flux measurements, software for flux, growth rate and solid growth image analysis) 3.- Generation of new initial models (biophysical model of potassium homeostasis, stochastic spatio-temporal model) allowing predictions that can be further tested by experimental approaches, leading to more refined models. 4.- Implementation of a powerful and versatile data management system for data storage and exchange with the potential to be offered as open source platform for SysMo2 users. The aim of the present project is to capitalize on all the tools, experience and previous investment in Translucent to further expand and refine modelling of cation homeostasis including not only potassium, but other cations such as sodium, as well as intracellular compartments (vacuole, nucleus, mitochondria).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I004505/1","grantId":"BB/I004505/1","fundValue":"300912","fundStart":"2010-08-31","fundEnd":"2013-08-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Palmer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
