Past research has shown that a specific brain region is activated when participants view a person acting in an unexpected manner (looking away rather than toward a salient object). As a stronger test of the hypothesis that such activation is uniquely social in nature, patterns of brain activation occurring in response to expected and unexpected events in a social context (after observing person who will either look toward or way from an object) will be compared with brain activation occurring in a non-social context (after observing a directional cue that will either point toward or away from an object). Neuroimaging techniques will be used to pinpoint the spatial location, timing and connectivity of brain activation in response to expected and unexpected events. Twenty-four participants will take part in one study that will establish the spatial location of activation and sixty participants will take in a study designed to establish the timing and connectivity of brain activation.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2529","grantId":"RES-000-22-2529","fundValue":"32215","fundStart":"2008-07-09","fundEnd":"2010-01-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings have yet to be used in any significant way by other researchers. However it is too early to make strong conclusions about the impact of the research. Broadly speaking, the research has impact on society because it furthers understanding of the basic brain processes that support social life. However, there was never any intention to impact members of society directly by the research and the research was funded on this basis of it's contribution to academic rather than non-academic beneficiaries Other Societal","person":"Jason  Tipples","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":" I have discovered that specific brain activity in response to averted eye gaze also occurs to arrow cues that point left and right. This research is important because it goes against the previously held view that there exist specialised processes for responding to eye gaze. More broadly, the results support the idea that our thinking is underpinned by general rather than specific (social) processes. They might be taken forward by researchers interested in the core deficits in autism. Researchers may wish to repeat my research in a population of individuals with Autism to examine whether 1) the same pattern is recorded or 2) a different pattern is found that favours the existence of specialised mechanisms for eye gaze Other","dataset":"gtr"}
