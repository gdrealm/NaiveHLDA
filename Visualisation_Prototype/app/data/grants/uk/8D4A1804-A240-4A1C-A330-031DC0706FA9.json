{"id":"8D4A1804-A240-4A1C-A330-031DC0706FA9","title":"Strategic Science: Research intermediaries and the governance of innovation","abstractText":"The Strategic Science project considers how the development of new technologies is shaped by government priorities and by the methods used to support and coordinate research. The project focuses on nanotechnology and synthetic biology. By considering how these fields are shaped by government policies and priorities, the project will consider the wider societal dimensions of research in these fields. The project has three key objectives. 1. To examine the way that government science policy shapes research in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. 2. To explore the different methods used to coordinate scientific research, particularly research funding, knowledge transfer networks and public engagement programmes. 3. To explore the wider social consequences of nanotechnology and synthetic biology and to consider how government support for and coordination of research might be more accountable. The project will has five phases. 1. Literature reviews and archival research, focusing on understanding contemporary notions of 'strategic science', culminating in an academic workshop. 2. Mapping the 'governance of science' through analysis of contemporary policy documents and with interviews with science policy representatives 3. Case study of nanotechnology 4. Case study of synthetic biology 5. Final analysis and final report. \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G000395/1","grantId":"ES/G000395/1","fundValue":"227093","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew Benjamin Kearnes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
