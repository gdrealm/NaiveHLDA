Synthetic biology innovation around the design of DNA molecules for digital archiving","abstractText":"There is an increasing amount of information stored in digital media; films, TV programs, pictures, mp3s, PDFs and others. Indeed, a considerable amount of information is &quot;born digital&quot; in that it was generated at the outset in a digital media (for example, digital cameras). Despite the every day use of digital storage methods for this information, it is far more complex to store digital information over a long period of time, ie, over decades. Current best practice involves storing information on magnetic tape, and regularly transitioning between upgrades of the tape technology, between 5 to 10 years. \n\nDNA, the chemical which stores the information passed on between generations is a naturally digital storage scheme; it has four possible &quot;letters&quot; (A, T, G and C). Because of the extensive research that has occurred over the last forty years, we can easily read, cut, copy and splice DNA together. More recently it has become feasible to also write DNA to a design of your choosing. Previously we showed that we could use DNA for a very different purpose than store genetic information, namely to store any digital information. In our first trial we stored all of Shakespeare's sonnets, a MP3 extract of Martin Luther King's &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech, a JPG of a picture of the EBI Building, and the PDF of the Watson and Crick publication in Nature in 1953. We can be confident that this information can survive for over 1,000 years.\n\nIn this proposal we want to expand on this work to exploit the fact that one can copy accurately and cheaply DNA information. To do this we need to know at far better precision the engineering properties of DNA enzymes - do they work evenly on every sequence? What is their precise error rate? Using this information we will be able to design a Digital DNA store which can be replicated 100s or 1000s of times easily. \n\nAs a proof of concept we would also like to store a more substantial amount of culturally important information in DNA - for example, the entire works of Shakespeare, or the UN declaration of human rights. With this new work, and with the expected advances in synthesis we expect to be able to store a substantial amount. To choose the precise works we store we will engage with the public, and also design an appropriate physical storage location.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L023741/1","grantId":"BB/L023741/1","fundValue":"511733","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nick  Goldman","coPersons":["Ewan  Birney"],"organisation":"EMBL - European Bioinformatics Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
