(2007). The FPD model system will be used in two experiments to determine the relationship between different foot pad lesion scores and pain. In addition we will more clearly define the minimum litter moisture content that will avoid the risk of FPD. We will evaluate the minimum score associated with evidence of pain in an experiment that replicates commercial practices to evaluate the degree of pain or discomfort associated with different FPD scores at different ages in commercial flocks. In conjunction with WP1 of the ANIHWA project we will propose thresholds so that the recommended commercial scoring scheme supports the welfare of turkeys. We will also assess techniques for assessing litter moisture as both a management aid and as a welfare indicator.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L012022/1","grantId":"BB/L012022/1","fundValue":"75280","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Morison Hocking","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" New grant, too soon to have outcomes New grant - too soon to record findings Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
