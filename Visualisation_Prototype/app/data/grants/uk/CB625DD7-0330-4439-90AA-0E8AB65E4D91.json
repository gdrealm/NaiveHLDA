This number is predicted to double over the next 20 years due to poor lifestyle choices and a lack of drugs. Regardless of cause liver disease follows a similar course; damage - inflammation - fibrosis (scars) - cirrhosis (dense scars) and increased risk of liver cancer. If patients do not dramatically change their lifestyle (reduce fat and alcohol consumption) or in the case of viral infections respond to anti-viral drugs there are no current treatments for liver disease. Patients with an autoimmune disease (primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis or Wilsons disease) have no therapeutic options. Liver disease represents a massive clinical and economic burden therefore understanding how liver scars (fibrosis) develop and go away is critical to identifying new medicines. Our Laboratories research focus over the past 10 years has been to understand what causes liver scarring (fibrosis) by culturing scar forming cells on plastic in petri dishes. We use this information to identify new anti-fibrotic (scar preventing or removing) drug targets and use archived tissue from rodent and human disease to validate and confirm these targets. Once potential medicines are identified we test these drugs in models of liver disease. Developing an in vitro 3D Liver chip system that mimics normal liver cell-cell interactions and models scarring would provide an opportunity to test new drugs in primary human cells; this would directly REDUCE the number of animals required for in vitro (cells made from animals) and even in vivo (whole animal) experiments. A 2nd advantage of this system is &quot;controllability&quot;. LiverChip scaffolds are in individual chambers and can be manipulated experimentally with disease modulators e.g. damaging agents, inflammatory cells or potential anti-fibrotic drugs in a tightly controlled, accurate manner. This level of control will greatly assist our understanding of what causes the disease and the breakdown or success of drugs. If a medicine causes significant hepatoxicity (liver damage) or does not achieve the same anti-scar effects in this system as the 2D cultures on plastic (petri dishes) for reasons such as rapid drug metabolism (breakdown), this may negate the need to test the drug in an in vivo liver disease model. Conversely, growing hepatocytes with scar cells (co-culture) may increase drug toxicity through direct or indirect mechanisms. This would prevent unnecessary procedures which carry both moderate and severe bands. Once established this system could be used to monitor scar generation or removal +/- drug intervention or damage stimuli daily over many days. The current hepatocyte LiverChip cultures at Zyoxel are growing for &gt;2 weeks therefore they can be treated repeatedly with damage agents or test compounds. Preliminary published (hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cells) and unpublished data from Zyoxel suggests that we would expect similar results in co-culture systems (1). Sampling the culture media and measuring makers of hepatocyte damage (liver enzymes release) or release of scar factors (collagens or fibrogenic cytokines e.g. TGFb1) would generate constant data streams to monitor disease and liver damage as the experiment progresses. Other applications of the LiverChips could include biomarker, drug breakdown and transport analysis.\n\nIf successful we hope that this system would be adopted by other liver researchers and prove a useful predictive tool for pharmaceutical companies. Long term this technology could be adapted to model disease in other organs susceptible to scarring e.g. kidney or skin. \n\n1. Domansky K, et al.
