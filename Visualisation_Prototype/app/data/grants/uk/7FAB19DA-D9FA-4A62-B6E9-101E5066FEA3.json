{"id":"7FAB19DA-D9FA-4A62-B6E9-101E5066FEA3","title":"Research in Theoretical Astrophysics: Accretion, Structure and Evolution in Gravitating Systems","abstractText":"We propose to undertake a broad programme of research in theoretical astrophysics. This research will be centered around accretion, structure and evolution in many astrophysical systems. Accretion is the process whereby a gravitating body accumulates mass from its surroundings. As the mass falls towards the body it can give up energy in the form of heat and light. Accretion onto a black hole is the most efficient way of extracting energy from normal matter. Astrophysical systems powered by accretion are among the luminous in the universe. Gravity not only powers these systems but determines their large scaled structure and long term evolution. The systems we aim to study cover many length scales, from compact binary star systems which would happily fit inside the Sun to colliding galaxies which consist of many billions of Sun-like stars.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E00119X/1","grantId":"PP/E00119X/1","fundValue":"1856790","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  King","coPersons":["Sergei  Nayakshin","Walter  Dehnen","Graham  Wynn"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
