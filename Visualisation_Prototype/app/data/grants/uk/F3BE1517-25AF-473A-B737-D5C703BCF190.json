{"id":"F3BE1517-25AF-473A-B737-D5C703BCF190","title":"Frequency multiplexing of terahertz sensors","abstractText":"We propose to develop a multiplexing system for read out of the array of low temperature terahertz sensors. The universal approach in designing the system will be used, so that the multiplexing technology will be transferable to the sensors of different types: single electron transistors, point contacts, bolometers. The prime application of the multiplexing system will be in a passive terahertz imager, which is currently under development at Royal Holloway University of London (RHUL) and National Physical Laboratory (NPL). The multiplexing system will use a single line for operation and it will address an array of sensors with a high speed, down to 10 ns per sensor. This will allow to generate a real time image or to perform a spectroscopic express analysis. The terahertz imager of this speed and performance will be a breakthrough in many applications including astronomy, security, express gas analysis and health imaging. Complementary expertise of RHUL, NPL and the named researcher, Dr T Lindstrom, will be used to success of the project. RHUL brings to the project the nanofabrication facilities and technology of sensitive terahertz detectors. NPL adds technology and equipment for the high frequency operation, and expertise in application of scientific developments for metrology and industrial needs. Dr T Lindstrom, the name researcher in the project, is an expert in high-frequency measurements at low temperatures. Development of the multiplexing system is an efficient synergy of these expertise.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G061432/1","grantId":"EP/G061432/1","fundValue":"319061","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vladimir  Antonov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
