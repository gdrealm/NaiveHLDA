{"id":"392251C4-FCDB-44BA-B1B8-9DCCCE294B47","title":"Effective Classroom Practice: A mixed method study of influences and outcomes","abstractText":"<p>This is a two-year research study that uses a mixed-method approach to identify key factors that contribute to teaching for effective measurable outcomes in primary and secondary phases of schooling. The study builds on a four-year, longitudinal research project (Day et al, 2006) into ‘Variations in Teachers’ Work, Lives and their Effects on Pupils (VITAE)’. The current study extends existing datasets created as part of VITAE and includes a new observational component to investigate variations in teachers’ classroom practice, and relationships with professional life phase, identity and school context.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>A purposive sample of 40 primary and 40 secondary teachers of English and mathematics who have consistently demonstrated either typical or more effective practice in promoting pupil progress has been selected. These teachers work in geographical clusters of schools to represent different contexts (urban, rural, etc) and levels of disadvantage. </p>\n\n<p>The research involves two school-based visits during the school year 2006/7. Contextual, observational and interview data generated from teachers, school leaders and pupils will be subjected to a first level, ‘grounded’ analysis and subsequently to a thematic analysis. This approach will be coupled with the use of individual teacher ‘cameos’ representing key contexts, characteristics and emergent issues.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1564","grantId":"RES-000-23-1564","fundValue":"275179","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Day","coPersons":["Pamela Mary Sammons"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
