{"id":"F2C593A5-BE43-4B90-8B48-29ADDC8812CF","title":"Multi-scale evaluation of advanced technologies for capturing the CO2: chemical looping applied to solid fuels.","abstractText":"Chemical looping combustion is one way of using a solid fuel such as coal, which is able to capture the CO2 without the energy penalty usually associated with carbon capture. However, this is a relatively new technology, and its application on a full scale system is relatively risky, due to uncertainties in the potential performance, overall cost and robustness of the system. Here this is addressed in a systematic, multiscale approach, which considers the detailed behaviour of the solid oxygen carriers, through to the systems level integration into a power station and energy grid. Another objective is to share knowledge and build a sustainable collaboration between the Chinese and UK groups, and enhance post-graduate training in this field. Consequently, the proposal is based around project studentships (7 in total, 2 at CU, 1 at SU, 1 at IC, 2 at TU and 1 at SE). Students will be exchanged between the UK and Chinese groups for extended periods, and will work as embedded researchers, benefiting from the experience of the hosting group and PI, and facilitating knowledge transfer between the groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I010912/1","grantId":"EP/I010912/1","fundValue":"578218","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings of this work have found direct application in a new project with an industrial collaborator (via a DTA funded studentship).

It aims to answer key questions about the use of this technology to capture CO2 from coal in the power sector. We aimed to set up pilot scale facilities for testing the method, models to help us understand what limits the performance, and develop new materials which can be used to provide the oxygen used for the combustion of the coal. Traditionally this work is seen as part of carbon capture and storage. However we have begun to see interested in wider applications where oxygen transfer materials could be used in other processes. Already we work with a small company applying these techniques to other areas. We have secured a follow on industrial project to take the process evaluation and modelling forward which will build directly on the work in this project. Chemicals,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
