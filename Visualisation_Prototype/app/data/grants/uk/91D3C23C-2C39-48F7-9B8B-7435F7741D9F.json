The initiative will be based at the London Centre for Nanotechology (LCN), a joint venture between Imperial College London and University College London, and will help establish an internationally competitive multi-disciplinary activity with strong critical mass at two of the UK's leading research universities. Our programme will deliver high impact fundamental science and will lead to the development of new techniques capable of quantifying target properties with appropriate spatial and temporal resolution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D063604/1","grantId":"EP/D063604/1","fundValue":"2776770","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gabriel  Aeppli","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
