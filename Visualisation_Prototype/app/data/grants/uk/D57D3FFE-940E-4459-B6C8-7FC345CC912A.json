Most published coastal studies, and hence guidance documents, are based on the prediction of average quantities such as overtopping rates per hour. Whilst these are undoubtedly useful for estimating drainage requirements and for making flood predictions if the inland drainage is inadequate or becomes blocked, they give little insight into the damage that may be caused by a single extreme overtopping or impulse event, which could cause global structural failure of sea defence works. \n\nThis project addresses the problem of the most extreme responses at the coast, whether this is wave run-up, overtopping volume or impulse on a section of sea defence works. We aim to understand and model the individual largest and most damaging waves within a long random sequence of severe waves hitting the coast - a storm consisting of thousands of individual waves. We will use the idea of localised groups of large waves to model the most severe waves that arise by chance in a storm. Detailed comparisons will be made between waves in the new flume at Plymouth University and a recently developed computer model OXBOU, all underpinned by analysis of waves at 2 locations off the British coast.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K024108/1","grantId":"EP/K024108/1","fundValue":"370111","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Howard Taylor","coPersons":["Alison Caroline Raby"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
