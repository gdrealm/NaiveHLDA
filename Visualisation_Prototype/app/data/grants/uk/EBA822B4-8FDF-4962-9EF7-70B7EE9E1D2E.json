Such displays/referred to hereafter as 3d displays/are increasingly used in society, in a wide range of applications that includes operation of remote devices, medical imaging, scientific visualization, surgical training, design, virtual prototyping, and vision research. A useful 3d display should be comfortable and natural to use, and must create a faithful impression of the 3d structure of the object or scene being portrayed. Unfortunately, current 3d displays typically fail on both counts. They often induce significant discomfort and fatigue, and the resulting perception of depth appears to be flattened, compared to equivalent real scenes. Both these problems are caused in part, if not completely, by the fact that almost all existing 3d displays present each eye's image on a single surface, at a fixed viewing distance. This means that the eyes try to focus at the display surface, irrespective of the depth variations in the portrayed scene. This affects depth perception because the eye's focusing response is a signal to depth. It causes fatigue and discomfort because viewers must decouple the natural relationship between their focusing response and the eye movements they make to look at near and far objects: this process is effortful and often unpleasant. I am proposing a programme of experiments to develop a novel 3d display technique that has been designed to rectify this problem. The display presents a near-correct stimulus to the eye's focusing response by presenting each eye's image as the sum of multiple planar images at different distances from the eye. I call these multi-plane images. All the other visual information is presented correctly to each eye. A difficult situation to simulate is when an object lies at a distance in-between two image planes. To do this, the object is presented as a blend of light at the two image planes. The core experiments will evaluate whether this technique is effective in stimulating the eye to focus in-between image planes. I will also measure eye movements to multi-plane images, to see whether they are equivalent to viewing real world scenes. Furthermore, I will investigate the relationship between eye movements discomfort in 3d displays, and determine whether multi-plane images can reduce this problem. The display technique and experiments are motivated by a theoretical model of how the eye's focusing response is controlled. This emphasis on basic science will allow me to develop a display that is better suited to the properties of the human visual system. In turn, the theoretical model, in conjunction with the unique properties of the multi-plane display, will allow me to address some long-standing research questions regarding how the eye focuses. I will continue to develop and refine the model throughout the research programme. The research findings will aid the development of 3d displays that are more comfortable, natural to use, and produce more accurate 3d perception than current displays. This should be of significant benefit to the growing number of users of this important technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E065376/1","grantId":"EP/E065376/1","fundValue":"296977","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Thus far, the principle contribution of the work outside academia has been to communicate how a better understanding of the interaction between the human visual system and stereoscopic media can significantly improve how natural/comfortable they are to use, and how effective they are. \n\nEvidence that this has been at least in part achieved comes from a large number of invitations to present the work to professional/industry forums, including technical (IBC, International Meeting on Information Display), creative (3Dstereomedia), and standards-setting agencies (SMPTE; the Society for Motion Picture and Television Engineers). \n\nIn future we expect the specific findings on contracting multiple-focal-planes displays to influence the design and construction of next-generation stereoscopic displays.

Typically, viewers must converge their eyes at the depicted stereoscopic depth (vergence) while focusing the eye (accommodation) at the screen surface. Decoupling these responses is effortful, and causes a number of aversive side-effects, including fatigue, discomfort, and poor perception of stereoscopic depth. \n\n\n\nOur goal was to develop and evaluate an approach to 3d visualisation that is better suited to the properties of the human visual system. The above problems could be solved if, like the real world, 3d displays presented continuous variations in focal distance. The primary objective of our work was to evaluate a proposed solution to achieving this called 'depth filtering'. Here, each eye sees the sum of images presented on multiple focal planes, at different distances, and continuous variations in focal distance are approximated by distributing image intensity across planes. Our secondary objective was to use our display to advance basic knowledge of how the eye focuses, and how accommodation and vergence interact. \n\n\n\nWe first constructed a novel multi-plane 3d display that (uniquely, to our knowledge) allows us to present depth-filtered images while simultaneously measuring the eyes' accommodation and vergence responses. \n\n\n\nWe carried out a series of experiments demonstrating that depth filtering does create continuous variations in the eye's accommodation response. Critically, we then determined the maximum image-plane separation that supported accurate accommodation and vergence, while preserving good stereoscopic depth perception. This is key to determining if depth filtering offers a practical solution: placing image planes close together improves the accuracy of the approximation to the real world, but with current technology displays can only be built with a small number of image planes. \n\n\n\nOur key findings are that using a display with just four or five planes, spaced relatively widely (0.6 - 0.9 dioptres), depth-filtered images can create vergence and accommodation responses, and perception of stereoscopic depth, that do not differ from viewing equivalent real-world stimuli. Thus, this approach appears to offer a practical solution to the aversive side-effects inherent in viewing conventional 3d displays. \n\n\n\nWe also used our display to better understand the conditions under which conventional 3d displays cause aversive side effects. The multi-plane solution is not practical for mass entertainment applications (cinema and TV), and these experiments have provided valuable information about where, in stereo depth, content should be placed in conventional 3d displays. \n\n\n\nIn addition, we have used the unique properties of our display to test a new model of how the eye focuses. This has provided significant insights into this basic question, and appears to unify two apparently contradictory and long-standing theories. Overall, the results suggest that fine-scale image information contributes less to the accommodation response than has previously been thought. The model has practical value because it allows us to predict how accommodation responses might break down in our display, and in new designs. Our findings provide a useful basis for the development of next-generation stereoscopic displays, including head-mounted displays, and virtual reality, where it will be important to present near-correct focus cues.
