The aim of the current project is to develop and apply coarse-grain models for the study of a naturally occurring biosurfactant that has interesting biological properties of considerable importance for applications in medicine e.g. it inhibits fibrin clot formation, it is an antitumoral, antibacterial and antibiotic agent etc.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H02218X/1","grantId":"EP/H02218X/1","fundValue":"1600","fundStart":"2009-08-26","fundEnd":"2009-11-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  New CG models to simulate biological systems Chemicals,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology Societal,Economic","person":"Carmen  Domene","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
