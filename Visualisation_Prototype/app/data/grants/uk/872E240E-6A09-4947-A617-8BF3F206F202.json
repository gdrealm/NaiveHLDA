{"id":"872E240E-6A09-4947-A617-8BF3F206F202","title":"Basic Knowledge","abstractText":"We can come to know something by reasoning to it, as a conclusion, from premises that we know. Belief in the conclusion is warranted because belief in the premises is warranted. In such a case, it is natural to say that the wan-ant for the premises is transmitted to the conclusion. However this cannot, it seems, provide a general model for the acquisition of all knowledge, even if much knowledge is based on reasons. For reasoning needs premises, and it seems that in order to know that one's premises are secure, one must, In turn, have reasons for them. And so on ad Infinitum. If all knowledge is based on reasons, the process of reasoning can never get started. We therefore seem to be forced to acknowledge a category of basic knowledge. Basic knowledge, it appears, will need to be unsupported by articulate reasons, and therefore warranted in a way that does not depend on our having a warrant for anything else. \n\nThis train of thought raises some of the most challenging and intriguing puzzles in both traditional and contemporary philosophy. First and foremost, what distinguishes respectable basic knowledge from irrational or arbitrary belief? Knowledge, it seems, should involve belief formed in an intellectually responsible fashion; but how does one exercise responsibility on beliefs that are formed spontaneously, without a substructure of reasons? Where reasons give out so, it seems, does any scope for policing. The project will seek both to elaborate and to test answers to this sceptical challenge by reviewing different possible models for basic knowledge in different areas of our thought, including perceptual knowledge, knowledge by memory, basic mathematical and logical knowledge, and psychological self-knowledge. The work will be informed by, and will be concerned to address, the debate between two very different conceptions of our knowledge in the round: internalism, which holds that knowledge is true belief supported by some form of reflectively certifiable warrant; and externalism, which holds that all that's needed for knowledge is that certain other conditions be met, which reflection cannot always certify - for example, the reliability of the belief-forming method employed. Special attention will be given to a recent important Idea in this area of philosophy, namely that warrant need variably require evidence - that it can be a matter of what's called rational entitlement. A crucial test area for our findings, on which the late stages of the project will concentrate, will be the vexed issue of basic a priori knowledge: the kind of knowledge, seemingly characteristic of fundamental logic and mathematics, in which neither experience nor inference from other known facts plays any role.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D503116/1","grantId":"AH/D503116/1","fundValue":"664370","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  As a research resource for other philosophical researchers Education Cultural","person":"Crispin  Wright","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":" Basic Knowledge is knowledge that doesn't rest on other knowledge. Its natural to view the knowledge delivered by perception, memory, our awareness of our own mental states, and ground-floor 'intuitions' in logic and mathematics as coming into this category. \n\n We structured our researches on this notion into five year-long phases. The first explored sceptical challenges to the very idea of basic knowledge. The second focused on the principles of closure (that the consequences of known propositions are always knowable) and transmission (that deduction from known premises always gives knowledge), presupposed both in certain of the sceptical paradoxes and in some responses to them, notably GE Moore's famous &quot;Proof of an External World&quot;. The third phase was devoted to the idea, first introduced by the PI a decade ago, of epistemic entitlement: a response to sceptical difficulties, and to the &quot;easy knowledge&quot; problems associated with basic knowledge, that postulates a kind of non-evidential justification for certain very general beliefs that supply the framework for our empirical investigations. Internalist and externalist conceptions of knowledge and justification - holding, respectively, that knowledge and justification are reflectively certifiable properties of our beliefs, and that they are properties accruing in virtue of the manner of external causation of our beliefs - provided the topic of the fourth phase. The final phase is devoted to the traditional idea of a priori knowledge - knowledge delivered by pure reasoning and reflection, without the input of sense experience. \n\n The project has been highly productive. The three AHRC-funded postdoctoral fellows (Dr. Dylan Dodd 2007-2012, Dr. Elia Zardini 2007-2010 and 2011-2012, and Dr. Aidan McGlynn 2010-11) and the PI have, between them, had some twenty articles on the project agenda completed and accepted for publication since its inception, all in internationally prestigious, refereed anthologies and journals. There are at least as many further research articles in progress. In addition, two major anthologies based on project conferences and workshops will be published by Oxford University Press; and a collection of the PI's research papers, entitled Imploding the Demon, will also be published by Oxford University Press, encompassing some seven new articles in the field composed during the lifetime of the project. Dr. McGlynn has a book contract with Oxford for work engaging Timothy Williamson's highly influential defence of externalism, Knowledge and Its Limits, published a decade ago. The very significant numbers of additional publications by members of the international network of scholars associated with the project that have been 'midwifed' by project meetings and workshops are detailed in the outcomes lists.\n\n No short summary can do justice to the overall tendencies of our work. As often in philosophy, the effect of sustained intensive collaborative research has been to deepen and sharpen philosophical difficulties rather than to solve them. Two important trends to emerge, however, have been the substantiation of a pluralist outlook on the internalism - externalism debate: that there is in fact a multiplicity of independent epistemic values, and merit in both views; and the consolidation of the notion of epistemic entitlement. Even the most significant philosophical developments filter only very slowly into the more general public consciousness, and their impact is often very indirect. It would be fanciful to expect pure theoretical research in the foundations of epistemology to allow of any direct societal application. Nevertheless, at least since its migration from St. Andrews to the Northern Institute of Philosophy in 2009, the researchers involved in the Basic Knowledge project have taken formal steps to address the need for contemporary philosophy to do a much better job of explaining its concerns and communicating their interest to a wider public. A dedicated programme of outreach activities, headed by Dr Federico Luzzi, originally a research student in the project, is ongoing. It consists of: (a) Caf? Philosophique sessions--open, public-friendly discussion sessions on topics linked to the project; (b) an annual public lecture delivered by a leading philosopher to communicate a central aspect of project research in an informal and accessible manner; and (c) episodes in the Institute's successful '10-Minute Puzzle' podcast series which communicate in a concise and accessible manner some of the problems that engage the project.
