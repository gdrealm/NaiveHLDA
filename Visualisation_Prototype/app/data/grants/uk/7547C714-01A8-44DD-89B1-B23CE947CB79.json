{"id":"7547C714-01A8-44DD-89B1-B23CE947CB79","title":"Social Protection and Disability: Policy Lessons from Vietnam","abstractText":"<p>People with disabilities (PWDs) represent a disproportionately high proportion of the world's poor. Recognising the reciprocal relationship between disability and poverty, leading to increased vulnerability and social exclusion, disability has been flagged as a key development issue in meeting the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and in eradicating world poverty. As a consequence, PWDs are increasingly being mainstreamed into government social protection programmes in low- and middle-income countries. However, there has been little evaluation of the effectiveness of these programmes with respect to PWDs. This research evaluates the efficacy of two government social protection programmes for PWDs in Vietnam, including a cash transfer programme and a free health insurance programme.</p>\n\n<p>To understand the multi-dimensional aspects of the efficacy of social protection programmes, the research adopts a mixed methods approach that includes quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis. Rigorous quantitative analysis of national household survey data will be combined with qualitative interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders from Government, Disabled People's Organisations, and PWDs and their families, to evaluate the effectiveness of programmes in targeting PWDs and in providing financial protection against poverty.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J018864/1","grantId":"ES/J018864/1","fundValue":"296021","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nora  Groce","coPersons":["Daniel M.
