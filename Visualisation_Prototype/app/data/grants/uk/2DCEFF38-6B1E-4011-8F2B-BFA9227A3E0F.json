Normally, bond-making and breaking reactions are studied in test tubes containing many millions of molecules. However, several aspects of chemical reactions cannot be observed by this means: for example, the existence of intermediates lasting a few thousandths of a second is often obscured. Our method employs a nanoreactor so small that it contains only about 400 water molecules as well as the single molecule undergoing the chemistry of interest. By observing the change in a tiny electrical current passing through the nanoreactor, we have been able to see, for the first time, sequential steps in complex reaction sequences one molecule at a time. The reactions we have chosen to investigate in the proposed research are important in human medicine and have been connected with cancer, cardiovascular problems, inflammation, sexual dysfunction and both accidental and deliberate poisoning. As well as contributing to our fundamental understanding of medical problems, the research we will perform permits the sensing of trace amounts of material based on chemical reactivity, including molecules found in chemical weapons, pesticides, foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals. This detection technology may form the basis for a new generation of commercial sensing equipment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300122","grantId":"G0300122","fundValue":"920127","fundStart":"2005-03-30","fundEnd":"2010-03-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Hagan  Bayley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
