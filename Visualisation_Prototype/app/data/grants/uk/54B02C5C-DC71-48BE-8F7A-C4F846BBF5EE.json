{"id":"54B02C5C-DC71-48BE-8F7A-C4F846BBF5EE","title":"Municipal Innovations in Non-Governmental Public Participation: UK/Latin America","abstractText":"<p>This project focuses on the municipal spaces of innovation in public policy making that have been notable in Latin America since the 1980s and in the UK since the 1990s. These innovations open new participatory spaces for non-governmental actors (NGOs, social movements, voluntary and community organisations) with the intention of creating effective approaches to poverty, exclusion and conflict. Latin American innovations, notably participatory budgeting, are now being experimented with in some UK cities. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to empirical knowledge, this research aims to contribute theoretical insight into the evolution of democratic theory in the age of globalisation. These municipal innovations may appear to be isolated experiments. However, we associate them with a post Cold War shift in democratic thinking towards ‘participatory governance’. We seek to clarify whether this is a permanent and/or sustainable shift. We also wish to explore whether it is creating meaningful spaces for participation and change below the State, capable of delivering effective new approaches to poverty, exclusion and conflict and the relational inequalities in which they are embedded. We will explore this through five municipal case studies, three in Latin America and two in the UK, building an interactive rather than extractive research process with non-governmental participants.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-155-25-0059","grantId":"RES-155-25-0059","fundValue":"253821","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jenny  Pearce","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bradford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
