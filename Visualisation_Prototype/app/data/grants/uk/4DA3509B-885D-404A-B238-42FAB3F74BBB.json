{"id":"4DA3509B-885D-404A-B238-42FAB3F74BBB","title":"Roadmap to XEUS","abstractText":"The proposed x-ray mission XEUS is a technologically challenging mission. The proposed cryogenic spectrometer instrument will require detectors to be cooled to the region of 30-50 mK. Adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerators (ADR) are idea coolers for this being independent of gravity. This proposal is to develop the ADR for the proposed XEUS mission.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F011822/1","grantId":"ST/F011822/1","fundValue":"285103","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Hepburn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
