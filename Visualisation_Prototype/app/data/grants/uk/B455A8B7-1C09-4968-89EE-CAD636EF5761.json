One of the reasons for the failure of attempts to increase physical activity is the self-protective tendency to defend against messages that highlight personal failings. Research suggests that such resistance may be overcome by focusing attention on one's values and positive aspects of oneself - 'self-affirmation' (Steele, 1988). Self-affirmation has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of health promotion. At present, however, it is not clear how these potential benefits can be realised.</p>\n\n<p>Four experimental studies will examine how self-affirmation operates and with which message types it can most successfully combined (eg those emphasising the threat or ways to overcome it). These questionnaire-based studies will also show how self-affirmation interacts with other techniques designed to encourage enactment of health-promoting intentions (ie forming detailed plans). These objectives will be pursued by studying the promotion of increased physical activity amongst 16-24 year olds. Given that the majority of this age group are in education, employment or training, participants will be recruited from educational establishments that offer a valuable opportunity for physical activity interventions.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-3209","grantId":"RES-062-23-3209","fundValue":"174263","fundStart":"2012-04-11","fundEnd":"2014-04-10","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Societal impact \nThe research was presented to large audiences of students and staff at several schools. These presentations emphasised gaps between physical activity behaviour and recommendations, and discussed particular techniques for bridging this gap.\nThe P.I. has also disseminated findings to individuals who work with students at the University of Sussex:\nFindings demonstrating the benefits of a message about physical activity and academic performance were discussed with the Health and Well-being manager. It was agreed that an adapted message would be added to the Health and Well-being webpages, and that students could be directed to this as appropriate. \nThese findings have also been discussed at several meetings with the Head of Sport, resulting in an advertising campaign focused on physical activity and academic performance. The Head of Sport presented the research at a Health and well-being committee meeting. The P.I. also supported the Sport Centre’s Sport England bid to encourage exercise amongst inactive students. \nThe P.I. met with the Student’s Union activities manager. Relevant findings from the project, for example the potential of self-affirming images, were discussed in relation to how these might inform planned interventions to increase physical activity.

It may be possible to reduce this resistance by focusing attention on personal values, positive characteristics and social connections ('self-affirmation'). \n\nThis project examined ways of using self-affirmation to increase open-minded acceptance of messages about the harmful effects of being physically inactive. A series of studies explored how self-affirmation works, and whether the effects depend on the target population and the type of health message. \n\nKey findings: \n• Self-affirmation encouraged more thorough processing of health messages, which in turn led to greater prioritisation of reasons to be active over the practicalities of achieving this. \n• Even when a neutral message was used, self-affirmed participants reported more physical activity a week later. \n• Initial evidence suggested that photographs of social groups may reduce resistance to messages about physical activity. This should be explored further as a potentially valuable method for enhancing real health campaigns. \n• Self-affirmation was most effective when combined with messages that explained negative consequences of inactivity without attempting to persuade individuals that it is easy to be more active. \n• Self-affirmation appeared to be particularly beneficial for those from higher socioeconomic status background, and could be detrimental amongst those who are more deprived.\n• Self-affirmation was associated with decreased levels of activity and less acceptance of messages amongst those already engaging in high levels of exercise. This may be because self-affirmation produced greater sensitivity to appropriateness of message content. The findings of this project suggest ways in which self-affirmation techniques can be incorporated into future advertising and health promotion strategies. Following further scientific research, it is likely that health promotion practitioners could put the findings to use by using both self-affirmation techniques and messages containing information about physical activity and academic performance. \nIn particular, we have a manuscript in preparation which offers a promising image-based approach to self-affirming, which could easily be incorporated into real health promotion campaigns (e.g. mass media advertising). Since defensiveness is a significant barrier to the dissemination of health messages to target audiences, this finding could have substantial benefits in terms of public health and the impact of future campaigns.
