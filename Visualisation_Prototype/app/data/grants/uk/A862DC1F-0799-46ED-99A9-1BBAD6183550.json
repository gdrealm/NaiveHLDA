{"id":"A862DC1F-0799-46ED-99A9-1BBAD6183550","title":"Evaluating SPR array imaging for glycobiology","abstractText":"Whilst carbohydrate structure and recognition are clearly central to biology, our appreciation of their structure and function is still rudimentary compared to proteins and nucleic acids. It has been estimated that around 2% of the human genome is dedicated to glyco-active enzymes (up to 6% in plants) and that over 70% of all proteins in man are glycosylated. In turn this has led to a need for analysis of larger numbers of glycan structures, and their cognate binding proteins, which has provided the impetus for the development of new technologies with high-throughput potential. Latterly, glycoscientists have identified carbohydrate microarrays (glycoarrays) as a key tool for the high-throughput studies that are necessary to understand this complex area of biology. The purpose of this study is to evaluate new methods with which to analyse carbohydrate-active enzymes based on integrated, chip-based surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy-mass spectrometry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G02460X/1","grantId":"BB/G02460X/1","fundValue":"80059","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rob  Field","coPersons":[],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
