This project aims&nbsp;to advance&nbsp; understanding of human conversation by developing,&nbsp;implementing and testing a model of dialogue which reflects as&nbsp;closely as possible the incremental nature of human language&nbsp; processing. Its primary focus will be on ellipsis, in particular on&nbsp;the way in which, <br />in conversation, turns are routinely fragmented and&nbsp;distributed across utterances and speakers, a phenomenon showing the tight coordination between the participants in the dialogue.</p>\n\n<p>The project combines formal and empirical investigation of how people build utterances incrementally in dialogue. It will use corpus data&nbsp;to identify when people make use of part of what someone else said as&nbsp;an unspoken constituent of their own utterances: ellipses and split&nbsp;utterances. It will use new chat-tool experimental techniques to test hypotheses about which utterance constituents are interchangeable across speakers in this way (Healey et. al. 2003). This will lead to an implemented, incremental inter-speaker model of&nbsp;<br />conversational turn construction. The primary theoretical framework&nbsp;to be adopted is <br />Dynamic Syntax (Kempson et al 2001, Cann et al 2005) which purports to <br />directly reflect parsing process dynamics, with mappings onto Type-Theory-with-Records to provide cross-theoretical&nbsp;understanding of the processes involved.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0962","grantId":"RES-062-23-0962","fundValue":"580526","fundStart":"2008-01-02","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Naturalistic human-computer interactions need computer models that reflect the word-by-word way people interact in conversation. DynDial is uniquely based on a grammar reflecting this, increasing naturalness for English/Swedish/German dialogue models. DynDial impact includes two projects: (a) RISER (EPSRC, Purver principal investigator): developing the system for general dialogue applications, (b) PPAT (EPSRC, Purver principal investigator): applying DynDial methodologies to analyse dialogues between schizophrenic patients and clinicians.

Thus hearers can understand partial sentences and switch roles to become speakers, offering continuations/clarifications/corrections, with no trouble responding to such modifications. Modelling these &quot;split&quot; utterances is inexpressible in orthodox grammars, as it requires models in which interlocutors incrementally collaborate to build a structure on a word-by-word basis. DynDial successfully modelled such phenomena as part of its development of a model of dialogue with Dynamic Syntax (DS: Kempson et al 2001, Cann et al 2005) as the background, in which incrementality plays a central role. Corpus study confirmed that these phenomena are common: results showed 20% of corpus data involved splits. Experimental work developed three new experimental manipulations: artificial splits, incremental clarifications and induced completions. Using these, we produced the first experimental demonstration of the relevance of syntactic increments in dialogue processing. DS was extended to record speaker-switch points, adapting Cooper's Type Theory with Records (Cooper 2008) and capturing major fragment types. This model was then used to produce a working computational dialogue system DyLan, based around Skantze &amp; Hjalmarsson (2010)'s dialogue manager Jindigo: DyLan is the first system which produces and processes representations of meaning on a strictly incremental, word-by-word basis in both parsing and production, allowing it to handle major split utterance and other ellipsis types. The research thus extends ongoing work to yield wholly novel results. The modelling of compound utterances in which people switch roles between speaking and hearing is not expressible in orthodox grammars, but emerges naturally from a grammar formalism incorporating the progressive building of representations of content, in which the grammar architecture and performance model are notably simpler. A Corpus study confirming how common these phenomena are is freely available. Experimental work developed three new experimental manipulations: artificial splits, incremental clarifications and induced completions. Using these, we produced the first experimental demonstration of the relevance of syntactic increments in dialogue processing, all of which are available, as is the working computational dialogue system DyLan, based around Skantze &amp; Hjalmarsson (2010)'s dialogue manager Jindigo: DyLan is the first system which produces and processes representations of meaning on a strictly incremental, word-by-word basis in both parsing and production, allowing it to handle major split utterance and other ellipsis types.
