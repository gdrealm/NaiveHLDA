The principal aim of the symposium is to progress the momentum established at the inaugural symposium held in April 2005. The establishment of a UK series of KDD symposium is seen as a new initiative whose objective is to bring together the various practitioners and research groups in the UK working both commercially or academical within discipline of KDD and its related enterprises. The symposium seeks to act as a show case for the current state of the art of UK KDD work, and to identify opportunities and establish partnerships to maintain the UK's standing within the international KDD community. Many of the leading UK experts on KDD will be presenting a collation of views and reports on current KDD topics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D069742/1","grantId":"EP/D069742/1","fundValue":"1664","fundStart":"2006-05-19","fundEnd":"2006-06-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Frans  Coenen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
