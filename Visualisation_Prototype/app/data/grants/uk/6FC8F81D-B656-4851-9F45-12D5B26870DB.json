Although the primary tumour can be removed at surgery, in a good proportion of the patients the malignant tumour can disseminate or metastasise to other parts of the body. It is the process of metastasis that is largely responsible for the death of the patient, since conventional therapeutic agents are not selective enough to kill the cancer cells without harming growing normal cells. Much effort has been expended on the identification of genes which initiate the uncontrolled growth of the primary tumour, but little or no comparable effort has been expended in understanding the process of metastasis. To tackle the problem of metastasis, Prof Rudland and his group have utilised their unique breast stem cell lines to identify four genes capable of inducing metastasis in their animal model system. The level of the protein products of these genes were then assessed with specific antibodies in thin sections cut from routinely collected clinical specimens of the primary tumour of one set of patients with breast cancer. The presence of these metastasis-inducing proteins showed a much stronger correlation with death of the patient than biomarkers in routine use in hospitals today. It is proposed to repeat this work in many of the commonly occurring human cancers, including another set of breast cancers, so as to establish whether these metastasis-inducing proteins either singly or in combination can predict the outcome of the patient better than conventional biomarkers and to test the usefulness of the best one in a simple blood test. The identification of groups of patients at high risk of death by their overproduction of biomarkers for metastasis will enable them to be treated more vigorously and spare the remainder from harmful side effects of the vigorous treatment. It will also help validate the next phase of the work in developing suitable inhibitors that interfere in the life threatening aspect of cancer, that of metastasis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801447","grantId":"G0801447","fundValue":"350768","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Spencer Rudland","coPersons":["Dong Liu Barraclough","John  Neoptolemos","Terence  Jones","Christopher  Foster","Christopher  West","Barry Roger Barraclough","Suzete  De Silva Rudland"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
