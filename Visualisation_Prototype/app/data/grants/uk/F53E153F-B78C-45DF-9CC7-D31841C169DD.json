However very little is known about how destructive plate boundaries initiate, evolve and end. This is central to plate tectonics, as it is thought that the dominant driving force of plate motions is the gravitational pull of subducting plates.\nIn the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, the Pacific and Australian plates are converging. In the north one subduction zone is nearing the end of its life cycle as anomalously buoyant oceanic plate is stalling subduction. To the south in the San Cristobal Trench, a new subduction zone has initiated in response to continued convergence of the Pacific and Australian plates, making this the perfect place to understand subduction initiation and cessation. \n\nIn this urgency proposal we will deploy seismometers for 1 year to record aftershocks from sequence of 4 major earthquakes with magnitudes between 7.1-7.6. These recordings and other recordings of earthquakes from around the globe will allow us to delineate with high accuracy the plate interfaces of the new and old subducting slabs and image the slab structures at depth. The structure of the old and new subduction zones will illuminate the processes occurring at depth which are shifting the force balance in the region to reverse the sense of subduction.\nThe proposed experiment will be enhanced by concurrent studies scheduled to be deployed in Fall of 2014, which includes a multimillion pound ocean bottom seismic deployment by colleagues in Japan. The combined array will allow us to image the Pacific plate which is stalling the subduction, allowing us to investigate what conditions are necessary for a plate to halt the descent of the slab into the mantle. Thus we will be able to understand how subduction stops and starts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M00788X/1","grantId":"NE/M00788X/1","fundValue":"52250","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  Harmon","coPersons":["Derek  Keir","Catherine A Rychert"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
