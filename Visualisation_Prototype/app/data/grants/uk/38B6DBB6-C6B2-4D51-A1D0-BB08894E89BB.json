{"id":"38B6DBB6-C6B2-4D51-A1D0-BB08894E89BB","title":"Structural investigation of DNA recombination in Gram-positive organisms","abstractText":"Homologous DNA recombination is a fundamental process in all living things including humans and involves the exchange of sections of DNA between two regions DNA that are very similar to each other. By swapping sections of the DNA, damage can be repaired and hence the genetic code maintained or alternatively some diversity generated. As part of the process, a crossover point called a Holliday junction is formed between the DNA regions that links them together. How the Holliday junction is manipulated into particular conformations and subsequently cut in order to release the two regions of DNA from each other again is of critical importance in deciding what sort of products are formed by the recombination. We are interested in studying proteins that especially bind to Holliday junctions. They can change its shape, help other proteins bind and/or cut it at particular places. We hope to help explain how some of these proteins recognize Holliday junctions selectively and carry out their various functions. To do this we are intending to determine the structures of the proteins when they are bound to the DNA. Specifically we want to study the proteins RuvA, RecU, RuvC and LrpC from a class of bacteria, some of which are known to cause serious infections in humans. We will also compare and contrast this vital information on the binding of Holliday junctions with that from other organisms including humans to see what common features exist.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E017576/1","grantId":"BB/E017576/1","fundValue":"271725","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  In the field of scientific research into DNA and in the area of studies on Campylobacter Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology ","person":"John  Rafferty","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" The structures of certain proteins and how these can be linked to their function in enabling the bacterium to produce active factors that could enable it to survive in its hosts (humans &amp; chickens). also discovered the way in which a separate protein can interact with and help in repairing DNA in a bacterium. the knowledge of the structural data might be employed as part of a strategy to inhibit the growth of the bacterium.
