The intervention will employ a simple but effective strategy to refuse offers of cigarettes (if-then plans about how to say no to offers of cigarettes plus reading anti-smoking messages) and test it against a control condition (forming if-then plans about completing homework plus reading pro-homework messages). A total of 18 schools (with approximately 3 classes in each) will be randomly selected to implement the intervention and 18 other schools (again with approximately 3 classes in each) will be randomly selected to implement the control condition. The intervention will be implemented by trained teachers and be conducted in schools in classroom time on nine occasions (ie. six months between each intervention). The main outcome measure will be smoking behavior assessed by objective measures (breath carbon monoxide measures) at baseline (when participants were 11-12 years of age) and at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months post baseline (ie., final follow-up when participants were 15-16 years of age). A secondary outcome measure will be self-reported smoking measured at the same time points. Analysis will test for differences in smoking rates at each of the follow-ups after controlling for any differences at baseline.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J000264/1","grantId":"MR/J000264/1","fundValue":"928086","fundStart":"2012-04-16","fundEnd":"2017-03-15","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Conner","coPersons":["Christopher John Armitage","Sarah  Grogan","Kamran  Siddiqi","Carole  Torgerson","Rebecca  Lawton","Robert Michael  West","Brenda  Gannon"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
