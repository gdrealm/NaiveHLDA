{"id":"92791C59-8BEC-4414-B7A8-43989BD95AB7","title":"Social influences on aging in a wild cooperative mammal","abstractText":"A key goal of research in biological and medical science is to understand why some individuals in a population remain healthy into old age, whereas others decline rapidly and die early. Research on model laboratory organisms such as fruit flies and mice suggests that the rate of decline in bodily function with age, or the rate of senescence, will depend on how individuals allocate resources to survival versus reproduction across the lifespan, and on the quantity and quality of resources available during growth and development. In highly social or cooperative animals, both these factors are strongly dependent on an individual's social status and its interactions with other group members. Our research will test for the first time the influence of these social factors on rates of aging and physiological senescence in a highly social, mammal, the banded mongoose, using a combination of long-term data analysis, behavioural experiments and physiological measures of senescence. Specifically we will address questions: (1) how does variation in individual attributes and social factors (such as helping effort, dominance status, and group structure) influence rates of aging in males and females; (2) how do these factors influence measured levels of oxidative stress, a suggested marker of physiological senescence; and (3) how does variation in social investment received during development influence adult survival and condition? We will address the last question using a large-scale field experiment in which we provision pups with nutrients for growth or with antioxidants to test for downstream effects on adult condition, reproductive performance, and levels of oxidative stress. The research will generate important new information on the main factors influencing variation and mortality and fertility in natural populations of social vertebrates, and how natural selection shapes the evolution of life history in long-lived animals living in close-knit family groups, including, potentially, ancestral humans. In addition, our work will provide the first test of mechanistic explanations of senescence in a natural mammal population, and the first experimental test of early-life effects on adult fitness traits. These investigations promise to advance our understanding of the evolutionary processes and proximate causes of aging.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G019657/1","grantId":"NE/G019657/1","fundValue":"488951","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The findings from this grant have contributed to the development of a new theoretical model to explain life history allocation across the lifespan in long-lived species. This theory may help to explain inconsistent patterns in previous tests of the oxidative stress theory of aging. Our research on banded mongooses suggests that mothers 'shield' their offspring during pregnancy by upregulating defense against oxidative damage. We argue that a transgenerational model is needed to understand individual variation in oxidative damage and survival in mammals, including humans.

In addition to the 11 publication outputs over the course of the grant, several key findings for demographic and physiological patterns are to be published in three manuscripts this year, one of which is already in press (Cant et al 2013 Adv Stud Behav). These are as follows:\n\n\n\nSurvival analyses\n\n- Sex differences: males live longer than females\n\n- Differences in mortality are not caused by aging, but rather lower survival of females in all age classes, particularly when they become reproductively active and become targets of within-group aggression and evictions.\n\n- No actuarial senescence in either sex, meaning that mortality risk does not increase with age. \n\n- Differences in how reproduction is divided among group members seem to play a role in differential mortality. Reproduction is more equally divided among the females than males, but the skew among females is affected by resources, meaning that competition is more intense when resources are scarce, potentially reverberating its effects: Within-group aggression against females may come at a double-cost, because it often co-occurs during environmental stress of draught.\n\n- Similar conflict over reproduction is not manifest in males, and within-group aggression does not have a similar survival cost in males\n\n- \n\nAnalyses of reproductive aging\n\n- Females experience aging, in terms of reduced litter sizes and longer inter-birth intervals. Early-life help received from other group members affects the total reproductive output, but does not appear to affect the slope of decline with age. \n\n- Similar decline in reproductive effort was not found in males, as testes size and the probability of mate guarding did not decline with age. It remains a possibility that actual fathering of pups does decline with age, but we do not have enough genetic data to test this yet. \n\n\n\nOxidative stress\n\n- Longitudinal analyses confirm that oxidative stress does not accumulate within an individual life-span; on the contrary, some individuals experience a reduction in levels of markers of oxidative stress, in both MDA and PC. \n\n- However, neither magnitude nor direction of change in marker levels predicted survival. \n\n- There were no sex differences in levels of any of the markers, corroborating the view that differences between the sexes are not because of differential aging process.\n\n- In short, oxidative stress measured by our methods, does not explain variation in individual life span or health. \n\n\n\nScope for future work\n\n\n\n- From our results it is clear that within-group social interactions, help and competition, both during growth and later on have a profound effect on reproductive fitness and life-span of females. Mechanisms remain elusive. \n\n- Next step is to explore what effect evictions and other sources of stress has on health, reproduction and aging and of females, and what mediates this. \n\n- This paves future work for exploring the role of stress hormones in aging; particularly in combination with shortening of telomeres, a potential mediating physiological effect linking stress and life-span in banded mongooses \n\n- With our methods, transient spikes in oxidative stress e.g. during growth or evictions could have gone unnoticed. Nevertheless, this damage, despite not accumulating, may have caused other types of decline which contributes to aging. Telomere length is a measure potentially linking transiet changes in levels of oxidative stress, to permanent cell damage and attrition. \n\n- Cortisol and telomere shortening could provide the ultimate link between social stress, reproductive aging and lower life-spans experienced by mongoose females. \n\n- Next challenge will be to linking effects of different types of stressors, to the indirect mortality effects of within-group conflict over reproduction. The problem of why some individuals in a population deteriorate with age more rapidly than others is of wide interdisciplinary interest. Most research has been conducted on laboratory model systems in pristine environments. However, there is growing realisation that more information is needed about patterns of senescence in natural populations exposed to predators, parasites, and pathogens. Our study is the first of this type on a wild mammal. This research complements laboratory studies of aging in rodents and other mammals and shows that levels of oxidative stress do not predict patterns of demographic senescence in a wild mammal population. The findings suggest that other proposed mechanisms for the physiological basis of senescence require further study, in particular, mechanisms of telomere dynamics and immunosenescence Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
