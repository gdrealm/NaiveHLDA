{"id":"DA4EA857-88EE-4EFB-8EB1-59FB54A06DD0","title":"Proposal for HPCx resources and support for the LESUK_3 Consortium (2006-2008)","abstractText":"The present proposal is the 3rd (LESUK_3)in a sequence begun in 1995 as part of a focussed initiative by a consortium of UK Universities to compete at world class level in developing and applying Large Eddy Simulation methods to complex engineering problems, with a particular emphasis on aerospace. The purpose of LESUK_3 is to produce accelerated devlopment of the LES technique where convincing demonstrations may be produced so that both academic and industrial CFD communities will recognise the benefits of LES and adopt this for future aerospace applications. The project is divided into work packages which give a balance between (i) addressing fundamental LES algorithm issues, and (ii) demonstrating to industry the progress achieved by applying the developed LES methods to a range of aerospace application challenges such as highly swept wings, noise generation from cavities, airfoils and jets, and vortex breakdown phenomena relevant to gas-turbine combustors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D053994/1","grantId":"EP/D053994/1","fundValue":"61541","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"James Joseph McGuirk","coPersons":["Michael  Leschziner","Dimitris  Drikakis","Zhiyin  Yang","Dominique  Laurence","Evgeniy  Shapiro","William  Jones","Gary John Page","Robert  Prosser"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
