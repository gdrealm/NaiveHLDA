The project examines the impact of women's economic and political protest on and through newspaper contributions. This will be measured in two cases.&nbsp; First women's protest role in the forgotten French outpost of Pondicherry, the main centre of population amongst small scattered territories ruled by France from the 17th century to 1962. Here female influence on anti-colonial consciousness emerged during violent episodes in 1948 but was first sparked in 1936-7 by industrial action. Many of the ephemeral broadsheet communications were written in Tamil. Second, the case of the collapse of The Pioneer newspaper (famous previously for employing Kipling), when advertisers withdrew their support due to pro-nationalist coverage of female boycotts, led by women from the Nehru family. The connection between coverage of protest and newspaper income prompts&nbsp; researchers to consider whether these two case studies are symptomatic of a broader change in the role of newspapers during 1928 through to 1948, when women took a leading role as supporters of independence.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3667","grantId":"RES-000-22-3667","fundValue":"56549","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Louise Chapman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Lincoln","findingsText":" Comparative trans-national research about the development of gendered citizenship in local communications demonstrates female influence on both economics and ideology - a neglected aspect of Indian history. This kind of in-depth study of the press can tell us a lot about how easy, or difficult it was to get ideas and information disseminated. In the case of The Pioneer, a short-lived liberal editor, F.W. Wilson, aimed to widen The Pioneer's readership to include the Indian middle class by featuring anti - colonial content. Establishment newspapers had to obey a triple imperative of embracing news values, reflecting ideological change and conveying political pressure, but colonial organs such as The Pioneer were affected in business terms by the economic and ideological maelstrom on which they were reporting. Wilson's support for the female cause at a time when the franchise in Britain was being extended, gave 'all things female' a public window but his liberal views made him a virtual outlaw in the colonial system. \n\n\n\nCoverage in establishment communications challenged existing colonial assumptions about indigenous women, but reports of their violent protests such as strikes, boycotts and cloth burning simultaneously weakened the economic resolve of British business and administrative authority. The nationalist movement's limited window of publicity also served to demonstrate the organisational capabilities of Congress as a ruling party, signposting the future importance of women's leadership role in post colonial India. \n\n\n\nHowever, The Pioneer gave most publicity to activities by women such as peaceful democratic conferences and other meetings involving discussions that furthered the move towards independence. Nehru articulated the significance of The Pioneer : 'For a while it was a live paper, the most readable in India. It amused or pleased or irritated or angered, but it was not dull. And now that Mr Wilson has left it, it has gone back to its old rut, and lest its hapless readers may be unable to find out what it is or what it stands for, it reminds them daily of &quot;law and order.&quot;\n\n\n\nIn French territories, the development of a significant workers' public voice for the first time represents a move from private to public sphere for disenfranchised Tamil working class women with only limited literacy. Often communications were read out loud during illegal mass outdoor meetings, then they were destroyed - but those records that remain reveal the roots of anti-colonialism. From 1934 onwards the Left in France prioritised anti-fascism in Europe because of the threat to Russia, but this meant that they neglected colonial deprivation. \n\n\n\nIndigenous communications centred on matters of social disempowerment and lack of civil, industrial and economic rights. The formation of legal worker organisations for the first time and a new political party provided the context in which writers of advocacy journalism adopted a twofold vertical and lateral strategy to promote their formative anti-colonial ideas. They needed to persuade French politicians (vertically) as well as their own people (laterally) that in Pondicherry campaigns for social and political reform had a wider significance for the future constitution. See above The research can be used to help create cultural awareness of heritage by Indian people who want to discover more about their country's recent past and how it was communicated. Equally, non-Indians who are curious about the role played by Indian women in colonial history and how aspirations for freedom and enhanced citizenship were communicated. In this case, activism can be inspirational, with role models from the past. Government/ Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
