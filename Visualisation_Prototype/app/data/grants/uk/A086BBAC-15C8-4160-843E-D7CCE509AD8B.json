Despite the significance of gaining a detailed understanding of the way in which written language is represented and generated, a relatively small amount of research work has been devoted to this task. This project aimed to advance our understanding of the processes underlying written word production, specifically investigating the extent to which handwriting is accomplished based on phonological (i.e., spoken) codes. A research method called &quot;persistent repetition priming&quot; was used, which is based on the observation that repetition of a word in reading or speaking results in a reduction of the time needed, on the scale of milliseconds, for its processing. Persistent repetition priming effects are long-lasting, detectable weeks after the initial presentation of a word. Persistent repetition priming effects have been previously demonstrated in the spoken domain (e.g., Wheeldon and Monsell, 1992) and can be used to investigate the processes and stages we go through (from meaning to articulation) every time we produce a word. \n\nThe first goal of this project was to document long-term repetition priming effects in a domain in which this has not been done before (handwriting). Additionally, the technique allowed us to address the central theoretical issue of the degree to which handwriting is autonomous from, or dependent on, the retrieval of spoken codes. To this aim, we investigated whether repetition priming can also be obtained across response modalities (i.e., from spoken onto written responses, and from written onto spoken responses) and with articulatory suppression (participants were asked to count aloud while writing). Five experiments were conducted to investigate these questions. As in previous studies, each experiment consisted of a study and a test phase. In the study phase, participants generated spoken responses to visually presented definitions (&quot;a furry animal that likes to chase mice?&quot; response: cat); in the test phase they named line drawings of objects. Considerable effort went into selection of suitable definitions and target objects. All target objects were presented to all participants, but only half of them, rotated across participants, occurred as definitions in the study phase. Participants were monolingual native speakers of English. Sentences (study phase) and pictures (test phase) were presented on a computer screen. Evaluation of priming effects focused on reaction time responses to pictures of repeated or non-repeated items in the test phase. The responses were either verbal or written. In case of verbal responses voice onset time was measured using a microphone. For recording of written responses pressure-sensitive graphics tablets and digital pens were used that allowed us to measure the initial time of contact; Participants wrote down their responses on a sheet of paper placed on the graphics tablet.\n\nThe purpose of the first experiment was to replicate persistent repetition priming effects previously observed in the spoken domain and thus establish that materials and procedures used in our project are comparable to existing research. Indeed, a robust repetition priming effect was found. The second experiment aimed to establish persistent repetition priming in the written domain. This study was identical to the first, except that rather than generating spoken responses, participants wrote responses down, both in the study and the test phase. The results showed a robust repetition priming similar in size to the one in the first experiment. To our knowledge this constitutes the first instance of documented repetition priming in the written domain. The following three experiments examined to what extend written responses depend on, or are autonomous from, phonological forms. In the third experiment, participants were asked to provide spoken responses to definitions in the study phase and written responses to pictures in the test phase. If spoken responses in the study phase cause repetition priming on written responses in the test phase, then both response modalities must to some extent share representations, most likely at the phonological level, i.e., handwriting is to some extent constrained by the same phonological codes that speaking is based on. The results supported this prediction. The fourth experiment examined priming in the reversed order of modalities: from writing to speaking. Here the possibility was assessed that when written responses are generated in the study phase this written output is read and phonologically re-coded by the writer as it is being generated. This would enhance the priming effect. The results again showed a significant repetition priming effect, Finally, the fifth experiment assessed the possibility that the effects from speaking to writing obtained in the third experiment might be due to silent pronunciation of written responses to pictures in the test phase of the experiment rather than reflecting a genuine priming effect from speaking to writing. To this aim, participants were asked to count numbers aloud in sequence while they were generating written responses to pictures in the test phase. It was predicted that this &quot;articulatory suppression&quot; technique may discourage participants from basing their written output on phonological codes (or phonologically encoding them post initiation). The results showed that this manipulation did not reduce the priming effect. \n\n The results of this project are very instructive. Long-term priming is apparently a robust phenomenon not only in the spoken, but also in the written domain. The results clearly suggest that phonology constrains written production. Overall, the project provided important insights into the dynamics of lexical access in speaking and handwriting. These findings pioneered the use of persistent repetition priming for the exploration of handwritten (rather than spoken) language. This technique is now more commonly used in research on handwritten language production. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
