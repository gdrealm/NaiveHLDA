Tourism and travel pose a major challenge for those seeking to reduce carbon emissions because of the high levels of mobility in contemporary societies and the value associated with travel and holiday taking. The applicants sought to develop their academic research on travel and the use of 'social marketing' as a potentially effective tool for promoting environmental behaviours. Social marketing aims to use conventional marketing techniques to promote a 'social good' and has been used extensively for tackling health challenges such as smoking, alcohol and drug abuse. Through drawing on both academic and practitioner expertise, the project explored the potential for using social marketing to promote rail travel as an alternative to short haul (domestic and European) flights for holidays. The project focused on two particular segments of the population that have been shown to have a higher propensity to take short haul flights more frequently: young professionals (aged 18 to 35) and ‘Empty Nesters’ (retired people whose children have left home). Through co-creation workshops, stakeholder meetings and the commissioning of an App developer, the project has developed a prototype App for public download that will promote rail as an alternative to air transport for holidays. The project has provided a case study of how to utilise co-creation as a technique for encouraging behavioural change and could be developed across a range of areas.
