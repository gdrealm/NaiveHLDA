Our research does not point to any 'crisis' or major shortcoming in research use in general. Research is used regularly, widely and at all levels of statebuilding policymaking and programming. While clearly strongest in DfID, there are signs that other departments, such as the FCO, MoD and the tri-departmental Stabilisation Unit are increasingly engaging with research, albeit to a limited extent. \n\n\n\nAnother general finding relates to the extremely varied types and levels of influence depending on such diverse factors as the country context, political situation, levels of instability, attributes of the research, precise policy issue at hand, and even the character of personnel at any given time. Perhaps most importantly, uptake can be greatly affected by attributes specific to the particular output in question, such as its focus, form, quality or presentation. All these points were especially apparent in our findings from the three case study countries as presented in the article, 'The Use of Statebuilding Research in Fragile Contexts: Evidence from British Policymaking in Afghanistan, Nepal and Sierra Leone' published in the Journal of Statebuilding and Intervention. \n\n\n\nA major finding is the presence of a process that we term 'cumulative influence'. This was particularly apparent with respect to the research on political settlements, which will serve as the basis for a forthcoming journal article. In this process, individual pieces may not appear to generate significant movement or influence in policy circles, but as such studies are complemented by further research, either by the same researchers or others, findings become part of a broader 'critical mass' of evidence which will in all likelihood eventually penetrate policy circles, shift thinking and catalyse policy change. The process is neither inevitable nor smooth; rather it is iterative, incremental, non-linear and ad hoc. The speed or extent to which this process takes place is determined by, amongst other things: prominent factors relating to the specific policy context; the existence or otherwise of various barriers and facilitators; and the effectiveness of available 'translation' functions.\n\n\n\nSuch influence as has been identified has been diverse, essentially capturing the full range of types described in the theoretical literature. Yet, whether influence was direct or indirect, this is not necessarily an accurate measure of its ultimate significance. In fact, our findings suggest that over time academic research - as opposed to directly commissioned analyses and reports - has had a more significant influence in shaping and framing broad policy approaches, and largely through more indirect forms of conceptual 'enlightenment' rather than the instrumental application of findings. Research funded by DfID was not consciously favoured by officials, and policy papers clearly demonstrate that a wide range of sources have been drawn upon. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that DfID funded research has achieved disproportionately higher influence overall.\n\n\n\nIn general, given the powerful role of chance and contingency, enhancing uptake is arguably about identifying and targeting certain discrete areas for improvement which build on existing strengths, encourage dynamic cultures of research use and promoting understanding between the producers and consumers of research. Our research has drawn attention to a number of prominent critical issues that remain to be fully addressed by both researchers and policymakers (and are presented in full in our report for DfID): designing realistic institutional incentives; developing staff skills and experience in handling and appraising research; improving the research component of inductions and pre-deployment briefings for officials taking up positions in country offices; revamping knowledge management structures, research repositories and institutional memory; enhancing efficient and effective intermediary services; supporting and promoting formal and informal knowledge-policy networks; building local research capacity; providing opportunities for secondments and exchanges across the research and policy worlds; optimising the substance and presentation of research; and strengthening the awareness and communication of existing research activities throughout government. The findings of the project hold out the prospect of significantly increasing the value for money of government funded research. In particular, the set of recommendations put forward could lead to more effective and efficient ways of utilising taxpayers money by increasing the uptake of commissioned research in policy.\n\n\n\nThe research may also indirectly promote better informed approaches and policies toward the development and security of fragile states and poverty alleviation, as officials improve and enhance their ability to manage, use and deploy available evidence and research in designing their programmes and determining broader trajectories of developmental assistance.\n\n\n\nThe project website will provide an open resource for anyone interested in the issues surrounded research uptake and influence, and many of the findings are transferable to other policy domains, especially within the social sciences where findings may be contested, concepts poorly defined and policy formulation in associated areas of public life pervaded by competing political agendas.\n Central to exploiting the findings of the research will be a dissemination event held at DfID in June 2014 in which we will present the project report, outline key findings and present suggested recommendations to relevant policymakers. Country office advisers and mangers will participate by video conference. This builds on an earlier event held at the House of Lords in 2013 at which we presented interim findings to a range of politicians, officials and non-governmental representatives.\n\n\n\nThe research team has produced a broad range of written outputs intended to reach a variety of relevant audiences, these include: mid-term papers outlining project progress (disseminated to officials in DfID); a co-authored book which will be published by Ashgate later in 2014; a shorter tailored policy report for DfID; and a number of articles published in established, high-quality and policy-relevant journals.\n\n\n\nIn order to maximise academic impact research team members have attended and presented at a number of academic conferences and research seminars, such as at Birmingham University and the International Studies Association Conference. We have also integrated our findings into teaching activities, such as on the PRDU's two Masters courses and at the PRDU/ODI's Advanced Course on Conflict, Crisis and Transitions. The more informal dissemination of the findings amongst prominent networks has taken place at various events attended by the research team, such as at Georgetown, Canberra and Harvard Universities.\n\n\n\nThe actual conduct of the research has also been important: indeed, participants frequently noted how they have reflected more on the issues raised simply by answering our questions in interviews or the survey and found the process itself enlightening. It prompted some to suggest that DfID does need to think more strategically about research uptake and has generated a lively discussion with government.\n\n\n\nThe project has also attracted the attention of the External Champion for RCUK's Global Uncertainties Programme as the grant was closing and we have now been invited to participate in an 'Enhanced Impact Scheme'.
