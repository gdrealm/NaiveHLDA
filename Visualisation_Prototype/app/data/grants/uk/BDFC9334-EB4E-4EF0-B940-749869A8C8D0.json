{"id":"BDFC9334-EB4E-4EF0-B940-749869A8C8D0","title":"Synthetic Biology of Bacterial Cell Division","abstractText":"Chromosome replication and subsequent segregation underlie the basic lfe process, as does the subsequent process of cell division, which must be coordinated with chromosome segregation. The aims of this project are to facilitate the synthetic biology of bacterial cell division and its relationship to chromosome organisation and segregation by uncovering mechanistic details of those processes in unperturbed bacteria and in squeezed bacteria growing in nanostructures. The understanding and novel reagents we generate will then be transferred to in vitro liposome experiments. This application was submitted too the ESF EuroSynBio initiative, and is one of four proposals recommended for funding. It is a collaboration between the Oxford Laboratory and Petra Schwille in Dresden and Cees Dekker in Delft, both of whom have received matching funding from their respective national agencies. Central to this project is the exploitation of a novel microscopic technique ['slimfield' microscopy], in combination with 4D multicolour epifluorescence microscopy, and controlled targeted protein degradation. Together, these allow us to visualize the assembly, action and disassembly of molecular machines that function in cell division, and chromosome segregation, and to relate their structure-function-dynamics to the processes of cell growth and chromosome-replication-segregation. The methods allow us to visualize single proteins in millisecond timescales, with ~ 5 nm precision, conditions when their position and action is not clouded by their diffusion or dynamic movement. Furthermore, we wish to visualize several components of macromolecular complexes simultaneously, and to be able to inactivate or remove specific components of a complex by using either small molecule inhibitors, or by targeted protein ablation. The molecular understanding that emerges from this work will be applied to my collaborators in vitro and 'squeezed' in vivo systems. 1.To determine the stoichiometry, spatial distribution, dynamics and turnover of divisome and related components. 2.To understand the sequential assembly of the divisome in time and space and to relate this to growth and chromosome replication-segregation. 3. To use targeted protein ablation to reveal organization of the divisome and how this relates to cell growth, chromosome organization and segregation. 4. To use the same techniques to investigate equivalent biological processes in squeezed cells [with Dekker] and model liposomes [with Schwille]. Reductionist biochemistry and molecular biology have been very successful at identifying proteins and characterizing them structurally and biochemically. Furthermore, classical genetics has been successful in identifying the types of biological process in which particular proteins functions. The challenge now is to determine how proteins function in the living cell; in particular where and when they function and in association with which other cellular components. The techniques used in the applicant's lab now allow us to approach this goal. This understanding will inform and facilitate the synthetic approaches adopted by the Dekker and Schwille laboratories.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I004785/1","grantId":"BB/I004785/1","fundValue":"355946","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Sherratt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
