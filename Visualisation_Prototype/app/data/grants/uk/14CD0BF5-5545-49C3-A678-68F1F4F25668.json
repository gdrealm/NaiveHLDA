The School is not committed to any particular social science paradigm, and covers both quantitative and qualitative methodologies.&nbsp;It seeks to ensure that its programme is varied, and that the courses offered are clearly structured, efficiently taught, and supported by appropriate and extensive learning facilities. In addition to promoting social science expertise, the School aims to provide participants with a stimulating scholarly environment, with easy interchange between young scholars, professional practitioners, and internationally recognised experts.</p> \n<p>The 39th Essex Summer School took place in July-August 2006. The School featured&nbsp;60 courses, and was attended by 596 participants from 356 institutions in 48 countries. The School was organised,&nbsp;in three two-week sessions; most courses were taught over two weeks, interspersed with a number of one-week and weekend courses and workshops. As the emphasis of the School is on imparting practical skills, the teaching on most courses is split between 'chalk and talk' and 'hands on' experience, most often in computer labs. With social science skills being much in demand, the training function of the School is meeting evident needs.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PTA-035-25-0036","grantId":"PTA-035-25-0036","fundValue":"78954","fundStart":"2006-07-10","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  PluemperEric Joel Tanenbaum","coPersons":["Elinor  Scarborough"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
