However, this procedure carries considerable risk and also implies indefinite immunosupression treatment associated with heavy side effects and eventual rejection. Furthermore, an increasing number of patients die while on the liver transplant waiting list due to the shortage of suitable organ donor. Therefore, new therapies are urgently needed to solve this growing health care challenge. However, the development of new drug against liver injury is currently impaired by the absence of appropriate in vitro systems for modeling liver pathophysiology. Indeed, current studies are mainly performed on animal models which rarely recapitulate all the aspects of the human disease. In addition, the use of animal is costly, not compatible with high trough put drug screening platforms and also ethically questionable. \n Consequently, the aim of this proposal is to address these limitations by developing an in vitro system to model liver disease in a dish using human induced pluripotent stem cells. This system will be compatible with large scale experiments and will only use human cells. Furthermore, its performance will be compared against mouse model to validate its interest for the replacement of model organisms. The resulting in vitro systems will provide an advantageous alternative to animal studies and also novel tools for drug development which will accelerate the delivery of useful therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/N001540/1","grantId":"NC/N001540/1","fundValue":"242470","fundStart":"2015-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-11-30","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Ludovic  Vallier","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
