In general, sensor nodes are capable of sensing, computing, and communicating. Therefore sensor networks are widely used in military battlefield surveillance. However, at the same time, as most sensor nodes are battery-powered, some functions may not be fully utilized and limited by certain constraints. To overcome power constraints of sensor nodes, the use of multiple local fusion centers (LFCs) could be effective, which allows building the WSN in a layered manner. A LFC will collect information from closely located sensor nodes. Thus, sensor nodes can save power. To share measured information for better estimation, the LFCs in a WSN are connected through a certain wireless mesh network. In this proposed project, we aim at developing i) distributed estimation methods at a local fusion; ii) iterative cooperation communication mechanisms between LFCs; and iii) performance analysis to optimize the performance with constraints.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H011919/1","grantId":"EP/H011919/1","fundValue":"117504","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jinho  Choi","coPersons":["Xinheng  Wang"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
