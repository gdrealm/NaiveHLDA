The hearts will be in live, developing zebrafish and mouse embryos. This is extremely challenging as the living heart is large (on a microscopic scale), is embedded in the body of the animal (meaning it must be imaged at depth) and is beating, and therefore moving, at a rate of around 300 beats per minute. As well as providing a challenge to demonstrate the advanced methods we will develop the study of cardiac development is important both for investigating the development of the healthy heart and for determining the causes of heart problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I010122/1","grantId":"EP/I010122/1","fundValue":"70430","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  we have published our data and are now building on this for further academic outputs Healthcare ","person":"Deborah  Henderson","coPersons":["Bill  Chaudhry"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" we have developed a new type of microscope that can be used to view whole embryos as they develop. Although this is not yet fully optimised, it should be useful for watching embryonic processes as they happen in real time once we complete the optimisation of this microscope, it should be of use to many biologists who wish to view morphogenetic processes in real time Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
