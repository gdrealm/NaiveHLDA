{"id":"2AEF55FE-0D6E-4B78-9AC5-61C5A7DC6AC3","title":"Functional significance of VEGF regulation by SRPK1","abstractText":"Human beings have remarkably few genes - about 22000 in total. Despite this we can make hundreds of thousands of different gene products - the proteins that make the body work. Each gene can generate multiple proteins by use of different parts of the gene - a process called alternative splicing. In this process different sequences coded by the DNA from the gene are stuck together to give a different message to make proteins. This is analogous to splicing together different scenes from a film to make different stories - cutting in a different ending can change a story from a tragedy to a romance. One of the most important processes in human development, normal function and disease, is how blood vessels grow and respond to injury - including in cancer, diabetes, blindness and kidney disease. Blood vessels require a balance between two types of the growth factor VEGF to work properly. These two types are made by this alternative splicing process. One type of VEGF makes new blood vessels that are leaky, grow into new tissue, and contribute to the most common forms of blindness (wet age related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy), kidney failure and cancer. The other type, made by splicing in a different ending to the protein, prevents new vessel growth and protects kidneys from failure in diabetes, and blindness and cancer in animals. The editing process that the cell uses to decide which of these two forms are generated has a number of steps in it, some of which provide specificity, to allow different forms of molecules to be made. We previously found that these steps are carried out by two proteins, SRPK1 and SRSF1. This project will find out how these molecules work, and whether inhibiting them can prevent blindness and hereditary kidney disease in animals. We will do this by using newly discovered drugs and genetic mouse models that have been developed to study these molecules, and by generating a new mouse model that will help us understand how SRPK1 works.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K020366/1","grantId":"MR/K020366/1","fundValue":"332422","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Bates","coPersons":["Sebastian  Oltean","Andrew Howard Salmon","Steven James Harper"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
