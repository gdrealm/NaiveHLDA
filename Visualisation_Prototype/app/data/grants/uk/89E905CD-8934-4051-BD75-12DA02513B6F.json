{"id":"89E905CD-8934-4051-BD75-12DA02513B6F","title":"Engineering Photonics: Sensor and Instrumentation Development and Application","abstractText":"This proposal is to provide a platform for our research programmes that develop and apply advanced engineering photonics sensors and instrumentation to provide innovative measurement solutions. These measurements enable advances in engineering and science across multiple areas recognised as strategically important by the UK government. These areas include aerospace, energy, manufacturing, health, environment and transport. \n\nCranfield's leading research in engineering photonics based sensors and instrumentation, around which this Platform Grant is focused, provides significant added value to all these themes.\n\nThe areas of research to be supported under this Platform Grant are:\n\n(i) Optical sensors and instrumentation for aerodynamic applications including evaluation on a flight test platform available owned and flown by Cranfield; a Scottish Aviation Bulldog aircraft\n\n(ii) Optical gas and chemical sensing\n\n(iii) Optical measurement technology for composite material process monitoring, health monitoring and impact detection\n\n(iv) Advanced optical sensors and instrumentation for point-of-care diagnostics\n\n(v) Novel optical instrumentation to support high added value manufacturing\n\n(vi) Sensors based on nano-structured films deposited on optical fibre devices","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N002520/1","grantId":"EP/N002520/1","fundValue":"1363270","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2020-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ralph Peter Tatam","coPersons":["Jane  Hodgkinson","Stephen Wayne James","Nicholas John Lawson","Seamus Patrick Higson","Alexandros Antonios Skordos","Thomas Owen Charrett","Helen  Ford","Peter  Foote"],"organisation":"Cranfield University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
