Although in numerical decline, it nonetheless, retains a membership of up to 60,000, representing up to one-in-five of the adult male Protestant population in Northern Ireland. </p> \n<p>Opposed to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the Order has been seen by critics within unionist politics as a barrier to the modernisation of unionism and movement towards more secular Northern Ireland. For its part, the Orange Order claims a moral and political rationale to opposition to the Good Friday Agreement. </p> \n<p>Despite its prominent position, there is no definitive information on what Orange Order members think of contemporary issues. This research aims to rectify that information deficit and to address the information gap concerning the political attitudes, roles and influence of the membership of the Orange Order. </p> \n<p>Drawing upon a large membership survey of the Orange institution,&nbsp;and abetted by in-depth semi-structured interviews, the research examines core political and social attitudes of Orange Order members, including the political and moral bases of opposition to, or support for, the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. The project will also examine the perceptions of the Orderâ€™s role as a large and significant religious-political organisation in an increasingly secular society.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1614","grantId":"RES-000-23-1614","fundValue":"49182","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James White  McAuley","coPersons":["Jonathan  Tonge"],"organisation":"University of Huddersfield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
