This research examined two uniquely successful community mobilisation projects led by sex workers in India, with the aim of understanding the social conditions that support effective grassroots development. The project investigated the role of three key sets of stakeholders: those who had significance for the projects’ public reputations (journalists, celebrities), practical, day-to-day functioning (police, local leaders), and strategic environment (politicians, government officers, funders).<br /><br />We found that project success derived from the projects’ strategic management of their relationships with powerful stakeholders. In addition to the better-known strategies of making polite requests, or mobilising adversarial collective protests, these successful projects engage in sophisticated political manoeuvring, offering their stakeholders incentives in return for their support. Doing politics in this way is made possible by: relative security of funding, ‘strength in numbers’, well-connected leaders, and establishing a respected public profile by challenging stigma and publicising achievements.<br /><br />A downloadable training module called ‘Getting stakeholders on your side!’&nbsp; was designed to disseminate findings to community organisations. Producing a special issue of the journal AIDS Care and 17 academic papers comprised the academic dissemination. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0193","grantId":"RES-167-25-0193","fundValue":"193870","fundStart":"2007-03-12","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Flora  Cornish","coPersons":["Catherine Magda Campbell"],"organisation":"Glasgow Caledonian University","findingsText":" We summarise our project findings in relation to our three research questions.\n\n\n\n1. How do social conditions constrain and enable successful community mobilisation?\n\n\n\nWe identified three interdependent dimensions of social conditions enabling the successes of community based organisations (CBOs).\n\n \n\n- At a material level, relative security of project funding has enabled the CBOs to focus on local and long-term priorities, resisting both a 'drift' of aims (to match shifting donor preoccupations) and funds with conditions counter to their community mobilisation aims. \n\n- At a relational level, both CBOs have forged profitable reciprocal relationships with powerful actors, enabled initially by well-connected founders/advocates with political know-how, and subsequently by becoming recognised change agents locally. \n\n- At a symbolic level, both CBOs adamantly challenged the stigmatisation of their members and acquired legitimacy through 'strength in numbers' combined with publicising their achievements. \n\n\n\nOur analysis highlighted that the CBOs do not simply absorb the powerful impacts of their social contexts, but that a primary reason for their success is their sophisticated active management of their relationships with the powerful actors who create their contexts. Hence the following question:\n\n \n\n2. What strategies do community organisations use to mobilise stakeholder support? \n\n\n\nThree types of strategies emerged, each with strengths and weaknesses: \n\n\n\n- Persuading (giving information or verbally requesting help - low risk but without leverage) \n\n- Protesting (mobilising collective protest - risks creating adversaries, but effective if the stakeholder risks embarrassment through public protest)\n\n- Exchanging favours (drawing the stakeholder into a reciprocal relation - risks making compromises, but can forge sustainable relationships of mutual benefit)\n\n\n\n3. What organisational processes best enable community mobilisation of traditionally marginalised groups? \n\n\n\nTwo features emerged most strikingly: \n\n\n\n- An articulate, resolute philosophy of empowerment: Both CBOs adamantly insist (often against the odds) that all their activities must promote sex workers' empowerment and mobilisation, and that sex workers have the capability and power to take important decisions and run interventions. \n\n\n\n- Leader-follower relationship - The public legitimacy of the CBOs has been maximised by well-connected, culturally and politically skilled non-community advocates and leaders. The leaders' public influence, in turn, has been made possible by representing large, organised, effective community organisations. \n\n\n\nOur primary conceptual contribution has been, at a general level, to suggest that development ought to be a process of producing means for poor people to exert leverage over the powerful actors who shape their environment. More specifically, we have begun to articulate the means available to poor people to do so. \n\n\n\nThese findings lead us to implications for social policies to promote community mobilisation: \n\n\n\n- Health/development policies concerning community mobilisation should incorporate 'stakeholder engagement' as a key component expected of community mobilisation projects. \n\n- Development agencies could play a brokering role in mobilising political will among a wide range of powerful social actors to create optimal conditions for community mobilisation.
