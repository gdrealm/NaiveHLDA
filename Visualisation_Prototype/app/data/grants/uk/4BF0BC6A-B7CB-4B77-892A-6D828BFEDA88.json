{"id":"4BF0BC6A-B7CB-4B77-892A-6D828BFEDA88","title":"Protein-protein interactions in the regulation of the cardiac sodium pump by phospholemman","abstractText":"Hormones such as adrenaline act on the individual cells of the heart (?myocytes?) to cause the whole heart to change its behaviour according to the needs of the body. This is an exquisitely regulated process that means the heart?s output matches the body?s requirements. Understanding how exposure to hormones causes the whole heart to change its behaviour is crucial in developing an understanding of what can go wrong in heart disease.\nWithin a myocyte, hormonal signals are transmitted into the cell by groups of proteins (protein ?complexes?). The way these complexes work depends on the proteins involved. We have evidence that a protein complex forms between two proteins, dok-7 and phospholemman. Phospholemman is responsible for transmitting signals from hormones to another protein, the sodium pump, one of the most important enzymes in the heart. The sodium pump is responsible for moving ions across cell membranes, and indirectly it controls many processes that keep the heart alive and allow it to beat. Understanding the relationship between dok-7, phospholemman and the sodium pump will greatly improve our understanding of the way the heart responds to hormones, and possibly why diseased hearts are less able to do so.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700903","grantId":"G0700903","fundValue":"351362","fundStart":"2008-03-18","fundEnd":"2011-03-17","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"William  Fuller","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
