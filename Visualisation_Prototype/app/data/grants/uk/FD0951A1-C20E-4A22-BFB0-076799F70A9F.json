{"id":"FD0951A1-C20E-4A22-BFB0-076799F70A9F","title":"Interactive whiteboards as pedagogic tools in primary schools","abstractText":"<p>The interactive whiteboard is fast becoming a common feature of primary classrooms in the UK and this country appears to be leading the world in introducing them. However, this is taking place in the absence of a clear conception of the whiteboards as communicative and pedagogic tools. </p>\n\n<p>Research so far seems to be predicated on the assumption that interactive whiteboards will transform teaching for the better. This project will use observations in four primary classrooms to provide a more detached and theoretically informed study of how whiteboards are used by teachers, in the context of established classroom practices, patterns of classroom interaction and educational goals. It will thus provide an empirically-grounded account of the use of this new technology and an assessment of its educational value.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1269","grantId":"RES-000-22-1269","fundValue":"45687","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil McKay Mercer","coPersons":["Judith  Kleine Staarman","Julia  Gillen","Karen  Littleton"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
