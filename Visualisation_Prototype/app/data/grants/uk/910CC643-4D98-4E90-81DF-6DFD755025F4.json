People who act in a more pro-environmental way in one dimension do not necessarily do so in another dimensions, and socio-demographic and attitudinal correlates of pro-environmental behaviour also vary between the behavioural dimensions. Policy measures intended to influence behaviour are likely to be more effective for different population subgroups depending on the specific nature of the behavioural change of interest. This has implications both for the marketing and targeting of initiatives and for the nature of the initiatives themselves, as these would ideally be tailored to the characteristics, constraints and motivations of people who tend to behave in particular ways.\nThere are also constraints to individual pro-environmental behaviour that may derive from the structure of the household the individual belongs to. There may be a life-cycle pattern of pro-environmental behaviour, which is higher for people living alone and for couples without children, but lower for people living in couples with children. Individual pro-environmental behaviour appears to be affected by partner’s behaviour and attitudes, and when dealing with pro-environmental choices that pertain to the household level, both partners’ behaviours and attitudes seem relevant for household decisions. Effective policies to minimise household’s carbon footprint will need to take into account that individuals’ decisions and actions depend on constraints generated by the other members of the household. We also find that that the ‘climate-gate’ had no impact on people’s pro-environmental attitudes.\nWe plan to expand these analyses to exploit the panel nature of the data when the second round of answers on environmental attidues and behaviours becomes available in November 2014.\nIn terms of energy consumption, we find that various household socio-economic characteristics such as household income, the presence of people of pensionable age, jobless, or in poor health have a statistically significant but moderate impact on per-capita energy expenditures. However, dwelling characteristics and especially household size have a much larger impacts in magnitude. Policies designed to improve pro-environmental behaviour of citizens may have a negligible impact given the recent socio-demographic trends, while policies influencing cohabitation and family size may have indirect – possibly large – impacts on the carbon footprint of the country.\nThose households who adopt domestic eco-technologies such as solar thermal and photovoltaic are more likely to be home-owners of (large) detached houses in rural areas and have marginally higher reported ‘environmentally friendly’ views and actions. These are also households with comparatively higher energy expenditures. Urban renters, household living in non-detached houses, those who report lower environmentally friendly views and actions and those who spend less on energy tend to be more likely to either reject (after serious consideration) the possibility of installing eco-technologies or face barriers and constraints to their adoption. Overall, the benefits of incentives to the installation of eco-technologies may accrue to the well off. The results of the project have a number of potential uses outside an academic context.\nThe findings related to drivers of energy consumption are clearly of value in providing insights for energy-demand reduction policy and highlight the need to look beyond information campaigns designed to manipulate social attitudes as these seem to have little relationship with pro-environmental behaviour. In particular two findings are of key relevance:\n- The importance of joint or dynamnic decision making and constraints in couple and multi-person or family households where the needs of others need to be accommodated;\n- The importance of occupancy levels and co-habitation in the per capita (and overall) reduction of energy demand implying a need to consider cross-departmental policies that can mitigate the demographic trend for increased sole-occupancy dwellings. \nThe analysis of the factors affecting the uptake of ‘energy technology’ are of direct relevance to DECC’s micro-generation and community energy policies and are also relevant to the installation sector in helping to understand future potential markets and untapped demand.\nFinally, the steps that have been taken during the project to demonstrate the critical value of linking reliable energy consumption data with dwelling characteritics and, crucially, a range of behavioural and socio-economic measures of the occupants has lead directly to plans to link UKHLS with DECC’s NEED data. We are also currently discussing with DECC how to include a consent question on wave 8 of UKHLS to allow linkage of UKHLS data to NEED data. We anticipate the linked data, which may be available in 2019, will be extremely useful for policy-relevant analysis within DECC and also, if appropriate data release is possible, in other sectors . These include energy sector market and consumer research activities where robust data of this kind will provide a step change in analytic and demand modelling capability.
