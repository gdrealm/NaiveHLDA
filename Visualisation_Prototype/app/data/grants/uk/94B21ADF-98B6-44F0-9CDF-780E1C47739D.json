This can extend life expectancy and quality, and allows resumption of day to day activities, but chronic rejection is a major problem. \n\nWe will carry out research into how small amounts of infection, which do not cause immediate clinical problems, might cause subsequent chronic rejection. This has previously not been considered significant, and therefore has not been studied. This area of research has been chosen because it is a strength of respiratory medicine in the UK. The Freeman Hospital is one of the worlds largest transplant centres, making the work feasible. The question of why lung transplants develop chronic rejection is of national and international importance.\n\nTo do our work we will be using very sensitive molecular methods to quantify low levels of infection, to see if there is evidence to suggest that this may cause inflammation and scarring of the airways. We believe that this causes progressive shortness of breath and chronic transplant rejection.\n\nNew antibiotic therapies have been used in chronic rejection and this seems to help some people, but no one knows how this works. We will perform a formal scientific study of this approach to improve the available evidence. We will also perform experiments with lung samples from transplant patients that aim to investigate potential mechanisms, and why some people do well but others do not. To allow these experiments we will grow transplant cells from small samples to give the larger numbers of cells needed. All of our work will be done using human samples because these are the most appropriate for our research.\n\nIt is expected that our results will show that even low levels of infection are a problem to lung transplant patients and that antibiotic treatment helps this. This would change how chronic rejection is treated and we think this may help to protect transplanted lungs and extend life expectancy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500705","grantId":"G0500705","fundValue":"526603","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Ward","coPersons":["John  Dark","Paul  Corris","James  Lordan","Andrew John Fisher"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
