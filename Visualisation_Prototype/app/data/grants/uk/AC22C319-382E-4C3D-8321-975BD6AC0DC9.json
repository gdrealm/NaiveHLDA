Previous research suggests that alcohol intoxication narrows attention, thereby making people more responsive to the most central and emotionally salient elements of a situation. In sexual assault, the culprit’s physical appearance and actions are the most emotionally salient aspects of the situation. Other aspects - such as the presence of bystanders and the physical environment, are considered peripheral because they capture less of the victim’s attention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this research, female participants will be given different doses of alcohol and then will read a sexual assault scenario. 24 hours later their memory for the scenario will be tested. The memories of participants who were given different doses of alcohol will be examined to see if they differ in terms of their accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>The research will also examine whether participants who were under the influence of alcohol whilst reading the scenario are more susceptible to memory distortion. The results will provide essential knowledge for establishing best practice guidelines for interviewing witnesses who were intoxicated. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J005169/1","grantId":"ES/J005169/1","fundValue":"68237","fundStart":"2012-08-11","fundEnd":"2015-01-19","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Heather  Flowe","coPersons":["Robyn  Holliday"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
