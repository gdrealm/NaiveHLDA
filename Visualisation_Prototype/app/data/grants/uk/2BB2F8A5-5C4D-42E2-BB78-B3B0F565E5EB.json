Using the multidisciplinary team assembled here, for the first time we will be able to answer specific questions about the comparative biology of germination, the function of key regulatory pathways, and the influence of these components on malting characteristics and brewing functionality. The project will provide new genetic resources for germination studies and present a framework for the successful transfer of information from Arabidopsis to cereals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F006934/1","grantId":"BB/F006934/1","fundValue":"505042","fundStart":"2008-02-25","fundEnd":"2012-12-24","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Holdsworth","coPersons":["Debbie  Sparkes","David John Cook"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" New scientific information about how plants grow Further scientific research Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education","dataset":"gtr"}
