Nationally and internationally concerns are repeatedly expressed that too often young people leave school with a fragmented and inadequate appreciation of history. Consequently, a central focus of the study is to discern the extent to which students acquire a coherent framework of knowledge that links past, present and future and vitally offers a usable structure to help young people make sense of their place in the world.</p> \n<p>Through written tasks and semi-structured interviews of students who (a) opt for history at KS4 and (b) abandon history after Year 9, the longitudinal study will explore students’ conceptions of the past during Years 10 and 11. Data for the study will be collected from 36 students in 3 different schools. Ultimately it is hoped that this study will provide a catalyst for other research. Indeed once more is known about students’ orientation in time, meaningful and practical recommendations for formal history education can be outlined.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1676","grantId":"RES-000-22-1676","fundValue":"45633","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"S  Foster","coPersons":["Peter  Lee","R  Ashby"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
