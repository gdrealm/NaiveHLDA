The behaviour that controlled their decisions was built-in through a specific model and information drawn from literature, data analysis and expert advice.

The central idea of attaching a behavioural framework to an agent-based model proved to be successful. Crime, retail and education examples were all developed (Malleson et al, 2010, 2012; Heppenstall et al, 2013; Olner et al, 2013; Birkin and Heppenstall 2011; Harland and Heppenstall, 2012, 2013). Summarising the main findings from each area:\n\n\n\nRetail: The methodology was applied to looking at the processes in the retail petrol market at a national scale (Scotland). The approach was found to be successful at replicating the main dynamic drivers in the system (Heppenstall et al, 2013). Rural/Urban divide in pricing was successfully replicated and predictions successfully made about which petrol stations were vulnerable to closure. Comparisons with previous work in this area (Heppenstall ESRC funded PhD), showed that incorporating individual behaviour to significantly improve the results; this research is currently being written up.\n\n\n\nCrime: The application to crime was entirely novel; the work from this area was the first example of a behavioural framework to be incorporated into an agent-based model for simulating the behaviour of burglars. This work was undertaken by the PI’s PhD student (Malleson) who worked alongside the main project researcher. Results correlated well with actual burglaries and showed areas vulnerable to burglaries after target hardening.\n\n\n\nEducation: The model was applied to looking at behaviour in school place allocation. By incorporating socio-demographic information, parental choice was explicitly accounted for. The model was run alongside that of the local LEA for allocation of school places (that matched the parental choice); the model was found to successfully allocate more pupils to schools of choice than the current system. The LEA have asked for this work to be extended.\n\n\n\nIn total six journal papers, one book chapter and two grants have come from the work in the project. There are 3 further papers in development. The work has been presented at both national (RGS, GISRUK) and international conferences (AAG, Geocomputation).\n\n\n\nThe work has already been extended by another funded ESRC project: Geo-spatial Restructuring of Industrial Trade (GRIT). In addition, further grants in health (MRC) and archaeology (Leverhulme) are currently under review. The PI plans on submitting a future grant looking at how to use this framework to simulate the effects of different climate change scenario’s on individuals, for example changing water usage or uptake of green technologies. The ability to realistically simulate an individual’s behaviour has a wide-ranging impact across all of the social sciences. For example, work from this project has been used to model the behaviour of burglars in a city and there are plans to further extend this work more generally for testing out crime reduction policies. The methodology that this approach derived is currently being used in another ESRC funded project (GRIT) to understand the short and long-term impacts on the UK economy of rising fuel costs. The microsimulation framework that was developed is now released under an open source licence and being used by researchers in the area of health, demographics and archaeology. A particular area of research that this framework is being used for is the simulation of ageing populations to identify where spatially stresses will appear in the NHS as the population ages. In the medium to long-term, the basis of this work potentially has great significance with the rapid uptake of agent-based modelling by researchers in different disciplines who are interested in understanding individual behaviour, how to change behaviour and the impact of different policies on an individuals course of actions.
