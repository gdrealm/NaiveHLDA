{"id":"331A6097-B828-49B0-ADBC-03619D4A4BD4","title":"Multi-Scale Modelling of Hybrid Perovskites for Solar Cells","abstractText":"Pioneering research into the development of hybrid halide perovskite solar cells as a viable alternative to existing technology has established a unique opportunity for the UK to maintain a highly competitive position in the development of photovoltaics. We are at the forefront of modelling work to understand the fundamental properties of these systems. The principle goal of the project is to establish a fundamental understanding of organic-inorganic perovskite technologies, identifying new target materials to accelerate technological development, whilst developing computational tools applicable across the entire field of solid-state materials research. Our team draws together a comprehensive range of expertise in photovoltaics, materials design and theoretical solid-state physics. The consortium involves two well-equipped universities and offers a powerful combination of expertise and infrastructure for materials modelling, bridging levels of simulation from fundamental theory to high-throughput screening, in the manner required for breakthrough discoveries in the field of hybrid photovoltaics. \n\nThe facilities and expertise available for the research programme will be enhanced by links to experimental groups provided by the EPSRC SUPERSOLAR Hub (EP/J017361/1). Critical mass and training targets will be achieved by linking the main research theme through our graduate programmes and Centres for Doctoral Training.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M009602/1","grantId":"EP/M009602/1","fundValue":"340645","fundStart":"2015-03-31","fundEnd":"2018-03-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Van Schilfgaarde","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
