It investigates the impact crime has on the mental health of individuals living in communities that have been subjected to crime, but who have not been direct victims of criminal actions. It also evaluates the economic costs in terms of induced mental health symptoms that constrain individuals from labour market activities. </p> \n<p>The paper therefore combines the literature on mental health and associations with economic activity with the literature on crime and its effects on the immediate community. Considering not only the direct impact of crime on the victims but also the indirect consequences of living in a community with a higher crime rate may lead to a more accurate analysis of the size of the consequences of criminal activities on the society. The research will help to gain a better&nbsp;understanding of the total societal cost of crime, to both victims and non-victims&nbsp;and&nbsp;could help improve public policy.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1979","grantId":"RES-000-22-1979","fundValue":"78764","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Francesca  Cornaglia","coPersons":["Christian  Dustmann"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
