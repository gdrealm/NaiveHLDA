The development of such a research network will be aided and informed by a scoping study of open source creative communities and a research workshop. \n\nA scoping study will be conducted examining four creative communities that utilise technology to create and publish digital manual(s): FakePress Publishing (Italy/global), FLOSS Manuals (Netherlands/global), UpStage (UK/New Zealand/global), and Sauti ya Wakulima (Spain/Tanzania). These case studies reflect upon the nature of co-creation in networked communities that are international, multi-locational and transcultural. Employing qualitative research methods (semi-structured interviews and focus groups), the research team will investigate the structures of power within these creative communities. The case studies will explore representations and understandings of multi-authored digital texts and changing notions of authorship, control and power.\n\nThis project defines the Digital Manual as a model of emergent multi-authored publication employing open source and co-creative practices and each of the above communities employ a slight different type of Digital Manual. Such digital manuals, emerging forms of the book, function as a resource and platform for digital practitioners, including artists, in their use and manipulation of technology for new forms of writing and publishing. More broadly, studying the digital manual relates to concerns with emerging forms of authorship, production and knowledge-making and how these might be intrinsic to processes of social formation. \n\nFor example, FakePress Publishing provides a series of ubiquitous technology and augmented reality publishing platforms as well as online workshops which function as a resource for other digital practitioners, new media artists, university students and individuals interested in learning about these new forms of publishing. FakePress Publishing also organises domestic and international workshops for different audiences (e.g. web designers, digital artists, university postgraduate courses and secondary education programmes). Both these activities allow the members of FakePress Publishing to share practices as well as co-create digital publications and enable a physical and virtual creative community to form. Engaging the structures of interpersonal relations within this type of emerging creative community can help in investigating shifts in authority and voice, within co-creative practices, more widely. Further, open source philosophy underlies the aims and activities of the community. This indicates presence of motivations, meanings and value associated with use of open licensing as well as the process of collaborative authorship. This has wider implications for understanding changing notions of control and ownership over creative output in the digital era as well as potential to inform regulatory frameworks, such as copyright law. \n\nThe final stage of the project will be a two-day workshop where network members and case study participants will participate in a series of discussions on the findings of the scoping study. During the workshop, the research team will aim to identify possibilities for future collaboration and the establishing of a consortium to investigate themes and issues emerging from the project. This project, through empirical knowledge gathered from primary research and development of a research network of experts on the topic (academics, practitioners and artists), will be a stepping stone for further in-depth study of digital co-creation and publication.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J012769/1","grantId":"AH/J012769/1","fundValue":"21882","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Penny  Travlou","coPersons":["Smita  Kheria"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
