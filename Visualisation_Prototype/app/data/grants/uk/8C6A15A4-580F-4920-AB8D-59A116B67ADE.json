{"id":"8C6A15A4-580F-4920-AB8D-59A116B67ADE","title":"Slum Tourism in the Americas: Commodifying Urban Poverty and Violence","abstractText":"This trilateral research project investigates slum tourism in four cities in the Americas: Los Angeles,\nMexico City, Kingston, and Rio de Janeiro. Drawing on a multi-sited ethnographic approach, this project\naims to theorise the commodification of urban poverty and violence in the context of global mobilities\nand urban political economies of spectacle. The research has a twin focus on the political economy of\nslum tours and their representational-performative politics. Its objectives are to ask: Through what\nrepresentational strategies do different actors negotiate the slum's &quot;place-in-the-world&quot;? How is violence\naestheticised and performed as part of symbolic economies based on cultural production and\nconsumption? What new social relationships and subjectivities are produced through the &quot;slum tourism\nencounter&quot; between slum-dwellers, tourists, tour operators and state actors? Our approach to slum\ntourism is original and important for several reasons. First, our cross-city, comparative research will\nallow us to distinguish between generalisable patterns and the idiosyncratic features of individual cities.\nThis is particularly relevant as slum tours are increasingly popular and influential in constituting the\nrepresentations of urban poverty on a global scale. Second, where existing work largely focuses on\ntourists as consumers, we also ask how a broader range of actors connect in the &quot;slum tourist encounter&quot;\nto convert the slum into a tourism product. Third, this attention to both production and consumption\nlinks to the project's central focus on the aestheticisation and performance of violence in slum tours.\nFinally, this project is innovative methodologically: its multi-sited, longitudinal and ethnographic research\nis both a challenge to most existing methodologies on slum tourism and the most appropriate means to\ninterrogate the performativity of the &quot;encounter&quot;, to establish knowledge on poverty and violence. The\nresults will be relevant for academic and non-academic stakeholders (residents, civil society, urban\ndevelopment and tourism policymakers). The trilateral research is part of on-going efforts to connect\nnational disciplinary traditions and develop European interdisciplinary urban studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M001970/1","grantId":"ES/M001970/1","fundValue":"447746","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-06","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth Alun Jones","coPersons":["Alessandro Massimo Angelini"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
