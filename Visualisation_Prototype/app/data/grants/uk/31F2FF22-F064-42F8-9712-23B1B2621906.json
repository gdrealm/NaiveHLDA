The earlier research indicated a considerable demand for assistance in defining more sustainable and effective approaches to charitable and philanthropic activities amongst charitable organisations, the general public and the corporate sector. This project will utilise these findings to generate a more professional and effective approach amongst Sri Lankan philanthropic institutions.</p>\n\n<p>One strand of activities involves workshops for relevant personnel to gain experience of best practice in the utilisation of charitable funds in development interventions. This will not only deal directly with charity and philanthropy but also with broader issues of how such resources can be harnessed to produce a more dynamic and sustainable approach to poverty elimination.</p>\n\n<p>The second strand consists of a pilot project in one relatively poor area of Colombo bringing together a range of charitable organisations and the local population. The aim of this strand is to encourage inter-agency cooperation, build organisational capacity to design and implement initiatives which address the underlying causes of poverty rather than symptoms, and develop 'toolkits' for use in other contexts.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L007819/1","grantId":"ES/L007819/1","fundValue":"58278","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Roderick Lennox Stirrat","coPersons":["Filippo  Osella"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
