{"id":"FA1FEE14-C6F5-492B-AE51-BD8035A3D66E","title":"Children's psychological adjustment and fathers' residence, parenting and traits","abstractText":"<p>Despite recent progress there are important issues that research on fathering and children's behaviour has not addressed. These include concerns that bidirectionality is not taken into account, and that little emphasis has been given on testing the additive and multiplicative effect of maternal and paternal mental health on children's behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>This study will use longitudinal data from the Millennium Cohort Study to fill these gaps. In particular, it will explore bidirectional links between child's behaviour (measured at 9 months with the Revised Carey Infant Temperament Scale) and father's transitions in and out of residence, and it will investigate the relationship between early father's parenting and later child's behaviour (measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 3 years) and the relationship between early child's behaviour (at 9 months) and later father's parenting (at age 3 years) both in resident and in non-resident father families. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, it will explore both the direct effect of father's mental health on child's behaviour at age 3 years and the effect of the interaction between father's and mother's mental health on later child's behaviour, and it will model the family-level mental health effect on child's behaviour in two parent families.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F028083/1","grantId":"ES/F028083/1","fundValue":"43163","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Eirini  Flouri","coPersons":["Lars-Erik Joakim Malmberg"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
