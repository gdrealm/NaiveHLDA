Our focus will be phonology of &quot;home signs&quot;, a communication system invented and used by a congenitally deaf child growing up with hearing family without exposure to conventional sign language.</p>\n\n<p>There are two foundational principles for phonology, which will be relevant for the proposed project.The first principle (&quot;duality of patterning&quot;) is that a set of elements that are not meaningful themselves (sound or handshape categories) combine and form meaningful units (words). Another important principle (&quot;discreteness&quot;) is that the meaningless elements are discrete and categorical, as opposed to continuous.</p>\n\n<p>We will investigate the type of handshapes used in home signs to examine whether home sign systems have these foundational properties for phonology seen in conventional sign languages such as British Sign Language and spoken languages such as English and Chinese. If so, we would have evidence that the foundation for phonology is a developmentally resilient property of language.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J00362X/1","grantId":"ES/J00362X/1","fundValue":"78229","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sotaro  Kita","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
