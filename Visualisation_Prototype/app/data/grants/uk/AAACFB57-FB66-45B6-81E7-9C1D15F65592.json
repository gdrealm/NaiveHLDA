Even at the level of a single cell, molecular biologists and geneticists are able to measure amounts of molecules such as proteins and RNAs, and to begin to unravel the connections between molecules that make up the pathways and processes that keep the cell functioning. Our knowledge of the interaction of molecules and genes comes from many sources. These include studies of the three dimensional structure of proteins, from which their function can be inferred, through to in vitro and in vivo studies that show how genes, and the molecules that switch them on and off, interact in the test tube, and in a key single cell organism such as yeast, or higher plant such as Arabidopsis thaliana. The way that molecular systems are described is changing from the traditional diagrammatic sketch of likely interactions, to a set of mathematical equations linking the rates of change of one molecule with the amounts of others. When the number of molecules is small, a set of stochastic reactions becomes a more accurate representation than a set of ordinary differential equations. But in both cases, finding the best fit between a mathematical model and data from the laboratory becomes a major problem. A second important issue concerns the justification for decisions made in modelling a biological system. We might like to say that only one model describes the data - but this is not possible for any complex system. Instead, we can hope to show that one model fits the data better than another, and this is the aim of the research proposed here. We shall apply a probabilistic approach that can optimise the fit of models to data, and quantitatively compare the extent to which they fit the data. This will provide useful information to the bench biologists and the systems biologists with whom they collaborate to further our knowledge of the cell.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I023429/1","grantId":"BB/I023429/1","fundValue":"14715","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ozgur Ekim Akman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
