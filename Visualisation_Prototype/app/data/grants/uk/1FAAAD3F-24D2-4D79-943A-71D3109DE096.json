A particular empirical contribution arose from data being gathered on the views of both parents and non-parents, enabling for the first time detailed comparisons of school choice attitudes between these groups. Drawing on political and moral philosophy with an ambitious interdisciplinary approach, the project tested attitudes towards the morality of choice in the abstract, a neglected area of research relative to that which focuses on the lived experiences of parents. Consideration of the possible impact of choice on the 'ethical environment' constitutes an innovative angle on the measuring of school choice effects. The project showed that support for 'choice' in education should not be taken at face value; scratching beneath the surface leads to an uncovering of complex and contradictory beliefs about the desirability of public service market reforms. \n\nFollowing an initial publishing of findings, journal articles were published. Findings prompted lively discussion at national/ international academic conferences. Sonia Exley was invited to talk about the project at Manchester University and academics have used the project's findings in blogs and the national media. The project has impacted on teaching at LSE, Bristol University and the IoE, London. Data has been deposited as a public resource at the UK Data Archive and indeed data has been used already by Oxford University academics. The project contributed to enhanced research capacity and methodological understanding through survey design in a new and complex terrain.\n \nUpon publication of the 28th BSA Report findings, public debate on school choice was also informed via press releases and media coverage in the national press and discussion pieces on popular non-academic blogs across the political spectrum. Following wide circulation of a research briefing about the project to relevant policy stakeholders, grassroots campaigning organisations set up in order to promote and defend local comprehensive schooling in Britain have made use of data from the project, as has the Institute of Government. Evaluating the possible impact of changes in government policy and shifts towards greater numbers of Academies and Free Schools in England, the Academies Commission made use of findings from the project on its website and in a major report (following an invited submission of formal evidence from the project to the Academies Commission). Representatives from the Department for Education (DfE) have engaged with the project through a meeting set up at DfE, attendance at a formal dissemination event held at LSE and the DfE commissioning of a report which included referencing of data from the project. Finally engagement with and influence on DfE policy processes has also occurred through the DfE processing of 'early release' formal evidence from this project which was submitted (and publicised online) to a government consultation on the Revised School Admissions Code in England in August 2011. The formal dissemination event for the project held at LSE in 2012 was attended by representatives from a number of important non-academic (as well as academic) stakeholders.

Although most in Britain believe parents ought to put their own child first when choosing schools, most also believe parents ought to consider the needs of other children. Only 4% believe facilitating school choice ought to be top policy priority within education. Most do not support private schools or believe it acceptable for parents to avoid schools on the basis of pupil backgrounds. There are low levels of support for actions such as moving house or feigning religious interest in order to access 'better' schools. \n\nWork in Social Policy and Administration examined the way in which government policy emphasis on public support for choice ignores simultaneous support for neighbourhood schooling, disapproval of education 'vouchers' and only low support for measures such as subsidising school transport costs in order to facilitate choice. Support for choice in Britain is instrumental rather than intrinsic - problematic given inconclusive evidence on the extrinsic benefits of education quasi-markets. Work on parental partiality and the potential ramifications of parental decisions to 'go private' on the wider ethical environment has been published in the British Journal of Educational Studies. While attitudes in general between parents and non-parents on school choice are less different than one might expect, parents who have made decisions to send children to private school are noted as expressing significantly more individualistic views about education, even after controlling for wider political attitudes. It is expected that secondary analyses of data from this project will take place in the future. Data have been submitted at the UK Data Archive and the BSA survey is one of the Archive's most frequently requested datasets. There is scope for possible future cross-national collaborations on attitudes towards school choice and a possible repeat fielding of questions designed for this project on a future wave of the BSA survey, examining change in attitudes over time (particularly given an era of major policy change in England in this respect). Scientific impacts in the academic community are expected from recently published journal articles. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
