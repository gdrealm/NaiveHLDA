The burden of leishmaniasis falls disproportionately on the poorest segments of the global population, including within Brazil, where there are 30,000 cases/year. Leishmaniasis diagnosis and treatment are expensive and many of the drugs used are not fit for purpose; drug resistance is an increasing problem. Public investment in treatment and control would decrease the leishmaniasis disease burden and help to alleviate poverty, yet more research is required to facilitate implementation. This project aims to increase capacity in Brazil for early phase drug discovery by enhancing research links between the UK and Brazil in the molecular, cell and immunobiology of Leishmania parasites.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M026167/1","grantId":"MR/M026167/1","fundValue":"47884","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy Charles Mottram","coPersons":["Paul Martin Kaye"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
