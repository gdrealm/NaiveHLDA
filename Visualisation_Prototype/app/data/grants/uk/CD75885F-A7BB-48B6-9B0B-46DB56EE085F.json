{"id":"CD75885F-A7BB-48B6-9B0B-46DB56EE085F","title":"PERFORMANCE COMPARISON OF TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING DOUBLY-FED GENERATOR TOPOLOGIES FOR GRID-CONNECTED WIND POWER APPLICATIONS","abstractText":"Currently the accepted technology for large wind turbines is the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). This technology is popular primarily due to the reduced cost of the partially rated power electronic converter. On the negative side is the fact that the generator requires brushes and slip rings which require regular maintainance.An alternative scheme is based on the brushless doubly-fed reluctance machine (BDFRM) which also has the cost benefit of a partially rated power converter but as its name implies does not require brushes and slip rings.The BDFRM has not been used for a wind power application. This project will experimentally examine its performance for a wind power application. There are a number of different approaches to the control of a BDFRM. The project will examine the use of Direct Power Control (DPC). This control approach will include sensorless operation and machine parameter independence. With the proliferation of wind power generation the issue of power system stabilty is of great concern. It is important to examine the fault-ride-through (FRT) capabilty of any generation system. This project will examine the FRT capability of the BDFRM and compare this to that of the DFIG. This will require that special grid fault emulation equipment is included in the laboratory test rig.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F06148X/1","grantId":"EP/F06148X/1","fundValue":"132897","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  There has been an increasing interest in the BDFRG technology from reputable industrial companies foremost in renewable energy sector (e.g. Rolls Royce, Siemens and others) where the former is being considered as a prospective alternative to commercial DFIG owing to the energy savings and smaller pay-back periods as well as superior fault-ride-through performance it may potentially offer especially in wind power applications.

The proposed control approach is entirely parameter independent and in many respects superior to all the existing model-based BDFRM algorithms reported in the open literature; \n(3) Essentially the same controller configuration could be used for the DFIG and similar advantages over the presently available control schemes for this machine could be achieved;\n(4) Avenues for further collaborative research with the industrial and/or academic partners on the project and wider have been opened. The research and industrial communities should be in a much better position to judge the merits of potential BDFRG use not only in grid-connected wind-turbine (or hydro) electricity generation but also in a variety of other markets traditionally served by DFIM including large pumps, compressors, fans, commercial heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, where the lower cost of the BDFRM, afforded by its brushless design, would ensure the energy savings and smaller pay-back periods. The BDFRG technology may also be an ideal candidate for off-shore wind power applications where it can offer improved reliability and lower operation and maintenance costs than the DFIG.\n\nThe main beneficiaries of the project results would be wind power industry and manufacturers of wind turbines (as well as electric drives in general due to the wider applicability of the project outcomes), as the research being undertaken would be of immediate relevance to them. This is foremost the case for collaborating countries, China, as one of the world's leading producers of wind energy, and UK, having the best wind resource in Europe. The consideration of promising generator topologies offering potentially significant cost benefits at competitive performance is an important research direction of common interest to the project partners and other parties in energy sector, and a solid foundation to sustain and further develop their collaboration in the future. Control of electric machines is an area of continuing interest to the broad international community, in both industrial and academic circles. The beneficiaries are therefore expected to be British and international electric equipment manufacturers through advancement in general knowledge on BDFRG/DFIG control.
