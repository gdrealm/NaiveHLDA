In order for the body to function properly these cells have to communicate with each other. They communicate by sending out signals that can be recognized by other cells through the activation of receptors on their cell surface. In turn, these activated receptors stimulate cells to react and change their behavior. The signal is stopped by removal of the activated receptors from the cell surface by uptake into small vesicles. This process is called 'endocytosis'. Endocytosis is important for the normal functioning of our body but if it 'goes wrong' it can lead to disease. For example, in the case of many cancers activated receptors might not be taken up efficiently and hence stimulation from these receptors might increase causing cells to grow uncontrolled. We propose to study the basic mechanisms of endocytosis of growth factor receptors using single cells cultured in the laboratory. We will analyze how cells normally control the uptake of receptors using biochemical approaches. We will also visualize individual proteins recruited to the vesicles by labeling them with a fluorescent dye. This will allow us to analyze the recruitment in living cells in real time using a microscope. Our study might permit us to uncover the role of the different proteins for the uptake of the receptors. The outcome of the project will give novel insights into the normal function of individual cells within our body and in the long run may provide the knowledge for the development of targeted therapies for diseases with altered receptor signaling such as cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G00319X/1","grantId":"BB/G00319X/1","fundValue":"362507","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We envision that the results from our research will form the basis for the better understanding of pathways regulating cell proliferation, axonal morphogenesis of neurons, and endocytosis of growth factor receptors. Since detailed knowledge of these pathways are required for drug developments, we envision that our results will create impact in endeavours by drug companies to develop novel targeted drugs.

We found that Lamellipodin is required for EGF-induced cell proliferation (Dev Cell, 2008). \n2. We discovered that c-Abl phosphorylation of Lamellipodin regulates its interaction with Ena/VASP thereby controlling dorsal ruffling of fibroblasts and axonal morphogenesis (Curr Biol, 2010). \n3. We discovered that Lamellipodin, endophilin and Mena cooperate to facilitate F-actin dependent endocytosis of the EGF receptor (EMBO J., 2013). Our research outcomes are actively being followed up by the academic research community and the results are of interest to the pharmaceutical industry.
