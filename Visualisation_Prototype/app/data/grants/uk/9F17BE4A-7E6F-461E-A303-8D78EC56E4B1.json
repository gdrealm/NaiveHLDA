This will be the first time that such a method has become available and will greatly facilitate future field studies which will be necessary for the improvement of anti-parasite drug distribution, evaluation of new drugs and vector eradication from isolated foci.\n\nAll known species will be collected from tropical Africa and identified by chromosome examination of larvae using the unique expertise brought together by this project. Novel identification assays will be developed by designing DNA primers for the Polymerase Chain Reaction across the breakpoints of the chromosomal rearrangements by which each of the species is defined. This will be achieved by laser-dissection of the chromosome differences and molecular characterisation of the differences through sequencing. This approach to identification has the advantage that it is based on the chromosomal characters of the larvae which are used to define a sibling species in the first place, but it is applicable to all life stages.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600015","grantId":"G0600015","fundValue":"462381","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rory James Post","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
