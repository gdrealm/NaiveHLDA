The purpose of this project is to develop the necessary knowledge base and the material and conceptual (computational) resources to establish the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida as the vehicle for implementing biological activities into a whole range of industrially-related processes. Mathematical modelling has become a common approach in most engineering disciplines. In general, this approach yields models that give a very accurate description of the system. However, predictions from such models are not meaningful or useful unless the model can be validated against collected experimental data. To achieve this, we must estimate certain parameters within the model to match the model predictions with collected data / the identification problem. The work in this proposal sets out to integrate modelling, experiment design and validation, and control and optimisation into a single framework that would lead to increased productivity and reduced experimental costs. The integration of these three research tools represents a unique, novel, and interdisciplinary approach to addressing the complicated research and industrial problem of model-based control and optimisation of the culture processes. It builds on existing work carried out by the authors and seeks to integrate various models developed with the ultimate goal of model-based control and optimisation of culture processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F003560/1","grantId":"BB/F003560/1","fundValue":"286516","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Athanassios  Mantalaris","coPersons":["E  Pistikopoulos","Andrew  Livingston"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
