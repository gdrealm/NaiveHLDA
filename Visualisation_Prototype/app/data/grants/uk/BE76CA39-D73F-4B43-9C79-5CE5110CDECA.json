{"id":"BE76CA39-D73F-4B43-9C79-5CE5110CDECA","title":"Haptic Experiments: Kinaesthetic Empathy and Non-Sighted Dance Audiences","abstractText":"This project explores how the innovative combination of existing motion tracking and haptic technologies can support non-sighted audience members to experience viscerally the movements performed by dancers during live dance performances. In this way, such audience members might achieve a deeper emotional engagement with the choreographic works they attend. The project builds on existing recent research on the concept of kinaesthetic empathy. This refers to how sighted audience members respond kinaesthetically, yet in culturally specific manners, to the movements they watch, and how this might trigger associations between the movements they watch and their personal experiences of such movements.\n \nThe project combines affordable and reasonably accessible technologies, such as the toy Kinect to track the motion of the dancers, and a specifically built haptic pad supported by miniscule vibrotactile motors. These motors can produce a repertoire of vibrations of different intensities and speeds across different areas of the pad, thus providing a mapping of the changes of the dynamic qualities of the performance event. Non-sighted users will be invited to explore with their fingers this haptic landscape (in a similar way that they do when reading Braille). This approach has been designed as an equivalent to how sighted audiences use their eyes to explore the performance space in order to capture the dance performance as it unfolds through time. \n\nHaptic technology which supports tactile devices is increasingly employed for the visually impaired to assist, negotiate, understand and investigate their immediate surroundings. Tactile devices engage users through their sense of touch, by combining tactile perception with kinaesthetic sensing (i.e., the position, placement, and orientation) through appropriate haptic interfaces. However todate this technology has not been used to assist access of visually impaired persons to movement-related events and spectacles, such as dance performances, or sports events. A small number of dance companies have used verbal descriptions of the movement activities, however this is very limited, due to language restrictions and because it interferes with the musical accompaniment of the performance.\n\nIn this scoping study the basic principles of extracting movement parameters from motion tracking data and mapping them on the vibrotactile pad will be examined to unable future research which will involve more sophisticated collection and transmission of movement information. The study will include experimental workshops with non-sighted participants, and the development of a small network of interested parties, both academic and non-academic, involving groups of visually impaired users, organisations for the support of visually impaired, relevant industry and funders. This network will be constituted in the final phase of the project to maximise opportunities for varied feedback and identification of resources for the future development of this scoping study into a fully fledged research project.\n\nThis project draws from the potential of current technologies to offer much wider access to the aesthetic experience of dance performances for visually impaired audience members, and simultaneously challenges assumptions about how audiences receive dance performances, which might encourage choreographers to expand their working methods. It also seeks to stimulate new developments in the use of haptic technology for the visually impaired both in relation to their access to dance and other movement-related activities, such as sports activities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J012890/1","grantId":"AH/J012890/1","fundValue":"23284","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  1) A workshop led by our Research Team in the Royal School for the Blind indicated the strong potential of this project to provide an educational tool which could enhance interaction between blind children, and also encourage them to expand and develop their movement vocabulary and range of movement qualities.\n2) Several exploratory sessions undertaken with dance students at the University of Edinburgh, as well as dancers from the Scottish Ballet (following the end of the Digital Transformations funded part of the project) indicated the choreographic potential of this project.

A prototype under the name Choreo-haptic was completed as part of the first phase of the project, which was funded by a Digital Transformations Research Development fund. Blind users place their palms and fingers on a pad and receive vibrations which aim to make them feel aspects of the movement, such as softness or circular patterns, while dancers perform live. The popular technology of Microsoft Kinect was used to track the dancers' movement together with small size vibrating motors embedded in a pad that respond real-time to the data received from the Kinect. While still in its infancy, the Choreo-haptic has generated very enthusiastic responses amongst blind participants who tested it. Once fully developed, the new device could offer blind people a much better access to the experience of viewing dance, than the traditional method of audio description, which has been used up to this point to support blind audience members of dance and theatre performances. This approach could be developed further to enhance the attendance of other movement-based activities (such as sports) for both blind and sighted people.
