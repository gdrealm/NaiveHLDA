While there have been improvements in CRC treatment, it remains a significant killer, with 16,000 deaths in 2011. Research by ourselves/others has revealed that a &quot;one size fits all approach&quot; will not work, as genetic changes in their CRC cells can cause treatments to fail in particular patients. This increased understanding has given rise to the concept of &quot;stratified medicine&quot;, where testing a patient's sample prior to treatment can indicate which therapy works in this particular patient. This &quot;stratified&quot; approach also allows patients who will not respond to be spared the often toxic side effects. Recognising the need to provide treatments leading to better survival/Quality of Life (Qol), a group of researchers, clinicians, patient groups and industry have formed a consortium (S-CORT), harnessing its members expertise to develop new approaches to stratify patients to improve outcomes, thus delivering real benefit for CRC patients.\n\nS-CORTs objectives are to:\n1. Create a consortium united in the common goal to employ stratified medicine to yield better survival and QoL for CRC patients\n\n2. Build on discoveries by S-CORT researchers to identify particular stratification approaches for patients receiving different therapies for CRC. Three priorities have been established\n\na. While the drug Oxaliplatin has increased our options for treating CRC, approximately 50% of patients don't respond and develop side effects that can affect their nervous system and reduce their QoL. Being able to decide in advance which patients respond, allows those patients to receive the drug while sparing non-responders the toxic side effects\nb. ChemoRadiotherapy (CRT) is used in the treatment of rectal cancer, but 40% of patients with locally advanced disease gain no benefit. A stratification approach may not only indicate which patients to treat, but also allow design of new approaches to make RT more effective\nc. In early disease, some patients can have aggressive cancer which invades other parts of the body. Identifying these patients in advance of treatment would allow them to receive more extensive surgery/RT while those with less aggressive disease can be treated with local rectal preserving treatment\n\n3. Establish a more complete understanding of the precise changes that occur in the genes and proteins of CRC cells and use this information to provide novel therapies for patients\n\n4. Develop our best candidates into clinical tests that select patients for the therapies that have the greatest chance of success and/or with the fewest side effects in their particular disease\n\n5. Bring together all our research into a database that will be a vital resource for future research, within and outside this consortium\n\n6. Ensure that the patient is at the centre of all activities in S-CORT, helping with the design of studies, participating in focus groups, meetings and conferences and contributing to the communication of the activities of S-CORT to healthcare and research professionals, patient groups and the public at large\n\n7. Publish our research findings in the best scientific journals and present our results at national and international conferences, thus demonstrating the quality of S-CORT's research \n\n8. Examine how tests that we are developing will perform in the hospital for CRC patients and evaluate the health, economic and societal benefits of this approach \n\n9. Ensure S-CORT's long term sustainability, thus driving implementation of new stratification approaches for CRC patients over the next decade, both in the UK and globally\n\nDelivering these ambitious objectives will allow development of new clinical tests to predict success/ failure of new therapies which, coupled with our increased knowledge of CRC biology will drive a new treatment vision where stratified medicine approaches can significantly benefit our patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M016587/1","grantId":"MR/M016587/1","fundValue":"5079620","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2020-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"TIMOTHY  MAUGHAN","coPersons":["Richard  Kennedy","Ultan  McDermott","Matthew Thomas Seymour","Ricky  Sharma","Simon  Leedham","Richard  Kaplan","Christopher  Holmes","Manuel  Salto-Tellez","Richard  Wilson","Graeme  Murray","Ian  Tomlinson","Andrew  Beggs","Dion Gregory Morton","Mark  Lawler","Anna  Schuh","Philip  Quirke","Patrick G.
