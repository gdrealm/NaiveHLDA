Stem cells have the unique ability to form any cell type in the body, but we still know almost nothing about the specific cues that direct them to one or another fate. \n\nThis project uses only chicken eggs/embryos and stem cells (thus avoiding ethical considerations connected with mammalian embryos and adults) taking advantage of the ease with which cells can be manipulated and studied in this species, yet they are more similar to human embryos that virtually all other non-mammalian models. \n\nThe project will identify factors intrinsic to the cells of normal embryos which are making a decision to become neural and to be part of the forebrain, and then test whether alone or in combination they can direct stem cells to differentiate in a neural direction. This approach is therefore more systemmatic and less invasive than most, and should lead to a deeper understanding of this important fate decision which will allow us to develop reliable methods for directing stem cell differentiation for therapeutic applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400559","grantId":"G0400559","fundValue":"918645","fundStart":"2005-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Claudio D Stern","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
