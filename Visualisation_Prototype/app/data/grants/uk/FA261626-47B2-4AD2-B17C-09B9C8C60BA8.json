It develops a history of the ownership of the 4,000 estates in the British West Indian colonies between 1763 and the end of slavery in 1834. It identifies those estate-owners and families who resided in or returned to Britain and constructs a prosopography of these slave-owners, tracing their commercial, political, social and cultural presence and impact in Britain.<br /><br />The project develops an integrated analysis of the impact of slave-ownership on the shaping of the British nation and utilises the new data to re-examine the relationship between Empire, slavery and early imperial Britain in the late C18 and early C19.<br /><br />The project will create a new public resource which will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>codify and make searchable the ownership and evolution of estates in the British Caribbean between 1763 and 1833</li>\n\n <li>trace the major commercial, political, institutional and cultural legacies of the slave-owners resident in Britain</li>\n\n <li>allow users to link estate-ownership with other extant records on enslaved people, notably the Slave Registers. </li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J017736/1","grantId":"ES/J017736/1","fundValue":"1261160","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2015-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Mary Hall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
