{"id":"D9EAA277-2809-41A1-8705-F6E8507D8B47","title":"The uses and outcomes of treatment of HIV infection in the UK","abstractText":"Over the last ten years, the drugs used to treat HIV have improved dramatically, leading to huge reductions in the number of people dying from AIDS in the UK and in other developed countries. However, these drugs may have side effects, some of which may be life-threatening, which may make it difficult for a patient to take all of their tablets. Furthermore, patients who forget to take their tablets at the right time, or who take fewer tablets than they are supposed to, may develop HIV strains that donâ€™t respond to these drugs, or to other drugs that they may receive in the future. Although there are a number of treatments that can be used if this happens, there is a worry that at some stage, patients may run out of treatment options and may once again start to become sick and die. As part of this application we will use a combination of data analysis and mathematical modelling to investigate the conditions in which this situation could arise. This will allow us to identify ways in which these treatments could be used more effectively, to minimise the risk of this happening.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600337","grantId":"G0600337","fundValue":"745339","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline Anne Sabin","coPersons":["Jane  Anderson","Richard John Gilson","Martin  Fisher","Abdel Ghayoum Babiker","Kholoud  Porter","Andrew Nicholas Phillips","Alan  Tang","Chloe  Orkin","Mark  Gompels","Valerie  Delpech","David Tyre Dunn","Margaret Anne Johnson","David  Goldberg","John  Walsh","Achim  Schwenk","Philippa  Easterbrook","Brian G Gazzard","Deenan  Pillay","Clifford  Leen"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
