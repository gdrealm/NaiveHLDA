{"id":"BB5F35CC-EE35-41C2-BAD9-F49DF58AA891","title":"Superresolved, 3D, multi-fluorophore tracking of live-cell dynamics","abstractText":"Recent work on adaptive optics technologies, funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council, has demonstrated a method that allows simultaneous imaging of many depth layers, and ultra-precise measurement of fast-changes movements, in the biological microscopy, including live-cell applications. This 'small grant' research proposal will develop software and design tools that will allow any biology microscopy groups to use this novel imaging technique on their own microscopes. We will distribute the software and design tools to biologists who wish to use it to further their research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K016679/1","grantId":"BB/K016679/1","fundValue":"2573","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kurt I.
