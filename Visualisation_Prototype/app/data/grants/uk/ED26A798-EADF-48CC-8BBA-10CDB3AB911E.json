{"id":"ED26A798-EADF-48CC-8BBA-10CDB3AB911E","title":"MRC Centre for Genomics and Global Health","abstractText":"Among the biggest challenges in medical research are (1) to develop effective vaccines against malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, which together account for a massive global burden of disease, particularly in the developing world; (2) to combat drug resistance in malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, enteric bacteria, invasive bacteria and other pathogens; (3) to combat the emergence of virulent pathogens such as pandemic influenza. Underlying these practical problems in global health is the biological phenomenon of genome diversity. Pathogen genomes are continually evolving in response to human immune pressure and prevailing drug usage; while at the same time infectious diseases are a major force for evolutionary selection of the human genome. Although genome diversity is a large part of the problem in infectious disease, it also offers a scientific route to understanding natural mechanisms of disease and immunity. Epidemiological analysis of the clinical consequences of pathogen genome variation may be highly informative about pathogen mechanisms of virulence, drug resistance and immune evasion. Equally, epidemiological analysis of the clinical consequences of human genome variation may be highly informative about host mechanisms of defence and protective immunity. The aim of this Translational Centre proposal is to develop the scientific environment and technical infrastructure needed to apply genomic epidemiology to practical lessons about disease prevention ? particularly about drug resistance and vaccine development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600718","grantId":"G0600718","fundValue":"3115100","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dominic Peter Kwiatkowski","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
