Here, it is important to understand the interlinked relationship between fluid flows, permeabilities, and geological structure. This can be attempted through observations made in boreholes. When a borehole is installed, flow up or down the borehole may occur naturally between rock at different depths. The nearby operation of any of the above projects may disturb the fluids in the rock, disrupting the flow in the borehole. If the borehole is used to extract fluids in these engineering applications, then any variability in the flow inside the borehole indicates where the most permeable depths are. Current methods of flow measurement inside boreholes are usually made at a single location. In order to establish what is happening along the entire borehole, a probe must be repeatedly lowered, and another measurement made. This process is tedious, and when the flow is changing over time, it can be impossible to adequately determine how this is happening at all depths. On the other hand, new distributed sensors allow measurements to be made with continuous spatial coverage. Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) gives continuous measurements of temperature along fibre optic cables. A fibre optic cable acts as a long (100s of metres to kilometres) thermometer from which temperature measurements can be obtained up to every 12 cm. Such a cable installed in a borehole can give a highly detailed log of temperature along its entire length in just a few seconds. This is useful in itself, but exact quantification of the flows by just passively measuring the temperature is not usually possible. We believe a new method, using heated fibre optic cables and DTS, will be able to measure flow rates. \n\nWith the proposed method, a cable installed centrally and running to the base of a borehole is heated uniformly by passing a current through the protective materials surrounding the optical fibre. The temperature of the cable, measured using DTS, will increase, and the increase in temperature should depend on how fast the fluid is flowing past it. Faster flows should remove heat more efficiently, lowering the cable temperature. Such a system would potentially be able to measure flows every 12 cm, and be able to detect changes occurring in the flow every few seconds.\n\nThe method will be tested in a controlled way using a borehole constructed in a lab from PVC tubing. This would allow access inside and allow us to visually inspect the flow (using dyes) and equipment during testing. A prototype heated 'Active' DTS (A-DTS) system is to be installed in the tube. From a storage tank, water will be pumped through the tube at varying rates, mimicking flow inside a borehole. This will allow is to determine how the temperature of the cable changes in different flow conditions. We will then adjust the heating power of the cable, as the temperature changes due to different flows may be more readily detectable when using higher or lower powers. Finally, the temperature effect at inflow/outflow locations (as would happen where a rock is fractured) will be investigated using inflow/outflow ports in the centre of the artificial borehole. The exact set-ups and the underlying physics will be tested using advanced numerical model techniques.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L012715/1","grantId":"NE/L012715/1","fundValue":"122949","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This research project has been running smoothly since March 2014.
