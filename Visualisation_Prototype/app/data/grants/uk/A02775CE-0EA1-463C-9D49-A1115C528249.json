{"id":"A02775CE-0EA1-463C-9D49-A1115C528249","title":"Subjects' Elicited Beliefs and their Actions in Strategic Situations","abstractText":"Many unresolved questions about strategic behaviour concern strategic sophistication, the extent to which players analyse their environment as a game, taking its structure and others' incentives into account, and take into account that others, too, make these deliberations.\n<br />\n<br />Strategic sophistication is usually studied by analysing individuals' actions in strategic\n<br />scenarios. This project focus on the relationship between a decision maker's actions and her beliefs about which actions her opponent will choose in order to further our understanding of decision makers' level of strategic sophistication. One of the most interesting results in economics is that a decision maker's actions and her beliefs are consistent with each other. (For example, a pedestrian who expects a car coming her way not to stop, does not cross the street until the car has passed.)\n<br />\n<br />However, studies involving human participants frequently find that actions and reported beliefs are inconsistent with each other. In this project we attempt to investigate different explanations for why people exhibit such behaviour. Additionally, we propose a framework of analysis on how to integrate people's reported beliefs and actions in order to infer players' levels of strategic sophistication.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1703-A","grantId":"RES-000-22-1703-A","fundValue":"23133","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Miguel  Costa-Gomes","coPersons":["G  Weizsâ€žcker"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
