To this end I want to complete a substantial body of research culminating in the manuscript for a monograph entitled 'Machine-Events: the erotic lives of the performative in visual culture'. \\n\\nSince the 1990's we have seen a disciplinary shift away from Art History and towards an expanding field of Visual Culture (altering not only what comes into view but how it does so). This shift seizes not just the chance to apply new theories to specific practices but engages the stylistic challenge of how one could or should write about them. Writing practices are now seen as creatively, even 'performatively', involved with shaping their subjects not simply explaining them or putting them into context. While feminist theory has been a major force in developing Visual Culture, through key concerns such as the particularity rather than universality of point of view, and the gendered structure of looking, today it is too easy to mistake feminism as the issue of a particular moment rather than an ongoing and changing body of concerns.\\n\\nAfter some disappointment with the perceived limits of 1980's feminist investment in psychoanalytic methods of interpreting the image - due to its difficulty with theorising pleasure in general, and lesbian and gay desire in particular, there began an optimistic turn to gender understood as 'performative' largely understood through Judith Butler's influential book Gender Trouble (Routledge, 1989). This produced renewed interested in the enactment of all visual culture (not just performance art) and allowed the body some relief from the formerly inescapable 'male gaze'. Yet, this theory has often been highly diluted. In the worst cases, the performative was mistaken for our ability to transform ourselves through the mere decision to act differently. More complex questions tended to fade from view. Such questions as: is gesture really like a language - and if so, how does that language work? Is the gesture neutral, gendered or the expression of sexual difference? If kinship is a practice rather than a natural law, are there any limits to its future unfolding? If language and/or gesture can choreograph sexual relation, need they always repeat the same steps, or might they produce new ones?\\n\\nMy task is to return to these demanding questions and thus to revive feminism's intellectual path between the concept of the performative, as it transforms all modes of communication through its most elaborate source in the philosophy of Jacques Derrida, and the way that we understand visual culture. My title borrows the term 'machine-event' from Derrida's late work where it arises in the context of the relation between confession (speech) and confessed deed (action). I take it to specify the inseparability of the inorganic automaticity of the machine and the organic spontaneity of the event. This helps us to access the strange ways in which an event (whether understood as a confession, an artwork, a gesture or a kiss) cannot be reduced to the spontaneous will of a performing agent: we must also take account of the machine-like force of repetition.\\n\\nThe five chapters of the monograph each interact with different art works, crossing both genre and media, allowing investigation into different aspects of erotic life, understood in symbolic, political and poetic senses. The works are: mainstream feature film Being John Malkovich (dir. Spike Jonze, US, 1999), independent feature Tape (dir. Richard Linklater, US, 2001), the installations known as Cells by Louise Bourgeois, the photographic series Infinity Kisses by performance artist Carolee Schneeman (1981-88), and the tango based short film Reservaat (dir. Clara van Gool, Netherlands, 1988). Fine-tuning the performative through this period of Research Leave will allow me to theoretically engage these works while allowing for their idiosyncrasies to make theoretical impact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F006373/1","grantId":"AH/F006373/1","fundValue":"25699","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lynn Justine Turner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
