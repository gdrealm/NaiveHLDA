The presence of J K can affect the price of a property and mortgage lenders refuse applications unless specialists are brought in to deal with the plant. \n\nThis proposal is for the further testing and development of a set of models that predict the occurrence of J K in the UK. Models developed under a previous Innovation A bid require further evaluation, and meetings with the conveyancing sector have also indicated that additional modelling work at finer scales than previously attempted should be investigated. This work will include further evaluation of the potential for these models to be included within conveyancing searches for domestic properties.\n\nA successful outcome to this project would be a working prototype that can be exploited via a Follow-on application that would commercialise a web based J K model for the benefit of value-added resellers in the conveyancing sector.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N007786/1","grantId":"NE/N007786/1","fundValue":"13534","fundStart":"2015-08-26","fundEnd":"2016-02-25","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Oliver  Pescott","coPersons":["David Brian Roy"],"organisation":"NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
