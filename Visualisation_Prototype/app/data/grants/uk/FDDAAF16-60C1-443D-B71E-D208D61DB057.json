{"id":"FDDAAF16-60C1-443D-B71E-D208D61DB057","title":"Trace - Retrace: Production of a group of reproducible collages with reference to time, place and memory.","abstractText":"This project explores the relationship between time, place and memory through the production of a body of studio work. This work will be made in response to the investigation of a site on the rural/urban edge of Kyoto: the site of the artist's residence in Japan 15 years ago which has since been demolished. During a ten-week period based at Kyoto Arts Centre the artist will undertake an investigation of the site. Investigative material will be in the form of traced drawings, maps, photographs, film, casts and found object collections. Work in progress will be exhibited in the North Gallery of Kyoto Arts Centre and the project will then be developed in the U.K. The final output will be in the form of a group of 'reproducible collages' in which processes of collage construction will be combined with those of image reproduction including tracing, etching, silkscreen and digital printing. The aim is to produce works which parallel, rather than illustrate, models of memory which relate to conventions of discontinuous time. The body of work will be developed towards solo exhibition in the U.K. and documented and contextualised through a project publication. The project will be located within the context of contemporary fine art practice that is concerned with issues of time, place and memory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D000238/1","grantId":"AH/D000238/1","fundValue":"21088","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  They were used as the basis of a one-day creative symposium held at SangMyung University, Seoul, 2007 Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural","person":"Christopher David Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" The principal finding was the creation of viable forms of reproducible collages that could serve as visual models for memory formation and recollection As practice-based research resulting in a body of artworks , presented in public exhibition, the research has the potential to engage with a wide audience and to prompt questions about our understanding of how memory is formed, and the process of recollection happens.
