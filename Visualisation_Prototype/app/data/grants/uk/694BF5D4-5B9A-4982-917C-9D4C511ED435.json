Whilst most academic work focuses on how and where goods are produced, consumed and disposed of, relatively little addresses the circulation of goods in the global economy. Turning attention to the circulation of things highlights the critical role of maritime space (the sea) and of ports, trucks and truckers in holding the global economy together. It also flags the signficance of 'Plan D' or 'System D' in the global economy; that is, the vast range of informal or unregulated economic activity which underpins globalisation.</p>\n\n<p>This research examines these intersections, starting from four of the major EU ports, including in Northern and Southern Europe. It entails qualitative research with truckers, haulier agents, shipping agents and customs and excise inspectors.The focus for the research is the potential gap between the physical contents of the container box, and their value, and the description of those contents on the box manifest. As such, the research addresses the collision between a global economy predicated upon the uninterrupted flow of goods and security concerns which are beginning to identify ports as the weakest link in global security.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003066/1","grantId":"ES/L003066/1","fundValue":"196538","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"N  Gregson","coPersons":["Michael A Crang","Ray  Hudson"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
