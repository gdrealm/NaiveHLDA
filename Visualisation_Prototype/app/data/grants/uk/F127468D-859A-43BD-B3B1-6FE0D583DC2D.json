The project will measure the dynamic impact of industry collaboration on individual research output. Specifically it will address the concerns that have received the most public and scholarly attention:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Do inventors and researchers with collaborative links with the private sector publish less than their peers without such links (&quot;reduced productivity problem&quot;)? \n</li>\n <li>Do high levels of industry collaboration increase or decrease basic and applied research output (&quot;skewing problem&quot;)? \n</li>\n <li>Does patenting influence academic output by delaying the publication of research findings (&quot;secrecy problem&quot;)? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This project will also address some of the dynamic implications of university and government practices and policies.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2806","grantId":"RES-000-22-2806","fundValue":"81418","fundStart":"2008-03-05","fundEnd":"2009-09-04","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mireia  Jofre-Bonet","coPersons":["Albert  Banal-Estanol"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
