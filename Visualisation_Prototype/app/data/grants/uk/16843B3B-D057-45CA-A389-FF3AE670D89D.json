Such repeated references often use different linguistic expressions &quot;the person in the butcher's shop&quot; followed by &quot;the man&quot; or &quot;he&quot;, for example. These changes seem natural, but they need a scientific explanation. One account, developed on a previous ESRC project. is called JANUS, because it claims that readers must take account of both what has already been said and of what might be said in the upcoming text. Linking back is primarily sorting out repeated reference. Linking forward is less well studied, but includes anticipating changes in perspective. JANUS claims that anticipating a change in perspective calls for more specific expressions. For example if the person in the butchers is referred to as &quot;the footballer&quot;, not &quot;he&quot;, the text is probably going to switch to their sporting activities.</p>\n\n<p>By measuring reading times for parts of texts, the project tests some specific predictions of JANUS, which contrast with other models.

Our theory, JANUS, is a theory about what form the second or later reference should take, in light of the way the person or thing was first described, and why some ways of making those later references are easier to understand than others. As an example, a person called John might later be referred to as &quot;he&quot;, but if two males are being talked about, &quot;he&quot; could be ambiguous, and it might be necessary to repeat the name John.\n\nOur project tested three predictions made by JANUS.\n\nThe first prediction relates to potential problems caused by expressions being overspecific (repeating John, for example, when only one man is under discussion).\n\nWhile there was evidence from two experiments that readers experience difficulty when a repeated name is used to refer to a salient character, neither experiment showed evidence that overspecificity of an anaphor can pose problems for readers (compared with the case when &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; is needed to avoid ambiguity). \n\nThe second prediction relates to the fact that texts and conversations typically develop in a certain way, with characters at the focus of attention being discussed further. However, at some point attention shifts to someone else. When a shift occurs, it is necessary to work out that the current referring expression does not refer to the (previously) focused person (or thing). So, properties of that person should affect processing.\n\nSpecifically, if readers encounter a gendered pronoun (e.g. &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;she&amp;quot;) then they will expect the gender of the antecedent to match the gender of the pronoun. Following a shift, if the focused character does not match then readers should experience a cost while they search for an alternative. However, if they do match then there will be no cost as readers will wrongly assume that no shift has taken place. Contrary to this prediction, our experiment found that when a shift took place (i.e. when an antecedent was unfocused) participants experienced difficulty when characters did share a gender. \n\nThe third prediction is that the form of an expression used to refer to a person may, in addition to ensuring a clear reference to that person in context, signal that a change of perspective on that person is about to take place. Overspecificity, for example, which might prove initially problematic (prediction 1 above) may later turn out to be justified as it signals a change of perspective (e.g from the home life to the professional life of a person).\n\nContrary to this prediction, we found no evidence of the expected pattern of results - initial difficulty with overspecificity, but a later advantage in the change of perspective condition following an overspecific reference. Rather, our results showed that although the overspecific anaphors did cause problems, at a later point a change of perspective caused difficulties, regardless of the form of the referring expression. A proper understanding of the problems that people have with language comprehension is crucial to developing effective treatment or rehabilitation plans for those people. Such work must be carried out by those who have a sound grasp of the aetiology and symptomology of the patients, and skills in how to interact with them.\n\nThe use of principles from the study of discourse processes to the design of information for computer-based systems is another area in which our findings could prove useful. Again, such work is best carried out by people who design the computer systems, as the relevant considerations about discourse processing have to be integrated with a wide range of other factors that influence web design. The project is one of basic research on a fundamental question about text and discourse comprehension (and the production of comprehensible discourse). How are links made between different expressions referring to the same person or thing (e.g. &quot;the London Eye&quot; and &quot;it&quot;) and what factors make these links easy or difficult to discern for the listener or reader? The most immediate impacts of the research will be academic, and will be achieved via conference presentations and publications in academic journals. As well as having a direct impact within psycholinguistics, we anticipate that a proper theory of coreference processing will have implications, for example, for developmental theories of discourse comprehension. Such a theory also has implications for the comprehension problems seen in people with brain damage or degenerative diseases. Beyond psychology, work on coreference also has implication for linguistic analyses, as illustrate by the work of Peter Gordon and Randall Hendrick.\n\nMore broadly, comprehensible text is increasingly important in everyday life, as more and more interpersonal communication is replaced by computer-based communication. Given that people have to understand information presented via computers with no help or with further computer-based help, it is important that the &quot;design&quot;; of the material presented via computer-based system takes account of the way that people typically process text. For example, our JANUS model predicts that expressions that are more specific than they need to be for specifying what is referred to serve specific functions, such as emphasis or change of perspective. If no change of perspective is intended, an overspecific expression may be misleading. The availabilty of our results in the academic literature will enable people who design text for the internet to take the appropriate psychological findings into account.
