A major advance in the treatment of the blood vessel complications in these diseases is the use of agents which block the function of a protein termed Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). We have been directly involved in the development of treatments which block VEGF function in eye disease. However, we and others have also shown that VEGF may be important in the health and function of neurons, including those of the retina and brain. In fact, VEGF is being developed as a treatment to promote survival of neurons in patients with motor neuron disease. Could long-term blocking of the blood vessel defects in the retina with VEGF antagonists inadvertently harm the neurons, which ultimately are responsible for vision? We propose studies to better understand the potential risks and to determine details about the mechanisms by which VEGF promotes neuron survival.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901303","grantId":"G0901303","fundValue":"454483","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Yin Shan Ng","coPersons":["David  Shima"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
