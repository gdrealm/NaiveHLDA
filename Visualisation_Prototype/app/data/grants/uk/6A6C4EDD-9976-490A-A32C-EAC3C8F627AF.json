It is the most common cause of disability in young adults in the western world.\nAlemtuzumab is the most effective drug treatment of multiple sclerosis tested to date; not only does it prevent new attacks, it also improves disability. Alemtuzumab works by binding to and killing lymphocytes, cells which normally fight infections but which mistakenly attack nerves in multiple sclerosis. Although effective, alemtuzumab has side effects, in particular, 1 in 3 patients develop a new autoimmune disease after treatment. In other words, as their immune system grows back it begins to attack other parts of their body, most commonly the thyroid gland. \nWe believe that these autoimmune diseases occur because of the way the immune system grows back after alemtuzumab: by expanding up the small pool of lymphocytes not depleted by alemtuzumab. We propose to get round this by giving a drug which boosts the thymus gland to produce new lymphocytes. We will treat 42 MS patients with alemtuzumab; half will also receive a licensed drug that boosts the thymus and half will be given a placebo. Our final measure of the success of our approach will be the proportion of patients in each group who go to develop an autoimmune disease after alemtuzumab. But, one year into the trial, we will have a ?stop-go? point where we measure the activity of the thymus in our patients; if the trial drug does not seem to be boosting the thymus we will stop the trial early.\nOur work is important - enabling patients to receive alemtuzumab without the risk of developing autoimmunity would represent a huge step forward in the management of multiple sclerosis. Furthermore this trial tests a general strategy for encouraging the recovery of the immune system in humans, and as such, has implications for people with HIV or those recovering from chemotherapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100114","grantId":"G1100114","fundValue":"965058","fundStart":"2012-08-15","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alasdair  Coles","coPersons":["Joanne Louise Jones"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
