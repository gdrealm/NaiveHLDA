It has recently been found that some of these compounds exhibit unusual ordering behaviour on a nanometre length scale. The electrons, instead of being uniformly distributed, are often found to organise themselves into regular patterns which involve not only the positions of the electrons, but also the direction of their spin and the shape of the electron orbitals. When these so-called emergent ordered states form there are often abrupt changes in the measurable properties of the material, such as the resistance, and furthermore, the ordering is often sensitive to external stimuli, such as magnetic field and temperature. It is the small scale of the phenomena (nanometres) and the controllability that make these materials very promising for new technologies.\n\n\n\nUntil recently it has been very difficult to determine the nature of these novel types of order.

The experimental results provide a better understanding of the properties of the materials that were investigated, and this could influence the design of new materials and theoretical models.
