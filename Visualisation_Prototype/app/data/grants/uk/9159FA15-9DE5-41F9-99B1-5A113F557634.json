Disruption of the BBB results in various brain diseases including stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Understanding of BBB integrity and maintenance is, therefore, essential to developing measures for preventing its disruption and also for effective drug delivery to the brain. Currently, most studies on BBB integrity and damage are performed on in vivo models and the current in vitro models do not reflect the cellular interactions that occur in in vivo, as different BBB cell types are cultured and studied in different types of media. The present project aims to develop a three dimensional (3D) in vitro BBB construct within the Kirkstall Quasi-Vivo culture system, which allows multiple cell types to be cultured in inter-connected chambers. Real time tracking of solutes across the BBB will be undertaken using a novel combination of laser and electrochemical biosensor based interrogation. Once developed, this in vitro model will be more accessible than an in vivo animal model for investigation of drug transport across the BBB","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M01312X/1","grantId":"BB/M01312X/1","fundValue":"41931","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Pankaj  Vadgama","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
