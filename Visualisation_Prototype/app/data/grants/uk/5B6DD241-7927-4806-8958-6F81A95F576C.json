Access to overseas natural resources, new markets and technological advances, have made China the world’s largest player in large hydropower dam projects, usually backed by state finance and state-owned enterprises.</p>\n\n<p>The project therefore aims to provide the first systematic and comparative analysis of the social, economic, environmental and political impacts of Chinese hydropower dam projects in low and middle income countries.The project involves detailed empirical research - including interviews and focus group consultations - at four dam sites in Cambodia, Malaysia, Ghana and Nigeria which represent different facets of China's dams in the global South.</p>\n\n<p>For this project, the School of Oriental and African Studies SOAS, the Open University and International Rivers will work closely together with Chinese project partners at Nottingham University Ningbo and Tsinghua University, as well as African and Asian project partners at Cambodia's Development Resource Institute, Nottingham University Malaysia, the University of Ghana and the Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J01320X/1","grantId":"ES/J01320X/1","fundValue":"595393","fundStart":"2012-10-15","fundEnd":"2016-08-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frauke  Urban","coPersons":["Poh Mui Tan","Laurence Edward Smith","Giles Marcus Mohan"],"organisation":"School of Oriental & African Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
