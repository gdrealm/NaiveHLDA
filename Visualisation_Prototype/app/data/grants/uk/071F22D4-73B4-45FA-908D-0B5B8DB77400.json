Innovative quantitative methods drawn from the recent literature on labour market micro-econometrics were used to investigate which ethnic groups are lagging behind and why the ethnic gap has widened over time.&nbsp; The extent to which different ethnic minorities experience unequal treatment, both on average and at different points of the welfare distribution, were investigated together with whether the policies and programs introduced to promote ethnic minority development have functioned as intended.\n<br />\n<br />The project’s objectives, emerging findings and policy conclusions were discussed extensively in a series of meetings and informal seminars for key stakeholders from the Government, donors and NGOs in Vietnam. This extensive user engagement strategy aimed to stimulate a dialogue around appropriate measures to promote ethnic minority development\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E013430/1","grantId":"ES/E013430/1","fundValue":"108352","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert John Baulch","coPersons":["Barry Michael Reilly"],"organisation":"Institute of Development Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
