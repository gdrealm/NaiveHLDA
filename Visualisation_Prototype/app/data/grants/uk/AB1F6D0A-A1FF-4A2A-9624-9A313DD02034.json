{"id":"AB1F6D0A-A1FF-4A2A-9624-9A313DD02034","title":"On the Proper Treatment of Embodiment","abstractText":"Work in embodied cognition depicts thought and reason as in some way inextricably tied to the details of our bodily form, sensorimotor skills, and the enabling web of social, cultural, and technological scaffolding in which we live, move, learn and think. But exactly what kind of link between the mind, the body and the local environment is at issue is often left uncomfortably vague. \nThe project aims to disentangle various arguments and appeals to embodiment, to assess the evidence for and against specific claims, and to canvass their potential importance for philosophy, cognitive science, and our self-image as a species.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112685/1","grantId":"112685/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The aim of this short 'matching research leave' grant (assessed as Outstanding by AHRC following the final report) was to complete a critical study of work on the embodied, interactive mind, presenting the results as a monograph (around 100,000 words). This (and much more - see Key Findings section) was achieved But an unexpected opportunity for true public dissemination turned up in the form of a short filmed dialogue on topics concerning embodiment and mind with Dr Michael Wheeler (Stirling University). The film was commissioned by Jon Bird at Sussex and shown at the Dana Centre Caf?, London Science Museum (http://www.danacentre.org.uk/) in May 2006.

The key idea is that mind cannot be understood independently of the active body. A full draft of the projected monograph was completed as planned (Supersizing the Mind: Reflections on Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension) and submitted to Oxford University Press - with whom the book later appeared. My work has been taken up by educationalists interested in the role of the body in learning, and by architects interested in the cognitive role of the constructed environment.
