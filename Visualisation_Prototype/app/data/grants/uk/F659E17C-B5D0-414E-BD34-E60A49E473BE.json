The utility of many chemicals and materials is intimately connected to their structural architecture, and knowledge of their structure is therefore vital in understanding how to maximise impact and to develop new cutting edge programmes in some of the most important areas of current scientific research. The investment will be in major techniques employed for structural characterisation, single crystal X-ray diffraction (StA), powder X-ray diffraction (StA), solid state NMR (StA), liquid state NMR (UoE), LC-MS (UoE), imaging/ion mobility MS (UoE), underpinning and enabling a significant proportion of the world-leading research in the joint School. \n\nOur vision is to invest heavily in both the infrastructure and training in structural science to provide increased capability for world-leading experiments that will underpin a wide range of our science that has both quality and breadth. The quality of the science that will be enabled through this investment (see below for details) covers science that fits into many of the EPSRC priority areas (e.g. catalysis, energy storage materials, healthcare technologies etc) and many of the Grand Challenge themes (e.g. Dial-a-molecule, Directed assembly of Extended Systems etc). Therefore the National Importance in this proposal is implicit in these EPSRC designations. However, we strive to provide an environment where the quality of the chemistry enabled by investment such as this has significant global impact, and includes specific aims of accelerating our impact on the non-academic world. To this end the EaStCHEM strategy looks to emphasise high impact research that enhances academic-industry interactions with the overall goal of enhancing the economic and social impact of chemistry research as well as promoting fundamental science of the highest possible quality. This strategy includes the development of strong training programmes for graduate students and industrial researchers based around the unique collection of available infrastructure and technical expertise. \n\nThere are clear links between the proposed infrastructure and the important challenge themes in the EPSRC portfolio. The Energy, Healthcare Technologies and Manufacturing the Future are the three most pertinent themes which will be directly impacted by the research infrastructure. Within the themes there are many research areas that map directly with the proposed research - many of which have been identified for growth in EPSRC funding (e.g. catalysis, energy storage) as well as other important research areas scheduled for maintained funding (fuel cell technologies, synthetic coordination and supramolecular chemistry etc).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K039210/1","grantId":"EP/K039210/1","fundValue":"980692","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Derek Woollins","coPersons":["Sharon Elizabeth Ashbrook","Alexandra Martha Slawin","Russell Edward Morris"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
