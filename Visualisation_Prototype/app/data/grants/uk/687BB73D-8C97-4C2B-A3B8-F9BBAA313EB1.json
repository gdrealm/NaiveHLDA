{"id":"687BB73D-8C97-4C2B-A3B8-F9BBAA313EB1","title":"Physical air-sea exchange: synthesis and dissemination","abstractText":"This proposal requests funding for costs associated with the publication of 3 distinct papers. The first is a joint paper on the physical air-sea exchange process studies undertaken by the DOGEE, SEASAW, HiWASE, and DMS Flux projects funded under UK-SOLAS. Publication in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society ensures wide dissemination to a much larger audience than the SOLAS community and is freely available online. The other two papers are related to technical aspects of making direct eddy correlation flux measurements from ships: the impact of flow distortion on the measurements (applicable to all flux measurements), and the effect of hygroscopic swelling of aerosol particles to the assessment of aerosol fluxes. These are technical studies underpin the science funded by the original UK-SOLAS grants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G000115/1","grantId":"NE/G000115/1","fundValue":"10925","fundStart":"2008-07-29","fundEnd":"2010-04-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret Jane Yelland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"National Oceanography Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
