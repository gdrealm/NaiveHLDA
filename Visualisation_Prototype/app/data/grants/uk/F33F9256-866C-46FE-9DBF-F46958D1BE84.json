The Politics of Knowledge Transfer in Public Health","abstractText":"<p>This project will explore: how individuals involved in developing UK public health policies are experiencing efforts to increase/improve the use of evidence (eg what policymakers think about ‘research impact’ agendas and guidelines for increasing/improving the use of evidence in policy); and what role third sector and commercial organisations play in mediating/translating public health knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The aims are: to unpack some of the assumptions underlying contemporary debates about ‘evidence-based policy’ and ‘research impact’; to explore the interactions of values, politics and evidence; and to further develop an ideational framework for understanding relationships between research and policy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In practical terms, the intention is to collaborate with potential research users to develop sector-specific recommendations for using public health research to improve policies (rather than simply trying to increase the flow of public health evidence into policy).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To achieve this, the project combines five methodological approaches: literature reviews; assessing policy tools/guidance designed to improve the use of public health evidence in policy; a series of ethnographic placements in relevant third sector organisations; in-depth interviews with politicians and individuals working in relevant roles in the civil service, commercial sector and third sector; and an online Delphi survey of these sectors.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001728/1","grantId":"ES/K001728/1","fundValue":"172556","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Katherine  Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
