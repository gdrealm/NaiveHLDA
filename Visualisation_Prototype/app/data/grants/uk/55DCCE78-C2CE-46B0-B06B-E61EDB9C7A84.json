The particle beams are bent by magnetic fields and the amount of bend is directly related to beam energy, an essential measurement for the ILC particle physicsts. The bend is monitored by beam position monitors which can have very high resolutions down to 20nm of a single electron beam bunch.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E003125/1","grantId":"PP/E003125/1","fundValue":"93400","fundStart":"2007-11-28","fundEnd":"2009-04-27","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Stewart Takashi Boogert","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
