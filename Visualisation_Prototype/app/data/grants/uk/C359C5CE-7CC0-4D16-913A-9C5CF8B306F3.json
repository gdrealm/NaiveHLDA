It is extremely challenging to\nachieve this using wireless radio frequency systems due to the limited overallocated spectrum. Free space optical communications provides an attractive unlicensed alternative, potentially offering communications at Gbit/s. In this case\nkey challenges include tracking the aircraft with the communications beam, and creating lightweight airborne terminals.\nThis project will combine a retro-reflecting airborne terminal that is free from tracking with a novel holographic\nbeamsteering 'base station' offering precision tracking of multiple terminals to provide the basis of Gbit/s data offload from\naircraft which are landing and airborne platforms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K504038/1","grantId":"EP/K504038/1","fundValue":"325129","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Work ongoing.
