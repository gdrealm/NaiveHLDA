{"id":"E40F4EB7-9A69-4D96-914B-A9A24B4AEAE3","title":"Lymphocyte Kinetics in Health and Disease: a workshop","abstractText":"Immune cell dynamics are a crucial determinant of human health. The correct balance between immune cell proliferation and death guarantees a functioning immune system that contains cells of sufficient range and quantity to be able to recognize and destroy all pathogens. Dysregulation of the dynamic balance underpins many pathologies including AIDS (immune cell depletion) and leukemia (aberrant immune cell growth). Understanding immune cell dynamics is therefore a prerequisite for understanding the human immune system both in health and disease.In the last 10 years significant advances in experimental techniques and in the mathematics needed to interpret these experiments have enabled the measurement of immune cell dynamics in humans. However, different mathematical and experimental techniques can give significantly different answers. To date, there is no consensus on which techniques should be used. Modelling of immune cell dynamics is an intrinsically interdisciplinary subject. There is currently no forum to discuss the modeling of immune cell dynamics and so mathematicians and experimentalists attend their single subject-specific conferences and have little opportunity to meet. The aim of this two day interdisciplinary workshop is to bring together mathematicians and immunologists who are experts in immune cell dynamics with a view to exchange ideas, disseminate knowledge, initiate collaborations and ultimately to reach a consensus on the optimal mathematical and experimental techniques.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G003130/1","grantId":"EP/G003130/1","fundValue":"8740","fundStart":"2008-10-15","fundEnd":"2009-01-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Becca  Asquith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" We received &pound;3,453 to cover costs for international speakers at a two day workshop we organised entitled &quot;Lymphocyte Kinetics in Health and Disease&quot;. The workshop was held in London 2008.\n\n\n\nThe two day interdisciplinary workshop provided a unique forum where both mathematicians and\n\nexperimentalists could discuss the modeling of immune cell dynamics. This enabled experts in immune cell dynamics to\n\nexchange ideas, disseminate knowledge, initiate collaborations and move towards a consensus on the optimal\n\nmathematical and experimental techniques. 120 people participated in the workshop which was fully subscribed.\n\nParticipants originated from around the world and had a broad range of backgrounds with a roughly 60:40 split between\n\ntheorists/ mathematicians and experimentalists; both industry and academia were well represented. An innovative, vigorous science base is essential for the prosperity of the UK and global economies. Interdisciplinary work produces some of the most novel, most exciting science: it invigorates the science base and produces the next generation of scientists, techniques and innovations. This workshop helped to build the interdisciplinary science sector in the UK. * Participants reported a number of collaborations and grant applications arising as a direct result of the workshop\n\n* A paper, written by the scientific organisers, discussing the key topics presented has been published in Trends in Immunology \n\n* We were invited to contribute a book chapter on the subject of lymphocyte dynamics. \n\n* Both informal and formal feedback about the event was very positive.
