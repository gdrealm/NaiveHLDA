The UK House of Commons Health Select Committee calculated that in 2002 clinical obesity cost\nthe English economy somewhere between &pound;3.3-3.7 billion per annum. A similar calculation in 2006 by the EU commission\nestimated that between 59 billion Euros and 236 billion Euros per annum or 7-28% of the total healthcare budget of the\nmember states was spent on the consequences of obesity related illness. It is estimated that by 2050 obesity will affect\n60% of the UK population. If this problem is not addressed it will result in an unprecedented and possibly unsustainable\ndrain on healthcare resources in the UK. Tackling this huge problem will require a multi faceted approach, not least of\nwhich will be attempts to modify the eating behaviour of large parts of the population. Food manufacturers have been\nproactive in this respect by developing a range of low or reduced fat foods to replace less healthy alternatives. However,\nreduced fat foods at present have low uptake by consumers and make little profit for industry. Market studies show that\nconsumers will not choose healthier food and drink products that have inferior taste or mouth feel to the less healthy\nequivalent. In this study we aim to develop protein-based ingredients and enabling technologies for the formulation of foods\nwith reduced energy density while providing stability and mouth feel that are equivalent or improved compared to the\noriginal versions. We will use a multi-scale approach that aims both to understand the microscopic role played by novel fat\nreplacers and emulsifiers, how these will impact on structure at the colloidal level, and how this determines texture in the\nwhole food. This will allow us to broaden our specific approach into a general strategy that can be applied to a wider range\nof food products.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J501712/1","grantId":"EP/J501712/1","fundValue":"42362","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We are in negotiation with food companies about exploiting the results of this research.

","person":"Paul Stephen Clegg","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" The functionality profiles of Quorn's fermented broth and liquid co-product (centrate) were investigated. Ultra-filtration was carried out on the centrate to separate high and low molecular weight (MW) proteins and concentrate these protein fractions on a laboratory scale. The fermented broth was centrifuged to analyse both its supernatant and deposit fractions. \nFoaming, emulsifying and rheological properties (viscosity, gelation) were assessed using a range of techniques on the broth and centrate samples. In parallel the protein composition of the samples was analysed by proteomics and SDS/Native-PAGE. A commercial whey protein concentrate (WPC) product was used as control.\n\n- The high MW centrate fraction and fresh broth deposit showed outstanding foaming stability in comparison with the WPC control and other samples.\n- Oil-in-water emulsions stabilised with the high MW centrate fraction displayed lower oil droplet sizes and higher stability than the control and other samples.\n- Solutions and oil-in-water emulsions of high MW centrate fraction showed higher viscosities than the WPC control and other samples.\n- The high MW centrate fraction displayed a lower gelation point than the WPC control and its gel showed a higher visco-elasticity profile than the control and other samples.\n- Proteomic and electrophoretic analyses revealed a concentration of surfactant-like proteins in the functional centrate fraction (high MW).\n\nOverall these results highlighted the functional potential of the fermented broth and centrate co-product, which could result from the presence of aggregated functional proteins and/or functionality imparted by the fungal cells themselves. Following this initial study the consortium is now interested in assessing the feasibility of producing and extracting functional mycoprotein on a large scale for use as functional ingredient (fat replacer, animal protein replacer) in innovative food products. \nPreliminary results obtained on a laboratory scale indicated that the integration of suitable protein extraction processes could equate to the production of up to 13,500 tons (fermented broth) and 3,500 tons (recovered from the centrate co-product) of proteins per year for an 80% protein purity (values based on extraction of the full protein content). Aligned on the price of whey protein concentrate (currently ?5.75 per kg for 80% protein), the production and extraction of functional mycoproteins could open up new markets of up to ?78 million (fermented broth) and ?14 million (centrate) per annum.
