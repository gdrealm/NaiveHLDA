This is achieved by the directed guidance of neuronal processes along highly specific pathways, which are laid down by chemical cues. Mistakes made during axon pathfinding from the eye to the brain, for example as a result of loss of eye pigmentation in albinism, result in an impaired ability to see in depth. Moreover, defects in axon pathfinding within the brain have been linked to the development of disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Understanding how brain and eye connections form normally may also help devise novel strategies for nerve regeneration following injury or damage to the adult nervous system, for example following optic nerve damage or stroke. Recently, we discovered that a molecule best characterised as a growth factor for blood vessels, which is known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), affects nerve wiring between the eye and brain. Specifically, we found that VEGF-A is essential for the routing of nerve processes that extend from each eye into the opposite brain hemisphere to help us see objects in depth. More recently, we discovered that a related molecule called VEGF-C also affects nerve wiring between the eye and brain. We now seek funding to determine the precise role of VEGF-C in this process, to investigate how VEGF-A and VEGF-C cooperate in establishing the wiring that is necessary for normal vision, and to establish how their signals are transmitted within the nerve cables. This research will advance our understanding of normal brain wiring and, in the future, will likely advance the development of clinical therapies that promote repair and regeneration following damage to the eye and its brain targets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J00930X/1","grantId":"BB/J00930X/1","fundValue":"146841","fundStart":"2012-06-11","fundEnd":"2015-06-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  A manuscript has been submitted to and is in revision for the influential journal Development.

Most studies use a particular isoform of VEGF termed VEGF165, because it has been described as a potent signal inducer via its receptor VEGFR2 and is also the sole VEGF isoform acting through another receptor termed NRP1. We now show that VEGF189 also binds to and can signal through NRP1, using several types of neurons as experimental model systems. The retention of VEGF189 in tissues is superior to that of VEGF165 due to the presences of two versus only one extracellular matrix-binding domain. Taken together with our finding that VEGF189 is fully capable of engaging NRP1, in addition to its known ability to bind VEGFR2, VEGF189 may be better suited than VEGF165 to induce localised tissue effects in therapeutic applications.
