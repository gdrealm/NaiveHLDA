{"id":"CF4BFF21-08BC-4ED8-9139-04D0955B3B62","title":"Why is infection unequal? : An inter-disciplinary approach.","abstractText":"In the developing world, people are commonly infected with a wide range of infections. These include worms in their guts, single celled parasites in their blood, as well as bacterial and virus infections. In the developing world, this burden of infection causes ill health; a large part of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of those in the developing world is due to these infections. People differ in the infections that they have: we want to know why this is the case. The work that we are proposing to develop will therefore try and work out what causes different people to have different infections. The study that we aim to undertake will, for the first time, look at all types of infections at once. To do this we need to establish a team of experts with different, yet complementary, expertise. In the first step that we are prosing now, we will assemble this team of experts. We will then plan in detail how and where we will undertake this study.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902447","grantId":"G0902447","fundValue":"47008","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Edward Viney","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
