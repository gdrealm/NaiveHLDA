Gesture is a robust phenomenon across cultures, the life span, and various communicative contexts. One interesting aspect of speech-accompanying gesture is that there are striking individual differences in how often speakers produce gestures. Some people gesture much more than others.</p>\n\n<p>So far little is known about the sources of these individual differences, and therefore the project will investigate whether gesture frequency can be predicted by measures of individuals' cognitive and social functioning. </p>\n\n<p>On the basis of various proposals about the functions of gestures in speech production and communication, the investigators will use predictors such as memory capacity, efficiency with which speech is produced and the tendency to feel empathy towards others. </p>\n\n<p>The investigators will test participants from broad backgrounds to maximise the variability of the predictors among the participants. The project will explore how well each predictor explains participants' gesture frequency in communication tasks. The project will have a theoretical impact on different research areas, including cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, and social psychology.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2002","grantId":"RES-062-23-2002","fundValue":"185944","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sotaro  Kita","coPersons":["Antje S  Meyer"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
