Firstly there is a demand-led, user survey of industry-academic collaboration and innovation. The second perspective takes HEIs as the unit of analysis and explores how HEIs manage and organise business interactions.&nbsp; Lastly the project then takes a regional perspective and explores how businesses interact within the surrounding industrial environment to uncover the character of regional innovation network relationships, the dynamics of their emergence, the effectiveness of the mediating role of regional institutions and barriers to regional innovation performance. </p>\n\n<p>The research is led by the Manchester Institute of Innovation Research (MIoIR) based at Manchester Business School with partners at Norwich Business School and University of Wales Institute, Cardiff.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E017959/1","grantId":"ES/E017959/1","fundValue":"363493","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  Howells","coPersons":["Fiona  Lettice","Rebecca  Boden"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
