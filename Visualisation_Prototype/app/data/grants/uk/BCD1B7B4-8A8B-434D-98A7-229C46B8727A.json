{"id":"BCD1B7B4-8A8B-434D-98A7-229C46B8727A","title":"Direct CO2 Capture","abstractText":"Carbon Capture &amp; Mineralisation (CCM) echoes natural geological processes and is likely to be a key technology in the permanent removal of CO2 from flue gases and industrial processes. Through this project the University of Cambridge will jointly collaborate with Cambridge Carbon Capture Ltd (CCC) in developing their Patented CCM technology and participate in further innovations in mineral carbonation. The process creates a number of valuable by-products which more than compensates for the cost of capturing the CO2. CCC's process currently involves two stages, the digestion of Magnesium Silicate minerals to form Magnesium Hydroxide then the CO2 striping using the Magnesium Hydroxide to form Magnesium Carbonate. This project aims to investigate the feasibility of using low-cost powdered olivine/serpentine rock to capture CO2 directly from flue gases thereby simplifying the process and significantly reducing cost. Our objective in this project is\nto acquire sufficient quantitative experimental data from a bench-scale gas-liquid-solid mixing rig to establish the technical feasibility and market relevance of CO2-scrubbing of flue gas by direct carbonation of olivine/serpentine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N509966/1","grantId":"EP/N509966/1","fundValue":"122432","fundStart":"2015-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ramachandran Vasant Kumar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
