The Individual Support Programme (ISP) provides assessment and remediation for doctors who are struggling with their performance. A pilot study was conducted in 2006 whereby case notes of assessment and remediation work undertaken with 10 doctors at the ISP were examined. The pilot project found a number of risk factors associated with underperformance in doctors. The current study builds upon the pilot by identifying factors that are present amongst a sample of doctors referred to the unit during a 12-month period. This study will apply a case control method using a matched sample of doctors who are not experiencing performance difficulties. Data will be collected using the anonymised case notes of referred doctors and from a semi-structured interview with the matched doctors. The aim is to identify risk factors that may indicate performance difficulties that are specific to the referred doctors. This would enable the training of educational supervisors and lecturers to help identify those who are beginning to struggle earlier and with more confidence.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F003773/1","grantId":"ES/F003773/1","fundValue":"78830","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Debbie A Cohen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
