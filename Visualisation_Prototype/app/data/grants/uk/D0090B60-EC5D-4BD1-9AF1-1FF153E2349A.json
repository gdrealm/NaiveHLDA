It is therefore important to identify such difficulties at an early age and to provide appropriately targeted intervention.</p>\n\n<p>A previous ESRC research project followed up a large sample of children referred to Speech and Language Therapy services with concerns about language development at 2-3 years. At the outset, assessments of language were administered along with novel measures of skills that are known to underpin language and social communication. It was found that the new measures helped to predict the kinds of difficulties children had at 4-5 years. It is important to know whether these measures continue to predict difficulties in the longer term. The sample of children are now 10-11 years, on the brink of the transition to secondary school. </p>\n\n<p>The new study will assess their language, reading and social communication skills. The aim will be two-fold: to evaluate the early measures as predictors of outcomes at this crucial stage in children's educational and social development, and to investigate whether diifferent developmental pathways throw more light on different profiles of difficulties observed in school-age children.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H045872/1","grantId":"ES/H045872/1","fundValue":"79018","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Shula  Chiat","coPersons":["Penny  Roy"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
