Policymakers in international organisations (e.g. UNIDO, GIZ) and in sub-Saharan Africa recognise a high disease burden and a reliance on imported medicines. They are keen to develop local pharmaceutical production on the continent. However, these initiatives face a competitive challenge from Indian imports. India is known by groups such as M&eacute;dicines Sans Fronti&egrave;res as the &quot;pharmacy of the developing world&quot; for its relatively low-cost supply of medicines across the global South. At the same time, doubts have been expressed about the quality and future supply of Indian pharmaceuticals. This proposed research will explore the role of India's pharmaceutical industry in sub-Saharan Africa. It asks: How does India's trade in generic pharmaceuticals impact on local production and public health security within sub-Saharan Africa?\n\nThe research will identify the extent of Indian pharmaceuticals' presence within sub-Saharan Africa's South-South trade, focusing on three main regions - East, West and Southern Africa (comparing selected smaller and larger countries within each). The project will adopt a global value chain (GVC) and global production network (GPN) analytical framework to map the relationship between different actors involved in this South-South trade. Empirical research involves collection and analysis of secondary trade data and primary interviews with key stakeholders (policymakers, firms, and NGOs). It will examine the role of various actors (e.g. firms, industry associations, states, international organisations) in South-South trade. The relationships between these stakeholders involved in the supply of pharmaceuticals for sub-Saharan Africa will also be explored. This will facilitate explanation of: \n1) The role of Indian firms in governing South-South value chains, i.e. influencing rules, standards and expectations for participaon, and thus shaping development outcomes in pharmaceuticals; \n2) Upgrading possibilities for African firms from participating in these South-South value chains, including expanding local manufacturing; \n3) State policies (e.g. industrial policies, public procurement) shaping the dynamics of Indian imports and local production. \nComparative lessons will be drawn, both between African countries/regions and from India for Africa, through a focus on the different types of policies employed at a national and regional level within Africa and India, and their relative degrees of success.\n\nThis project will provide the first cross-regional study within Africa of the Indian pharmaceutical industry and its implications for local production. The project will be of particular relevance for national, regional and international policymakers keen to address the significant industrial and health challenge of an improved supply of pharmaceuticals. It is also of relevance to those policymakers increasingly recognising global value chains and production networks as key components of global trade. \n\nAcademic outputs will include academic journal articles and a book. The project will have a strong knowledge exchange component, guided by a stakeholder advisory group throughout the research, and involving policy workshops, blogs, and briefing notes to enhance research impact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N001885/1","grantId":"ES/N001885/1","fundValue":"228221","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rory  Horner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
