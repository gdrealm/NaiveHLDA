{"id":"EC7873C9-5BFC-4871-ACA4-7CBFD982EAC8","title":"Neighbourhoods and the creation, stability and success of mixed ethnic unions","abstractText":"<p>Numerous geographical studies over the last few decades have explored ethnic segregation. However, none of these studies have explored ethnic mixing within households and the contextual factors that might influence this. Mixed-ethnic unions are growing in number, indicative of an increasingly multi-cultural society but the factors that influence where these unions form, how stable they are through time, whether this stability is influenced by the ethnic context in which these people live, and whether such couples seek out mixed-ethnic neighbourhoods, are not well understood. Some have argued that mixed-ethnic couples are more likely to choose to live in mixed-ethnic neighbourhoods, but these studies are based on cross-sectional data. Therefore it is not possible to determine whether mixed-ethnic couples are more likely to live in mixed-ethnic neighbourhoods because they formed there or because they moved there. Using longitudinal data, this study will tease out the relative importance of the two different processes. This research project will therefore contribute to our understanding of mixed-ethnic unions in Britain by exploring the role of neighbourhood context on the creation, stability and success of mixed-ethnic unions. The results will be of direct policy relevance to those interested in promoting ethnic integration and multiculturalism.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F003803/1","grantId":"ES/F003803/1","fundValue":"82362","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Zhiqiang  Feng","coPersons":["Gillian Mary Raab","Paul  Boyle","Maarten  Van Ham"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
