No longer a solution looking for a problem ; lasers are a tool in their own right. Many different solid-state laser configurations have evolved since the inception of the laser, the majority are based on rare-earth (RE) ions and produce coherent radiation in the near-IR. In some cases, multi-kW power levels that can cut through centimetres of steel in seconds are available. The light emission from these lasers starts from low-lying meta-stable excited states of the RE ions; however, many applications exist, such as display technologies, diagnostic tools at the life-science interface, or capitalising on the transmission window of seawater for sub maritime sensing and communications, which require higher-energy photons, that is, visible light. Such wavelengths can be obtained through non-linear frequency upconversion of IR lasers or directly through stimulated emission originating from higher-lying RE-ion excited-states. Solid-state visible lasers based on emission from these higher-lying excited states are still a research laboratory phenomenon, typically with low powers and low efficiencies and a limited range of wavelengths. The principle technical challenge restraining these devices is an effective pumping cycle that avoids loss generating mechanisms such as parasitic upconversion and photo-darkening, which, for example, have so far foiled the commercialisation of upconversion-pumped visible fibre lasers. We present a new approach for generating visible output from RE ions that will expand the toolkit of the laser user. Drawing upon our pioneering research and expertise with recent and critical technological advancements, namely ultra-low-loss rare-earth-doped crystalline waveguides and narrow-linewidth high-power diode-laser pump sources, we can now for the first time generate the right pump excitation parameters that will enable efficient high-power operation of this laser architecture. Our vision is to simplify the solid-state visible laser to just a single oscillator, while simultaneously broadening its capabilities through exploiting the rich spectroscopic properties of the higher-lying excited-states for generating different colours, and, their unique energy storage capacity. A power-scalable architecture will be realised, demonstrating applicability to high-power operation in both continuous wave (cw) and pulsed modes of operation, with unrivalled characteristics compared to alternative solid-state systems. Successful demonstration of the milestones in this project will place the UK at the forefront of international research in the field of high-power visible solid-state lasers, with an excellent opportunity to commercialise the technology through our industrial partners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H005412/1","grantId":"EP/H005412/1","fundValue":"427649","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Publications are well received in the community, leading to invited talks and a revitalization of interested in planar waveguide lasers for quasi-four-level lasers. \nLaser power scaling work has led to following on funding in manufacturing with light.\nDevelopment of specific infra-structure and expertise has led to a new collaboration with CiMAP - an institute in Caen University.

One major success was the demonstration of a high-brightness 946nm planar waveguide laser, with 30W of output power with the world's highest radiance level, which could be frequency upconverted to the blue wavelength regime. This will be the subject of ongoing efforts.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the fundamental approach to exploit upconversion effects to populate higher-lying energy levels that emit light in the visible regime, several new techniques were developed to assess the potential of different active materials. These have been published in international conferences proceedings and are presently being written up as journal articles (Mar 2014). The new characterization techniques developed included measuring the excited state absorption characteristics of higher-lying excited states, and the energy transfer processes from these upper levels that are parasitic to the visible emission. \n\n\n\nCritical to the success of the project for demonstration of visible upconversion planar waveguide lasers was the planar waveguides, unfortunately these were not realized in a useful time frame for the project and not with the required design characteristics, a limitation of the fabrication process for the materials identified as having the best potential. New collaborations are being developed to work towards a solution to this problem.\n\n\n\nFirst upconverted blue light was observed toward the end of the project and illustrated that with appropriate waveguides there would be the potential for laser emission. Further efforts in this arena will be followed up to demonstrate this proof of concept. Too early in the TRL scale to envisage exploitation at this stage.
