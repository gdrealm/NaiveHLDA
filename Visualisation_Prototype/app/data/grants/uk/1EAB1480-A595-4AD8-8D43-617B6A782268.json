All cultures were successfully cultivated in photobiorectors at Strathclyde and near infrared spectra of the cultures and fluids were taken. \n\nDisruption of the algae for estimation of lipid and metabolite content was a challenge using high pressure homogeniser. Novel methods need to be employed, perhaps including microwave assisted. \n\nSimple models of key analytes (e.g biomass) could be readily built offering the prospect of re The realtime monitoring of such cultures aids the population of the process design space giving more confidence in industrialising marine bioproducts of the future.
