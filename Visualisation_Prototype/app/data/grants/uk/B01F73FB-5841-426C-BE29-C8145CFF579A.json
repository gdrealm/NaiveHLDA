All Buddhist moral rules are rooted in and derived from the principles of Buddhist morality. With this in view the research is divided into three parts. Part One examines the existential, psychological and doctrinal dimensions of Buddhist morality. Part Two surveys and analyses specific rules and prescriptions: lay precepts, monastic vows, Bodhisattva vows and tantric pledges. Part three studies the rituals used to bestow the different vows and pledges, and provides translations of such rituals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113041/1","grantId":"113041/1","fundValue":"11476","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Tadeusz  Skorupski","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Oriental & African Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
