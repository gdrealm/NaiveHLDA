Little progress has been made in the treatment of this disease since testicular testosterone deprivation was identified as a therapeutic modality. There is an urgent need to accelerate the development of novel therapies for this disease. Key bottlenecks to the treatment of this disease include poor clinical predictors of which drugs result in clinical benefit, and lack of access to hormone resistant cancer cells to understand the biology of the disease. This results in protracted trials, lasting many years, evaluating whether new treatments prolong time to death of large numbers of patients. It is envisioned that the enumeration, separation and study of prostate cancer cells in the blood of patients using validated new technology will expedite clinical trials and allow access to tumour cells for the study of the biology of this disease, leading to improvements in treatment for this unmet need.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601308","grantId":"G0601308","fundValue":"794215","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Johann Sebastian De Bono","coPersons":["Christopher  Parker","Mitch  Dowsett","Paul  Workman","Jeremy  Clark","David Paul  Dearnaley","Gerhardt  Attard","Andy  Norman","Stanley  Kaye","Colin Stephen  Cooper","Florence  Raynaud"],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
