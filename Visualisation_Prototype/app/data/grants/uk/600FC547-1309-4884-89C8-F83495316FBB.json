The CIB sjupports high quality research and training in integrative mammalian biology. Research at the CIB concentrates on the study of whole animal function in normal and pathophysiological situations, in order to understand fundamental biological mechanisms and their control, in biology and disease. The CIB contains more than 30 principle investigators, the majority of whom are based in the School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, with remaining members in the School of Medicine. An Executive group was established that not only included a member from each Research Division, but also the Director of the Biological Services Unit, the Head of the Pharmacology teaching Department and two members from Industry, in order that the needs of industry could be incorporated into the CIB planning as it developed. \n\n\n\nThe CIB incorporates principle investigators, who have received, or are in the process of applying for grants and PhD studentships involving in vivo research projects. The CIB also provides teaching and research projects for four programmes at Masters level that involve in vivo research, although the only one directly funded by the CIB, MRes in Integrative Biomedicine, will close in September 2010 after three successful years. The Research Divisions involved are: the Wolfson Centre of Ageing, that includes all aspects of neuroscience research; the Reproduction and Endocrinology Division, where research involves developmental programming of obesity and cardiovascular disease, fertility, diabetes and circadian rhythms; the Pharmaceutical Sciences Division, involved in blood brain barrier research, lung biology and tissue injury research; the Cardiovascular Division, involved in obesity, imaging and cardiovascular biology research; the Immune Disease and Infection Division, involved in the development of transplantation techniques. \n\n\n\nA major activity at the CIB was the recruitment of new posts to enable a first rate education at undergraduate, postgraduate and fellowship levels and to build integrative research capacity. Importantly, this will help to ensure i) the flow of young scientists with an appropriate training for work in industry, especially in pre-clinical in vivo skills (nine 4 year MRes/PhD studentships are solely supported by the CIB) and ii) a strong development pathway for excellent young researchers to become the in vivo teachers of tomorrow.\n\n\n\nThe in vivo capabilities of the CIB offer significant value to industry drug discovery programmes, and with its virtual structure the CIB benefits from a range of specific expertises located throughout King's, each embedded in areas where complementary techniques involving in vitro cell biology and molecular techniques exist. This provides an interdisciplinary network of research across a range of Disciplines to exploit in order to set the study of animal pharmacology, physiology and dysfunction in a translational and drug development context and within the context of the 3Rs. King's College also provides access to King's Business, which supports innovation at KCL, and more recently within the CIB. \n\n\n\nThe following courses including an education in the 3Rs that will continue are:\n\ni) Second year undergraduate course in Animal Models of Disease; up to 24 students per year.\n\nii) In Vivo short summer course in Pharmacology &amp; Physiology, funded by BPS/Physiological Society, up to 9 students per year.\n\niii) Final Year Research Projects, approximately 8 students per year. \n\niv) MSc Drug Discovery, including 6 month project in industry, up to 12 students per year. \n\nv) MSci Integrative Physiology and Pharmacology, in association with ABPI and including 6 month project in industry doing Toxicology or Safety Pharmacology projects. This course ran for the first time in 2011-12. up to 12 students per year.\n\nvi) MRes/PhD (four year course in Integrative Biomedicine. Course). Course ran for 3 years and trained 9 students. Ceased in 2010, as further capacity building studentships were not obtained. \n\nvii) BBSRC funded Integrative summer studentships. 6 awarded to date. \n\n\n\nThe following number of students have been trained i) Yr 2 course 72, ii) summer course 45, iii) Final Year Research projects 40, iv) MSc 50, v) MSci 7 vi) MRes/PhD students - 9, vii) our technical administrator registered for a PhD in 2009 and this will be complete by Sept 2013. Viii) Summer students 6. Total:230 \n\n\n\nOther students supported via training by the Centre include those funded by bodies including the MRC, BBSRC (doctoral and case), EU, BHF and other charities and self-funding students. Without doubt some of the funding has been brought to the Centre as a consequence of this grant. This accounts for about 50 students in total.\n\n\n\nThe following staff have been employed:\n\nSarah Flatters. Lecturer. \n\nMajor personal grant funding: \n\n• Principal applicant Wellcome Trust project grant &quot;Oxidative Stress as a causal mechanism for chemotherapy-induced pain&quot; - &pound;310,452 (22/8/11 - 30/4/15)\n\n• MRC-CASE 4-year PhD studentship in collaboration with Eli Lilly - &pound;127,668 including &pound;52,400 Lilly contribution (1/10/12 - 30/9/16) \n\n• Royal Society Research Grant - &pound;15,000 (17/10/11 - 16/10/12)\n\n\n\nAndrew Grant. Probationary lecturer. He has completed his PGCAP (post graduate teacher training) and gained a merit.\n\n\n\nJulie Keeble. Probationary lecturer. She recently headed the King's arm of the GSK/KCL Scientists in Sport initiative that has been prize winning. She has also been awarded the King's College Outreach prize (2011). \n\nMajor personal funding: \n\n• Arthritis Research UK: Role of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in arthritis: manipulation of the endogenous cysteine: H2S pathway as a novel approach to the treatment of arthritis -PK Moore, SD Brain &amp; J Keeble [&pound;181,970]. JK has been the PI on this grant since 2010. 2009-2012\n\n• Pfizer/MRC CASE studentship: TRPV1 and hyperthermia - Dr Julie Keeble &amp; Ian Machin [&pound;92,318, including &pound;30,000 Pfizer supplement]. 2010-2013\n\n\n\nProf Phil Moore and Dr Manasi Nandi were appointed in association with the Centre as part of a collaboration with Pfizer. Much of the collaboration has ceased following the closure of the Sandwich site. Prof Moore returned to the University of Singapore in 2010. Dr Nandi has passed her probationary lectureship. She has obtained a 3 year BHF project grant (&pound;254,086), a Maplethorpe 2 year postdoctoral fellowship (&pound;95,664), a Saudi Cultural Bureau PhD studentship (&pound;142,080) and 2 BHF PhD students (one has gained a PhD). \n\n\n\nDr Simon Pitchford has now joined our staff and will run the MSci course. Transferable skills of those trained that will enhance business, regardless of career choice. \n\n\n\nOutreach: Most PIs and all fellows/students have been involved in Outreach. Two examples are: i) S Brain and A Aubdool (CIB PhD student) have secured funding from the Royal Society (2.4K) to work with Walthamstow Academy on a series of class practicals, involving chilli peppers and daphnia, relevant to in vivo teaching. Collaboration of M Christie and J Keeble with University of Nottingham (Dr Noah Russell) on a daphnia imaging and data collection device aimed for undergraduate teaching. They are looking for a funding opportunity for this. Dr Keeble has led a major 'Scientists in Sport' initiative as mentioned above. \n\n\n Development of pre-clinical models to aid translation of novel pharmaceutics to humans to support healthy ageing. \n\n\n\nExploitation routes include: \n\na) Training: Expanding training for undergraduates from about 15 per year to up to &gt;50/year (in 2011/12). Regeneration of Pharmacology Department such that mean age profile of staff is in the late 40s, rather than 50s, whilst expanding training courses. Also, whilst the total number of staff has remained similar (25 in total), the gender mix has changed such that instead of 4, the Department has 7 female academic staff. Moreover, two new courses as described in the training section have been developed.\n\n\n\nb) Engaging in a new way with industry and with new industry partners. Our partners from training and research collaborations are shifting away from big Pharma towards SME/biotch and CROs. Mark Christie has developed initiatives to i) build an in-house contract research capacity, Ii) a pre-CASE award, introducing pump priming funding to enable links with industry in 2011. Of the 3 grants funded all have brought in further funding. We plan a further six project calls until end 2013 (costing 48K). Development of a Models Database that has prompted discussion with potential industry partners. \n\n\n\nc) Interactions with Imperial College London including: i) GMEC Funding that led to a successful NYAcad of Sci meeting; ii) potential extension of database to include PIs at Imperial; iii) a series of strategy meeting to enable a joint further grant strategy (although a suitable funding initiative was not found, with a proposed MRC partnership application not acceptable); iv) joint teaching of MRes students in telemetry etc); v) joint public speaking course (2007-2012). vi) frequent interchange of PIs for lecturing opportunities . \n\n\n\nd) Systems Biology: Use of BBSRC systems biology grant to appoint Hans van Baardewijk for one day per week. The grant has also provided small pump priming grants for Systems Biology that enables students to attend an advanced Systems Biology course, with consequence engagement in this area.
