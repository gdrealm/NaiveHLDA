The first aim was to determine whether immune senescence could be regulated at the level of nuclear transport of key molecules from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of human T cells. The second aim of this grant was to investigate why immune responses in the skin are decreased in older individuals. In order to determine the nature of this defect, we investigated leucocyte recruitment and function in the skin\n\n\n\nAim 1. We found that T cell senescence was unlikely to be regulated at the nucleopore since T cells at different stages of differentiation showed the same number and distribution of these complexes. Furthermore, there were no differences in expression of neucleopores after activation of these cells. Our previous data had shown that senescent T cells had deficient transport of key signaling molecules into the nucleus of the cells and the data that was generated with the Coutavas Lab suggests that this is probably due to failure of the transport mechanisms but not the entry ports into the nucleus.\n\n\n\nAim2. In order to determine the nature of the defect in older individuals, we investigated leucocyte recruitment and function in the skin. Some of this data is still being analysed but the data generated thus far suggests that an essential early signal that amplify the skin response to antigen is considerably reduced in old humans. This responses revolves around the cytokine IFN-gamma, which was an unexpected finding and this work has led to a new testable hypothesis that skin resident T cells, that secrete this cytokine, are defective in old subjects. For aim 2- we have generated banks of tissue samples for microarray anlaysis which can be used to probe molecular changes during ageing and this is a resaurce that will be available to wider scientific community.
