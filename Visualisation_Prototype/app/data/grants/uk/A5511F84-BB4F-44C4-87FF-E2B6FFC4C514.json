Being a fan has become an increasingly universal audience experience with most media consumers negotiating the vast range of content that has become available in the digital age through their affective preferences - the television shows, films, novels, sports teams, artists, comics, plays, musicians, genres, poets or composers whom we hold particularly dearly, return to frequently and often gather a large amount of information on. In turn these fan objects serve as a source of enjoyment, sometimes outright pleasure, but also of belonging and an expression of ourselves. In a quickly changing world, they indicate to ourselves and others who we are and thus communicate and maintain a sense of identity. \n\nHowever, fans are not only consumers of media and culture, they are also active participants in culture who in many cases become cultural producers. In the era of digital media in which technologies of media production are easily accessible to most media consumers with, for instance, smart phones boasting HD video and sound recording, free video editing software being widely available, and the internet offering easy distribution routes through portals such as YouTube, LiveJournal or social networking sites, user generated content is an increasingly important part of our media landscapes - much of it driven by fans' enthusiasm and interests. Similarly, fans create value by working collaboratively through review- or wiki-type sites that for many consumers become important spaces of peer information that structure their cultural consumption.\n\nYet, in an environment of unprecedented choice of arts, culture and entertainment that confronts contemporary citizens and consumers, we make the selections that structure our engagements with culture through the affective position of the fan; and thereby tend to choose what we already like, already enjoy and already are familiar with. Hence, the question emergences whether enthusiasm and fandom might also serve to erode the challenges of the unknown, the fantastic and the 'hard-to-make-sense-of' in our cultural encounters, which in the eyes of some literary and cultural theorists constitute the true value or art and culture - and hence their potential to change the world in which we live for the better.\n\nThis project examines these conflicting positions and answers the question of how we can conceptualise the cultural, social, economic and political value of participatory culture and fandom in the digital age by conducting a comprehensive review of past research on forms of fandom and enthusiasm across the spectrum of culture, media and arts. This review compares empirical findings of different studies and identifies broader trends across studies, critically examines the methodologies on which current findings are based as well as the soundness of their theoretical conclusions, and indicates areas of future research that will be required in order to more fully map the challenges and benefits of fandom and participatory culture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L006367/1","grantId":"AH/L006367/1","fundValue":"30890","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  As findings are in the process of being published, this section will be updated in 2015.

The key findings from this review include the following:\n\nI. The fundamental mode of participation of participatory culture is 'textual selection'\nThe review identifies three types of participation among enthusiasts and fans surrounding their fan object and interaction with other fans in the existing literature. Two are widely recognised: a.) creative participation such as the creation of fan art (fan fiction, fan remixes of music or audio visual material and visual artworks, etc.); and b.) forms of productivity and 'fan labour' that include extended debate and reflection on the fan object and contributes to knowledge creation and sharing, in particular online. The review, however, argues that participatory culture is also structured- and in turn becomes constitutive of contemporary forms of enthusiasm and fandom through a third type of participation: textual selection. Practices of textual selection are structured by two forces: Firstly, the transformations of textuality in processes of media convergence. Hypertexts online, for example, no longer afford the narrative linearity that most print and broadcast media offer. Similarly, the emergence of fan or user generated texts as paratexts (texts about texts) and the increasing convergence of different media platforms leading to heightened intertextuality and the emergence of transmediated narratives and discourses all necessitates users to construct textual boundaries at the point of reception. In turn, the way the boundaries around fan objects are structured by the affective bond between fans and fan objects is based on psychological processes of projection and self-reflection. Fandom is therefore in the first instance always an engagement with and maintenance of the familiar, independent of the specific cultural field in which specific fan cultures or forms of enthusiasm are located. Consequently, its value and the value of texts around which fandom evolve cannot be assessed in relation to either the text or the recipient alone, but only in the interaction between the two.\n\nII. A distinction between utility and aesthetic value is required in order to assess the social, cultural and political consequences of fandom and participatory culture in the digital age\nCultural enthusiasm and fandom tend to affirm participants' horizons of expectations precisely because they a.) select the boundaries of the fan text in the first instance and b.) rework and appropriate cultural objects and texts in both acts of reception and through fan generated content. Fandom therefore has a self-affirmative capacity that has often been associated with forms of empowerment and emancipation, and, in the particular context of participatory culture, with the democratisation of cultural production and transformations of the cultural industries. The review identifies this important cultural function of participatory enthusiasm and fandom as cultural and social utility, which is, however, to be distinguished from aesthetic value. Utility facilitates agency. Drawing on contributions to literary theory such as, Reception Aesthetics, it is suggested that aesthetic value is distinct from utility in its capacity to facilitate qualitative change by broadening the recipients' imagination through encounters with the textually Other. Value is thus rooted in the capacity of processes of reception and creativity to challenge existing horizon of expectations and experiences.\n\nBased on these two central findings, the project proposes the development of Use Aesthetics based on further interdisciplinary enquiry, which accounts for the importance of extrinsic factors in the formation of value such as media literacy and education. Based on these two central findings, the project proposes the development of Use Aesthetics based on further interdisciplinary enquiry, which accounts for the importance of extrinsic factors in the formation of value such as media literacy and education. \n\nIn aiming to publish the findings in cooperation with the Organization for Transformative Works (a nonprofit organization run by and for fans to provide access to and preserve the history of fanworks and fan cultures) I am also aiming to engage with the user community in order to for the key findings and aesthetic considerations arising from this work to inform creative practice and practices of participation in popular culture. In this sense, the findings are aimed to contribute to the forms of media literacy and reflection that the review suggests are required in the building and maintaining of cultural utility and aesthetic value in participatory culture.
