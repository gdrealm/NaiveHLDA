However there is evidence to suggest that the diet of pregnant and lactating women is particularly important as it has major long-term implications on the health of their babies. It has been shown that individuals with a low birth weight are not only less likely to survive delivery but are also at substantially increased risk of developing obesity as adults. In contrast breast-fed infants, who are known to grow more slowly than bottle-fed infants, are less likely to become obese later in life. The underlying causes of the relationship between early growth and later obesity are not known but we believe that the quality of the diet of women during pregnancy and during breast-feeding is critically important. We have shown in a rodent model that if pregnant animals have too little protein during pregnancy their babies are small at birth and are more likely to become obese in adulthood. We think this is because these animals eat more and exercise less. In contrast in our rodent model where animals grow slowly during lactation because their mothers are eating a diet low in protein, the animals do not get fat even when offered a highly palatable diet. We have identified an important gene in the brain that is expressed at higher levels in animals that are resistant to obesity. We think this makes these animals more responsive to a protein leptin. This protein is produced by fat cells and signals to the brain to suppress appetite and to increase energy expenditure. In this proposal we will test this idea by giving obesity-prone and obesity-resistant animals leptin and then measuring their food intake and energy expenditure. We will also study the brains of these animals further to identify other genes that are expressed at different levels. We will study the DNA from the brains of our animals to determine why particular genes are not expressed properly. Understanding these processes will enable us to both identify at risk individuals and to develop intervention strategies to improve the health of both pregnant and breast-feeding women and their offspring.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E00797X/1","grantId":"BB/E00797X/1","fundValue":"260197","fundStart":"2007-04-10","fundEnd":"2010-06-09","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Ozanne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" Diet is important for an individual's health at any stage of life. However, the diet of pregnant and lactating women is particularly important as it has long-term effects on the health of their babies. Individuals with a low birth weight are not only less likely to survive delivery but are also at substantially increased risk of developing obesity later on in childhood and when they are adults. In contrast, breast-fed infants, who are known to grow more slowly than bottle-fed infants, are less likely to become obese as children and later in life. The underlying causes of the relationship between early growth and later obesity are not known. However nutrition plays an important role in regulating early growth so we believe that the quality of the diet of women during pregnancy and breast-feeding is critically important. We have developed a rodent model that mimics what happens in humans who grow at different rates during fetal and early postnatal life and allows us to investigate the underlying mechanisms. If pregnant animals have too little protein during pregnancy their babies are small at birth, undergo postnatal catch-up growth and are more likely to become obese in adulthood. In contrast, if animals grow slowly while they are suckling because their mothers are eating a diet low in protein, they do not get fat even when offered a highly palatable diet. We have identified an important gene in the brain that is expressed at higher levels in animals that are resistant to obesity. This makes the animals more responsive to the protein leptin. This protein is produced by fat cells enters the blood and signals to the brain to reduce food intake and to increase energy expenditure. In very early life leptin also promotes growth of neurons in the brain. We have found, as predicted, that animals that grew slowly during suckling and become resistant to obesity are more sensitive to leptin both as babies and in adulthood. However, this is not only because they have more of the protein that leptin binds to: they also respond differently to small proteins that are released from nerves in the brain in response to leptin. This raised the question of why they responded differently to leptin and the small peptides. We addressed this problem by investigating whether gene activity is the same in animals that are sensitive and resistant to obesity and whether the small peptides have the same effect on gene activity. Since there are thousands of genes and many were found to differ in activity between our experimental groups, special computer-based methods were needed to interpret the results. We have developed such a method and identified genes that are present at different levels in the brain because of alteration of their mother's diet during pregnancy or lactation. Some of these are already known to be involved in the regulation of body weight, but many are not. Understanding what these genes do will enable us to develop intervention strategies to improve the health of both pregnant and breast-feeding women and their offspring. They also provide novel targets to help the pharmaceutical industry develop anti-obesity drugs. These findings are very important in light of the growing epidemic of obesity in society today.
