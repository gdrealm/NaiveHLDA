Endocrine disrupting substances (EDS) interfere with the passing of messages by hormones. Development of babies in their mothers? wombs is very dependent on the correct very low level of hormone. Any EDS present may corrupt the correct developmental signal being sent to the cells of the baby and cause problems. The Endocrine Society in 2009 published a statement on endocrine disrupting substances (EDS) invoking the Precautionary Principle.\n\nThe only reliable way at present to test for the effects of EDS on development in the womb is to use animals. Because it is very difficult to perform direct measurements on living embryos, studies have to sacrifice animals at different stages of development. \nWe wish to develop a model of breast tissue, using human cells from commercially available cell lines, so that we can test EDS and see if they affect development. This is building on results from our previous research based on 2D cell cultures detecting whether a chemical is an EDS that mimics the female and/or male sex hormones. This has already replaced many animal experiments. However, to detect the damage that can be caused by EDS during development we need to establish a new type of cell culture model that allows us to engineer, control and observe a model tissue consisting of the different types of cells found in the real tissue during life and exhibiting the same intriguing complex ductal branching structure. \n\nThis task will require a cooperative effort by scientists with skills in tissue culture, microscope usage and measurement science. Our University in Ulster has just invested #654k in a new microscope and tissue engineering facility that will help us to achieve this task. The internationally renowned company, Leica, who developed and provides this equipment, expressed their interest in supporting and helping us in this task. We are therefore asking the NC3Rs for funds to find skilled manpower and consumable items.\n\nWe anticipate that the end result will lead to a testing system that enables us to reliably identify harmful doses of EDSs without the need to use animals and at the same time allow us to directly observe the damaging process caused by EDS. This will potentially give further clues on how EDSs work in real life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000090/1","grantId":"G1000090/1","fundValue":"361919","fundStart":"2010-10-05","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"C  HowardCharles Vyvyan  Howard","coPersons":["Kurt  Saetzler","Christopher  Downes","George  McKerr","Ana  Soto"],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
