The aim of sexual reproduction is to create genetic diversities, whereas the important genetic materials, which are required for essential biological activities, need to be faithfully inherited to the progenies. Meiosis is the process designed to accomplish this fiddly mission. All human cells contain two almost identical sets of genetic materials, one from the father and one from the mother. However gametes must contain only one set. This is crucial so that upon fusion of an egg and sperm, during the fertilization, the genetic content is returned to the two standard sets. Essentially, meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that halves the genetic content of parental cells. Furthermore, it allows a period of time during which one genetic set from the mother and one from the father can mix with each other leading to a unique and diverse set of genetic materials that give to the progenies their individuality. Separation of genetic materials during meiotic divisions occurs on a scaffold structure which is composed of microtubules (MTs). As their name implies, MTs are hollow rod-like tubes that are found within all cells. Specifically, they are fibrous polymers made up of the proteins alpha- and beta-tubulin, whose polymerisation and de-polymerisation enable MTs to grow and shrink. MTs contribute to the maintenance of the cell shape, the cell polarization, the cell movement and the intracellular transportation of other biological molecules and complexes. These important and diverse functions of MTs rely on their dynamic properties which, in turn, are regulated by MT-associated proteins. MTs emerge from a specialized structure within the cell called the MT organising centre (MTOC). MTOC contains another type of tubulin, gamma-tubulin, which, in association with several other proteins, forms a structure called gamma-tubulin complex (gamma-TuC) that acts as a nucleation seed for alpha/beta tubulin dimers to polymerise. In addition, many of the MT regulatory proteins are found to be concentrated at the MTOC. In this project, I aim to investigate MT regulation during meiotic cell division using yeast as a model organism. Many advances in understanding biology come from leads established in model systems. Fundamental cellular activities, such as ones performed by MTs, are conserved from yeasts to humans. A prime example of the impact of model systems upon the field is the identification of gamma-tubulin in a filamentous fungus A. nidulans. Search for homologous proteins of A. nidulans gamma-tubulin identified human gamma-tubulin. Another example is that extensive analyses employing budding yeast S. cerevisiae brought about identification and insights into conserved components of gamma-TuC. Following these leads I also aim to exploit in my work a highly tractable system the fission yeast S. pombe. In fission yeast, extensive conformational change of MT architecture takes place during meiosis. I have previously identified a protein called Hrs1, which appears on the MTOC during the early stage of meiosis, and induces a special MT conformation through this stage. I assume that there exists a regulatory system which makes Hrs1 to appear temporarily on the MTOC and assists the transition from one meiotic stage to the other. In this proposal, I will examine this assumption to obtain better insight into the MTOC regulation. Model systems are living test tubes which enable us to precisely examine working hypotheses in order to extract concepts applicable to other living organisms. Placing such information in the context of what we know about the MTOC of less tractable organisms provides valuable insights into the general MTOC function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F014597/1","grantId":"BB/F014597/1","fundValue":"496243","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The press release of the finding at the University of Leicester informed public about the way to analyse microtubule structure, which may be disturbed in neural developmental genetic disorders, using yeast as a model system.

It organises radial microtubule (rMT) array and we termed it rMTOC. Strikingly, the rMTOC is proteineous structure that resembles to the pericentriolar material (PCM) of the centrosome of higher eukaryotes. It is highly likely that rMTOC serves as an excellent model for PCM, a prototype of mirotubule anchoring matrix.\nWe also found that the rMTOC formation is dependent on the Hrs1/Mcp6, a meiosis specific rMTOC component. Hrs1/Mcp6 is rigorously downregulated both by proteasome-dependent degradation and phosphorylation to promote rMT dissolution and bipolar spindle formation at the onset of meiosis I. Together, our study reveals the molecular basis for the transient generation of a novel MTOC which triggers a programme of MT remodeling that is essential for meiosis.
