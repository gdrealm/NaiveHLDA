It addresses clear knowledge gaps identified by NERC, DEFRA and UKERC in the effects of MREDs on flow conditions, habitats and ecological interactions. It will use a wealth of observation techniques above and under water, ranging from radar to sonar and in situ measurements, to be deployed over 2 years at 3 key sites around the UK. These measurements will feed into models of ecological interactions and habitat preferences, allowing predictions of the multiple effects of large MRED arrays.\nBeing fully cross-disciplinary, this project will engage different academic beneficiaries at each stage. Researchers in the field of instrument design (in the laboratory and at sea) will benefit from our experience in building the different systems and adapting them to long-term deployments on the seabed, in extremely challenging environments. This will be done by carefully planned Knowledge Exchange activities and open-access publication of our results, as well as exchange of personnel. The avenues opened for continuous imaging of complex and dynamic 3-D structures will be useful to researchers in other fields associated with ecological systems and marine structures, but also in medical 4-D imaging.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J004200/1","grantId":"NE/J004200/1","fundValue":"164041","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-22","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used in the field, at the European Marine Energy Centre, during the project itself.

But how clean are these new energies? How do they affect the environment? Through the FLOWBEC-4D project, we have designed a new series of instruments and a methodology to analyse measurements, which we validated over 5 deployments at different sites with and without MRE structures.\n\n(1) We have designed and developed an acoustic imaging system, integrated into a subsea platform (the FLOWBEC platform). The 4-tonne frame hosts instruments to image the seabed and water column and its environmental conditions. The frame can be deployed fast (20 minutes in 40 metres of water) to account for rapidly changing tides or sea conditions/ The FLOWBEC system can take measurements up to 8 times per second over 2 weeks, catching details of a few centimetres to a range of 50 m.\n\n(2) We have successfully deployed and recovered the FLOWBEC platform in the challenging waters of Orkney (Scotland), for 5 deployments of 2 weeks each in 2012 and 2013. We have measured the environments around two tidal turbines, one wave-energy converter and two control sites with no MRE structures. Deployments were conducted during the seabird breeding season which peaks in summer months, assessing the interactions between seabirds, fish and marine mammals. For multibeam imagery alone, several Terabytes of data cover ranges of 50 m from the sonar, encompassing the MRE structure (if any), the seabed, the water surface and any object within range, all imaged 7 times a second for 2 weeks.\n\n(3) Algorithms for noise removal, target detection and tracking have been written. It is possible to estimate collision risk and the impact of the turbine structure on tracked targets by considering the vertical distribution of targets and what percentage are likely to encounter the turbine structure. Tracking analyses allow the environmental effect of MRE devices to be explored using the distribution of targets (plankton, fish, birds, marine mammals) and predator-prey interactions with time, tide and space, where space includes vertical use of the water column, and horizontal distribution around the wave and tidal sites, and how this changes with the presence and absence of structures. The vertical habitat preferences of these ecological groups and collision risks can also be evaluated by looking at spatial overlap with MREDs, and collision risk predicted by looking at the overlap with conditions favoured for siting of future MRE structures.\n\n(4) Early dialogue between engineers, scientists and end-users has resulted in a tool (the FLOWBEC platform) and a methodology (data acquisition, target detection and tracking) which can be applied to any MRE structure around the world. This approach can also be used to check the environmental and ecological impacts of any other offshore structure. Our findings have already been put to use by others, as the different deployments in 2012 and 2013 have taken place at the European Marine Energy Centre (Orkney, Scotland). \nResults have been shared with the developers of the Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) structures at different stakeholder forums, using the NERC MRE Knowledge Exchange Network. Close liaison with other FLOWBEC partners working at Strangford Lough (Northern Ireland) and WaveHub (Cornwall), as well as the FabTest facility (Cornwall), have informed the development of the processing/interpretation approach.\n\nThe FLOWBEC platform, and the accompanying methodology for processing and interpreting the data, can be applied to sites all over the world, connected to renewable energy or to any offshore construction or long-term activity. A Knowledge Transfer Partnership, spearheaded by the University of Aberdeen (co-PI on FLOWBEC) and including the National Oceanography Centre â€“ Liverpool (PI on FLOWBEC) and the University of Bath (co-PI on FLOWBEC), has recently been signed with MeyGen, to develop these ideas in a wider setting.\n\nThe next step, already under way, is to integrate the measurements already done, or soon to be done, with the FLOWBEC platform into wider ecological models of the areas around MRE structures.
