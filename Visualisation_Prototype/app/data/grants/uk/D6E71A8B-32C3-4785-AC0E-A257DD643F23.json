Asylum, School and Lodging House Interiors in London and South-East England, 1845-1914.","abstractText":"<p>The experience of institutional living and concerns over the plan, design and decoration of residential institutions are not new. Victorian England saw a dramatic growth in institutional spaces in which large numbers of inmates could permanently reside. From the 1830s the relief of the poor, the punishment of criminals, the treatment of the mentally and physically ill, and the education of children were all subject to increasing charitable activity and government intervention.</p>\n\n<p>This project will examine the impact of the design, decoration and furnishing of residential institutional spaces on the experiences of their inmates. The project will focus on three case studies: lunatic asylums (as they were known to contemporaries), schools for middle-class children, and common and charitable lodging houses. </p>\n\n<p>Firstly, the project will explore the role of government legislation and recommendations in fashioning institutional life, but equally important is the investigation of the limitation of this power. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the project will assess the relationship between institutional spaces and contemporary domesticity, that is, the ideals and practices of the family home. To what extent were inmates able to achieve privacy and could the inhabitants of a nineteenth-century institution ever hope to feel &quot;at home&quot;?</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0389","grantId":"RES-061-25-0389","fundValue":"229792","fundStart":"2010-01-04","fundEnd":"2012-07-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Elizabeth Hamlett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":" The idea of home, and upper- and middle-class domestic practices, was a major influence on the decoration of the three institutional types. The Commissioners in Lunacy, housing reformers and headmistresses shared a language of domesticity, stressing &quot;comfort&quot; and &quot;cheerfulness&quot;. In asylums, this was crucial to attempts at cure. Domesticity was supposed to civilise poor lodgers. Girls' schools drew legitimacy from domestic social practices. In contrast, headmasters emphasised that boys should not enjoy feminine comforts, but they too drew on domesticity, defining themselves against it. Institutional governing bodies had diverse aims - cure, education, reform, sanitisation and control -- but home was a common point of reference. \n\n\n\nThe drive for domesticity led to a close attention to the material environment. Common lodging-house keepers were compelled to clean and whitewash. Model lodging-houses offered coffee- and reading-rooms, and sleeping cubicles. Rowton and LCC houses were decorated to a high standard. Asylum dayrooms and galleries, both public and private, often overflowed with ornaments and draperies. Girls' boarding-houses were decorated like middle-class homes, but were also modelled on the public schools whose power they sought to appropriate. In contrast, boys' houses were sparsely furnished, with sporting trophies and portraits, emphasising their collective, institutional nature. \n\n\n\nHow successfully domesticity transferred to inhabitants is questionable. Attempts to create home-like material worlds often failed. Institutions might not deliver - some asylums were badly managed, and many common lodging-houses evaded inspection. Inmates might damage institutional d?cor, or they might ignore their surroundings. Some asylum patients did feel comforted, and were grateful. But others were too unwell, or disturbed, to engage with the environment. Lodgers were often indifferent to d?cor, instead defining home through duration of stay and their relationships with other inmates. Schoolboys were the most at home, often creating almost fanatical material traditions.\n\n\n\nThe material world was an essential part of the operation of institutional power. Surveillance, as outlined by Foucault, was present in all the institutions surveyed, but it differed in meaning and consequences. In asylums, close surveillance was as much about patient safety as discipline. Lodgers in LCC houses recognised that surveillance was sometimes in their collective interests. Boarding-school girls come closest to Foucault's theory, as teachers, struggling to discipline without corporal punishment, constantly watched them. Dormitories had viewing holes for passing headmistresses. In contrast, a sharp line was drawn in boys' houses between pupil space and the 'private side of the house', leaving boys to discipline themselves.\n\n\n\nHowever, inmates also used the material world to exercise agency. Older schoolboys and some patients had their own rooms. Boys decorated their studies, and the ability to quickly domesticate, proved useful later, in chambers, barracks and the colonies. Others had to resort to smaller strategies. Female patients could find satisfaction in their needlework. Inmates created meaning through shared material cultures. Schoolboys and lodgers pooled food and drink - small hospitalities challenging the limits of institutional provision. Material jokes (e.g. apple-pie beds) were common to both. However limited an individual's control, the material world was almost always open to small acts of self-fashioning.  Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
