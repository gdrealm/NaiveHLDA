Because of this they need to be accurately represented in climate and weather prediction models. Recent observations of atmospheric Saharan dust by UK scientists provide strong evidence for the existence in mineral dust layers of particles that are predominantly vertically aligned. This alignment is thought to be due to atmospheric electricity associated with the dust layers. Computer modelling indicates that the alignment can significantly change the properties of the dust layers, including the amount of light they transmit, absorb and reflect. This has been termed a 'Venetian blind effect' from the way the tilted particles influence the amount of transmitted light and heat. Change in this and other properties can have significant impact on measurements of dust clouds from satellites, and possibly also on dust movement through the atmosphere. The proposed project will answer urgent questions concerning the precise origin, magnitude, extent and impact of this phenomenon by the use of a variety of measurements from the ground, balloons and aircraft, carried out in the Middle East. The project will result in improved understanding of dust and has the potential to solve a long-standing enigma concerning the movement of dust clouds on the continental scale. The proposal takes advantage of a major opportunity offered by the UK Met Office MEVEX flight campaign, to carry out this project at little additional cost. Therefore it provides excellent value for money.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G007268/1","grantId":"NE/G007268/1","fundValue":"67673","fundStart":"2009-01-21","fundEnd":"2010-05-20","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The dust radiosondes developed during the project were used in 2010 and 2011 to verify the presence of volcanic ash from Icelandic volcanoes.

A byproduct of the project has been an aerosol radiosonde for launching on meteorological balloons. The radiosondes have already been used for detecting ash from the Eyafjallajokull eruption. The Met Office stocks them for use during future volcanic events. The aerosol radiosondes developed by this project can be used for atmospheric aerosol, including volcanic ash. A project is due to start shortly where a commercial version of the radiosonde will be developed. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Environment,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
