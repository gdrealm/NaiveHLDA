Brand new evidence of the relationship between mosses and microbes in these northern forests is suggesting that any disturbance of these environments will alter their natural CO2 mopping activity. Findings will be of interest to academics, researchers and educators as well as mathematical model makers and users. With improved understanding and predictions policy and land users can make more realistic decision regarding forest management for sustainability. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
