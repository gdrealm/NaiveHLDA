{"id":"66A616B7-DDF7-48FF-90CF-C2B1C8658BAD","title":"The mechanics of epithelial tissues","abstractText":"Many of the cavities and free surfaces of the human body (e.g. gut, lungs, blood vessels) are lined by tissues just a few cells thick. These epithelial tissues separate the body's internal environment from the external environment. As part of their normal function, epithelial tissues are continuously exposed to large mechanical deformations: lung alveoli deform during respiration, intestinal epithelia resist peristaltic movements in the gut, and endothelia are exposed to pulsatile fluid shear stresses in blood flow. The mechanical function of epithelia is particularly apparent in disease when mutations or pathogens affecting the cell skeleton (cytoskeleton) or junctions linking cells to one another result in fragile tissues that tear during routine function (e.g. epidermis bullosa, staphylococcus blistering). Cells within epithelial tissues are tightly connected to one another by intercellular junctions: some junctions form a barrier restricting the passage of solutes across the tissue whilst others integrate the cytoskeletons of neighbouring cells to form a strong multicellular tissue that can withstand mechanical stresses. Despite their clear mechanical role, little is currently known about the mechanics of epithelial tissues and how this derives from the mechanical properties of the cells that make up the tissue and the proteins that make up the cells. This is primarily due to the lack of specific experimental techniques to measure the intrinsic mechanical properties of tissues while monitoring cellular and subcellular traits.\n\nWe have developed a novel tool to quantify the mechanics of epithelial tissues by stretching cultured epithelia. During tissue deformation, the applied mechanical tension can be measured and the tissues can be simultaneously imaged at subcellular, cellular and tissue length scales, such that the architecture of the sub-cellular components, the shape of the cells and their eventual reorganisation can be accurately monitored as a function of the imposed force. To complement this experimental tool, we have developed a novel computational model of epithelial tissues that can serve as a means to interpret and refine our experiments.\n\nWe now propose to use our new techniques to understand what proteins play a role in setting the mechanical properties of epithelial tissues. To do this, we will focus on three aims:\n\n1) Develop a systematic methodology for characterizing the mechanics of tissues\n2) Discover what proteins set tissue mechanical properties\n3) Incorporate our findings into a computational model of tissues.\n\nAim1 is geared at creating a systematic methodology for collecting all of the necessary information to fully characterise the mechanics of normal tissues.\n\nIn aim 2, we will ask how the absence of a given protein affects the mechanics of a tissue. To answer this question, we will reduce the level of expression of a chosen gene in the cells that make up the tissue and measure how this affects the mechanics of the tissue. We will also examine how gene depletion changes the organization of the tissue and the cells that compose it. We will pay particular attention to proteins identified in clinical studies of fragile epithelia, as they have direct relevance to patients and potential palliative therapies.\nIn aim 3, we will use computational and statistical approaches to identify what cellular structures are the most important for setting tissue mechanics using the results of aim 2. Moreover, this analysis and the experiments from aim 2 will directly support the development of a model specifically tailored to study tissue mechanics at large deformation and used to refine our understanding of how changes in protein expression within cells can lead to failure of epithelial sheets, as in clinical cases.\n\nIn summary, the proposed investigations will greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanics of epithelial tissues and how pathologies can affect tissue strength.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M003280/1","grantId":"BB/M003280/1","fundValue":"355117","fundStart":"2015-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Guillaume Thomas Charras","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
