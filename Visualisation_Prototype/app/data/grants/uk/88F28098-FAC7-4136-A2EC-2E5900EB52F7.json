{"id":"88F28098-FAC7-4136-A2EC-2E5900EB52F7","title":"The Development of Biological Motion Processing During Infancy","abstractText":"<p>Face movement is complicated because faces do two very different things. They move rigidly, when we nod or shake our heads. But they also move non-rigidly: our faces actually change shape as 12 different muscles work in concert to form a smile.</p> \n<p>The aim of this project is this: are infants born face experts or do they have to learn face recognition? We know that from birth, infants are interested in face shapes, but the ability to perceive motion accurately takes a little longer to develop. </p> \n<p>In this project we will investigate the development of infantsâ€™ ability to recognise gender from facial motion, and if they can tell the difference between faces shown from different viewpoints. These are tasks that are very difficult for computers, but easy for humans. More importantly, we hope to learn more about the development of motion perception.</p> \n<p>Our preliminary studies suggest that infants can recognise face motion from different viewpoints, but that their motion perception is not yet mature. It seems that infants do not show an inversion effect for face movement. This would suggest they are using an immature motion processing system, which has not yet developed a specialisation for upright faces.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E00167X/1","grantId":"ES/E00167X/1","fundValue":"78013","fundStart":"2006-09-05","fundEnd":"2008-05-04","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Janine Veronique Spencer","coPersons":["Justin Matthew O'Brien","Alan  Johnston"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
