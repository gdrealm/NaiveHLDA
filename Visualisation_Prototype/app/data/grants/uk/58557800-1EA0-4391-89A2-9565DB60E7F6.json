We will use a unique marriage of concepts extracted from ultrasonics and photonics that are intrinsically generic in applicability. This new field will deliver unprecedented accuracy and control for delivery, together with improved efficacy and selectivity, and a much reduced risk of infection. This research will lead to a quantum leap for biologists who are studying the cell's chemical pathways or signals (cellular signal transduction) through to histological/clinical approaches. For example within a population of cells it will be possible to target each cell individually, introducing foreign biological material into any cell. This is central for studies in numerous human diseases. By the use of fibre optic delivery and endoscopes, we envisage that the realisation of this basic technology may allow us to develop a non-invasive surgical technique.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D04877X/1","grantId":"EP/D04877X/1","fundValue":"1023450","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kishan  Dholakia","coPersons":["Andrew  Riches","Frank James Gunn-Moore","Wilson  Sibbett"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
