{"id":"BE4E794C-5D9D-4653-9BE5-64DF59E33AEA","title":"Synaptic plasticity during cortical slow wave activity","abstractText":"When neurons in the brain become excited, they 'fire' electrical impulses, which they rapidly transmit to all their contacts. The points at which neurons contact each other are called synapses, and long-term changes in the strength of these synaptic connections are thought to provide the biological basis of the brain's ability to learn and remember. If synaptic strengths are continuously altered as we go about our daily lives, is there a point at which the flow of electricity through the brain will eventually become congested? One hypothesis is that sleep provides a critical period for retuning synaptic connections, to enable continued and efficient learning. \n\nDuring sleep, the brain alternates between two different patterns of electrical activity - low-amplitude fast oscillations, associated with rapid eye movements and vivid dreaming, and slow wave oscillations of deep sleep. It is the slow wave oscillations that have been implicated in playing a role in retuning synapses in brain circuits, but the cellular mechanisms have yet to be resolved. The aim of this project to record directly the strength of synaptic connections in cortical circuits, and determine how they change during sleep-related slow wave oscillations. We will use thin slices of brain tissue, which preserve the intrinsic patterns of slow wave oscillations, while allowing unprecedented access to monitor synaptic events using electrical measurements and optical imaging techniques. These experiments will determine how the precise sequences of neuronal firing during slow wave oscillations are translated into increases versus decreases in synaptic strength, and thus provide insights into rules and mechanisms by which slow wave sleep recalibrates neuronal circuits.\n\nSleep has previously been viewed as an evolutionary adaptation to conserve energy during dark and cold nights, but we now know that the brain is highly active during sleep, suggesting it has a positive function. Nevertheless, the need to sleep is still commonly viewed as a nuisance in our busy schedules, and we take stimulants and sedatives to override our biological clocks. Disturbances in sleep are correlated with problems in physical and mental health, and resolving the function of sleep is a critical step to determining the pathway to healthy aging.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J018074/1","grantId":"BB/J018074/1","fundValue":"436571","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our research project explores the role of slow wave sleep in oscillations in regulating plasticity in the brain. Sleep is increasingly sacrificed in the face demands from work and society, and becomes fragmented with age. Understanding the basic functions of sleep will be critical for informing public policy on the health and education, from school times for teenagers to sleep management in the elderly.\nWe have presented our data at conferences, but are only now in the process of submitting our findings for publication. Following publication of our research, we will seek to highlight the research to non-academic communities, and plan to maximize the public impact of our research through our partnership with Prof Foster's Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute.\nThe project is going as planned, but, at present, we are not able to claim an impact beyond academia.

It has been suggested that these slow wave oscillations play a role in retuning the strength of connections between neurons (synapses) following awake experience, and that this process is important for memory consolidation.\nWe have used thin slices of brain tissue, which preserve the intrinsic patterns of slow wave oscillations, to test directly how this activity modulates synaptic strength. We have found:\ni) Synapses that are activated during Up states are preferentially weakened.\nii) The precise temporal correlation between presynaptic activation and postsynaptic spiking during Up states, enables synapses to be maintained or strengthened.\niii) Up states influence the amplitude and kinetics of postsynaptic calcium influx, which determines the nature of plasticity.\nThese findings suggest that slow wave sleep has a homeostatic role in down-scaling the overall strength of synaptic connections, but can also support active consolidation of memory traces. The aim of this project is to determine the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity during sleep-related slow wave oscillations in in the medial entorhinal cortex. We will take this forward in future projects in two directions:\ni) Examining how slow wave sleep modulates synaptic strength in vivo\nii) Examining the role of dendritic mitochondria in regulating slow wave sleep plasticity.\nAddressing these current and future questions requires advances in remote-focusing multiphoton microscopy, which will be of use to researchers across multiple disciplines.\nThe findings of these projects will benefit other researchers attempting to understand the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, the functions of sleep, and how sleep disturbances impact human health.
