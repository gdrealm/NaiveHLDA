An ethnographic approach to the value question opens up new avenues of inquiry because the ethnographer is not just interested in political-economic theories of value but also local modes of valuation in different intercultural contexts. </p>\n\n<p>What anthropological research offers, is not an abstract theory of value, but concrete analysis of valuers that situates findings within a generalised, historically-informed comparative framework of analysis in the Asia Pacific region.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2561","grantId":"RES-062-23-2561","fundValue":"292099","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen Margaret Sykes","coPersons":["Christopher Alan  Gregory","Fiona Caroline Magowan"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
