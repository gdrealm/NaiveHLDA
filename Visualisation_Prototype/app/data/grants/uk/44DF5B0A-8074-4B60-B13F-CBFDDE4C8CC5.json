{"id":"44DF5B0A-8074-4B60-B13F-CBFDDE4C8CC5","title":"EMBER: Effects of Moorland Burning on the Ecohydrology of River basins","abstractText":"Controlled burning is used worldwide for the management of vegetation, yet there is serious concern about the environmental implications of such practices. Across Northern England and parts of Scotland, moorland burning is a traditional practice for encouraging and maintaining heather growth (75% of the world's heather cover occurs in the UK uplands). However, detailed evaluations of the costs, benefits and sustainability of burning are hampered by a lack of basic scientific data. Many moorland owners feel pressured to change what they see as traditional practice despite any convincing evidence of environmental degradation and this is causing serious tension between farmers and regulators. The problem also has major financial implications because heather burning is subsidised by the government under its environmental stewardship scheme, whilst paradoxically an estimated &pound;450-630M is being spent on trying to improve the quality of water courses to meet Water Framework Directive requirements. Unsurprisingly, evaluation of burn sustainability is one of the most pressing applied ecological issues for which upland managers are requesting evidence from the scientific community. EMBER will address these issues by providing the first co-ordinated evaluation of moorland burning effects on river catchment hydrological and ecological processes. Case study sites influenced by prescribed burns will be established in internationally important SSSIs in the Peak District and North Pennines, UK. Without this research, our understanding of hydrological and ecological responses to moorland burning will remain poor, biodiversity will be at risk and these systems will potentially fail to meet EU and UK policy requirements with resultant implications for landowners. EMBER will increase understanding of the processes linking prescribed moorland burning, hydrology, water quality and stream invertebrate communities in upland peat dominated catchments. Four work packages (WP) will ai to: 1. increase understanding of the effects of moorland patch burning on the hydrology and physicochemistry of peat, through examination of changes in soil hydrology and water quality. 2. provide a better understanding of the effects of moorland patch burning on basin runoff quantity and quality, through examination of river flow regimes, suspended sediment concentration and water chemistry. 3. assess the influence of changes in stream hydrology, water quality and sediment fluxes on stream ecosystems through examination of stream invertebrate community biodiversity and fish abundance 4. gain a more fundamental understanding of some environmental drivers of upland aquatic community response to burning by experimentally manipulating fine sediment flux under controlled conditions using a series of streamside mesocosms. Taken together these packages will provide a holistic patch- to basin-scale evaluation of burning from the perspective of peat hydrology, chemistry, river water quantity and quality, and stream ecosystems, thus providing the balanced knowledge base which is currently lacking. In the longer-term we expect EMBER to act as a major reference underpinning UK moorland burning policy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G00224X/1","grantId":"NE/G00224X/1","fundValue":"623912","fundStart":"2009-07-06","fundEnd":"2013-03-05","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  EMBER results used in multiple parts of the upland evidence review on burning\n\nhttp://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/5978072?category=5968803\n NEER004 edition 1 - The effects of managed burning on upland peatland biodiversity, carbon and water Agriculture/Food and Drink,Environment,Leisure Activities including Sports/ Recreation and Tourism,Government/ Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy Cultural,Societal","person":"Lee Eric Brown","coPersons":["Sheila Mary Palmer","Joseph  Holden"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" See http://www.wateratleeds.org/fileadmin/documents/water_at_leeds/EMBER_2_page_exec_summary.pdf\n\nKey findings are:\n• Prescribed burning on peatlands was shown to have clear effects on\npeat hydrology, peat chemistry and physical properties, river water\nchemistry and river ecology.\n• Burning reduces the organic matter content of the upper peat layers.\nThe net result is that the peat is less able to retain important particles\nknown as exchangeable cations. In other words, the peat in burned sites\nis deprived of chemicals which are important for plant growth and for\nbuffering acidic rainfall.\n• Lower concentrations of nutrient elements found in peat soils in burned\nriver basins do not support the idea that burning enriches the peat with\nnutrients from ash.\n• Rivers draining burned catchments were characterised by lower calcium\nconcentrations and lower pH relative to rivers draining unburned\ncatchments. Rivers draining burned sites had higher concentrations of\nsilica, manganese, iron and aluminium compared to unburned\ncatchments.\n• There was no difference between burned and unburned catchments in\npeat nitrogen concentrations or in carbon to nitrogen ratios (high C/N is\nconsidered unfavourable to microbial decomposition of peat), and no\nsignificant changes in peat pH.\n• Water-table depth is very important in peatlands for maintaining their\nstability and function as a carbon store. Water tables were found to be\nsignificantly deeper for burned catchments than for unburned ones.\nDeeper water tables would suggest a greater scope for degradation of\nthe peat and loss of carbon to the atmosphere.\n• Sphagnum is an important peat-forming species. Changes in the\nhydrological properties of the peat after fire make the peat less\nconducive to Sphagnum moss growth.\n• River flow in catchments where burning has taken place appears to be\nslightly more prone to higher flow peaks during heavy rain. However, this\nwas not a conclusive finding.\nTHE EMBER PROJECT\nThis document summarises findings of a study into the effects of moorland burning on peatlands, carried out by scientists\nworking on the EMBER project. The EMBER project was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council with additional\nsupport from Yorkshire Water. The comprehensive five year study assessed the impacts of prescribed vegetation burning by\ncomparing five burned and five unburned river basins across the English Pennines. The EMBER project compared the hydrology,\nwater chemistry, soil properties and aquatic ecosystems of these burned and unburned areas.\nThe uplands of the UK are an important source of river water, form valuable habitats, provide a large store of carbon and deliver diverse environments for recreation\nand farming. There has been concern about prescribed vegetation burning in the uplands in terms of its impacts on river waterq uality and flows, river ecology,\npeatland hydrology, soil physical properties and carbon storage. There are ongoing debates about the wider environmental impacts of burning, although the evidence\nbase to date is minimal because there has been a lack of co-ordinated research into how burning affects upland environments. The EMBER project has provided new\nintegrated understanding across multiple linked river basin processes (soils to streams), using comparable methods at replicated study sites and over a broad\ngeographical region (Pennines).\n• Burning vegetation alters the natural peat hydrology in the upper layers\nof the peat affecting the balance of where water flow occurs. Recovery\nof many hydrological properties appears to be possible if a site is left\nunburned over many years.\n• Prescribed peatland vegetation burning leads to significant increases in\nmean and maximum near-surface soil temperatures in the years\nfollowing burning as well as lower minima (and thus wider thermal\nvariability).\n• Thermal regimes appear to recover as vegetation regrows. This recovery\nwas also seen in soil hydrology data from burned plots of different ages.\n• Macroinvertebrates play a vital role in aquatic food webs by feeding on\nalgae, microbes and detritus at the base of food chains before they\nthemselves are consumed by birds, fish and amphibians. The research\nfound that river macroinvertebrate population diversity was reduced in\nburned sites.\n• Particulate organic matter (predominantly peat) deposits were\nincreased up to four-fold in the bed sediments of burned rivers\ncompared to unburned rivers.\n• In burned sites, river macroinvertebrate populations were dominated by\ngroups that are commonly found in higher abundance in disturbed river\nsystems, such as non-biting midge larvae (Chironomidae) and\nburrowing stonefly larvae (Nemouridae).\n• Increases in the abundance of disturbance-tolerant taxa counteract\ndeclines and/or losses amongst some groups (i.e. mayflies) which are\ntypically sensitive to reduced pH, increased aluminium and deposition\nof fine sediments. These changes show that burning increases the effect\nof biological stressors compared to unburned rivers. - Education for upland managers\n\n- Education for hill walkers/ramblers about moorland management effects\n\n- RSPB/National Trust have upland reserves\n\n- Important soil and water chemistry findings for water companies with upland holdings/tenants - Natural England/SNH will be able to use the findings for their upland policy making \n\n- Environment Agency may need to rethink some monitoring locations to capture upland changes due to land management\n\n- Data could underpin modelling studies to 'optimise' location and frequency of burning Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism","dataset":"gtr"}
