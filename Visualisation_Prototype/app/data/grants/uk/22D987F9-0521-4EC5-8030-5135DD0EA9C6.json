T lymphocytes seek and destroy pathogen-infected tissue and cells. However, these lymphocytes sometimes wrongly recognise proteins on our own tissues: This can cause destructive conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Because T lymphocytes have such potent ability to be either beneficial or dangerous, their function is tightly regulated. To fight infections, these cells produce a cytokine called IFN-gamma. One of the control mechanisms to regulate the production of IFN-gamma is the induction of another cytokine, IL-10, within the same T cell, which then ?shuts down? IFN-gamm; expression. However, how exactly the T cell regulates the appropriate production of IFN-gamma vs. IL-10 is not understood. We have recently discovered that a protein called CD46 (which is present on the surface of T lymphocytes) is an important trigger for the switching of IFN-gamma to IL-10 in human T cells by sending appropriate signals into the cell. In addition, we have made the exciting observation that our finding is important for understanding a major human disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA): We observed that the CD46 signals transduced do not work properly in T cells from RA patients (they do not shut down IFN-gamma). We now aim at finding out what exactly happens on a molecular level inside the cells when CD46 is activated on the cell surface of a healthy T cell. Understanding these ?signaling events? within healthy T cells will then allow us to compare those to data to signals from RA patients? T cells and define exactly were things ?are going wrong?. The understanding of this induction pathway will then lay the groundwork to understand the pathogenesis of RA and thereby to develop better diagnostics and therapies. The main investigator (CK) of this study is a leading authority in the functions of CD46 and regulatory lymphocytes. She has recently relocated from the US to the MRC Centre for Transplantation at King?s College and will now collaborate with outstanding experts (AC) in the RA field and in cytokine regulation (PL) on this project. Because King?s emphasizes strongly the crosstalk between basic research and clinical/patient work, CK will be in a position to rapidly interpret the findings for patient benefit. The proposed funding will help establish this promising body of work in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002165","grantId":"G1002165","fundValue":"857584","fundStart":"2011-06-13","fundEnd":"2014-06-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Claudia Marlis Kemper","coPersons":["Paul  Lavender","Andrew Paul Cope"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
