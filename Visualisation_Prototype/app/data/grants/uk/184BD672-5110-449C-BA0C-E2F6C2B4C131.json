The difficulties involved in understanding and in managing culturally and religiously diverse societies make it so. The recent furore surrounding Dr. Rowan Williams' passing remarks about Sharia Law only testifies to the delicacy of these difficulties and the confusions of thought they evoke. The role of theory is not to resolve those difficulties but to clear them of misunderstandings which make their solution impossible; because these misunderstandings have developed over time, in step with the difficulties, theory must be supplemented by history. \\n\\nHistory shows that the difficulties confronting diverse modern societies - of religiously-inspired dissatisfaction, dissent and mistrust - are strikingly similar to, and in some respects owe their special character to, the difficulties that confronted the divided societies of 17th century Europe. If we wish to understand the difficulties of the present, we must re-learn what it means to think about the problems of religious toleration and dissent with the combination of imagination, breadth and seriousness that characterised the greatest minds of the 17th century. This is the central intellectual objective of my proposed research project, 'John Locke and toleration'.\\n\\nLocke's reputation at the present time is in some respects a curious one. On the one hand he is by common consent acknowledged to have exercised a dominant influence on the development of the idea of toleration in subsequent liberal thought. Thus he is regarded as a key figure in the history of the idea of toleration and of liberalism generally, because he put into currency certain persuasive conceptions which contributed centrally to the emergence and spread of liberal ways of thinking about toleration which continue to ramify in the present. On the other hand, it is noticeable that detailed consideration of his work in its own terms has not figured prominently in recent writing about toleration. \\n\\nIn works of political philosophy his name is often invoked but his work, if it is read at any length, is interpreted with an eye to present-day categories and with the matching tendency to silently edit those parts of it which do not accord so well with present-day interests and assumptions. Emphasis is laid on particular passages in Locke's texts but his argument as a whole, and the assumptions that supported it, recede from view. In historical works his views are explained and explicated with reference to the different schools of thought which allegedly exerted an influence upon his thinking. Either way, the special character of Locke's arguments, the comprehensiveness and particularity of his vision, and the originality of his position is systematically obscured.\\n\\nThe project therefore has three interpretative aims: to identify the fundamental points in Locke's mature position about toleration, to distinguish this position from the positions formulated by Locke's predecessors, contemporaries and opponents and to show how Locke's position connects to wider views of politics, God and the human understanding. The pursuit of these aims will generate three thematically connected publications, (i) a critical edition of an as yet unpublished Locke manuscript on toleration (ii) an article in a refereed journal about the context and composition of this manuscript and (iii) a commissioned chapter on the development of Locke's position about toleration. Together, these aims embrace a single purpose: to understand Locke's idea of toleration in its own terms and in doing so to shed new light on the possibilities for thinking about toleration today. \\n\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G00773X/1","grantId":"AH/G00773X/1","fundValue":"16964","fundStart":"2008-10-13","fundEnd":"2009-01-12","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy Arthur Stanton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" The critical findings of the project relate to the standard views of Locke, liberalism, and toleration. On the standard view of these items, Locke gives classic expression to a view of toleration that is central to liberalism. This view embraces at least five connected positions, that (i) religion is the business of the individual, whose (ii) possesses a right to choose his way of addressing it, so that (iii) religion is private, i.e. optional and is to be (iv) tolerated by the state - thus (v) coercion of this individual by government in respect of religion is inappropriate. These views, it is supposed, are given organized form by Locke who relies on them to ground his rejection of the use of force in relation to religion. However there is a curious inconsistency, even blemish, in his thinking, because he denies toleration to Roman Catholics and atheists. The result is a Locke who is a simulacrum of John Stuart Mill or John Rawls. This project decisively shifts the terms in which Locke is understood away from this standard view. It shows that with Locke religion is neither private nor optional, and is a matter of duty rather than right primarily, a duty prescribed by natural law. Law directs Locke to jurisdiction, and, more precisely, to two corresponding jurisdictions, the eccesiastical and civil. The different ends implied in these two jurisdictions and the different ways in which they are established make church and state free from each other's direction, so that worship in a church is simply outside civil jurisdiction, and not subject to it: this worship is therefore not tolerated by the state, for the state has no jurisdiction over it, but is free , and toleration finds its place in the toleration of other people's manner of worshipping God by every one. Conversely the state, because it is responsible for upholding the ends implied in civil jurisdiction, is required to coerce Roman Catholics and atheists, whose different prepossessions undermine the possibility of civil jurisdiction. The state protects civil interests against threats even when these threats are religiously inspired or irreligiously inspired. In short, Locke is not Mill or Rawls and the liberal story about toleration rests on a misreading of Locke and selective quotation of a limited range of the available evidence.  ","dataset":"gtr"}
