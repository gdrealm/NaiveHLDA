Rising levels of literacy, for example, increased the number of individuals engaged in every kind of reading practice. Similarly, the rapid expansion in the production and availability of printed matter, from newspapers and magazines to major works of scholarship and literature, supplied ever-more-diverse material to which common placing techniques could readily be applied. The Georgian invention of literary criticism, both as an academic and as a journalistic enterprise, also appears to have intensified the inherent judgmentalism of readers, encouraging them to evaluate and to reflect upon as well as simply to record their encounters with texts. Meanwhile, the pervasive Enlightenment stress upon the benefits of intelligent and reflective reading as a route to self-knowledge, convincingly articulated by authorities like Addison and Shaftesbury, made many of the procedures which had long been intrinsic to common placing appear more rather than less useful in the decades after 1700.\n\nBecause it is based directly on the detailed study of surviving English commonplace books from this period, the book in which this project culminates is especially alert to the technical features of common placing and to the ways in which they helped shape the activities and experiences of Georgian readers. It offers much evidence, for example, that these practices affected readers' behaviour at every level, from their broad tastes in genre (notably encouraging them to favoured songs and moralistic prose) to their concentration upon certain kinds of material within complex texts (such as the epitaphs and speeches in which commonplaces particularly reveled). Moreover, the specific techniques by which printed materials were made to yield manuscript extracts are shown to have influenced individuals' appreciation and understanding of what they read. In particular, it will be seen that excerpted passages from well-known texts, precisely because they were subjected to radical decontextualisation and recontextualisation when transferred to a commonplace book, frequently took on new and unpredictable meanings for individual readers.\n\nBy focussing attention directly upon the evidence generated by historical acts of reading, this book therefore has wide&shy; ranging implications. It will make an important addition to our understanding of the distinctive context in which the literary culture of the ages of Swift, Johnson and Byron evolved. It will also, however, be of considerable interest to the diverse community of literary scholars, theorists and historians who have recently been seeking to comprehend the nature and implications of reading as a familiar cultural practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E50356X/1","grantId":"AH/E50356X/1","fundValue":"24461","fundStart":"2007-02-05","fundEnd":"2007-06-04","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Allan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
