The aim of this Overseas Travel Grant is to develop the computational expertise of the PI by direct interaction and exchange with the Thermofluids Section at Athens Technical University (headed by Prof Bergeles) who has developed a number of specific inhouse codes (DNS, LES, VOF) and has applied them computational models describing combustion in internal combustion engines. The aim is for the PI to modify numerical codes in order to apply them to study the fundamental processes associated with phase change processes. With the analytical work proposed by the PI, the results from the codes will be validated and applied to new research into dispersion when phase change is important. The visit will be for 2 months, sufficiently long to make head way on the computational side, with the final deliverable reported after 12 months.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E029302/1","grantId":"EP/E029302/1","fundValue":"5425","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Eames","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
