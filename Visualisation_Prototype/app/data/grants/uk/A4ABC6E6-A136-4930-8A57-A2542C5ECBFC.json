This is in stark contrast to the ever-expanding use of antibodies to treat a range of diseases when they are used as binders and modulators of protein function. This feasibility study aims to answer whether this imbalance can be redressed through the utilisation of novel techniques now available in antibody research (specifically improved antibody phage libraries and bispecific antibody technologies) combined with an examination of the therapeutic and commercial potential of catalytic antibodies should the primary issues of poor catalytic efficiency and selectivity as compared to the natural enzymes be addressed. As a test case we have chosen to try and make catalytic antibodies that share the therapeutically useful properties of streptococcal IgG endopeptidase but lack the enzyme's immunogenicity, which seriously limits its clinical potential.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N012356/1","grantId":"BB/N012356/1","fundValue":"119422","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel Shaun Scrutton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
