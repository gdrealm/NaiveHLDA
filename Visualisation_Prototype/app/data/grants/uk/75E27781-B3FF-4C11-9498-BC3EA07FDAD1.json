{"id":"75E27781-B3FF-4C11-9498-BC3EA07FDAD1","title":"Urban Construction Consolidation Centre","abstractText":"A Construction Consolidation Centre (CCC) aims to promote the efficient flow of construction materials through the supply chain to the work face on site. The Urban CCC (UCCC) would enhance performance of the construction site and reduce the impact on environmental issues such as congestion, pollution, and waste. Construction material, less bulk items such as aggregates, would be delivered to the UCCC, where they are formed into work packs, defined by the various contractors, and delivered to the work face, using 'just-in-time' criteria. This process combines (consolidates) multiple part loads into single deliveries and, hence, reduces vehicle movements to site. In this process, unnecessary packaging is removed for re-use or recycling. The material handlers will extract all unused material, manage and reduce waste, and maximise re-use. In the UK, construction consolidation has only been used in London and at Heathrow due to operational necessity (space, vehicle movement reduction and control), and which are largely project specific and temporary in nature. Where construction has not had those imperatives, contractors have chosen to revert to traditional, less efficient supply chain models with consequent negative impacts on the environment and community.The novelty of this project is in the design and operation of a semi-permanent UCCC spanning multiple projects with different start and end dates, providing a 'just-in-sequence' supply option to local construction sites, which targets congestion and environmental benefits in addition to operational savings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/I000313/1","grantId":"TS/I000313/1","fundValue":"95224","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Recent years have witnessed the development of new routes-to-market involving specialist 'last-mile' consolidation and distribution service providers. Sustainable development has been a key driver, with many business-to-business (B2B) applications seeking to reduce congestion (as well as costs) through smart consolidation practices that deliver 'just-in-time'. As part of this research, supply network design configuration and capability tools have incorporated a last-mile methodology which addresses the interests of the various stakeholders - institutional players, companies and customers. \nThe challenges facing the UK construction industry reflect many of the inefficiencies in current practice. 60% of\nplanned vehicle deliveries do not arrive on time, 20% of all UK waste comes from construction, 15% from overordering\nof materials and nearly one hour lost productivity per person per day on every construction project due\nto materials delay. This project looked at identifying the hard and soft factors that influence public sector\napproval in the context of UCCC to aid the development of a collaboration model between private companies\nand public resources, and then link the key processes and requirements of the stakeholders to inform the\npotential development of a new industry standard for the UK construction industry.

The UCCC concept may also inform synchronisation with other modal termini (railway station, airport, docks). \nc) Enable effective working in the logistics industry: future potential to set a new standard throughout the construction logistics industry on 'just-in-time' material consolidation processes and control \nd) Customer focused technology development: principal construction companies, and their sub-contractors in the supply chain are all potential users who may benefit from the efficiencies of the system. The use of consolidation in the context of regeneration may also pioneer a new approach to construction logistics with potential benefits throughout the public sector. The integration of supply network tools with Last Mile design concepts, developed as part of this research, may be used to review possible approaches to re-evaluating public services in a common geographical space. In one application, research findings have informed tool development and integration, and approaches for potential deployment, as the services involved some B2B (and B2C) activity. Scenario development techniques developed may also be used to evaluate mechanisms for network design choices and integration.
