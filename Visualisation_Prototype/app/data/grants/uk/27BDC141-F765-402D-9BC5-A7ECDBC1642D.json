{"id":"27BDC141-F765-402D-9BC5-A7ECDBC1642D","title":"Lymphostromal Interactions in Thymus Development and Function","abstractText":"The thymus gland plays an essential role in immunological protection against infection. It does this by supporting the production of T-lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that is able to recognise and trigger the destruction of foreign materials entering the body. The purpose of this research is to understand how the thymus develops and supports the formation of T-cells from unspecialised blood stem cells. This will help to devise strategies to restore thymus function when this has been damaged or lost, to understand the origins of autoimmune disease which can occur when T-cell development goes wrong and to develop methods to produce T-cells in-vitro for therapeutic use.\n\nAs part of the Birmingham MRC Centre for Immune Regulation, the Groups research activities are listed on the Centre website. In addition, both PIs belong to the University Press Office panel of experts available for public consultation. Both visit schools in the locality and in their home town areas to speak to VI form groups on their work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401620","grantId":"G0401620","fundValue":"1000020","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Eric John Jenkinson","coPersons":["Graham  Anderson"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
