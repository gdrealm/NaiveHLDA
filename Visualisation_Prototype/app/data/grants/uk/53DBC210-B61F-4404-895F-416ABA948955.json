The UK leads the world in the development of this technology. They are also being developed for medical and biological imaging as they can significantly improve currently available systems. They combine silicon micromachining with traditional Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) planar processing on high resistivity silicon to produce sensors with unique properties. These include the world record for survival in a radiation environment and very fast signals. They can also operate to within a hairs breadth of their edge, which allows one to tile them into a larger array with almost no loss of image quality. They have the potential for use in many areas of science and also in homeland security. This project will produce the second generation of this technology which will improve their characteristics and open up new areas of application.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G000778/1","grantId":"ST/G000778/1","fundValue":"162493","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  3D pixel detectors have been used for the first time in the ATLAS experiment (Insertable B-layer).
