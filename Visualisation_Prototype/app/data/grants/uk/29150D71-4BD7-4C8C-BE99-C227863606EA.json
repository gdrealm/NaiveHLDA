{"id":"29150D71-4BD7-4C8C-BE99-C227863606EA","title":"CLOTS - Clots in Legs or TEDs after Stroke","abstractText":"Recent media coverage has alerted the public to the potential importance of venous thromboembolism in the context of long distance air travel, the so called economy class syndrome . Several airlines now offer passengers below knee graduated compression stockings. On this background we believe that the public will be interested in the CLOTS Trial and will be capable of understanding its results. Widespread application of the results, which will maximise the health gains, will be facilitated by a high level of public awareness. If stockings are effective we would aim to achieve a situation where patients and/or their carers would ask for stockings when in hospital. We would disseminate the trial results through the press, the Cochrane collaboration and patient and carer organisations (e.g. Stroke Association and CHSS) to ensure that we not only make healthcare professionals aware but also the general public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200531","grantId":"G0200531","fundValue":"1221660","fundStart":"2003-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Dennis","coPersons":["Peter  Sandercock","John  Reid"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
