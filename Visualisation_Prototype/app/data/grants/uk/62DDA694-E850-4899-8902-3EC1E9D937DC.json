This project examines the extraordinary and enduring appeal of American films in Britain from the 1920s to the present, seeking an understanding of their place in the national culture and imagination. It questions whether films have been a vehicle for 'Americanisation', and through the study of audience research surveys and box office ranking, it investigates the distinctive preferences and taste patterns of British audiences. A series of representative case studies, ranging from The Big Parade (1925) to the Patriot (2000), offers more detailed analysis of British reactions to high profile and controversial films.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112914/1","grantId":"112914/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-15","fundEnd":"2006-05-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Glancy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
