According to the phonological core deficit view of dyslexia (eg, Hulme &amp; Snowling, 1992), the link between rapid naming (RAN) tasks and reading is driven by underlying shared phonological processes. </p>\n\n<p>However, recent research (RES-000-23-0699) has suggested that processes outside phonology, consistent with the ‘Double Deficit’ theory (eg Wolf &amp; Bowers, 1999), may be critical. Evidence was also found for a possible orthographic deficit in a group of children poor at RAN relative to closely matched controls, and the main goal of the proposed research is to investigate, in the same key experimental groups (now aged 9-11 years) the nature of this orthographic deficit. </p>\n\n<p>Do low RAN children have problems learning about individual word-forms, or rather in developing statistical knowledge of commonly occurring letter combinations? An orthographic learning task will show whether, in addition to deficiencies in existing knowledge, the low RAN group struggle to acquire new orthographic representations, which would have implications for vocabulary growth. Longitudinal data will also speak to the enduring debate on the robustness of the RAN-reading link.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2387","grantId":"RES-000-22-2387","fundValue":"79033","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Daisy Ann Powell","coPersons":["Rhona  Stainthorp","Morag  Stuart"],"organisation":"Roehampton University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
