These networks facilitated knowledge exchange between academic and business participants, whilst providing the opportunity for participants to interact with research-informed evidence and case studies of business practice.\n\n\n\nThe project was initially delayed, due to reorganisations in research partners, however, once these initial delays were overcome, approximately 75 businesspeople participated in a programme comprised of 7 workshops in each of the four selected network areas (Burnley, Chorley, Pendle and Preston). The 29 sessions comprised knowledge exchange (academic research-based evidence), business speakers (practical case studies) and action learning sessions enabling participants to consider potential practical implementation in their own businesses. Four of the workshop series were in addition to the original programme specification, and included to supplement the action learning element of the programme. They were led by one of the research partners, 3 Man Factory, a Preston-based creative design and communications SME.\n\n\n\nWorkshop topics included marketing, human resource mediation, the economic environment and access to finance. In addition, a session on corporate social responsibility and additional practical sessions on e-marketing were added to the programme in adaptation to requests received from business participants. In order to cover all of this ground within the 12 month duration of the project, and to address concerns raised by participants who could not attend all sessions, four elements of the programme were covered through a webinar, with the highlights turned into a podcast. This has been uploaded to the LBS blog webpage and remains accessible by network participants.\n\n\n\nWhilst the full impact of the project will not become evident until the later Impact Report, nevertheless, initial feedback suggests the following:\n\no Sessions were well attended\n\no Feedback suggests the material was useful, particularly in relation to marketing topics\n\no Human Resource topics were considered to be less relevant to certain cohorts, possibly due to their small average firm size\n\no Participants indicated a desire to further develop the network in the future, to include sessions on a wider range of topics, particularly related to exploring barriers to progress and growth\n\no Consideration of practical implementation of evidence-based ideas was considered to be the most worthwhile aspect of the programme\n\no Whilst initially hesitant about the action learning element in the programme, participants came to regard this as one of the most useful features of the scheme - i.e. having a facilitated discussion about how to implement ideas, derived from research-informed studies and in line with practical case studies presented in the sessions\n\no The network facilitated closer links between the university, research partners and the participating firms - future meetings have been arranged to try and build upon this legacy\n\n\n\nInitial feedback would, therefore, suggest that the project has met all of its major stated objectives. A more mature understanding will be sought through collation of longitudinal data relating to participating SMEs, to try and identify any medium term effects arising from the programme. Hopefully this evaluation may inform the Impact Report, although full findings are expected to form the basis of an academic paper in the medium term. This is currently being prepared and a copy will be downloaded onto the site once completed and accepted for publication. The project facilitated the enhancement of business performance through a number of inter-related channels, including the exchange of evidence-based research findings and the sharing of best practice practical case studies. These were enhanced via action learning sessions allowing reflection upon the material and consideration of how this may be introduced within participating firms. Consequently, the expressed intent was to facilitate enhanced business performance through the consideration of new ideas and innovative or best practice examples of business practice.\n\n\n\nThe extent to which this enhancement of performance has been achieved will become apparent from the evaluation of the project - the early stages of which will be included in the Impact Report in due course. It is easier to measure certain variables (i.e. sales, profit, employment, productivity) whereas others remain less tangible (i.e. encouraging business leaders to reflect and think outside of their normal frame of reference) and yet equally as important to the ultimate success of the organisations in question. The KN4B programme is a Knowledge Exchange project and therefore has impact objectives built into every aspect of the programme.\n\nEach workshop was designed to combine the benefits arising from exposing SMEs to the insights derived from the latest academic research, alongside case study examples of practical application and action learning sessions intended to facilitate deliberation as to how (whether) these ideas could inform changes in business practice amongst participant companies.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the network has created new links between research partners (local authorities) in the region, the university and the SME community. The project team intend to utilise this relationship by holding follow-up meetings with the research partners, in order to further develop potential future partnerships to benefit business development and growth in the area. Deliberations are being held concerning a potential conference or series of workshops being run, by the university and other stakeholder groups, intended to further this agenda.\n\n\n\nThe results arising from the evaluation of the project will potentially inform the strategy adopted to maintain the momentum established by KN4B (legacy). It will enable the research team to identify the significant factors inherent in strengths and weaknesses of this type of KE programme, which has the potential to inform the academic literature in addition to assist in designing future interventions of this type. If it has proven to have lasting impact, the research team intend to publish their findings and consider application for additional funding to further develop (or fine tune) their approach to secure enhanced business impact.\n\nThe legacy aspect of the prioject has required additional work, since the research partners (local authority economic development departments) were ultimately unable to take over the programme as had been initially agreed upon the development of the programme. Consequently, the academic partners have sought to steer interested SMEs towards participation in one or more of the other knowledge exchange programmes being undertaken by UCLan. This includes a ESF funded project to enhance the prospects of SMEs with high growth potential, the university's incurbation unit assisting fledgling start-up companies, and a bid in collaboration with the Manchester Metropolitan University relating to workplace discipline and SMEs.
