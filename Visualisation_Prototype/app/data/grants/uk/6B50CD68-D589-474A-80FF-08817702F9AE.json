However, au pairs are not protected by employment law. They have no right to a minimum wage, nor defined maximum working hours nor a right to holidays. The project aims are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to investigate the effects of changes to recent UK immigration legislation on the supply of au pairs within the UK</li>\n\n <li>to examine the place of au pairing in the life and work trajectories of au pairs</li>\n\n <li>to evaluate the subjective experience of au pairs</li>\n\n <li>to examine understandings of au pairing within host familiesâ€™ narratives of (good) parenting.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project uses four methods: an on-line survey and analysis of existing data to provide an overview of the nature and extent of au pairing in the UK; in-depth interviews with au pairs to explore their experiences; interviews with host families to uncover how au pairing to fits with their identity as parents and interviews with key informants to provide context.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J007528/1","grantId":"ES/J007528/1","fundValue":"220823","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rosie  Cox","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
