Each year around half a million people across the globe are affected by this bacterium which is a leading cause of meningitis and septicaemia in children. \n\nOur challenge is to understand how the meningococcus escapes surveillance by our immune system to enter into the bloodstream where it causes disease and damage to infected individuals. \n\nThe bacterium lives in constant contact with humans (usually in the nasal passage), so it is exquisitely adapted to cope with our immune system. One example of this is that the bacterium binds a human molecule called factor H (fH) very tightly to its surface which acts to switch off immune responses. Additionally the bacterium covers itself with direct copies of human structures to camoflague itself when in the body. \n\nKnowing the answer to how the bacterium avoids our immune responses would be enormously valuable for designing effective vaccines.\n\nThis project will examine how the bacterium avoids the complement system, a key aspect of human immunity in the nasal passages and the bloodstream. We know that complement is critical in protection against N. meningitidis as people who lack complement factors are at great risk from meningoccal infection, and all our measures of immunity are based on complement. \n\nWe will examine how complement factors are recruited to the surface of the bacterium and how this impacts on the development of the typical skin rash and the rapid progression of meningococcal disease. \n\nThis will also help identify novel vaccines and allow us to evaluate their ability to induce protection. It is already known that complement factors bind to vaccine candidates on several bacteria, including N. meningitidis and the leading cause of pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumoniae. Therefore determining complement binding sites on the meningococcus should lead to the discovery of further vaccine candidates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900888","grantId":"G0900888","fundValue":"3437500","fundStart":"2010-08-02","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christoph Marcel Tang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
