Since April 1998 the operations of these radars have been supported by the UK STP National Facilities panel under a grant awarded to the Radio and Space Plasma Physics Group. This proposal requests funds to support this activity for the next four years. The funds support the operation, maintenance and repair of the radars, data dissemination, experiment design and training in aspects of radar operations and data analysis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E007929/1","grantId":"PP/E007929/1","fundValue":"395532","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Lester","coPersons":["Timothy Kenneth Yeoman","Stephen  Milan"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
