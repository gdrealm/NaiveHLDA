{"id":"F348B669-CC7A-44CF-BD31-DB61751D0832","title":"Axonal transport, protein trafficking and neurological disease","abstractText":"There are currently no effective treatments for motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Indeed, the mechanisms by which motor neurons die in ALS are not even properly understood. However, one of the earliest defects seen in models of the disease is disruption to movement of proteins through the cell by a process termed ?axonal transport?. Defective axonal transport is also seen in several other neurodegenerative diseases. This programme of studies is therefore to gain insight into the mechanisms by which axonal transport is damaged in ALS. We will disseminate our findings to the public in a variety of ways. Firstly, both Chris Miller and Chris Shaw regularly speak to lay audiences of patients and carers on their research at Motor Neurone Disease Association meetings. Chris Shaw has also communicated research findings and strategies on ALS to the public via radio and television broadcasts. In addition, the IOP hosts Open Days (which have been funded by the MRC) in which members of the public, through a series of talks and hands-on research presentations, are exposed to the wide range of neurodegenerative diseases-related research projects that are currently underway in the IOP. Finally, our findings are listed on the IOP WEB pages and receive exposure through the IOP press office.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501573","grantId":"G0501573","fundValue":"1230990","fundStart":"2006-11-06","fundEnd":"2014-08-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Charles John Miller","coPersons":["Christopher E Shaw"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
