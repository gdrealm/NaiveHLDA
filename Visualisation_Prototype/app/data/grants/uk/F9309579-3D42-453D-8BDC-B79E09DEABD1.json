Currently PV cells convert only typically 15 to 18% of the solar radiation into electricity, while the rest of the available energy is lost as heat or reflection. A key barrier to the widespread adoption of photovoltaics is achieving economic viability and reducing losses that occur due to increased temperature. One route towards enhanced efficiency is the use of a solar concentrator, as the area of the expensive photovoltaic cells can then be is reduced. Production of greater output per unit solar cell area can be achieved when solar radiation is concentrated on the photovoltaic via low cost reflecting/refracting materials. Many conceptual practical design, operation and control issues require further research to determine the most successful means by which solar concentration can be deployed for photovoltaics. One innovative approach has been to use the low concentration compound parabolic reflectors which enable the capture of a large part of the diffuse solar radiation in addition to the direct component. This is a particularly suitable approach in the climatic conditions in northern Europe, however, optical efficiency for 2D concentrators are limited to 85%, which can be inproved by developing 3D systems. A PV/T collector typically consists of a PV module at the rear of which an absorber plate (a heat extraction device) is attached. The purpose of the absorber is twofold. Firstly it cools the PV module and thus improves its electrical performance, and secondly it collects the thermal energy produced, which would otherwise been lost as heat to the environment. This collected heat could be used for low temperature applications such as domestic hot water production or space heating. In order to promote this type of solar system, it will be necessary to translate the basic concepts into efficient and functional technological components, and associated performance should be evaluated in a reliable manner. Electric energy production with photovoltaic/thermal solar hybrid system can be enhanced with the employment of concentrating devices. Concentrating PV operates at a relatively higher temperatures compared to the flat plate PV module, thus concentrating PV/T with overall efficiencies of 68% would be more appropriate for building integration enabling its efficiency improvement and domestic applications.This project will develop a non-tracking concentrating photovoltaic/thermal (CPV/T) system with optimised performance, which will be suitable for building faade/roof integration. As no tracking is required it is possible the cost of this system to reduce by two-fold, which makes more attractive for building integration. This will be undertaken through a new three dimensional design of a compound elliptical-hyperboloid concentrator of concentration ratios of 6.25 through a set of computation simulations together with controlled and outdoor tests. This design will enhance the optical efficiency of the concentrator unit and hence improve the overall electrical and thermal efficiency of the concentrating PV/T system. A prototype system will be made and indoor controlled characterisation will be undertaken at the HWU. Based on the process refinement one kWp system will be manufactured to characterise at outdoors test conditions. In addition, an integrated Optical, Heat transfer and Electrical (OHE) model will examine the PV/T system to optimise its performance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G030820/1","grantId":"EP/G030820/1","fundValue":"178444","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  In this project a novel low concentrating photovoltaic system was developed, fabricated and tested for UK climatic condition to achieve triple benefit from the system: (i) generate electricity at the point of use, (ii) reduce overall &amp;quot;U&amp;quot; values of such systems and (iii) penetrating adequate lighting within the building envelope.

The focus of this research was to develop a solar concentrator which is compact, static, translucent and, at the same time, able to collect maximum solar energy. A novel geometry of a 3-D static concentrator has been designed and coined the Square Elliptical Hyperboloid (SEH) to be integrated in glazing windows or facades for photovoltaic application. The SEH concentrator is optically optimised for different incident angles of the incoming light. The optimised SEH concentrators are obtained by investigating their different non-dimensional parameters such as major axis over minor axis of the elliptical entry and the height over side of the exit aperture. Evaluating the best combination of the optical efficiency and the acceptance angle, results confirm that the 4x SEH built from dielectric material, working with total internal reflection, is found to have a constant optical efficiency of 40% for an acceptance angle equal to 120 degree (-60, +60 degree). This enables capture of the sun rays all day long from both direct beam light and diffuse light making it highly suitable for use in northern European countries. A higher optical efficiency of 70% is obtained for different dimensions of the SEH; however, the acceptance angle is only 50 degree. The optimised SEH concentrator has been manufactured and tested indoor and outdoor conditions at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh; the experimental results show an agreement with the simulation results thus validating the optical, electrical and thermal model. In addition, a heat exchanger was designed and integrated with the rear of SHE system to investigate combined photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) use. Series of incident solar radiation intensity and fluid flow conditions revealed that use of PV/T for SEH system enables to increase overall efficiency by reducing the solar cell operating temperatures. This research produced seven peer reviewed journal article (four in press and three are review ongoing), six conference article and one book chapter. We have developed an IP, generated a UK patent and a spin-out company called &amp;quot;Solar Concentrator Limited&amp;quot; is being developed for commercialisation of the technology.
