We believe that the proposed project will provide important insights into this problem and thus will assist in understanding the underlying neural pathologies. Furthermore, a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate cortical excitability will give us an insight into new approaches to the treatment of epilepsy. MCW frequently appears at public meetings organised by the National Society for Epilepsy and Epilepsy Action, and has helped the BBC establish an information resource on epilepsy (http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/epilepsy/).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400627","grantId":"G0400627","fundValue":"275361","fundStart":"2005-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dmitri  Rusakov","coPersons":["Matthew Charles Walker","Dimitri Michael Kullmann"],"organisation":"Institute of Neurology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
