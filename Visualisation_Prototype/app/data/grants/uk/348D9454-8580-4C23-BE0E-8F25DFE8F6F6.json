A Feasibility Study and Exploratory Trial","abstractText":"Rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the UK continue to rise each year. Reported infections with chlamydia, a bacterial infection which is often present without any symptoms and can lead to infertility and chronic pelvic pain, have increased by 139% since 1996. Successful control of STIs relies on reducing spread of infection in the community. One way of doing this is to cut down the length of time an individual carries the infection before seeking treatment. Partner notification (PN) aims to do this by informing the infected person?s sexual partners of the possibility of exposure, offering diagnosis and treatment, and providing advice about preventing future infection. However, the effectiveness of PN in controlling STIs, as currently practised in the UK, is doubtful and many sexual health (GUM) clinics struggle to reach national targets. \n\nWe do not know the best ways of carrying out PN. The current system relies on the infected person informing their partners and advising them to attend a sexual health clinic or their GP for testing and treatment. Many sexual contacts are reluctant to come forward and new methods need to be tested. In the USA ?Expedited partner therapy? (ExPT), strategies which reduce the time taken for sexual partners to be treated, are becoming increasingly established, but these have never been evaluated in the UK. A key part of these new methods is patient delivered therapy, in which the patient is given additional antibiotics to give to their partner(s). This means that their partners do not necessarily need to attend clinic. Some studies have already shown that UK patients would find this option highly acceptable.\n\nOur study will use patient, GUM clinic staff and community groups to develop two models of expedited partner therapy to test in two GUM clinics in the UK. We will obtain preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of ExPT as compared with routine partner notification practice and find out for whom ExPT is best suited. We will also determine costs associated with the ExPT strategies. If the approach we propose is successful, it could enhance provision of care to partners of individuals with STIs, particularly those less likely to access existing services, and thus reduce sexual health inequalities. The net result would be a decrease in STIs in the community and fewer re-infections. Together this would reduce complications of STIs, such as infertility and pelvic inflammatory disease and their costly health consequences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500100","grantId":"G0500100","fundValue":"315701","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Claudia  Estcourt","coPersons":["Nicola Minling Low","Lynn  Myers","Paddy  Horner","Tracy  Roberts","Jacqueline Anne Cassell","Catherine  Mercer","John Chisholm Imrie","Eva  Jungmann","Anne Mandall Johnson","Gary  Brook"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
