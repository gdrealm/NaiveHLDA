One way to address this challenge is to construct subsurface geological repositories in which this waste can be stored over long-term (&gt;millennia) timescales. In this network proposal (GeoRepNet), we intend to develop a three-year collaborative network to investigate and prioritise the major challenges involved in the design, construction and maintenance of geological repositories. \n\nThe network is comprised six workpackages that will address the geophysical, geochemical and biological challenges of establishing and operating geological repositories and investigate methods of monitoring geological repositories. The technical focus of the network, addressed by a dedicated workpackage, will examine the cross-transfer of technology from the space and astronomical communities into geological repository monitoring, for example miniaturised in-situ instruments designed for planetary exploration and spectroscopic methods of monitoring repository atmospheres to detect leakage of wastes. \n\nThe network will implement its objectives using three major meetings (one in each of the network years) and a series of satellite workshops. Important in the network's objectives will be developing the next generation of scientists involved in the establishment of geological repositories and one meeting will be dedicated to this objective. The network will make use of a web site and social networking technologies to implement its objectives. The network is primarily a UK network, but it will draw in international collaboration to achieve its objectives and maximise the expertise available for the achievement of its objectives.\n\nOur overall aim is to create a step change in the identification, prioritisation and provision of solutions, to establishing and maintaining geological repositories.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K001736/1","grantId":"ST/K001736/1","fundValue":"243775","fundStart":"2012-10-19","fundEnd":"2016-04-18","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Charles Seaton Cockell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
