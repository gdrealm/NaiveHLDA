The second phase will engage groups of bereavement and substance misuse professionals, practitioners and service users in developing, testing and validating new practice guidelines. These guidelines will inform and assist support servicesâ€™ staff in more adequately addressing the needs of this group of bereaved people.<br /><br />The research is being led by researchers in the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath who have experience in conducting research on bereavement. Other members of the research team are based at the University of Stirling and have experience in addiction studies. A bereaved family member will also be part of the research team. The study aims to make a significant contribution to the bereavement and substance misuse literature, raise awareness of issues faced by those suffering this type of loss and inform evidence-based practice guidelines.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J007366/1","grantId":"ES/J007366/1","fundValue":"378243","fundStart":"2012-09-10","fundEnd":"2015-09-09","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tony  Walter","coPersons":["Linda  Bauld"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
