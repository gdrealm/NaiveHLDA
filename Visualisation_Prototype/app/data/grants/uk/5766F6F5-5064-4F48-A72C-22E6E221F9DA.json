Positrons are the antimatter counterpart to electrons with which they annihilate releasing gamma-rays. In addition to their importance in our fundamental understanding of nature, studies of their interactions with ordinary everyday matter allow us, for example, to investigate crystal structures and to obtain functional images of human organs using the medical technique of positron emission tomography (PET). In many collisions of positrons with matter, positronium (Ps) is formed.\n\nPositronium is a composite made of a positron and electron, analogous to the hydrogen atom with the positron replacing the proton. So often is Ps formed, that e.g. 80% of gamma-rays detected in PET, and 95% of all gamma-rays released from the galactic centre of the Milky Way are the result of Ps decay. Once formed, it has ample time to interact with matter before annihilating because its lifetime, although of the order of nanoseconds, is still millions of times longer than typical scattering times. For these reasons, knowledge of how Ps itself interacts with matter is important not only for collision physics but also, for example, so that we may improve radioprotection in PET, or learn about the environment in which positrons annihilate in outer space. \n\nSince both experimental and theoretical studies with Ps projectiles are difficult, corresponding data are scarce or non-existent. Recently, however, we have discovered that positronium scatters from a wide variety of atomic and molecular targets in a similar manner to that of a bare electron at a given projectile velocity. This is not what was expected! And, whilst the reason is unclear, its ramifications at a fundamental and practical level might be far reaching. It looks like the positron in Ps is heavily screened (or &quot;cloaked&quot;) from the target by its partner electron and we wish to understand why. In the process, through the proposed research, we shall charter the outcome of such collisions and glimpse into the formation of Ps resonances and possibly Ps compounds. From a practical viewpoint, the outcome of the project may feed directly into models of how Ps interacts with matter, encompassing interstellar clouds and the human body.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J003980/1","grantId":"EP/J003980/1","fundValue":"468305","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Results are being used by other academics as evidenced by citations in the literature.

The efficiency from Xe, whilst lower at low energies, becomes comparable to that from H2 at around 100â€“120 eV; at ~250 eV, it is an order of magnitude lower. In the long term, positron/Ps scattering may also impact upon the risk assessment associated with medical diagnostics and therapeutic protocols of positron-emission-tomography, material characterization (primarily through annihilation,positronium formation and scattering). The public/industrial sector will also benefit through knowledge transfer as well as the training of talented young scientists in performing world-class science and in developing a variety of skills (e.g. problem-solving, creativity, communication, etc). The immediate beneficiaries of the research will be other scientists studying positron and positronium physics, atomic and molecular physics, astrophysics. The theme of the research is interdisciplinary, with relevance in chemistry, environmental studies, plasma physics. Chemicals,Environment,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
