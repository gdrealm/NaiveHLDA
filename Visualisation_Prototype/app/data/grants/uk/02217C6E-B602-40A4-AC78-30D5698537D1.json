The aim of this project is to undertake research to underpin the development of new oilseed rape varieties with increased resistance to insect herbivory. Exposure of plants to UV-B wavelengths, which are a natural component of sunlight, has been shown to reduce the attractiveness of plants to insect herbivores by altering plant chemical composition. Several plant responses to UV-B are mediated by a protein called UVR8 and the defence response to herbivory involves the regulatory molecule jasmonic acid. In this project, we will examine the potential of UVR8 and a protein called MYC2 that mediates the response to jasmonic acid to increase resistance to insect herbivory in oilseed rape. We will test whether transgenic over-expression of specific genes increases resistance to insect herbivory as 'proof of concept' that manipulation of the UV-B response could be used to develop new varieties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I017542/1","grantId":"BB/I017542/1","fundValue":"100890","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  It is too early to demonstrate significant impact that this stage of the research.

The original demonstration that UV-B wavelengths induce defence responses was shown by our collaborators in the model plant species, Arabidopsis. We combined this knowledge with our expertise in brassicas to test whether similar responses occur in this closely related crop genus. In addition, we have made transgenic brassicas expressing the UV-B receptor, UVR8, to test the proof of principle that this gene is capable of functioning in this crop species. The main focus of the work is on induction of defence against invertebrate pest including slugs, aphids and diamondback moth which all affect commercial brassicas. This work is being done by the Glasgow team, using facilities at the JIC and will be reported by them separately. Our contribution to the project has been in the production of transgenic brassicas, and in the UV-B induction of defence against pathogens\nWe have completed the production of the transgenic brassicas, and identified stably-expressing lines (first objective). These have been provided to Glasgow for their invertebrate experiments. We found that UV-B does induce disease resistance in brassicas, though its effect depends on the pathogen species (second objective). We found consistent induction of defence against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, but no effect against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. This work demonstrates the potential for improved disease control using UV-B responsive genes which could be used in combination with other resistance genes. This is a novel area of research that has the potential for improving pest and disease resistance in brassica crops. It is too early to demonstrate significant impact that this stage of the research. However, using a small number of pest and pathogens, our work has demonstrated that UV-B responses do occur in commercial brassicas. The next step forward would be to test the responses in different brassica cultivars as the basis for variety improvement through breeding. The work has generated interest from industry, and could be developed in partnership with breeding companies. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
