{"id":"FEEFA3F0-17CD-4192-A747-FAB275EAA183","title":"EViDAnCE - Exploring Value in Digital Archives and the Comainn Eachdraidh","abstractText":"Rural areas have strong place identities, formed through the reproduction of traditional cultural practices alongside contemporary influences. These identities are performed and constructed through a repertoire of knowledges, histories, and customs, and include modes of expression such as story-telling, music and song, poetry and literature, dance and drama. Together with material objects, artefacts, sites and cultural spaces, these form dynamic cultural heritages. Both tangible and intangible heritage activity takes place in remote rural areas. Community based initiatives play an important role in such areas in the collation, production and communication of local cultural heritage. The Outer Hebrides contains 14 of Scotland's 28 Comainn Eachdraidh (CE) or historical societies which began in the 1970's with a very specific political and cultural purpose. Within their recent history, there has been a specific turn towards the digitisation of such work but to-date the relationship between the production of lived and virtual heritage is little understood and valued. \n\nCommunity digital archives represent both a major economic asset and a key community resource, having potential as education tools, for empowerment through co-production of local knowledge, to encourage community engagement in local history, and for recreation and tourism consumption purposes. Yet, the conversion to digital archives is not a neutral process. The interrelationship between volunteers, professionals and digital applications needs further interrogation to understand the fluid practices involved. By comprehending these networks of cultural heritage production the value of such digitisation initiatives will be understood in terms of how they assist or problematize community development and cohesion, cultural preservations, individual identity, wellbeing and finally how they contribute economic value to communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L006006/1","grantId":"AH/L006006/1","fundValue":"33176","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  My findings have been used in a number of ways by the main project partner (Hebridean Connections).

They have been used to create future funding bids. \n\nFor the other project partners (the historical societies) a number of similar impacts have been identified but they have also talked about an increased sense of confidence with regards to the activities they undertake. The project also highlighted to them the importance that digital technologies can have in terms of disseminating their heritage.

It shows how grass-roots community activity surrounding history, heritage and culture can have a resounding impact upon the communities involved, energising them into a variety of different actions. It also highlights how these activities have been finding new expressions through digital technologies, including digital archives and social media, from which different notions of cultural value are being shaped. The following report should be read as a series of vignettes that speaks to the concept of cultural value in different ways. A central proposal from the project is to comprehend cultural value as a flexible and differentiated concept that can mean a number of different things in different spaces and places. This reflects the ethnographic methodology which has been employed to understand the complex ways in which communities in the Outer Hebrides derive benefit from cultural activity and participation. At its core, the report highlights how the production of community heritage in the Outer Hebrides creates cultural value for communities in a variety of different ways: from helping develop connections between land, people and place that are central to the on-going development, the 'liveliness' of Gaelic culture, and the benefits sought in building connections and dialogues between people both out with the immediate community and in the extended diaspora. The project has helped to evidence the ways in which cultural activity surrounding the collection and dissemination of archives brings value to communities. The findings will therefore be used by the project partner to help report to their own funders as well as to build confidence and evidence for their own future funding activities.
