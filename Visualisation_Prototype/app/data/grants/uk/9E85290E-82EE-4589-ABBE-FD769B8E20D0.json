Until now there has not been good enough data to study the issues and therefore inform government policy on health, pensions or retirement, for example. \n\nKey questions that this study will be designed to answer are:\n\nWhat is the relationship between health and wealth?\nWhat determines the nature and timing of retirement?\nHow important are household and family structures to health, wealth and quality of life?\nHow adequate are financial provisions for retirement, and how can policy help?\nHow should the government optimise the use and quality of health and social care services?\nWhat is the nature and structure of social networks, support and participation for older people?\n\n8500 people throughout Northern Ireland have been randomly selected to become members of this study. Study members and their partners will be interviewed in a Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) every two years in order to build up a detailed picture of how circumstances change in later life.\n\nThe NICOLA study consists of the following 3 stages: an interview, a questionnaire and a health assessment. \nIn this first stage, a 90 minute Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) is conducted in the participants own home at a time that suits them. \nIPSOS Mori, a leading research company, have been commissioned to carry out these home interviews.\nThe interviewers collect information on living arrangements, children, education, income and assets, physical and mental health, employment, lifelong learning, planning for retirement, care and social support. They record this information using a computer. \nQuestions will be asked about health, diet, work, family and social networks, income and benefit receipts, quality of life, cognitive functioning, daily activities, housing, retirement and pensions. The affect of 'the troubles' on the lives of people will also be explored.\n\nNICOLA study members further invited to take part in a home interview every two years and a health assessment every four years. \nAll participants will be provided with detailed information sheets prior to the home interview and health assessment and will have the opportunity to contact the study team directly to ask any questions they may have.\n\nInformation gathered during this study will be used to inform and plan Northern Ireland Health and Social Care provision in the future, and to design other policies targeted towards older people. \nAcademic researchers will also use the data to help understand important questions in health, economics and ageing. Their results will then be used to advise policy makers on how best to design policies for health and pensions and to compare the Northern Ireland population to similar populations in other countries\n\nEverything captured in the interview is treated in strict confidence. The results will not be used in any way in which they can be associated with participants or their addresses.\nAll information you give will be treated in the strictest confidence and used for research purposes only.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L008459/1","grantId":"ES/L008459/1","fundValue":"2693870","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Kee","coPersons":["Lindsay  Prior","Declan  French","WILLIAM GEORGE HUTCHINSON","Anne  Kouvonen","Michael  Tomlinson","Dermot  O'Reilly","Michael  Donnelly","Ian  Young"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
