{"id":"9AD3DE57-DCCC-413E-9688-44A36239EA11","title":"Euclid Phase-A additional programme - increasing the impact for UK Science and Industry","abstractText":"The programme has four elements: 1. Lead role in the Euclid Visible Instrument Development The Euclid scientific payload consists of two instruments, the Visible Imager (VIS) and the Near Infrared Spectrometer. These instruments are being developed by two instrument groupings, under a common Euclid consortium umbrella. UCL-MSSL is assigned as the lead group on VIS and is also providing the CCD readout electronics. Because of changes to the Euclid management since the Euclid Definition Phase proposal in early 2010, there have been increased demands on UCL-MSSL system management. We propose additional support to reinforce the UK lead on the VIS instrument. We also propose support of a study of the power supply for the CCD readout electronics. This is key to performance of the CCD camera, but could not be afforded within the current resources. 2. Preparing for a UK lead in the Euclid Attitude Control System UK has a leading science role for Euclid, but is not currently in a leading position industrially because Euclid (and Plato) has greatest similarity to the Herschel spacecraft design; in the implementation of which UK had only minor industrial roles and hence has poor heritage. Astrium Ltd strategy for Euclid is to target prime roles on major sub-systems of the Euclid Service Module - the best targets are the attitude and orbit control system (including fine guidance sensor) and the main propulsion system (Hydrazine mono-propellant). These subsystems have a direct influence on the fine pointing accuracy, stability and settling time of the Euclid telescope and consequently the science performance of the VIS instrument. It is proposed that Astrium Ltd will work with UCL-MSSL to study selected aspects of the interaction between the Euclid service module sub-systems and the VIS instrument performance. 3. Maximising the UK Science Influence in Euclid, and Weak Lensing in particular As recommended by the recent UKSA review, a dedicated Euclid pipeline to generate and analyze end-to-end image-level products for use in setting requirements and the ground segment development is now essential to secure Euclid selection later this year. In order to produce the number of simulations required for accurate testing of our methods during the definition phase, we require a dedicated UK-Science Ground System machine that can be used in the continuous production, processing and analysis of images. The results of this work will cement the UK's role in Weak Lensing on Euclid, obtained under pressure from other Euclid nations. The UK also has the target of securing UK leadership of the design, coding and operations of the Euclid Mission Archive (EMA). The EMA is core to the Euclid data analysis and would be a major coup for the UK. We propose a study of this concept, supporting a bid for the role within the Euclid Consortium later this year. 4. Supporting the UK e2v CCDs on Euclid e2v is developing the CCDs for Euclid but proper testing of the prototype devices will be needed before the Euclid performance is assured. We propose the improvement of existing facilities which will be used for the tests of the e2v devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J000191/1","grantId":"ST/J000191/1","fundValue":"150012","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Scott Cropper","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
