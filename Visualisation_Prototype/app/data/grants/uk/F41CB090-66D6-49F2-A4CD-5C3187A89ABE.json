In order to explore these challenges the seminar will be structured around six themes over 18 months, each taking the shape of a day long workshop. The key themes identified by the applicants relate to contemporary practical and theoretical issues arising from relief work. </p>\n\n<p>The workshops will be structured around key concepts and categories such as Conflict, Intervention&nbsp;and the Politics of knowledge, Darfur: Assessing the Assessments; Emergency in Haiti: Where Medics, Missionaries&nbsp;and Militaries Collide; Assessing humanitarianism: disaster&nbsp;and data dissemination; Who are the humanitarians now? </p>\n\n<p>These workshops are open to the public and bring together academics, practitioners, lay public and people from the areas concerned. The records (including film footage and presentations) of these events can be found on&nbsp;the&nbsp;HCRI website.&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0708","grantId":"RES-451-26-0708","fundValue":"18126","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This research and NHGO engagement seminar has been productive.

The NGOs involved were: MSF, British Red Cross, MAG, and Handicap International in particular. The research project established common ground for further research and brought about new collaborations. This collaboration was primarily an initial exchange of ideas between practitioners and academics. It has enabled joint research projects to emerge and collaborative networks to become established and active. This is undoubtedly part of a wider change in the humanitarian sector which brings together researchers and practitioners. This was primarily a seminar series with limited aims, It nevertheless generated some research outputs but it also led directly to collaborations and further research meetings: namely a Memorandum of Understanding with the Federation of the Red Cross, a strong collaboration and joint bid with the HPG of the Overseas Development Institute, further collaboration with MSF (France and International). It also served a seed for a major conference, Humanitarianism,, past, present, future held in October 2012 and an AHRC network led by colleagues in Birmingham.
