Its aim is to bring together research-intensive Schools to provide advanced research training to the region's doctoral students and early career researchers in a way that combines an efficient use of resources and leading-edge practice. By pooling expertise from across the 14 universities, researchers are able to benefit from world-class training irrespective of their institutional home. Specifically, NARTI:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>organises and facilitates travel to advanced training events in methods and/or subject areas that give focussed and in depth attention to current and emerging trends</li>\n\n <li>runs an annual, two day colloquium for doctoral students focused on advanced training</li>\n\n <li>provides an arena for these people to network and share research interests, contacts and advice through a dedicated website hosted by Leeds University Business School </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The intent is to bring about collaboration between faculty and research students, building tight knit research communities focussed on a specific approach or set of concerns, and bringing about a step change in the quality, vision and expectation of the training being offered that would not be viable for a single institution to deliver.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-046-25-0005","grantId":"RES-046-25-0005","fundValue":"80883","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin  Holt","coPersons":["Timothy  Clark","Thomas Frederick Burgess"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
