All too often children have to endure chronic lack of physical and emotional care over long periods of time before they receive help. And all too often that help is too little, too late. Key to effective help for children is that their plight is spotted early and that something is done quickly to help them. Action on Neglect aims to ensure that practitioners such as teachers, nurses and social workers are supported to provide the best possible response to children who are experiencing neglect.<br /><br />As a follow-up to the study 'Noticing and Helping the Neglected Child'&nbsp; Action on Neglect will bring together groups of practitioners and managers from all key professions, in three areas of England, to develop suggestions for more effective responses to neglected children. A pack will be produced that will set out details of feasible and cost-effective blueprints for improved routes to services for neglected children and their families.</p>\n\n<p>The project will be supported by two advisory groups - one involving parents who have received help with their parenting and one involving young people who have received support as a result of neglect.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J010790/1","grantId":"ES/J010790/1","fundValue":"88493","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Brigid  Daniel","coPersons":["Julie  Taylor"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
