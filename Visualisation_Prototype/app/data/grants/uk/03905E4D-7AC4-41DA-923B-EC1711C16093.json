Furthermore, it focuses on the trade union’s role in the mediation of conflicting interests between national and migrant workers.</p>\n\n<p>The research develops a comparative international perspective by looking at a national context particularly affected by recent intra-European immigration (UK) and expanding on a comparative study on Italy and the Netherlands previously carried out by the researcher. The aim of the comparison is to highlight differences between these countries and to point out variables and mechanisms responsible for the different outcomes. The analysis addresses three main aspects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>factors influencing union stances towards labour immigration, immigration policies and migrant workers</li>\n\n <li>effects of union attitudes</li>\n\n <li>the development of trade union interaction with migrant workers across time. The proposed methodology combines qualitative and quantitative methods to assess union formal debates, union actions and union outcomes in including migrant workers.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001752/1","grantId":"ES/K001752/1","fundValue":"161869","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stefania  Marino","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
