{"id":"F70C32D8-F967-4C0D-8BFA-5350626BE410","title":"Catalytic Science in the Harwell Research Centre","abstractText":"Catalysis is a core area of science that lies at the heart of the chemicals industry - an immensely successful and important part of the overall UK economy, where in recent years the UK output has totalled over 50B and is ranked 7th in the world. This position is being maintained in the face of immense competition worldwide. For the UK to maintain its leading position it is essential that innovation in research is maintained, which can be achieved through bringing together the internationally leading academic activity that exists in the UK in this key area of contemporary science. We therefore, aim to create a Centre for Catalysis at the central facilities which will help to keep the UK at the forefront of this crucial scientific and technological sector. The Centre will be established in the Research Complex at Harwell which will allow us both to work closely with the central facilities, to whose development the project will also contribute, and to interact with and contribute to the broader scientific community on the Harwell/RAL Campus The major developments in the in situ characterisation of catalytic materials that have taken place in the recent years have been of immense importance in addressing the complex scientific problems posed by catalytic science The Centre will therefore in pursuing a wide ranging programme of research in catalytic science, develop state-of-the art in situ facilities that will be used for experiments to be conducted at the Diamond, Synchrotron Radiation, ISIS Neutron Scattering and Central Laser Facilities. Such experiments will allow us to probe the structure and evolution of catalysts at the molecular level during their operation; but their effectiveness will require the on-line studies to be integrated with off line experimentation in the Complex, within which we will establish a broad range of experimental facilities. An extensive programme of applications will be undertaken, with strong emphasis on the following central themes in contemporary catalytic science:* Sustainable Catalyst Technologies for Organic Transformations* Catalysis for alternative fuels* Catalysis in the Protection of the EnvironmentBy coordinating the expertise of the collaborative groups, in novel areas of catalytic science enabled by the facilities on the Harwell/RAL campus, we will provide a platform for new initiatives that will provide a hub for UK catalysis research and will give substantial added value to the existing investment in catalytic science. Moreover by working together, the UK scientific team will be able take centre stage and lead the world in this crucial field.The impact of the Centre will be further promoted by a vigorous and effective dissemination strategy which will develop strong interactions with a wide range of academic and industrial groups and with the broader scientific community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I019693/1","grantId":"EP/I019693/1","fundValue":"1645060","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Centre has developed a strong, coherent and rapidly expanding scientific programme, The main current themes include:\no Synthesis, Characterisation and Catalytic Applications of nanocatalysts.We have established an active programme at RCaH in the development of oxide supported nanoparticle systems. The synthesis of nanoparticles is based on different novel preparation methods including (i) colloidal methods, (ii) decomposition of preformed organometallics, (iii) chemical vapour deposition and (iv) ion beam sputtering and nanolithography. This allows us to tune the structural characteristics of the nanoparticles and ultimately their catalytic performance\no Hydrocarbon Dynamics in Microporous Catalysts \nUnderstanding the dynamics of sorbed hydrocarbons in microporous materials is a fundamental challenge in catalytic science. We are currently focussing on the diffusion and rotational dynamics of straight chain and branched alkanes in the industrially important zeolites ZSM-5 and Y. They are being investigated by a powerful combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) to obtain critical information on a rate limiting step of commercial processes such as acid-catalyzed conversions of simple hydrocarbons to alcohols, olefins and aromatics. \no Catalytic Processes on Multi-Component Oxides \nThe application of multi-component oxide materials in catalysis has numerous industrial applications; the use of iron molybdate in the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde is one example of this. However, these multi-component oxides have complex structures and it can be hard to unravel the exact nature of the active phase. Work within the catalysis team at RCaH has developed an approach to limit the growth of multi-component oxide phases to the initial surface layers of the catalyst. These systems allow us to probe changes in surface characteristics (XAFS, IR, Raman) and relate these difference in structural properties to the catalytic activity. \no The Use of XAFS for Structural Characterisation of Catalytic Materials. XAFS is a well-established technique for the characterisation of heterogeneous, homogeneous and electro- catalysts. It plays a crucial role in elucidating the local structure of materials without any long range order, understanding the environment of isolated metal sites in framework architectures, and unravelling catalytic processes in situ under realistic conditions. However, considering the range and depth of UK catalytic science, the number of experienced researchers in this field remains relatively low. One of the guiding principles of the programme mode access to B18, alongside the necessity for high impact science, is the need to support and encourage inexperienced users. Through the careful coordination of beamtime, we have been able to study a wide range of catalytic materials and introduce new users to the field.

By October 2013, it will have 20 full time staff (research fellows, research assistants and PhD students). It is already producing outputs in key areas of catalytic science including photocatalysis, microporous and oxide catalytic processes. The development of the Catalysis Centre at Harwell has provided strong scientifi foundations that are being further developed in part by the UK Catalysis Hub, the Facilities developed (and being developed on this project are accessed by a winde arange of researchers, students and academics in the field of catalysis.
