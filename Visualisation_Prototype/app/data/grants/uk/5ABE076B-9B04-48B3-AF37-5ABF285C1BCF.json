Around 1 billion people, predominantly in the developing world, harbour parasitic nematodes that cause chronic and debilitating diseases.

Methods to control nematodes are relatively limited, and drug resistance is becoming common. All nematodes share a common lifecycle growing from an egg through 4 immature larval stages before reaching the sexually mature adult stage. Progression from egg to larvae involves a hatching process, and from individual larval stages to adulthood involves a repeated process termed moulting, where the external skeleton is shed and a new one synthesised. The moulting process allows growth. The astacin enzymes are catalysts that are involved in the processes of hatching, skeleton synthesis and moulting. The specific roles played by this class of enzymes have been confirmed in a model experimental system and will now be examined and characterized in an important veterinary parasite.

Around 1 billion people, predominantly in the developing world, harbour parasitic nematodes that cause chronic and debilitating diseases.

All nematodes share a common lifecycle growing from an egg through 4 immature larval stages before reaching the sexually mature adult stage. Progression from egg to larvae involves a hatching process, and from individual larval stages to adulthood involves a repeated process termed moulting, where the external skeleton is shed and a new one synthesised. The moulting process allows growth and development.\nThe astacin enzymes are catalysts that are involved in the processes of hatching, exoskeleton synthesis and moulting. The specific roles played by this class of enzymes were originally established in a model experimental system (Caenorhabditis elegans) and have now been validated in an important veterinary parasite. The nematode Haemonchus contortus is a common and economically significant gastrointestinal parasite of sheep and goats. The results generated in the H. contortus and C. elegans systems are also relevant to other parasites of animals and plants, and this has now been established for the human infective filarial nematode Brugia malayi. The project aims were to identify, study and exploit these enzymes with the overall goal of identifying vaccine and drug targets to treat and control nematode infections.\nIn this study we have successfully identified and characterized the key enzymes that are involved in the synthesis and remodelling of the exoskeleton of both Haemonchus contortus and Brugia malayi. We have proven that they play nematode-specific roles, key criteria for the development of a potential drug or vaccine. In addition, we have developed a range of experimental tools that will be invaluable in future targeted drug development; these include a nematode transgenic complementation system, a recombinant protein expression system and specific protease and collagenase assays.\nIn this project we have successfully developed a nematode complementation system, whereby existing C. elegans cuticle and moulting mutants can be rescued via transgenesis with parasitic nematode genes. This has been done for Haemonchus contortus genes, and for the first time with Brugia malayi genes. This had led to the development of numerous transgenic C. elegans lines that express H. contortus and B. malayi astacins, peroxidase and protease inhibitor genes. This resource will be invaluable in future targeted drug development studies.\n\nWe have also developed a novel autoinduction protocol for the expression of H. contortus and B. malayi recombinant proteins in a functionally active form. This information will be of interest to other groups working in this field.\n\nWe have also developed a nematode cuticle collagen-processing assay that will be used to screen for collagen processing enzymes and their inhibitors. Again, this will be a useful resource for future targeted drug development.
