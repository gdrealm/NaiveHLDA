Diabetics are at high risk of heart disease because the way they make energy from foods, such as fats and sugars, is faulty. Understanding these faults is important to find new ways to treat people with diabetes.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a method which can see inside living things and can help us to see how we change the food we eat into energy. The big problem with MRI is that the amount of signal we can see can be very small. In 2003, a new method of imaging which gives more signal in MRI was invented. This new method provides greater than 10,000 times more signal for a short period of time. This method is a tool which can help us answer our questions about why some people make energy from food in a faulty way.\nOur aim is to develop this new method to help us understand how normal hearts work and what goes wrong in diabetic hearts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601490","grantId":"G0601490","fundValue":"360980","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Damian John Tyler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
