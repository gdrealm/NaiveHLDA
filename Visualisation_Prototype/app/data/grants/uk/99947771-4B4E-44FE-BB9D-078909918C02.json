These advantages however are not equally experienced by all members of the population, moreover the distribution is often not socially justified, as the groups that benefit from the higher density and better connections are not the same who experience the burdens such as congestion and poor air quality. This is a globally recurring issue, despite considerable differences between urban areas worldwide in terms of economic context, spatial planning and infrastructure provision. This research, within the call's theme of social justice and the policy domain of infrastructure and built environment, will investigate physical and socio-economic processes that underlie the uneven distribution of urban outcomes. An international comparison of metropolitan areas in the UK, Netherlands and Brazil will take place to both identify universal drivers towards unjust outcomes and specific circumstances that can reduce or enhance existing social differences. In particular, the project will investigate the specific urban planning strategy of transit-oriented development (TOD) and its potential for delivering more equitable outcomes. This will be achieved through an international survey into job accessibility, population preferences and affordability in relation to transport and housing options; a dedicated measuring campaign targeting in-vehicle exposure to transport pollutants and advanced statistical and geographical information analysis. There are currently ambitious plans for TOD in S&atilde;o Paulo and the project will engage with stakeholders to target actual issues and allow the research to have a direct impact on social justice in S&atilde;o Paulo.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N011481/1","grantId":"ES/N011481/1","fundValue":"230311","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alex Hidde Hagen-Zanker","coPersons":["Prashant  Kumar"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
