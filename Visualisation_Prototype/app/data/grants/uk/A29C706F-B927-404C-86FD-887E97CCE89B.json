Each year and between March 15th and 21st in 2004 we host Brain Awareness Week, as part of the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives. \n We also believe it to be very important that MS patients, through their local groups, are kept fully apprised of the research that is conducted in their name. Hence, I regularly address local MS groups in order to inform them of progress, not only in our own work, but in MS-related research in general. My participation in the Scottish MS Network ensures that dialogue with other MS professionals is maintained. We also present our work at the annual research meeting of the UK MS Society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0301172","grantId":"G0301172","fundValue":"682211","fundStart":"2005-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter James Brophy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
