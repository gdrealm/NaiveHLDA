Treatment for TB relies on drugs developed some 40 years ago. Unfortunately these drugs are not very good as they require long treatment regimes (6-9 months) and often they do not work due to the ability of the TB bug to develop resistance. Using a novel strategy we propose to develop a new drug that will be able to kill all of the TB bugs quickly including the resistant ones. To develop this drug we have partnered up with industry (GSK pharmaceuticals) and will use industry-like development and management methods. If we succeed in this 2 year project, we are confident that we can secure future funding from the TB Alliance so that we can eventually register our new drug within the next five or six years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002586","grantId":"G1002586","fundValue":"1022080","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Giancarlo Augusto Biagini","coPersons":["Paul  O'Neill","Neil  Berry","Nick  Cammack","Stephen  Ward"],"organisation":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
