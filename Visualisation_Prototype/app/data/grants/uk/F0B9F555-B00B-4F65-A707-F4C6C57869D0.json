Understanding the detailed properties of materials has therefore never been more important. The development of high quality computer simulation techniques has played an increasing significant role in this endeavour over recent years. The UK has been at the forefront of this new wave, and the UKCP consortium has played an important part, in both developing computer codes and algorithms, and exploiting these new advances to increase our understanding of many industrially relevant materials and processes.\n\nThe preferred mechanism for providing computational resources on HECToR is via HPC Consortia, and UKCP is onesuch, containing 19 different nodes. Each node is a different University Department and is represented by one key academic - see the &quot;Linked Proposals&quot; or the Track Record for a complete list of current members of UKCP. This proposal seeks computational support for a large body of research (see &quot;Other Support&quot;) with a substantial allocation of HECToR resources and also the support of a named PDRA. The PDRA will assist with training and supporting different members of the consortium in using the principle codes used within the consortium (e.g. CASTEP), and also develop some of the new code features required to complete some of these projects.\n\nThe research described in this proposal will make significant impacts on many areas of future technology, such as the development of improved materials for battery electrodes, solar cells and hydrogen-storage materials, each of which will help the move towards zero-pollution cars in the future. Some very applied parts of the proposal will study superalloys for use in engine turbine blades, or the properties of glasses used for storing nuclear waste materials. Other parts of the proposal will study the structure of materials with high accuracy, including subtle effects like dispersion forces and quantum nuclear effects, which may lead to better materials in the future. Other projects focus on a better understanding of existing materials, such as the interaction of proteins and DNA, or the operation of ligand-gated ion channels in cells.\n\nAs part of this proposal, the researchers will have to develop new algorithms and theoretical improvements that will increase our simulation abilities, either by increasing the accuracy and reliability of calculations, or by enabling us to simulate bigger systems for longer. These will enable the next generation of simulations and further widen our computational horizons.\n\nThe research proposed does not easily fit into any of the traditional categories of 'physics' or 'chemistry' etc. Instead, the UKCP is a multi-disciplinary consortium using a common theoretical foundation to advance many different areas of materials-based science which has the potential for significant impact both in the short and long-term.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K013459/1","grantId":"EP/K013459/1","fundValue":"18068","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jorge  Kohanoff","coPersons":["Peijun  Hu"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" The goal of this grant is to provide computer time in the ARCHER national facility, through the UKCP consortium. The nature of the research carried out is quite varied, but always under the heading of computer modelling at the atomic scale. Simulations have or are being conducted in the following areas: optical properties of 2-D materials, irradiation of materials and biological matter, mechanochemical reactions, and porous liquids. Below are described the main achievements to the date.\n\n1) Real-time simulations of laser-matter interaction to obtain nonlinear optical properties (e.g. second and third harmonic generation -- SHG/THG) of novel 2-dimensional materials. Research confirmed the experimental finding that 2D transition metal dichalcogenides have very strong SHG (e.g. Scientific reports 4, 5530 (2014)), 2-3 order of magnitude larger than common nonlinear crystals. Note that the experimental determination of SHG of 2D material is non-trivial as several assumptions need to be made to deduce the absolute SHG from the measured SHG relative to the dielectric substrate.\n\n2) It was shown that the dissociative electron attachment cross section of biomolecules (DNA components), i.e. the probability that they will break by capturing an electron, increases significantly (a factor &amp;amp;amp;gt;6) when they are in an aqueous environment, as it happens in vivo. We have also shown that there are a range of protection mechanisms against DNA damage. The aqueous environment helps to reunite the fragments after a break. Also, protonation and the surrounding proteins make more difficult breaking bonds.\n\n3) We continued, from a previous grant, the study of the irradiation of amorphous solid water by Carbon ions, in an attempt to understand the dynamics of the formation of organic molecules in the cosmic environment. In this case, we have shown the formation of relatively complex species like HC(OH)_2 that require the intervention of two water molecules, what is not possible in the gast phase and requires the icy environment. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms of DNA radiation damage is particularly relevant within the context of radiotherapies, and also in the assessment of dangers posed by radiation to living creatures. For example, harnessing the full potential of various types of radiation with minimal collateral damage requires a molecular-level understanding, which depends on the particular source of radiation. The same methodology can be used to study any situation in which excess electrons are generated by irradiation.\n\nThe methods developed for non-linear optical properties of materials are still under development. In the future it will be released as functionality in the code Open-license (GPL) code YAMBO (http://www.yambo-code.org/), thus reaching a significant community of researchers, particularly through the European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (http://www.etsf.eu/).
