Yet contemporary western societies now collectively spend over ninety percent of their time indoors. It is with this contradiction in mind that it is worth reconsidering how easily personal wellbeing and environmental experiences are able to combine within the actual lifestyles of different groups today.</p>\n\n<p>This project pursues this argument through a case study of the social context associated with a sample of professional office workers in London as representatives of one of the fastest growing types of occupation in this country. Building on theories of practice, it will analyse the everyday pressures associated with a sample of these workers, consider the social expectations they cope with and document how they handle the changing outdoor conditions presented by one calendar year. Through these means it will develop an innovative new technique for investigating urban nature experience, examine how routine outdoor practices are established, maintained and potentially redirected, and use the institutionalised behaviours of an important, under-researched and rapidly growing group of workers to inform debate about how to foster more sustainable city futures.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2129","grantId":"RES-000-22-2129","fundValue":"26617","fundStart":"2007-02-08","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Russell  Hitchings","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
