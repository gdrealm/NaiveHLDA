However, copy number variation, where different individuals have different numbers of the same gene, is more common than previously thought. This variation between people affects susceptibility to common diseases such as psoriasis. In this project, we will investigate copy number variation of three genes that are part of the body?s defence against bacteria and viruses. We will test if people with tuberculosis or AIDS have different numbers of these genes compared to healthy people. This will give clues on the importance of these genes involved in infection. It could also potentially identify drug targets for future work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801123","grantId":"G0801123","fundValue":"315826","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  Hollox","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
