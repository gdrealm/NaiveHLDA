Current lifestyles encourage large amounts of sitting (sedentary behaviour) through increasing car use, computers, and appealing screen-based home entertainment systems. Methods to help change such behaviours are now needed, particularly for those with a high risk of developing a chronic disease, such as diabetes. We propose to decrease sedentary behaviour in a multi-ethnic group of young adults at risk of diabetes through an educational intervention (attending a workshop and having prompts). If successful, this could have significant public health benefits given the widespread nature of sedentary behaviour.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802131","grantId":"G0802131","fundValue":"448703","fundStart":"2010-04-26","fundEnd":"2013-04-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart JH Biddle","coPersons":["Kamlesh  Khunti","Myra  Nimmo","Thomas  Yates","Trish  Gorely","Melanie  Davies"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
