Diamond has emerged in recent years as a functional wide-gap semiconducting material largely enabled by advances in diamond synthesis to a level of quality that has reached that of more conventional crystalline semiconductors. In spite of its structural similarity to these materials, diamond has consistently exhibited unique properties such as its high thermal conductivity, thermal and radiation stability and negative electron affinity that enable niche and new electronic and optoelectronic applications. There remain many practical issues to resolve in diamond electronics (e.g. efficient low resistance and rectifying contacts, optimised n-type doping and control of thermal and chemical processes) and there is a need for better understanding of new phenomenon and applications (e.g. transfer doping, nanodiamond sensors and quantum storage). This background provides an ideal set of challenges for a project student equipped with the appropriate tools in the form of complementary characterisation methods (X-ray Absorption Spectroscsopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Microscopy) that can be applied in-situ to probe the interplay between energy levels, chemistry and local structure with high energy, temporal and spatial resolution. Solutions to the practical issues will ensure a high probability of generating useful data for the PhD programme while the application of techniques operating with the brightest sources coupled to the most efficient experimental probes and detectors will ensure an equal likelihood of discovering new science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G068216/1","grantId":"EP/G068216/1","fundValue":"146932","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The science findings have been used as the basis of a patent for graphene manufacture and for lectures to schools, organisations and also for radio and TV programmes in English and in Welsh.

This was achieved by understanding the catalytic conversion from sp3 to sp2 carbon and controlling the reaction to grow high quality 2-dimensional films. The work has resulted in journal papers, presentations at international conferences and the submission of a PhD thesis for the project student. For graphene production, the method uses a lower temperature than others (500C) and can be used to selectively define the areas of growth. For diamond cutting tools, it provides new insights into the mechanism for failure for cutting ferrous metals. It has potential use for understanding of the iron-carbon system for the metal/steel industry and longer term importance in quantum computing and spintronics as it involves three of the key materials - doped diamond, iron and graphene.
