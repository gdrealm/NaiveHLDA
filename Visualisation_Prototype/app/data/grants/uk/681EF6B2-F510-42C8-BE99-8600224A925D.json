{"id":"681EF6B2-F510-42C8-BE99-8600224A925D","title":"Microengineering of Quadrupole Mass Spectrometers using RP techniques","abstractText":"The rationale of this follow on project is to provide proof of concept of manufacture of a novel microengineered gas sensor. An emerging range of 3D Rapid Prototyping (RP) microfabrication techniques (namely Selective Laser Melting (SLM) and Digital Light Processing (DLP)) will be used to manufacture a novel microscale vacuum instrument. For the first time RP techniques will be used to fabricate a low cost universal gas sensor utilising a micro-quadrupole mass spectrometer (u-QMS). A comprehensive IP review and market search is to be undertaken. A survey of potential applications, customers and investors will be carried out and next stage Business Plan will be formulated.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F008848/1","grantId":"EP/F008848/1","fundValue":"113879","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Taylor","coPersons":["Paul Raymond Chalker","Christopher John Sutcliffe"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
