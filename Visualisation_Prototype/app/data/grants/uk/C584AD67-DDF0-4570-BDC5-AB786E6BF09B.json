{"id":"C584AD67-DDF0-4570-BDC5-AB786E6BF09B","title":"Bridging the Gaps Between Engineering and Mathematics in the Edinburgh Research Partnership","abstractText":"The Edinburgh Research Partnership (ERP) in Engineering and Mathematics was established recently, linking key groups in Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt Universities. This is completely changing the research environment at the two institutions, and this period of change and realignment offers a unique opportunity to extend the commitment to multidisciplinary working in both institutions. This project is focused on creating new collaborations between mathematical sciences and engineering through a range of pump-priming activities designed to break down the barriers (including lack of time and opportunity) to multidisciplinary collaborations, and to encourage the building of novel and lasting collaborations from the ground up. The activities include scoping workshops, working in pairs (a concentrated period for people from different subjects to work together), mathematician/engineer in residence (immersion in a different discipline) and a visitor and seminar programme. Academic staff in the ERP (and subject areas relevant to this call) will be encouraged to apply to our Selection Panel for backing to carry out pump-priming activities, and we will respond quickly with support for promising proposals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E018939/1","grantId":"EP/E018939/1","fundValue":"388348","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This was a very wide-ranging project that generated many short term interactions bewteen disciplines.
