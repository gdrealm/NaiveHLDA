Standard statistical and econometric techniques cannot be used in these circumstances. </p>\n\n<p>The method that we propose to apply to the APC problem has been used to address problems of a similar nature in the other disciplines and its application to one of the longest standing statistical problems in the social sciences is overdue. </p>\n\n<p>The APC problem has recently been relevant to research questions as diverse as how saving behaviour varies as people age (in various countries), breast cancer incidence (in China), subjective measures of happiness (USA), propensity to commit suicide (Switzerland), and productivity of scientific researchers (France). </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4293","grantId":"RES-000-22-4293","fundValue":"42496","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Cormac  O'Dea","coPersons":["Martin  Browning","Ian  Crawford"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
