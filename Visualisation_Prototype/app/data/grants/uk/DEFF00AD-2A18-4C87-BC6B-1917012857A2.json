Many pharmaceuticals are chiral, which means that they exist as two mirror images. These mirror images often behave quite differently in their interactions with the body's complex chemistry, and so it is important for safety and economic reasons to make pharmaceuticals in just one of its two forms i.e. the one which has the best clinical effect. One of the most efficient ways of doing this is by using a small amount of a chiral catalyst, ultimately derived from chirality created by nature, to generate large amounts of a key molecule en route to the target pharmaceutical. In this project we plan to use a series of reactions discovered in our laboratories, which enables us to rapidly create molecules containing previously difficult-to-access symmetries, to create new chiral catalysts. The catalysts will be tested in several key reactions and the most promising will be developed further so that they may ultimately be used in pharmaceutical manufacture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C547322/1","grantId":"EP/C547322/1","fundValue":"124540","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Elizabeth Gibson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
