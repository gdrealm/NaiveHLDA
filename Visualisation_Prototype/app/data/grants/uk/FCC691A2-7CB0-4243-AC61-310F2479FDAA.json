Early planning discussions for this local centre have involved the PI on this research seminar series Prof. Gillian Youngs as a key contributor. \nTwo major seminars co-organized by the series and the TSB ICT and Creative Industries KTNs held at NESTA in London and University of Wales, Newport, focused on what endures as a challenge for the Catapult agendas - 'Creative and Digital Economy: A New Fusion'. Discussions at these and a further seminar at Oxford University with TSB collaboration highlighted a number of key areas which have been taken forward including:\n- Focus on the creative industries which are strong in the UK, and present one of the best \n- opportunities to provide the UK with a strategic advantage in developing new \n- platforms, products, and services. \n- New approaches to intellectual property and different kinds of value generated from it and associated with it.\n- Focus on new methodologies for collaborations across ICT and creative specialisms and expert languages as important. \n- Geographical clusters as well as clusters based on skill sets and innovative competencies and investment networks are important.\n- Importance of Catapult identity as a quality hub, focal point and champion for innovation nationally and globally and as a centre of open innovation, brokering, showcasing and dissemination of new technologies and business and service models. \n- Human-centred processes to key to digital economy transformations. Recognition that inputs from diverse actors are needed to understand them.\nBriefing summaries were produced and distributed from these three seminars ensuring wide cross-sector dissemination of their discussions and outcomes.

Its seminar methodology was core to its achievements. Its applied focus generated a partnership model firmly oriented towards delivering impact through high quality engagement of research and practice in policy-relevant contexts. This involved a deep knowledge exchange approach involving academic research, policy, creative and business practice, as well as third sector. Most of the 12 seminars held in England, Wales and Scotland, were co-organized including with the Technology Strategy Board (now Innovate UK) and other RCUK projects notably Glasgow-based CREATe and Brigton-based Fuse. \n1. Digital and creative innovation\nFindings address to a substantial degree agendas of collaborators and reside in three main areas. The first relate to digital and creative innovation. These emphasize that the nature of innovation has developed from the industrial to the digital era. In digital times many kinds of innovation are comparatively more accessible including to individuals. This indicates that where innovation takes place as well as who does it and how has expanded dramatically and requires new forms of approach to research and practice including from policy standpoints. \nCreativity is a core focus in this regard not just in relation to creative industries as we know them in economic terms, but to wider views of creative inputs to digital innovation across new social and cultural as well as business opportunities. Human-centred approaches are especially important in shifting innovation agendas to orientations fit for the digital age where innovation can be small as well as large scale and focused on creative and new ideas for information-driven solutions as well as services and products.\n2. Human and socio-cultural dimensions of connectivity\nThis emphasizes that connectivity is far from just a technological issue, a matter of hardware and software, but features human and socio-cultural dimensions that are powerful pathways to new forms of innovation whether aimed at profit or non-profit goals. New kinds of transdisciplinary perspectives associating arts, design and humanities as well as social science insights and methods with those of science and technology are increasingly in demand. This is highlighted by the long journey to be travelled towards the' Internet of Everything ' (IoE) where diverse forms of work-based as well as social and cultural aspects of life will be connected ever more deeply to interactive information streams as we move through different physical environments. We are still at the stage of largely imagining the IoE and connectivity in this regard is about embedding the virtual world of the Internet and all its interactive capacities in the familiar physical world and, importantly, our experience of it. \n3. Politics of privacy and trust in a digital age.\nThis is a world of Big Data where issues of trust and privacy are to the fore. It emphasizes the opportunity costs of the new digital possibilities. While the politics of digital engagement offers extensive potential for individual and collective empowerment, it also presents new risks around security of virtual (data) identities. This suggests the need for fresh perspectives on politics and policy addressing such issues as central to challenges faced in the digital age. Solutions are likely to come through new debates as well as forms of experimentation with data that test boundaries and help develop awareness and understanding of risks. As is often the case market actors are in the driving seat to a large extent through new services and products which consumers want to access. In many ways policy is playing catch up but progress in this area is one of the major routes to success for Big Data developments which drive towards more data exchange. Rights of individuals to their data are bound to be increasingly at issue as we move in this direction. (Please note that this report applies to ES1001816/1 and ES1001816/2 as they are both the same research seminar series, split because the PI moved institutions)\nWe envisage the outcomes on creative and digital innovation being taken forward in engagement with the work of Innovate UK's Digital Catapult Centre and its new local centres around the UK as well as in collaborations related to those with various relevant policy actors and business. We envisage the outcomes on human and socio-cultural dimensions of connectivity and the politics of privacy and trust being linked to that work but also to further funded research projects.
