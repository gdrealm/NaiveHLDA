Compared to\nmathematical, textual or visual data, audio data has remained largely underexploited and undervalued, and thus represents\nan opportunity to grow innovation and to develop new markets. While Automatic Speech Recognition and Music Analysis\nare now creating some industrial value, R&amp;D needs to be conducted to tackle the challenges posed by Automatic\nEnvironmental Sound Recognition defined in a broader sense. The newly developed advanced audio data analysis and\nmodelling techniques will create value across a variety of applicative domains. While proven markets include Professional\nSecurity and Home Security, a range of novel markets can be developed in relation to Multimedia Database Indexing,\nEnvironmental and Industrial Monitoring, the Internet of Things and more. The project will gather the newly developed\naudio analysis and modelling techniques into a demonstrator instantiated as a &quot;Personal Audio Space Indexer&quot;.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507088/1","grantId":"EP/M507088/1","fundValue":"77443","fundStart":"2014-11-03","fundEnd":"2015-09-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  PlumbleySimon  Dixon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
