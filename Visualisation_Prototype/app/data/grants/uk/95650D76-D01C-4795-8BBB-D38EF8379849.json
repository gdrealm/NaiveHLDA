Some of the findings and data from the ESRC award will be used to create educational material for Key Stage 3 educational resources (initially for History and Geography students).

However this was not the case in historical populations. This project sheds light on a watershed in urban mortality in north-western Europe, the period 1750-1820, when towns ceased to function as demographic sinks consuming the population excess of the countryside with their excessive death rates, and became capable of natural population growth. Using novel sources of data for the large London parish of St. Martin in the Fields we investigated the timing and causes of the fall in infant mortality, and the extent to which levels and trends in mortality differed by social status. \nThis study was the first to study infant and child mortality across the social status spectrum before the nineteenth century in England. It confirmed the distinctiveness of the early modern urban mortality regime and suggested that the 'urban graveyard' phenomenon of this period was not a necessary or universal feature of pre-modern cities. Key results were: \n1. Infant feeding practices and smallpox were the main drivers of the lethality of London in the early modern period. A rise in maternal breastfeeding and the advent of smallpox vaccination (but not its precursor inoculation) were the main causes of the falls in metropolitan mortality between 1750 and 1820. \n2. There was no advantage of wealth to life expectancy at least in early childhood in London in the period 1750-1812. Infants of wealthy families were at higher risk of death in the first year of life and this was mainly a consequence of the lower prevalence of maternal breastfeeding amongst higher social status groups. However a convergence to relatively long maternal breastfeeding in all social groups resulted only in a convergence on infant mortality rates with no greater advantage to wealthy families. \nResults of the project have been disseminated via eight invited seminars and three papers are scheduled for publication. The project included a scoping exercise to establish the existence of sources for the study of urban mortality in other British cities which resulted in a Leverhulme Trust grant (?200,846) for the project &quot;Mortality and epidemiological change in Manchester 1750-1850' (Jan 2013 - June 2015, PI is RJ Davenport). This new project allows a comparison between London, the only long-established major city in England, and the rapidly urbanising commercial and industrial centre of Manchester in order to test the ubiquity, and the commonality of the drivers, of mortality declines in urban centres in this period. \nThe project also contributed to the development of the research expertise of the research associates. Dr John Black was funded to attend a week long training programme on Geographical Information Systems and attended a course on statistical analyses of spatial data at the University of Cambridge. Dr Romola Davenport acquired expertise in the demographic technique of family reconstitution with training from Ms. Gill Newton (another RA on the project). We have won further funding to extend our exploration of urban mortality trends to Manchester, 1750-1850 (funded by the Leverhulme Trust, PI RJ Davenport). Our work will also contribute to a Wellcome Trust-funded grant to Prof. Richard Smith 'Migration, mortality and medicalization: investigating the long-run epidemiological consequences of urbanization, 1600-1945', on which RJ Davenport is a senior research associate and JP Boulton is a named collaborator.
