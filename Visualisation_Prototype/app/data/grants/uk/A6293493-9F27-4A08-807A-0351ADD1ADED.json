Four out of five people report considerable (acute) pain after surgery. One in five Europeans suffer from chronic pain. Unmanageable pain impacts upon peoples' lives, their carers and families, and is a massive economic burden. We need to find new treatments for managing pain. Considerable time and effort is spent searching for new treatments, but the conventional way of working out if therapies are effective (efficacy) relies simply on asking people. Descriptions of pain vary a lot between people, meaning that sensitive, reliable ways of measuring pain have been difficult to come by. Developing a new treatment requires hundreds of patients, takes time and is expensive; up to fifteen years and a billion US dollars. Sometimes a lot of this money is spent before realizing treatments don't work or have too many side-effects. We must develop new, sensitive tools that give early signals of efficacy. These tools need to work quickly, in small numbers of people, to reduce costs and to focus earlier on the best candidates for new treatments.\n\nThis research uses a type of MRI scanning called arterial spin labeling (ASL), to measure small changes in blood circulation in the brain (cerebral blood flow-CBF). We have shown that ASL can detect CBF changes that occur when people experience pain, both after surgery and as a result of disease, such as osteoarthritis. These patterns of CBF changes are related to how the brain processes pain, are quantifiable and can be distinguished from those in people without pain, using less than 20 subjects. They tell us about how the brain represents 'being' in pain. Using mathematics known as 'machine learning' (ML), we can predict, solely from CBF patterns, about how likely it is that a person is in pain. Importantly these methods mean that we don't have to rely on what the patient is telling us. \n\nWe aim to demonstrate ASL is a useful, efficient tool for assessing new painkillers. We will examine pain experienced following wisdom teeth surgery. Many people with no other health problems, taking no other medicines, suddenly experience recurrent toothache, resolved by having their wisdom teeth extracted. Often when a wisdom tooth on one side of the mouth is removed, the other one must also be removed. This means that we can look at how reliable CBF patterns are between surgeries, or examine the effects of a painkiller, compared to a placebo. The study of pain following wisdom tooth surgery is ideal for research; it is well-controlled using common painkillers, eg, paracetamol. We know paracetamol works, but we don't know how it changes the representation of pain in the brain- 'analgesia'. \n\nFirst, we will verify if ASL can reliably detect CBF changes representing pain, by comparing the effects of extracting one tooth to the other, using a statistic called the intra-class correlation co-efficient. Next, we will assess the sensitivity of ASL to detect the effects of paracetamol, compared to placebo, before and after wisdom tooth surgery. Looking at the effects of paracetamol while pain-free tells us if the drug changes CBF independently of any pain-killing quality. Assessing CBF changes following surgery will demonstrate the effects of analgesia. Using ML, we can make predictions about how likely it is the analgesia is working, compared to placebo. These techniques tell us where in the brain we know a good pain-killing drug is working, and the sensitivity of perfusion MRI to detect it. With this information, we can test new drugs and make rapid, cost-effective predictions about the likelihood that they will be effective. \n\nWe envisage the technology will be useful for assessing not just drugs, but other therapies, in both acute and chronic pain conditions. The technique may also help assessing people unable to verbalise if they are in pain, for example, very young individuals and those in vegetative states.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J005142/1","grantId":"MR/J005142/1","fundValue":"394246","fundStart":"2012-08-06","fundEnd":"2014-07-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven C Williams","coPersons":["Matthew Alexander Howard","Andre  Marquand","Fernando Osmin Zelaya","Nadine  Khawaja","Tara Frances Renton"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
