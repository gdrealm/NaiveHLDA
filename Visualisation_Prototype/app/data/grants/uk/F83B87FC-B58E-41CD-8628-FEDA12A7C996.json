{"id":"F83B87FC-B58E-41CD-8628-FEDA12A7C996","title":"Imaging the surviving penumbra and recovery after stroke","abstractText":"In the UK, stroke is the third cause of death and first cause of acquired disability, despite some degree of recovery in most survivors. Acutely reopening the blood vessel with thrombolysis salvages some tissue from infarction and improves outcome but does not always result in sufficient recovery. This may be due to death of brain cells in and inflammation of the salvaged tissue, in spite, or even perhaps because, of restoring blood flow. These lesions might prevent normal function of the remaining healthy cells to resume. Better understanding these processes might lead to novel approaches for treatment, in order to improve outcome after stroke. In this programme of research, we will use novel imaging techniques to tackle these issues in acute stroke patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500874","grantId":"G0500874","fundValue":"843339","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jean-Claude  Baron","coPersons":["Elizabeth  Warburton","Franklin Imo Aigbirhio"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
