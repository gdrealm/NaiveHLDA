{"id":"8601D44B-8079-4A47-BB6B-DF76BDD55E55","title":"Preventing childhood obesity in the UK, with a focus on South Asian children","abstractText":"We plan to develop a package of activities to prevent obesity among children. The activities will be tested among children aged 5 to 7 in primary schools in Birmingham. \nObesity is a growing global problem among children and adults. Its health consequences include increased risk of heart disease, cancers and diabetes. In the UK, people of South Asian (SA) origin are at particularly high risk, but this group have not been included in previous research. We know that targeting children is a good way of preventing the rising trend. \nPrevious research has had limited success, partly because less attention was paid to the planning process. Our study takes a new approach to planning, focusing on environmental factors and including children of SA background.\nWe will first gather information from people in schools and surrounding communities, and combine this with information from the scientific literature. Through this process we aim to define activities that the target community perceives to be effective, important and acceptable. \nWe will then test the package among children from four primary schools. We will assess the effects and refine the activities by comparing these children with children from other similar schools who did not have these activities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501292","grantId":"G0501292","fundValue":"336164","fundStart":"2006-09-04","fundEnd":"2009-09-03","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peymane  Adab","coPersons":["Timothy  Barrett","Miranda  Pallan","Joan Lynne Duda","Ulf  Ekelund","Paramjit  Gill","Jayne  Parry","Amanda  Daley","Janet  Cade","K  Cheng"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
