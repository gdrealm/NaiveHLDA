One of the proposed scenarios involves the delivery of biologically important compounds such as amino acids on the primordial Earth by the impact of meteorites on the Earth's surface. In the early 90's, several works reported the discovery of more than seventy amino acids in meteorites, the majority of which have no known terrestrial occurrence. This finding supports the exogenous hypothesis for the origin of life. \n\nIt is thus currently believed that amino acids may have formed in the interstellar medium, where complex organics, i.e. large carbon-based molecules, have been found. Laboratory experiments of highly energetic processes such as illumination by ultraviolet photons or bombardment by cosmic rays on interstellar ice analogs, have indeed found that these processes are very efficient in the production of large organic molecules and, in particular, in the formation of amino acids.\n\nDespite this progress in the past twenty years, the direct detection of amino acids in the interstellar medium remains elusive. Previous works focused on the search of amino acids in regions across the Galaxy where massive stars form. These regions are relatively hot, and are known to show an active chemistry which induces the production of large amounts of complex organics. The spectrum of light observed toward these regions is highly populated by molecular emission lines at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths, resembling a forest of lines. In this highly populated spectra, the brightest line features correspond to the more abundant species in the interstellar medium. This makes the identification of less abundant species such as amino acids challenging. As a consequence, no firm detection of amino acids in the interstellar medium has been reported to date. \n\nIn this research project, we will use a novel theoretical and observational approach to detect the simplest amino acids, glycine and alanine, in the interstellar medium. This approach considers that the initial stages in the formation of Solar-type systems, characterized by very cold temperatures (about 10 degrees above absolute zero), are better suited for the detection of amino acids. \n\nIn a first step, the chemistry of glycine and alanine will be characterized theoretically assuming very cold conditions resembling those of young Solar-type systems. This will help us to infer the main chemical routes involved in the destruction and formation of glycine and alanine at cold temperatures. In a second step, we will perform theoretical modelling of the emission spectrum of these species. This will allow us to establish the parts of the spectrum of light where the probability to detect glycine and alanine is higher. Finally, we will perform deep observations of these species by using the unprecedented capabilities of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) located on the Chajnantor plateau in Chile. The increased sensitivity of this facility (by more than a factor of 10 with respect to previous instrumentation) offers the opportunity, for the first time, to accomplish the detection of amino acids in space. \n\nThis research not only will allow us to fully characterize the pre-biotic chemistry of amino acids, but will allow us to directly link the formation of these complex organics in the interstellar medium with their subsequent delivery onto planetary systems. The detection of amino acids at the early stages in the formation of Solar-type systems will represent a milestone in our understanding of the emergence of life on Earth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M004139/1","grantId":"ST/M004139/1","fundValue":"241742","fundStart":"2015-09-21","fundEnd":"2019-06-02","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Izaskun  Jimenez-Serra","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
