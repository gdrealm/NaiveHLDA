This work will study a protein in cancer cells that is important for cell function, but which operates excessively in cancer cells and may be responsible for their rapid growth. We can assess tumour potency by measuring the amount of this protein in cancer cells, and in the future, may be able to design strategies to control it and limit tumour expansion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700759","grantId":"G0700759","fundValue":"385343","fundStart":"2008-10-21","fundEnd":"2011-10-20","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Wilkins","coPersons":["John Clive Ellory"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
