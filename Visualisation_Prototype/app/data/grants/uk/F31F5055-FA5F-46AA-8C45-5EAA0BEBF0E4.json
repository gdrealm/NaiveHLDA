Six interdisciplinary seminars were held between 2008 and 2010, five in the UK and one in Germany.</p>\n\n<p>The ISSUES seminar series developed an active multi-disciplinary network, which included representatives from 18 universities, three research institutes, six Government departments and environmental regulators, three wildlife trusts, five environmental consultancies and six local/regional authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The key finding to emerge from the seminars was the conclusion that the Ecosystem Service (ES) approach provides a workable framework for multi-discipline research and knowledge exchange. The seminars enabled participation in multi-disciplinary discussions and field-visits which directly informed the research of the participants. The novel application of an ES approach to an urban water setting was pioneered and resulted in publication of a peer-review journal paper, and the co-organisers went on to contribute to the major technical report The UK National Ecosystem Assessment published in 2011.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-496-26-0048","grantId":"RES-496-26-0048","fundValue":"22777","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca  Wade","coPersons":["Lian  Scholes"],"organisation":"University of Abertay Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
