In doing so we aim to lay the foundation required to understand, design and realize future large scale Ubiquitous Computing arrangements that will be embedded in the world we inhabit and shape the ways in which we all live. Key activities involved over the project are reported through the website and include a two day seminar at the Royal Society on the grand challenge of ubiquitous computing. Ubiquitous Computing has emerged as a key UK research strength with initiatives such as the Grand Challenges and investments such as the EPSRC WINES programme suggesting continued growth in this critical research area. However, a key question is whether the UK can continue to build on its current prominent position in this area. We seek to maximise the benefit of current initiatives such as Equator, the UK grand challenges and the WINES programme by working in partnership with other international initiatives and world leading research groups to shape a global Ubiquitous computing community. In addition to shaping an international research community the initiative will also seek to promote a stronger engagement between the international ubiquitous computing community and society. The aim is to allow the public to have a central role in shaping the technology and the nature of this future society. The initiative will deliver benefits to a number of key parties including:\n\nThe research community focusing on Ubiquitous Computing will benefit from a range of collaborative mechanisms allowing them to collaborate in the formation of new shared concepts and new approaches to the realisation of ubiquitous computing.\n\nA range of industrial concerns will benefit from increased knowledge of the multidisciplinary issues involved in tackling the challenges associated with Ubiquitous computing and the agreement on shared approaches fostered through this endeavour. \n\nPolicy makers and Government Agencies will benefit from an understanding of the technical and societal challenges raised by the emergence of ubiquitous computing through the forums supported by this initiative. \n\nThe general public may accrue benefit through broader understanding and articulation of the issues involved in ubiquitous computing and future generations will benefit from the teaching materials to emerge from this initiative.
