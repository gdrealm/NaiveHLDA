{"id":"EC8E8AF6-BBA4-45F3-95C4-510C62C8C4E3","title":"Multilingual London English/Multilingual Paris French","abstractText":"<p>This bilateral Franco-British project will compare developments in contemporary London English with those occurring in Paris French. Particular attention will be paid to the influence on English and French of varieties spoken by communities of immigrant origin, including Afro-Caribbeans in the UK and French Caribbeans and Maghrebans in France. </p>\n\n<p>New linguistic features found will be analysed to determine their relationship with ethnic-derived varieties and with more traditional sites of linguistic change, such as non-standard - but widely diffused or 'levelled' - varieties of English on the one hand, and 'fran&ccedil;ais populaire' on the other. Particular attention will be paid to features taken over from the ethnic varieties through a process of code-switching or 'crossing', as has been shown to occur by other studies carried out in London. The emphasis in the second part of the project will be on the direct comparison of language change in the two settings. </p>\n\n<p>The project will constitute the first large-scale comparison of two significant Western European cities from a sociolinguistic perspective. It will contribute to our understanding of sociolinguistic processes of language change and also to social questions to do with migration, integration and their educational consequences. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H043691/1","grantId":"ES/H043691/1","fundValue":"395332","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Penelope Helen  Gardner-Chloros","coPersons":["Jennifer Lilian Cheshire"],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
