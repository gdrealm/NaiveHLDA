{"id":"34B4E1D6-0EAB-413E-B8F1-B253D9C8F9AB","title":"Global health and Human Rights: Theory, Process and Substance","abstractText":"<p>The seminar series brings together researchers from across a range of disciplines to critically interrogate the development of rights based approaches to health. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) defines the right to health as &quot;the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health&quot;. This series will deepen our theoretical and practical understanding of rights based approaches to health. The first seminar will focus on current theories of human rights. The second seminar will focus on the processes by which rights to health are invoked or thwarted. The third, and final seminar, will focus on rights based approaches to contemporary global health issues such as tobacco, severe acute respiratory syndrome, World Trade Organisation agreements governing trade in intellectual property and services, and poverty alleviation. Each seminar will be held over two days, at which invited speakers will share experiences of theory, policy and practice. Speakers will be from the UK and abroad and will be a mix of academics, policy makers and practitioners. At each seminar, subsidised places will be provided to three post-graduate students and three members of voluntary sector organisations. Dissemination will be through a website and printed material.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4320","grantId":"RES-451-25-4320","fundValue":"15449","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria Clasina Stuttaford","coPersons":["John  Harrington","Gillian Ann Lewando Hundt"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
