{"id":"43334BA7-D1D7-4866-AC80-0B4AAC6FF3F4","title":"A fundamental study of deformation mechanisms in advanced polycrystalline nickel-base superalloys","abstractText":"As one of the most important classes of high-temperature structural materials, nickel-base superalloys exhibit unique high temperature properties, which make them the first choice in demanding applications such as the hot sections of turbine engines for both aircraft and power-generation applications. Nickel-base superalloys rely upon a combination of matrix strengthening and precipitation hardening to give outstanding high-temperature mechanical properties. This research project will study the effect of gamma prim precipitate distribution on the deformation mechanisms in advanced gamma (matrix)/gamma prime (precipitates) nickel-base superalloys for high temperature applications. It takes an interdisciplinary approach, combining detailed metallurgical studies, in-situ mechanical testing on neutron and high-energy x-ray synchrotron diffraction beam lines and mathematical modelling. Instead of studying macroscopic mechanical properties as a function of microstructure, our approach will allow us to study directly strengthening mechanisms as a function of microstructure. In advanced superalloys, fundamental studies have often been limited by the complexity of the microstructure. We will overcome this by first studying simplified model microstructures and using these to validate and tune advanced models, before moving on to commercially more relevant but also more complex microstructures.This project will provide an improved fundamental understanding of the interplay of gamma prim-distribution and deformation mechanisms, which is key to harnessing the full potential of these new high temperature alloys. Although a number of new gamma prim strengthened polycrystalline nickel-base alloys have recently emerged from worldwide development programs, the optimisation of the mechanical properties of these alloys through thermomechanical processing has been, to date, strongly empirical. This new understanding will make it possible to identify optimum microstructures, which will not only help definite the ideal thermomechanical processing routes for newly developed alloys, but also illuminate future alloy development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E020933/1","grantId":"EP/E020933/1","fundValue":"314622","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We continue to work with companies such as Rolls-Royce to improve our understanding of high temperature materials performance in order to provide guidance for future alloy development.

In this case, undertaking detailed analysis of deformation structures is usually carried out on material with only a limited amount of deformation as otherwise the analysis in a transmission electron microscope become too difficult. Another shortcoming of work in this field in the past was, that most of the research had focused on complex industrial microstructures. \n\nIn our present project, we developed model microstructures to study deformation mechanisms in industrial alloys. In addition, we used in-situ experimental methods such as in-situ loading while recording g neutron diffraction data. In this way we were able to study the fingerprint of the deformation mechanisms and identify change of deformation mechanisms as a function of microstructure, test temperature and plastic strain. The understanding generated in the present project will be used by companies such as Rolls-Royce to develop more physically informed living models in the future. Also, the work should be able to contribute to future Nickel Superalloy development as it provides guidance in terms of how the different microstructure parameters affect the deformation mechanisms in the material. As a result of the EPSRC project, Rolls-Royce has continued to fund PhD project in Manchester to continue the work on fundamental deformation mechanisms in nickel base superalloys as this is of p[articular interest to understand fatigue in these alloys Energy,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
