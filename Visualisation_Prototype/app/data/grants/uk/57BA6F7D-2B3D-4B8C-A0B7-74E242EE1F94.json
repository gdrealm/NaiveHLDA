The work will be carried out in tandem with a currently active project that is looking at the environmental barriers faced by many people in managing continence including access to public toilets. A steady decline in the availability of these facilities has resulted in current public provision being at an all time low. <br />&nbsp;<br />One of the key reasons for toilet closures is through vandalism and ‘anti-social’ behaviours. This has lead to a number of design initiatives and guides to tackle such issues through design. Current design guidance for publicly accessible toilets tends to offer a one-size-fits-all solution, which does not consider the wider community needs. This is problematic not only for access for the general population but also when considering how robust a facility needs to be to deter possible anti-social behaviour. <br />&nbsp;<br />This project examines existing provision to understand the varied challenges providers face in regards to non-toileting behaviour. In addition it will consult with communities and capture relevant examples of good or bad design that may be considered to ‘put off’ users opposed to creating toilet facilities that users feel safe and secure using. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-193-25-0006","grantId":"RES-193-25-0006","fundValue":"12126","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Robust Accessible Toilets (RATs) used secondary analysis of data gathered from the NDA funded Tackling Ageing Continence through Theory, Tools and Technology (TACT3) project to identify design elements in publicly accessible toilets that had focused on a Design Out Crime perspective at the expense of inclusive and therefore more accessible design. The key output of this project and shared with the TACT3 research was 'Publicly Accessible Toilets; An Inclusive Design Guide', available on hard copy and PDF. This guide also charted community efforts to manage public toilet provision, and introduced the Great British Public Toilet Map as a digital information resource (This output was also shared with the TACT3 project).

This design perspective has been applied to wider publicly accessible space, creating a fortress approach that denies access. The most extreme example was the recent 'spike' design in doorways to discourage rough sleepers. Communities can use the guide to assess options for managing local publicly accessible toilet provision, as well as design guidance on fixtures and fittings to maximise provision for all members of the community but especially older and disabled people and families with young children.
