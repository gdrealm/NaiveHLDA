This affects a permanent genetic change in the target which is propagated through to its progeny. While there are several means of genetic modification, few are capable of permanent modification of target cells. Amongst all vectors for gene delivery, LV are unique in unparalleled efficiency, safety, lack of toxicity and ability to modify non-dividing target cells. They have therefore come to be recognised as a key reagent required for the efficient development of the burgeoning cell therapy, as well as gene therapy industries. However, although LV represent a well understood and robust technology, there is no manufacturing methodology for very large-scale LV production. This is now an acknowledged bottle-neck both for clinical trials and for commercial exploitation of many cell and gene therapy products in current development. We propose to address this unmet need","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M028992/1","grantId":"BB/M028992/1","fundValue":"1436650","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Pule","coPersons":["Pamela  Tranter","Adrian James Thrasher","Yasuhiro  Takeuchi","Waseem  Qasim"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
