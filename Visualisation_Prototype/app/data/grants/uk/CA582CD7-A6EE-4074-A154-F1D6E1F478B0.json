Plasmas are key to fusion energy research, which may lead to an almost limitless source of energy for mankind's future.

This workshop will bring together a group of applied mathematicians and physicists whose skills can offer a mutually beneficial forum for the exchange of ideas on problems in plasma physics. Mathematicians working in non-linear dynamics, differential geometry and topology, and numerical analysis possess tools that can open up new avenues of exploration in plasma physics and numerical simulation.

Furthermore, numerous informal discussion sessions were held that enhanced the opportunity for developing new collaborations. Leaders (from the UK and abroad) of broad range of topics in plasma physics, computation and applied mathematics attended the meeting, and it is likely that the exchange of ideas led to new developments.
