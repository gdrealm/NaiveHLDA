{"id":"6ACE62A8-3FA8-4714-9292-DAA76D3A4179","title":"New Applicant Grant","abstractText":"The discovery of a Higgs boson at LHC could indicate that there is more than one.\nOur most popular theory for Dark Matter, supersymmetry, predicts the existence\nof 5 Higgs bosons, and searching for another is now a very high priority. This is \nparticularly timely in 2015 as the restart of the LHC at (or close to) is design energy means \nthat heavy objects will be produced much more easily than before. There is therefore\nan excellent opportunity to look for new heavier Higgs bosons. In supersymmetry \nthe most likely decay mode of such a particle is into pairs of 'tau' leptons. Warwick has a\nlot of expertise in the study of the first Higgs boson to these particles, and it is natural to\ntry to extend our studies to a possible heavier particle. \n The increased LHC beam energy might produce other heavy particles. For example a\nWarwick student is preparing to search for a new heavy boson (W') resembling the W boson \nof the weak nuclear force. His studies include this boson decaying into an ordinary W boson\nand a Z. This grant should allow us to extend that search to also cover decay to a W and a\nHiggs, with both of these decaying into 'jets'. This is not currently studied in ATLAS but\nshould be the most sensitive mode for a high-mass W'\n Whether either of these possibilities really occurr we do not know - but we can\nonly find out by looking.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M004236/1","grantId":"ST/M004236/1","fundValue":"3024","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"William  Murray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
