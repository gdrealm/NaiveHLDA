The dynamic processes occurring then has been poorly resolved because of the deposits' depth beneath margin sediments and salt mobilisation by overburden stress. The Red Sea is a potentially useful analogue. New geophysical data reveal glacier-like bodies of evaporites flowing into one of the central deeps. We will now explore whether similar flowage can be deduced from the new high-quality 3D seismic data being collected off Brazil and examine deformation rates generally. This will provide datasets for a PhD study and help understand the hydrocarbon potential of the pre-salt stratigraphy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I52880X/1","grantId":"NE/I52880X/1","fundValue":"8868","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Neil Charles Mitchell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" This funding was provided to allow us to explore whether findings of a project on the Red Sea (geophysical data showing evidence of evaporite flows) would help understand geological evolution of the South Atlantic where similar large thicknesses of evaporites were deposited when Africa rifted from South America. Discussions were held with industry scientists from Hess, British Gas and Petrobras. Although these showed a lack of detailed data on the stratigraphy exist, some seismic datasets and future drilling may yield interesting projects in the future to explore this analogy. The knowledge of the Red Sea processes may guide the understanding of temperature evolution of South Atlantic reservoirs in the future. No exploitation has currently been undertaken.
