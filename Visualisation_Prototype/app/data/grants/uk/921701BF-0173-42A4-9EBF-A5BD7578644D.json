{"id":"921701BF-0173-42A4-9EBF-A5BD7578644D","title":"Engineering Functional Materials for Catalytic Smart Microreactors","abstractText":"There has been tremendous recent progress in manufacturing very small chemical reactors with channels of the order of micrometres in size. These microreactors allow rapid evaluation of new chemical reactions compared with larger units. The current methods of manufacturing of such reactors are based on expensive and polluting electronics manufacturing techniques. This project will develop faster, cheaper and multifunctional devices with much wider range of potential application. This project involves combining new fabrication methods with recently developed catalysts to provide novel and efficient microreactors. It is a blend of materials science, engineering and chemistry involving mechanical and materials engineers (Liverpool), chemists and surface scientists (Durham) and polymer and organic chemists and chemical engineers (Bath). The complementary expertise of these groups is vital to the success of the programme.The Liverpool group in the first stage of the project will use their experience in Selective Laser Melting (SLM) and Digital Light Processing (DLP) to fabricate novel reactors containing channels &lt; 100 microns in size for reactant and heat exchange fluids in a single unit. These will be evaluated as potential industrial reactors using novel catalysts developed at Bath involving magnetic nanoparticles. In the second stage, the reactant channels will be functionalised using plasma techniques at Durham and converted to catalytically active species using chemistry developed at Bath. A series of test reactions will be performed and the performance analysed by a number of methods. These will require the development of in-situ methods, in order to optimise the design of the reactors and to illustrate the potential benefits to the materials, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The end result will be a multifunctional reactor with integrated analytics optimised for selected chemical reactions of immediate relevance to the fine chemicals industries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D064635/1","grantId":"EP/D064635/1","fundValue":"158811","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jas Pal  Badyal","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" Durham's contribution towards this collaborative project was the plasmachemical functionalisation of\n\nmicroreactor walls supplied by Liverpool University with linker groups to then be passed onto Bath University\n\nfor the immobilization of catalytically active species.\n\n\n\nThe group at Liverpool prepared different internal diameter porous structures using Rapid Manufacturing Technologies\n\n(namely Selective Laser Melting (SLM) and Digital Light Processing (DLP)). These included 20 mm plastic tubes with\n\nvarious internal diameters (30 - 1000 microns). They were exposed to a variety of electrical discharges containing\n\nglycidyl methacrylate precursor (this monomer provides epoxide groups for subsbequent linkage to catalytic moieties).\n\nThe chemical nature of the deposited nanolayers was verfied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and contact angle analysis. Penetration of the plasma throughout each plastic tube internal was proven by reacting the epoxide centres with fluorescent dye and observation using fluorescence microscopy. The presence of fluorescent signal throughout to the central regions of the tubes indicated\n\nplasma deposition successfully occurs within their interiors. \n\n\n\nThe developed plasmachemical surface functionalisation approach was then translated to metallic porous structures\n\n(metal strips and blocks) prepared by Liverpool University using Selective Laser Melting (SLM), and the coated samples\n\nwere then submitted to Bath University for catalyst immobilization studies. The fundamental understanding gained during the EPSRC catalytic microreactor project regarding the penetration of\n\nelectrical discharge species into small apertures is being extended to applications for porous ceramic materials as part of\n\nfollow-on support (?160,449) for an international collaboration awarded to Durham for a project entitled 'Interface Science\n\nand Engineering' by the UK-India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI).
