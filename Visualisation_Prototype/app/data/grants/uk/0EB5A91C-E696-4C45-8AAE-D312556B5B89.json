{"id":"0EB5A91C-E696-4C45-8AAE-D312556B5B89","title":"University of Warwick Experimental Equipment Proposal","abstractText":"The goal of this project is to establish a portfolio of research equipment that will support the strategic research objectives and enhance the research capabilities of the University of Warwick internally and with external collaborators and partners. The equipment will support and enhance cross-disciplinary research activity including investments made by the University in 'Global Research Priorities' (GRPs) including Energy, Innovative Manufacturing, Science and Technology for Health, Materials and Sustainable Cities. \n\n5 equipment bundles which underpin current projects and grants have been requested as follows:\n\n- Bundle 1: Refreshing Solution and Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Capability;\n- Bundle 2: Advanced Materials Characterisation and Analysis;\n- Bundle 3: Innovative and Sustainable Manufacturing and Infrastructure;\n- Bundle 4: Micro/Nano-fabrication and characterisation;\n- Bundle 5: Multi Length Scale Nanomaterials Characterisation.\n\nEach bundle is within EPSRC's remit and in areas where Warwick has research excellence, a critical mass, a previous history of strategic investment and plans for future growth. These bundles will refresh and update existing capability across four departments in the Faculty of Science and will enhance the strength and productivity of the Warwick and national research base as well as supporting the effectiveness of individual researchers. \n\nThe investment will underpin the research of &gt;50 academic groups working in diverse fields, including: analytical science, automation systems, catalysis, chemical and synthetic biology, condensed matter, energy materials, functional ceramics, magnetic materials, manufacturing, medical imaging, nanoparticles, nanocomposites, polymer materials, power electronics, semiconductors, spintronics, structural engineering, synthetic organic and coordination chemistry.\n\nThe equipment will support the training of many PhD students and early career researchers on state-of-the art equipment, and will be accessible to Warwick academic users, as well as external academics partners, collaborators and industry. Steps will be taken to ensure the equipment requested is managed and maintained and that usage is maximised across the University and with external research partners. This includes the Warwick Analytical Capability Guide - a comprehensive current catalogue of available instrumentation and techniques at the University of Warwick, and Warwick Scientific Services - a centre of excellence based at University of Warwick, delivering cutting-edge world class scientific services, technical measurement solutions, innovative translational research, and knowledge and training services to businesses that could benefit from expertise and instrumentation.\n\nThe criteria behind the selection of the equipment ensures that the portfolio has wider strategic benefits for the University and their collaborative research community. The individual equipment will help to support researchers; collectively, the equipment will provide an opportunity to share new ideas and to create connections between academics across the Faculty.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M028186/1","grantId":"EP/M028186/1","fundValue":"515796","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Pamela Anne ThomasTimothy S Jones","coPersons":["Richard John Dashwood","Mike  Shipman","Marin  Alexe","Richard Ian Walton","Claudia Andrea Blindauer","JÃ³zef  Lewandowski","Marco  Polin","Alison  Rodger","J.
