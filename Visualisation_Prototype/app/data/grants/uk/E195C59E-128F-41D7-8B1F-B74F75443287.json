Each year about 20 million low birthweight babies are born worldwide. Low birthweight is caused by either preterm delivery (babies born earlier than expected) or fetal growth retardation. In countries where perinatal health services are limited, low birthweight and preterm birth are a major cause of neonatal deaths. Low birthweight babies are 20 or more times likely to die than heavier babies, with much of this mortality burden due to preterm birth. The current paradigm of using iron supplements (and folic acid) targeted at pregnant women often fails, in part because of the side effects, which are a strong barrier to use of the supplements early in pregnancy, a period of vulnerability for iron deficient women and their fetus and future newborn. And also because maternal inflammation and micronutrient deficiencies block effective utilization of iron Our approach will provide a product that will efficiently deliver iron and that can be taken early in pregnancy during a critical intervention window, which offers the potential to prevent neonatal deaths.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M026469/1","grantId":"MR/M026469/1","fundValue":"148908","fundStart":"2015-05-26","fundEnd":"2017-11-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tanvir Mahmudul  Huda","coPersons":["William Odita Tarnow-Mordi","Shams El  Arifeen","Michael John Dibley"],"organisation":"ICDDRB","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
