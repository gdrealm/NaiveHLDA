There has been an increase in social science research on stepfamilies in recent years but much remains to be done (Coleman et al. 2000).&nbsp;For example, a number of studies explore the effect of living in a stepparent family on children, including their psychological well-being.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Perhaps surprisingly, though, little research has considered the potential psychological impacts on the parents and this forms the focus of the proposed study, which examines whether stepparenting influences mental health using secondary data from the British Household Panel Study (BHPS).<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-163-25-0026","grantId":"RES-163-25-0026","fundValue":"46079","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Boyle","coPersons":["Elspeth  Graham","Vernon  Gayle"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
