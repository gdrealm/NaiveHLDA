It aims to develop completely new markets and achieve breakthroughs in performance.\n\nCSIC focuses on the innovative use of emerging technologies in sensor and data management (e.g. fibre optics, MEMS, computer vision, power harvesting, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Wireless Sensor Networks). It aims to develop completely new markets and achieve breakthroughs in performance.\n\nThe outputs of the Centre will provide the construction industry and infrastructure owners and operators with the means to ensure that very challenging new performance targets can be met. Furthermore, the potential breakthroughs will make the industry more efficient and therefore more profitable. They will give UK companies a competitive advantage in the increasingly global construction market.\n\nCSIC works closely with our large network of industry partners in developing the strategic direction for the Centre and in collaborative projects. To date, the Centre has over 30 demonstration projects and case studies.\n\nIn this proposal for Tranche 2 funding, we seek to build on the research and demonstration projects carried out in the Core programme and the Tranche 1 Collaborative Projects, with a strong focus on developing the outputs of these projects to be market ready, through development of the technologies into products and through standardisation of the deployment of sensor technologies in infrastructure environments and of the analysis of the data produced.\n\nImportant to this aim is the creation of an 'incubator team' who will carry out product development activities and will deploy sensor technologies in the field, further demonstrating and refining CSIC's capability and demonstrating the value of this capability to the market. The team will be constituted so that it can respond rapidly to client demand for demonstration and deployment of technologies and interpretation of data, creating maximum value for our industry partners.\n\nThis will result in a number of outputs designed to catalyse widespread uptake in the infrastructure industry, including:\n\n1) Specific commercialisation opportunities for the technologies through joint ventures, spin outs or licensing of IP;\n\n2) Consulting services, deploying sensors to assist clients e.g. in monitoring sensitive structures during construction, understanding live performance of assets or designing new assets efficiently based on data from monitored assets;\n\n3) Development of best practice guidance for structural health monitoring of assets, deployment of sensor networks, and analysis of data; and\n\n4) Development of training packages for industry\n\nIn addition to this, CSIC will carry out further research to expand the capability of the Centre's technologies into new areas, as identified by our industry partners through meetings and workshops.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L010917/1","grantId":"EP/L010917/1","fundValue":"2184280","fundStart":"2014-02-03","fundEnd":"2017-03-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  NOTE - DUE TO CHALLENGES IN USING RESEARCHFISH AND THE LIMITED TIME AVAILABLE, CSIC CONTENT ENTERED REPRESENTS A SMALL FRACTION OF ACTUAL OUTPUTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS. A FULL 4TH YEAR REPORT IS CURRENTLY BEING PREPARED FOR EPSRC - THIS WILL GIVE A MUCH MORE RELIABLE INDICATION OF ACHIEVEMENT.\nThe engineering, management, maintenance and upgrading of infrastructure requires fresh thinking to minimise use of materials, energy and labour whilst still ensuring resilience. This can only be achieved by a full understanding of the performance of the infrastructure, both during its construction and throughout its design life, through the application of innovative sensor technologies and other emerging technologies.\n\nThe key aim of CSIC is that emerging technologies from world-leading research at Cambridge will transform the construction industry through a whole-life approach to achieving sustainability in construction and infrastructure in an integrated way. \n\nThis covers:\no design and commissioning\no the construction process\no exploitation and use\no eventual de-commissioning\n\nCrucial elements of these emerging technologies are the innovative application of the latest sensor technologies, data management tools, manufacturing processes and supply chain management processes to the construction industry, both during infrastructure construction and throughout its design life.\n\nThe major objective of CSIC is to integrate these innovations for exploitation and knowledge transfer - something which is new to the UK construction and infrastructure industry. We believe that the outcome will be major transformations in the approaches to the design, construction and use of complex infrastructure leading to step changes in improved health and productivity; a low carbon society; sustainable urban planning and management.\n\nThere will be a very substantial market for exploitation of these technologies by the construction industry - particularly contractors, specialist instrumentation companies and owners of infrastructure for both domestic and international markets.\n\nWith our industry partners CSIC is pushing forward new frontiers of technology and innovative management in a sector of the economy which has traditionally had very little investment in research, particularly when compared to sectors such as computing or electronics. \n\nCSIC draws on recent research in new techniques, new models of construction and new management approaches. Through this innovation in technology and management, supported by extensive training and development, deep-rooted attitudes and assumptions are being challenged by CSIC with the aim of revolutionizing construction and the public perception of it.
