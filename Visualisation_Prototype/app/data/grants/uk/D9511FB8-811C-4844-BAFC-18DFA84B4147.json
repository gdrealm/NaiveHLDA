They are also used by university writing tutors, and tutors of English for Academic Purposes.\nBetween its launch on July 8th 2013 and the end of July 2013 there were over 128,000 unique page views to the Writing for a Purpose website, from countries including (but not limited to): Algeria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Egypt, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK, Ukraine, United States and Vietnam.. On July 31st 2013 we held a one-hour question and answer session on the British Council Facebook page, with language learners worldwide who were using or were about to use the Writing for a Purpose materials. This generated 20,000 hits. Since then regular question and answer sessions have been run on our behalf by the British Council LearnEnglish team.

Our objectives were to: \n\n1. raise teachers' and learners' awareness of the types of writing produced by university students, and their linguistic features; \n\n2. create a substantial bank of academic writing materials; accessible via the British Council LearnEnglish website; \n\n3.improve the quality of student writing, thereby increasing students' chances of success and their appreciation of higher education.\n\nFor the original study we collected, annotated and analysed almost 3000 good-quality student texts, fairly evenly distributed across four levels of university study and more than 30 disciplines. These texts form the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus - see www.coventry.ac.uk/bawe. They are categorized according to their discipline and level, and also according to 13 broad 'genre families', ranging from Case Studies and Essays to Proposals and Methodology Recounts. This categorization is new, and draws attention to the existence of many types of student writing that had previously been neglected in textbooks and course materials concerned with the development of academic writing skills. \n\nWe collaborated with the British Council to create online teaching and learning resources based on these genre families and referring to BAWE corpus data - see www.britishcouncil.org/writingforapurpose. The activities take writing purpose as a starting point, help teachers and learners to think about what university writing is for, pay attention to previously neglected genres, and provide links to relevant and authentic examples of proficient student writing. The materials are intended for use by learners of English and others who are undertaking or who are about to undertake university study in the medium of English, and who are unfamilar with the conventions of academic writing. They are also intended to be used by tutors of such students. \n\nThe materials can be used in class or for individual study, using data projection, desktop computers or mobile devices.
