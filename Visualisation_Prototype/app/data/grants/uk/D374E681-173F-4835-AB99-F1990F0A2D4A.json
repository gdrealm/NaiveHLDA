This way I aim to gain a better understanding of how nicotinic receptors promote the molecular and cellular processes required for memory and learning. \n\nIn Alzheimer’s disease there is a progressive degeneration of brain regions underlying memory and cognition. One of the key brain areas affected in Alzheimer’s disease is that which produces and releases acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that rapidly breaks down acetylcholine after it has been released in the brain. At present the main treatment for Alzheimer’s disease is with drugs that block the actions of acetylcholinesterase. \n\nAcetylcholinesterase may, however, be especially important for the proper functioning of nicotinic receptors. This is because nicotinic receptors rapidly become paralysed if acetylcholine is not quickly removed after it has performed its signalling functions. \n\nIn my studies I will also aim to determine whether the anti-cholinesterase drugs used in Alzheimer’s disease disrupt the normal actions of acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors in memory and learning areas. The results should ultimately contribute towards the development of better therapeutic treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500823","grantId":"G0500823","fundValue":"264414","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Zaineb  Henderson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
