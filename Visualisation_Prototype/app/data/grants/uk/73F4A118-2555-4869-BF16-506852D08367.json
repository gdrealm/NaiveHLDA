Understanding atomic-level structure and dynamics is key to harnessing the properties of increasingly complex new materials, and this represents one of the major challenges across the physical sciences in the early 21st Century.\n\nSolid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy provides extremely detailed insights into ordered and disordered materials at the sub-nanometre scale. Recent exciting advances have allowed an evolution from empirical interpretations of measured parameters to a deeper understanding of materials structure and properties by merging experimental and in silico approaches. This has lead to the emerging field of &quot;NMR crystallography&quot;, which we define here as the combined use of experimental NMR and computation to provide new insight, with atomic resolution, into structure, disorder and dynamics in the solid state.\n\nThe Collaborative Computer Project for NMR Crystallography will support a multidisciplinary community of NMR spectroscopists, crystallographers, materials modellers and application scientist by developing and integrating software across these area. These range from first-principles electronic structure predictions of the key NMR interaction tensors through to the simulation of nuclear spin interactions for direct comparison with experimental spectra. Through a flagship project the scope will be increased to cover paramagnetic systems, addressing materials for Li-ion batteries and catalysis. CCP-NC will leverage the RCUK investment in solid-state NMR infrastructure, and ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of this emerging discipline.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J010510/1","grantId":"EP/J010510/1","fundValue":"489170","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Collaborative Computational Project in NMR Crystallography (CCP-NC) supports a multidisciplinary community of NMR spectroscopists, crystallographers, materials modellers and application scientists by developing and integrating software across the area of NMR crystallography. \n\nA direct impact is to companies who use solid-state NMR in-house for characterisation of solid forms. For example, numerous the pharmaceutical companies have in-house solid-state NMR spectrometers with experienced personnel as do those in the field of catalysis.

Phys. Chem. C on the combined use of powder X-ray diffraction and solid-state NMR data in the structure determination of a pharmaceutical material, and a paper featured as a &quot;Hot Article&quot; in CrystEngComm), and a workshop on modelling of disorder co-organized by CCP5. The integrated suite of NMR-Crystallography software will be of direct interest to the scientific instrument manufactures which specialise in magnetic resonance.
