People with autism are characterised as socially withdrawn and inhibited whereas individuals with Williams syndrome are characterised by the opposite pattern, showing evidence of hypersociability and an interest in people. Little is known about the type of information retrieved from the environment by people with Williams syndrome. The project will study the patterns of eye gaze when watching both still images, where someone is looking at a particular object, and film clips depicting social interactions.&nbsp;The patterns will be compared with typically developing children and adults. </p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is the first study to use eye-tracking with people who have Williams syndrome.&nbsp;Previous eye gaze studies of those with autism have given inconsistent results due to using stimuli of differing complexity.&nbsp; It is hoped to resolve this by comparing behaviour with different types of stimuli</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2030","grantId":"RES-000-22-2030","fundValue":"81869","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Hancock","coPersons":["Deborah Michelle Riby"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
