{"id":"C76ECCF1-CE6F-48F8-A11B-E287C3E138B6","title":"Development of epidermicin NI01 for nasal decolonization","abstractText":"The World Health Organisation have stated that infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria (e.g. MRSA) are one of the greatest current threats to public health and there is an urgent need for novel antibiotics to combat drug resistant infections. We have discovered epidermicin, an exciting and important new antibiotic that rapidly kills MRSA and other bacteria. The new antibiotic is more active than current antibiotics, is non-toxic and bacteria don't develop resistance to it. These are significant advantages over current antibiotics so we plan to develop epidermicin for clinical use. People who carry MRSA in the nose have a high risk of developing infection and transmitting MRSA, so we will examine how effective epidermicin is for removing MRSA from the nose. We will also carry out experiments designed to help us to understand how epidermicin kills bacteria and why they do not become resistant and carry out work to ensure that the antibiotic is not toxic when used clinically.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021474/1","grantId":"BB/J021474/1","fundValue":"132497","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mathew  Upton","coPersons":["Peter Andrew Warn","Jeremy Paul  Derrick"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" Demonstrated in a relevant model that epidermicin is better than the current therapy for preventing infection with methicillin resistant S aureus (MRSA), on of the most important pathogens seen in healthcare settings.\nDetermined the structure of epidermicin.\nIdentified novel data that supported submission (March 2014) of a second patent application protecting the technology being developed.
