Their potential to elucidate the timing and impacts of abrupt climate changes and millennial-scale climate variability prior to the Holocene has been little exploited, however. In a recent review of vegetation records of millennial-scale variability during the last glacial (73,500 - 14,700 calendar years ago, 73.4-14.7 ka BP), the paucity of records from North African Mediterranean borderlands was identified as a major limitation to the understanding of spatial variability in past climate dynamics associated with abrupt climate events evident in marine and ice core records (Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich variability). Research from the Alboran Sea raises several questions regarding the phasing of climate variability between the mountains of Northwest Africa and southwestern Europe, in particular regarding moisture availability during high-latitude cooling events, with important implications for the understanding of past air mass trajectories in the subtropics. New data are required to resolve the nature of the hydrological regime and the role of fire during abrupt climate events. This project will undertake high-resolution palaeoecological investigation of new deep-lake cores retrieved from Middle Atlas lakes. The coring mission, fully funded by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft), is scheduled for September 2012. In this project, analysis of vegetation change and fire regime will be undertaken at centennial-scale resolution, supported by the development of a robust AMS radiocarbon chronological framework, in the framework of an international collaborative approach incorporating sedimentological, palaeolimnological, palaeohydrological and geochemical investigation. This project will advance the understanding of climate-vegetation-fire interactions in the Mediterranean region and the sensitivity of montane ecosystems to abrupt climate forcing. It will also contribute to the understanding of climate dynamics, notably air mass movements and hydrological regime, in the region of Atlantic-Mediterranean-Saharan climatological interaction.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K000608/1","grantId":"NE/K000608/1","fundValue":"65301","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  As a New Investigator Award that finished within the last 4 months, it is only possible to present an incipient narrative impact around the research that has been initiated through the Award. However, key steps have been taken in line with proposed Pathways to Impact, notably in terms of achieving membership of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management, disseminating information about the project via publication in the foremost global dissemination resource (International Innovation), engaging with the local to regional public via activity sessions organised as part of Manchester Science Festival at the Manchester Museum, and working with a local artist to create sculptures for educational activities such as the Science Festival. The activities at the Manchester Museum were very well received by the public and the Museum has invited further activity sessions in 2015. The NERC award can be understood to have planted the seeds of an impact case relating to public engagement in research and enrichment of cultural life in the Manchester area. Efforts to sustain and develop this case will be actively pursued over the next 1-3 years.

Successful recovery of new, high-quality, deep-lake sediment cores spanning the last 25,000 years from the Middle Atlas in the framework of a co-funded NERC and DFG (German Science Foundation) underpins the findings. Specifically, by significantly enhancing temporal resolution of the new palaeoecological records, my research has provided the first evidence of impacts of early Holocene climate anomalies, such as the North Atlantic cooling episodes at 8200 and 10300 years ago, on terrestrial ecosystems and fire regime in Northwest Africa on sub-centennial timescales. Compared with previous research in this geographical and thematic context, the research has taken robust steps to improve chronological uncertainties about the timing of key events. In particular, this necessitated the novel application of AMS radiocarbon dating to pollen concentrates from lake sediments. This approach has been possible through cooperation with the NERC Radiocarbon Facility at East Kilbride, and three Radiocarbon Dating Awards. The research provides critical insights into the climatic sensitivity and resilience of the emblematic Atlantic cedar (Cedrus atlantica) forests of the Middle Atlas, with important consequences for the understanding of this species' fragility in the face of current global change. \nThe New Investigator Award has cemented a multilateral international partnership between the Universities of Manchester, Leipzig and Potsdam, as well as collaborations with Moroccan scientists. The findings of the research have been communicated at five international conferences in 2013-2014 including both interdisciplinary congresses and specialist meetings in the USA, Europe and Africa. Two manuscripts in advanced stages of development will lead to the first publication of the findings (submission, January 2015). The research has enabled the PI to establish an active research group at Manchester including two funded PhD students. The findings of the research will be of value to the wide multidisciplinary academic community engaged in the study of palaeoclimates and palaeoenvironments. Specifically, the findings relating to rapid climate events during the early Holocene will be of value to forthcoming climate modelling efforts to understand the nature, scale, spatial patterns and drivers of change for these events. Links with the climate modelling community engaged in this activity have been successfully made, for example through participation in the INTIMATE EU COST Action. \nThe novel application of pollen concentrate dating has received significant interest following the conference presentations, and the method will be put to use by other researchers, particularly working in dryland and mountain environments where traditional methods may not be applicable.\nBeyond academia, the information on long-term vegetation history and sensitivity to climate changes will be of value to present-day ecologists and of significance for informing conservation and management practice of cedar forests in the Atlas region. Steps have been taken to facilitate the transfer of knowledge in this direction, specifically by establishing a partnership with the ecology unit at Moulay-Ismail University (Meknes) and membership of the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management (Mediterranean Ecosystems).
