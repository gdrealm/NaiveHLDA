Concerns over CO2 emissions and associated climate change impacts are also spurring technology efforts in order to make hybrid and electric vehicles widely available. Energy storage is a key issue that needs to be addressed within both these scenarios and supercapacitors will play a vital role.To meet future energy demands new generation supercapacitors must increase their energy densities at least two-fold over current commercially available devices, while maintaining response times of less than one second. They must also be low cost.We will use hard templating and novel microwave assisted synthesis routes to create structured electrode materials based on TMNs, addressing the key electrode features for supporting good electronic conductivity, good electrolyte mobility and plenty of surface area to increase the total charge-storage capabilities of the supercapacitor. State-of-the-art electron microscopy techniques will enable us to establish the critical link between material structure and performance.The success of this project will initiate a step-change in current research directions, basing new developments on high performing, low cost materials. These developments will see supercapacitors supporting upcoming technological developments including use in hybrid-electric vehicles, new portable electronic devices and in delivery grid systems which are supported by renewable energy sources.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I029370/1","grantId":"EP/I029370/1","fundValue":"102165","fundStart":"2011-06-21","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicole Kathleen Van Der Laak","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
