We seek to understand the underlying nature of the physical universe in terms of fundamental forces and particles. This knowledge underpins our quest to answer some of the biggest questions in science, such as how our universe originated and evolved from the Big Bang.\n\nExperiments capable of reaching these extremes of energy &amp; size are very technically demanding. The challenges include devising precision detectors which can operate in hostile environments, particle accelerators which can collide beams at very high energies, super-sensitive detectors capable of identifying very rare decays, high-speed electronics which can read out millions of pieces of information per second &amp; software which can analyse petabytes of data in a distributed fashion. Particle physics thereby stimulates a variety of important technological developments.\n\nThis is a &quot;consolidated grant&quot;, underpinning the base of highly skilled research &amp; technical staff which allows UCL to lead projects at the very highest levels. It provides the support that allows the group to effectively train PhD students &amp; young post-doctoral researchers. The science this grant will support includes:\n\n- Understanding the mechanism that gives particles mass by searching for new fundamental particles such as the Higgs boson with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. In the event of such a discovery, measuring the properties of the Higgs boson will be critical. Cross checking with precision measurements from the Tevatron collider will allow a powerful consistency check of the standard model of particle physics.\n\n- Understanding why we live in a universe that is dominated by matter with only a tiny anti-matter component, in contrast to the conditions immediately following the Big Bang. We will study in detail the properties of the neutrino, which is a stable, uncharged, almost massless particle released in radioactive beta decays. The neutrino is being studied with the MINOS experiment. UCL is also completing the construction of the SuperNEMO experiment, which will search for the incredibly rare process whereby two simultaneous beta-decays occur inside the nucleus. Examining such decays will yield fundamental insights into the nature of the neutrino.\n\n- Searching for phenomena at extremely high energies, well beyond the reach of man-made accelerators like the LHC. We are searching for the interactions of ultra-high energy neutrinos in the Antarctic ice using the ANITA experiment &amp; we are preparing for experiments that will search for the exceedingly rare process whereby a muon (a heavier version of the electron) spontaneously converts into an electron.\n\n- Developing new accelerator and detector technologies for future experiments. We need to build higher energy colliders, and giant detectors able to detect neutrino beams fired over large distances, as well as 10-times larger underground detectors to continue the search for rare processes. These crucial science goals require the realisation of new detectors with unprecedented performance and which can be scaled-up effectively and affordably.\n\n- Sharing the results of our work with other scientists and industry. Our accelerator and radiation measurement expertise can be applied to the fields of nuclear medicine and security. We also cooperate with instrument manufacturers in order to develop better products for our own research and for other scientific and industrial users.\n\nSome of this work is funded on other grants but is underpinned by the technical expertise that is supported by this consolidated grant. Continuity &amp; support for the technical base in the UCL High Energy Physics Group is vital to progress the science &amp; the benefits that it brings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K001426/1","grantId":"ST/K001426/1","fundValue":"4340020","fundStart":"2012-10-19","fundEnd":"2016-10-18","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David Simon Waters","coPersons":["Jonathan Mark Butterworth","Mark Andrew Lancaster","Gavin  Hesketh","Ruben  Saakyan","Emily Laura Nurse","Ryan James Nichol","Simon  Jolly","Mario  Campanelli","Jennifer Anne Thomas","Nikolaos  Konstantinidis","Chamkaur  Ghag","Matthew  Wing"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
