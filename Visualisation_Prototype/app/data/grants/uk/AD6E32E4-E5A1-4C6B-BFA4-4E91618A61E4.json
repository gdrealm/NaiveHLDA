The technical develop will involve optimized design, outsourced commercial device prototype fabrication and control hardware and software development. It is anticipated that commercial consultants will be employed to carry out market survey and targeted marketing activities in tandem with Cambridge Enterprise.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D503574/1","grantId":"EP/D503574/1","fundValue":"61331","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The technology has been used in TSB projects (with Oclaro) and an EU ERA-NET+ project with Oclaro and Adva.

The laser was then demonstrated in a WDM-PON access system in collaboration with industrial partners Oclaro and Adva Athermal lasers could be useful in low cost WDM networks. The TUCAN project is looking at athermal WDM lasers in WDM-PON CPEs. A patent was filed.
