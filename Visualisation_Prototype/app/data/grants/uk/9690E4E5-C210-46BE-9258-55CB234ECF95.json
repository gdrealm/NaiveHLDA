{"id":"9690E4E5-C210-46BE-9258-55CB234ECF95","title":"An Interactive and Intuitive Object Deformation Framework for Interactive Multimedia Applications","abstractText":"Object deformation is an important aspect of Interactive Multimedia Applications (IMAs) that are prevalent over a number of different applications, such as product and engineering design, facial animation in MPEG-4, medical simulation and computer gaming. In such applications, users may interact with and manipulate deformable objects while expecting to receive interactive responses. However, because processing deformable objects is time consuming and computationally expensive, rigid (i.e. non-deformable) objects are still being used in place of deformable objects in many existing applications. This reduces both the level of realism and the expressive power in an application.There are two critical issues to address involving object deformation in IMAs. First, object deformation requires the management and evaluation of both the shape changes and the constraint settings over a number of domain spaces, such as geometric space and motion space. These are large in terms of data size and complexity. Second, an object can be deformed provided that certain constraints and manipulators have been set up, which may have very different natures and be difficult to specify.The research in this proposal will develop a new object deformation framework, which will comprise of a set of new techniques to give an improved object deformation performance and quality over existing techniques and to offer a novel interface to allow deformation constraints and manipulators to be specified in an intuitive manner.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G009635/1","grantId":"EP/G009635/1","fundValue":"101535","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our skeletonization method was applied by some researchers to support model reconstruction.

Our investigation provides an understanding of how different forms of deformation information can be consolidated and processed in an efficient way to support interactive and high quality object deformation. Particularly, we have developed skeleton generation methods, in which a generated skeleton will form a manipulator to support interactive 3D model deformation. We have also developed techniques for identifying important features on 3D models, which offers indicators to help support quality preservation for deformable objects. The main research outputs were published in the forms of journal and conference papers, and that others can pick up our findings and develop something on of of them easily.
