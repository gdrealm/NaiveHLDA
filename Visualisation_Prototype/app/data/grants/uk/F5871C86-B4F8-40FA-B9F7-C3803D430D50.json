It will assess the historical development of this mixed speech variety, its connections with other varieties of Romani, its structural composition, and its role as a marker of group identity. The project will also assess ongoing attempts at language revitalisation within the community, triggered by social changes and not least by the impact of encounters with Roms from other countries, among them recent immigrants to the UK. The descriptive compilation of English Romani lexicon will support educational activities within the Romani community.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1495","grantId":"RES-000-23-1495","fundValue":"131424","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Yaron  Matras","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
