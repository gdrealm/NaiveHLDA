{"id":"AFA72FFD-F4E3-471A-92D4-79370CA3433F","title":"Exploring the movement of people from different ethnic groups into or out of wards with high or low density of their own ethnic group","abstractText":"<p>Little research has been conducted on how internal migration of different ethnic groups, in and out of areas, contributes to population patterns. Research that has explored migration by ethnicity has compared ‘white’ with ‘non-white’ people to discuss patterns of segregation, ethnic concentration and majority population ‘ghettos’ or ‘enclaves’. However, it is likely that there will be variations within the minority ethnic group that will offer important insights to these debates. This research will explore patterns of residential migration within different ethnic groups within England and Wales. Specifically, whether there is a tendency for people from different ethnic groups to move into or out of areas where their own ethnic group has a high or low density. These research questions will be explored through secondary analysis of the 2001 census using a specially commissioned table containing information about migration and ethnicity. Inflows and outflows of individual ethnic groups (as defined by the 2001 census) will be separately measured at the ward level (to assess local level migration). Patterns will be mapped using GIS software. This detailed analysis will help to establish if patterns of internal migration for different ethnic groups are related to the densities of their own and other groups.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F00351X/1","grantId":"ES/F00351X/1","fundValue":"49365","fundStart":"2007-11-12","fundEnd":"2008-11-11","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Antonia  Simon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
