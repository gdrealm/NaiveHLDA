Recent research suggests that the formation of iron mineral deposits and the aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide could be intimately linked with the development of the disease. Further, the development of magnetic iron minerals may help to provide early diagnosis due to their affect on magnetic resonance images (MRI). The project will build on some recent successful experiments performed by the applicants at the Swiss Light Source and Canadian Light Source facilities, and will utilise the strong track record of the applicants in the application of synchrotron techniques to the analysis of magnetic materials and biominerals. As the facilities required for these experiments do not yet exist within the UK, funding is requested for overseas travel for the principle investigator. This will enable him to perform further experiments, build collaborations with scientists at international synchrotron laboratories, and provide crucial on-site training for a PhD student involved in the project. Further to this, the expertise and technical achievements attained in the project could be translated to planned facilities that will become available at the Diamond Light Source laboratory in the next 3-4 years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K00252X/1","grantId":"EP/K00252X/1","fundValue":"15762","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  In addition to academic impact we have produced on-line research articles for the general public, and have interacted with the media to disseminate the results as widely as possible.

In particular we have shown the following: (i) that the amyloid-beta peptide can reduce biologically relevant iron (III) minerals including ferrihydrite, forming pure Fe(II) minerals and magnetite; (ii) that similar reduced iron minerals exist in transgenic mouse cortical tissue that are associated with regions of disease pathology such as amyloid plaques, and (iii) that regions of amyloid-beta and iron are correlated at the nanoscale level and that plaque regions appear to contain a composite iron-amyloid material. These results have led to the publication of two journal papers, the submission of a further journal paper, and additional magazine/on-line articles and media work. \n\nAs part of this project we successfully translated x-ray synchrotron techniques from the realm of materials physics to biomedical research areas. This would not have been possible without access to overseas SXM facilities at the Canadian Light Source and the Swiss Light Source. The success of our work has also now led to the award of facilities time at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, USA), where our proposal scored in the top 2% of all submissions. These ongoing experiments will develop further the techniques in order to explore human tissue samples. Further to this, we have established a significant new collaboration with facilities staff at the new SXM beamline at the Diamond Light source, thus bringing the expertise we have gained through international collaboration, home to the UK. We have also recently performed some of the first commissioning experiments on the new Diamond beamline (I08), and have ongoing experiments planned there in the coming year.\n\nOur results have opened up new avenues of research by suggesting that the role of iron in Alzheimer's disease pathology may be far more significant than originally thought. Further, our in vitro studies have revealed possible mechanisms for the production of the reduced iron minerals found in Alzheimer's tissue. Further work will look at possible targets for amyloid reduction, such as the dysregulation of the ferritin protein. In addition to journal publications, the EPSRC overseas travel grant significantly contributed to the PhD training of a student, James Everett, who has now passed his PhD and has submitted a Fellowship application to the Alzheimer's Society, pursing some of the themes discussed above. We believe the results from this project could lead to a step change in current thinking of how iron is linked to AD and other related neurodegenerative disorders. Our findings will thus be of great interest to researchers working on the origins, treatment and MRI imaging of these conditions. Further, the application of the x-ray techniques to new areas such as biomedicine and disease pathology will find a wide audience, whilst the aspects of our work concerning iron biomineralisation are likely to be of particular interest to microbiologists.
