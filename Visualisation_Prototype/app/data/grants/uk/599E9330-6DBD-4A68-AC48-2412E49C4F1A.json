A novel molecule has been designed that binds to the cell membranes of the kidney and reduces the inflammatory response after transplantation. This should result in a shorter hospital stay for the patient and a reduced need for dialysis after transplantation. There is also good evidence that improving the initial function of a kidney can improve longterm fuction, thus improving the outcome for the patient. This would also increase the number of kidneys available for transplanation to those on the waiting list.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001197","grantId":"G1001197","fundValue":"2365690","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven H Sacks","coPersons":["Richard Anthony Smith","Martin  Drage"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
