However students make varied progress in languages, and the causes of this variation are not well understood.\n\nThis project tracked 56 UK undergraduates spending a year abroad in France, Spain or Mexico as part of their degree in languages. Some attended university, while others taught English, or undertook workplace internships. The study documented students' learning of French and Spanish before, during and after the stay abroad, plus language use patterns and evolving social networks whilst abroad. A specially developed suite of language tests, questionnaires and interviews was administered on 6 occasions; selected participants were also 'shadowed' during various social experiences abroad.\n\nThe project found that all students accessed rich target language input while abroad, and their language skills developed well in general, though with some (expected) variation between individuals. Their personal confidence and problem solving skills also increased. However, despite making academic and professional connections, many did not make close local friends, especially when living with other international students. The pervasiveness of English in international higher education was evident, with all students leading bilingual lives to varying degrees, and sometimes struggling to speak French or Spanish rather than English. The easy availability of virtual media meant frequent contact with home social networks, so that any straightforward home/abroad distinction was outdated. The project breaks new ground in showing how these social factors influenced the language learning of individuals in complex ways and how study/ residence abroad can no longer be viewed as a linguistic, cultural, or social &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;immersion&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; experience. Instead, it must be understood as a multilingual and intercultural experience and students undertaking residence abroad will require new forms of support and guidance to achieve their personal goals (including language learning goals). Findings are being taken forward in three ways. Firstly, they are being interpreted by the original LANGSNAP team to contribute to new theorisations of second language acquisition, as a multilingually grounded and socially/ contextually embedded process (Ortega, 2014). Secondly, advanced learner corpora for Spanish and French of 300+k words each have been created and are being made available to other researchers through the LANGSNAP website at www.langsnap.soton.ac.uk . Thirdly, the findings will form the basis of new research-informed guidance materials for study abroad programme managers and participants. These distinctive materials will have the following aims: \no Support participants' social insertion in both international and local networks abroad;\no Promote participants' social engagement and social contribution while abroad;\no Develop participants' intercultural awareness and capacity to reflect in a relativistic way on social conditions at home and abroad, and interrelations among these;\no Develop participants' research skills relevant to understanding and interpretation of contemporary culture(s) abroad and at home;\no Develop language learning strategies (including internet based practices) appropriate for mulitilingual conditions\nThe materials will be developed and trialled in collaboration with professional partners in France, Spain and selected Anglophone countries (UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland).
