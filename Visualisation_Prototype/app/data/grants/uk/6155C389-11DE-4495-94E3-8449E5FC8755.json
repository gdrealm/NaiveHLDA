In some cases it is too time consuming, difficult or dangerous to take samples to analyse e.g. inside furnaces for power generation or industrial processes, monitoring air pollution, detecting leaks or poisonous gases. Remote sensing methods use the fact that gases absorb only certain precise wavelengths of light, absorption lines, giving a fingerprint of each molecule. A diode laser can be used to measure the absorption as the wavelength is varied, or tuned, across one absorption line. Most diode lasers emit only one wavelength which can be tuned over only a narrow range that is usually much less than the separation between lines of different molecules. To detect more lines or more species simultaneously we need a separate laser and detector for each line. This then becomes complicated and expensive. Some lasers however emit many wavelengths, each such that an integer number of half-wavelengths fit into the length of the laser. These modes give a regular pattern of spectral lines covering a wide range and, by tuning over the space between each mode, the whole range can be covered by a single laser. Such a multi-mode laser behaves like many separate lasers but with only one beam. So many lines or molecules can be detected when particular modes are absorbed. This Multi-Mode Absorption Spectroscopy , MUMAS has the great advantage that many spectral lines or several molecules can be detected simultaneously using only one laser and one detector. This could make a compact, cheap and reliable remote multi-species sensing system for monitoring and active control applications. The research proposed will develop micro-cavity lasers to emit multi-mode laser light in the infra-red. A very short (micro) cavity has a large separation between the wavelengths of the modes so can distinguish separate absorption lines and cover a wide range at the same time. Since most molecules absorb infra-red wavelengths it is important to make these lasers emit in this spectral range. Secondly the research will address the major problem that trace gases, at low concentrations, absorb only a tiny fraction of the light. So it can be hard to tell the difference between a small dip in the intensity caused by absorption - the signal, and a dip due to the random fluctuations of the laser intensity or the detector - noise. One way to improve the signal-to-noise ratio is to make the signal vary at a regular frequency by modulating it in some way. Since the noise is spread out over all frequencies, measuring in a small range around the modulation frequency eliminates most of the noise but keeps most of the signal. This can be done by modulating the wavelength of the laser over a small range at high frequency while, at a slower rate, scanning the centre wavelength across the spectrum. This wavelength modulation spectroscopy WMS allows gases at levels of one part per million to be detected. The primary research will test the technique of infra-red MUMAS by detecting simultaneously CO and CO2. The ratio of these two gases is one indicator of the completeness of combustion e.g. in coal or gas-fired power stations and automobile engines. Rapid monitoring of the combustion process is essential for active control to optimize performance for fuel economy and reduced emissions. This will be a test bed for applications in other industrial process control. The next stage will detect other species important in exhaust gases, waste incineration, atmospheric monitoring, e.g. H2O, NH3 CH4 and other hydrocarbons. The MUMAS fingerprint also allows temperature and pressure to be measured remotely. MUMAS has potential for a new type of sensor in engineering and control applications such as combustion engines, waste incineration, atmospheric and industrial process monitoring, and possibly also medical diagnostics using breath analysis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G035903/1","grantId":"EP/G035903/1","fundValue":"411081","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Ewart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" The main results of the work are summarized below with reference to the original objectives of the project. The overall aim of the work was to demonstrate true multi-species detection using MUMAS and this was successfully achieved.\n\n\n\nObjective 1. Develop multi-mode micro-cavity lasers based on diode-laser pumped Er:Yb:glass with powers of the order of 10 mW and mode linewidths between 10 - 100 MHz. \n\n\n\nObjective achieved: a compact, multi-mode device has been developed providing up to 30 mW output with mode line-widths of &lt;5MHz tunable in the range 1.54 - 1.6 micron. This output is well-suited to amplification, if necessary, in Er-doped fiber amplifiers.\n\n\n\nObjective 2. Demonstrate multi-species detection by simultaneous detection of CO and CO2 around 1.56 micron and extend the method to other species such as H2O, CH4 etc. Other parameters e.g. temperature and pressure will also be simultaneously measured.\n\n\n\nObjective achieved: CO and CO2 have been simultaneously detected by MUMAS using a single laser and single detector. The ratio of CO:CO2 has been measured in calibrated gas mixtures with an uncertainty of less than 0.4%. In addition, extension to other species and multiple species detection has been demonstrated by detecting and measuring CO, C2H2 and N2O in a gas containing all three species. In the same process, temperature and pressure information is also available from the data.\n\n\n\nObjective 3. Apply Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopic WMS techniques to lower the detection limit to ppm levels. Specifically to determine the optimum practical modulation frequencies and wavelength scan rate to minimize integration times for ppm detection.\n\n\n\nObjective achieved: WMS methods were applied to MUMAS of O2 using a modulated diode laser resulting in improvements in detection sensitivity to the ppm level. In addition, simultaneous application of WMS and cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) was demonstrated leading to further improvements in detection sensivity. More recently WMS method was applied to near IR-MUMAS of CO by modulating the cavity length of an Er:Yb:glass microlaser at 1KHz during the MUMAS scan at 1 Hz.\n\n\n\nObjective 4. Extend existing MUMAS modelling procedures to analyse MUMAS signatures generated using wavelength modulation. \n\n\n\nObjective achieved: Modelling programs were developed to simulate WMS-MUMAS spectra in both the derivative limit and beyond.\n\n\n\nObjective 5. Develop a transportable instrument based on MUMAS for multi-species detection.\n\n\n\nObjective achieved: A prototype system for CO/CO2 detection was built and transported to the Engineering Science laboratory in Oxford and used to measure CO/CO2 ratios in the exhaust of a running SI engine. The ratio of CO:CO2 was measured in calibrated gas mixtures with an uncertainty of less than 0.4% and the ratio in the engine exhaust gas was measured with similar precision. Absolute partial pressures of the two gases were measured to an uncertainty of 2 - 4%. The principle of multi-species sensing using MUMAS having been demonstrated and also its application to a practical device - SI engine exhaust, the technology has been shown to have potential for other industrial and environmental applications for detection and/or measurement of multiple gas species for process control or monitoring. A collaborative relationship is now being developed with Johnson Matthey and gas sensor manufacturers with a view to developing multi-gas sensors for applications in industrial process technology.
