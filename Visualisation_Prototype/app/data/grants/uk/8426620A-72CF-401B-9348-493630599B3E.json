{"id":"8426620A-72CF-401B-9348-493630599B3E","title":"New Catalytic Reactions for Organic Synthesis","abstractText":"This proposal seeks to develop a new and more efficient way to prepare complex organic molecules. Our efforts will focus on the production of new catalysts for organic reactions, especially oxidation reactions. The development of new catalytic reactions is important to chemical industry as well as academia because it enables valuable organic compounds to be prepared quickly and efficiently with minimisation of cost and waste produced.The reactions that we seek to improve currently rely on the use of a large excess of chlorinating agent and, by using our new reagents, we are able to completely remove this requirement. This is clearly a big improvement on exisiting technology (ie a new and 'greener' way of making compounds), and will have significant ramifications for the use of new oxidising reactions, especially on a large scale.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D076560/1","grantId":"EP/D076560/1","fundValue":"123621","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  In the efficient synthesis of complex molecules with bioactivity Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Economic","person":"Timothy  Donohoe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" New efficient routes to complex molecules using new oxidation catalysts Synthesis of molecules of interest and use especially in pharma.
