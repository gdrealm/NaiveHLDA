{"id":"CD0F95FA-679D-471A-B954-D0528ADD9999","title":"The Integration and Interaction of Multiple Mathematical Reasoning Processes","abstractText":"The proposed Platform Grant renewal will be used to provide essential \ninfrastructure and exploratory activities that will support a portfolio of \nprojects that focus on the automation of mathematical reasoning processes, \nincluding their analysis, development and interaction. We can be broadly \nclassified by our &quot;holistic&quot; perspective of automated reasoning. Central to \nthis theme is the interplay between representation and reasoning. Discovering \nthe &quot;right&quot; representation can often dramatically simplify the reasoning \nrequired in solving a problem. Conversely, meta-level reasoning, and in \nparticular proof-failure analysis, can often provide guidance in evolving \nthe &quot;right&quot; representation. \n\nThe renewal of the Platform Grant will enable us to maintain and strengthen the momentum\nthat has been build up around this theme -- both in terms of basic research as\nwell as applications: The former covers a spectrum of topics, including:\ncognitive aspects of theory formulation and reformulation; \nmathematical discovery and automatic theorem generation; ontology creation,\nrepair and evolution; proof procedures; proof planning; AI problem reformulation;\nquantum computation; computational creativity; visualisation of reasoning processes. \nThe latter covers wide ranging applications such as: software verification; formal\nmodelling of software intensive systems; graphics design; games design; \ndisaster recovery planning. \n\nOur work is a unique blend of the techniques of artificial intelligence \nand theoretical computer science -- we also believe we are unique in our\nholistic perspective of automated reasoning and mathematical discovery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J001058/1","grantId":"EP/J001058/1","fundValue":"1140290","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Ireland","coPersons":["Jacques  Fleuriot","Simon  Colton","Jeremy  Gow","Paul Bernard Jackson","David  Aspinall","Gudmund  Grov","Fiona  McNeill","Alan  Smaill","Greg  Michaelson","Alan  Bundy"],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
