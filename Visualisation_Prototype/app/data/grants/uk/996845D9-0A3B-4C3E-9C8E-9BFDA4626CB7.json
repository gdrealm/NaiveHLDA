For example, we may be unconcerned about a very painful toothache that we had in the past, but go out of our way to avoid even a mild toothache in the future. Philosophers have debated whether the fact that we are biased toward the future is irrational or incoherent, or is best explained in evolutionary terms (e.g., as allowing us to prepare effectively for what is to come). However, this bias is not merely a philosophical curiosity, but one that is likely to have a surprising impact on our everyday judgments: e.g., the findings of psychological research imply that if someone is deciding what to charge for their work, all other things being equal s/he will charge less for work s/he has already completed than for work s/he has yet to carry out. This is because we seem to value events in the future more than in the past. To give another example, if we are deciding how much someone should be punished for doing something wrong, we are likely to think more punishment is appropriate if the wrongdoing lies in the future than the past. We see future acts as more deserving of praise and blame, and more deliberate, than similar past acts. Moreover, events in the future feel closer in time than events an equivalent distance in the past: two weeks before Christmas, it seems to be very close, whereas two weeks after Christmas the holiday may feel as though it is in the distant past. \n\nThese phenomena can be described collectively as temporal asymmetries in judgments, and have been interpreted as being part of a more general bias toward the future. Researchers point to the fact that we spend more time thinking about the future than the past, and that we represent ourselves as moving toward the future and away from the past, as further evidence for such a bias. However, there are reasons to believe that this bias may not be present in young children and may only emerge with development. \n\nThe aim of this project is to examine the development of these types of temporal asymmetries in children and adolescents. Studying these effects in children will provide a new way of exploring the issue of whether younger people are less future-oriented than adults. Moreover, it will provide a unique way of testing some claims about why temporal asymmetries occur. Building on initial pilot studies, the project will explore when children first seem to value future events more than the past, judge that future events seem closer in time than past events, feel more emotion when considering the future versus the past, and judge that future actions are more deserving of praise or blame than past actions. It will also examine whether all of the asymmetries are present from the same age or whether differences in emotions felt when thinking about the past versus the future appear first and can explain other asymmetries. Furthermore, it will explore whether there are developmental changes in other aspects of thinking that have been taken to be indicative of a temporal bias: the amount of time spent thinking about the future versus the past and the tendency to represent ourselves as moving toward the future and away from the past. It will examine whether such changes go hand-in-hand with the emergence of temporal asymmetries. These studies will be the first to be conducted with children and will provide a new body of evidence about fundamental changes in children's thinking; moreover studying temporal asymmetries in a developmental context will help us to explain why these phenomena occur.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N000900/1","grantId":"ES/N000900/1","fundValue":"210291","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Teresa  McCormack","coPersons":["Eugene  Caruso"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
