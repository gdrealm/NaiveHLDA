Offline analysis of coil-end samples is slow, destructive and does not allow monitoring and control of material properties throughout a production run. Research at the University of Manchester has resulted in the development of a new non-contact system (ROMA), exploiting a novel multi-frequency electromagnetic technique to monitor material microstructure during forced cooling. An important benefit is that it can measure from 0-100% transformation. This collaboration will transfer knowledge to Siemens and enable commercial exploitation by reference-site installation on the Tata Steel hot-strip mill at Port Talbot.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J50080X/1","grantId":"EP/J50080X/1","fundValue":"87508","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The principal aim of this project was to take electromagnetic inspection of steel microstructure to full commercialisation. This was achieved by extending the capabilities of the existing system by designing and constructing a multi-sensor operational unit for installation onto a full-scale steel plant, the hot-strip mill at Tata Steel's Port Talbot plant.\n\nA second sensors has subsequent been fitted to the IJmuiden hot strip mill and plans are in place to extend this to an array of sensors, with the aim that this will be a reference site for future commercialisation.
