Drug treatment is available for human disease but it takes six months, which is impractical in developing world settings where TB is most common. Consequent non-compliance with treatment regimes leads to the emergence of drug-resistance. This is now a major world-wide problem with practically incurable 'extreme drug-resistant' strains appearing in many countries, including the UK. Treatment would be much more effective if treatment regimes could be shortened. The principle reason why treatment regimes have to be so prolonged is that that a sub-population of cells in lesions are relatively tolerant to the antibiotic, a phenomenon termed phenotypic tolerance or non-inherited antibiotic resistance. The mechanism of phenotypic tolerance is currently unknown but we have recently discovered that it is associated with slow growth in M. tuberculosis. We have recently shown, through theoretical studies, that random variations of growth rate in individual bacteria cells may the mechanisms for generating persisters. This project is to investigate this hypothesis in an experimental system. The results will provide a new understanding of the mechanistic basis of phenotypic tolerance that is likely to provide new targets and opportunities to interfere with the resistance mechanisms and thereby increase efficacy of TB treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J002097/1","grantId":"BB/J002097/1","fundValue":"622845","fundStart":"2012-03-05","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The grant is still ongoing and we have not yet published our findings but several papers are currently in preparation that we expect to generate signifgicant outcomes.\nHowever we have presented our work at several meetings that have stimulated other researchers to investigate the phenomena we decribed.\nHowever, the project stimulated us to write and edit the book, 'Systems Biology of Mycobacteria' published by Springer in 2013.

Generation of a promoter probe library constructed and analysed: We have constructed and analysed a set of promoters which constitutively express the gene of choice at a range of levels. The Mycobacterial PL5 promoter was mutated using 8-oxo-dGTP and dPTP-PCR-mutation (as described in Zaccalo et al.,1996) to create a library of mutated promoters. Following vector cloning upstream of GFP, we screened over 60 mutated promoters for differential expression using GFP fluorescence (485/535nm). This has also been carried out successfully in M. bovis BCG and we are currently analysing strains where growth rate is controlled using our developed promoters and the TBLeuD gene in Mycobacterial LeuD mutants. \n2. Single cell measurements: We have further developed out microfluidics platform to enable us to continuously monitor a large number of individual bacteria over an extended time period. Bacterial cells are immobilised against the bottom surface of the device and the plate is sealed using a pneumatic manifold which also allows user control of media administration. We have recorded growth rate in individual cells for up to 6 generations and have developed object tracking with M. smegmatis cells during the initial growth phase. This can track the complete history of each cell despite the &quot;jumping&quot; motion of Mycobacterial cells upon division. \nAfter recording the growth rate in individual cells in the microfluidics device we have switched the feed to media containing appropriate antibiotics and tracked killing in single cells. Cell death has been tracked using the exclusion dye propidium iodide (535/617nm). Any surviving cells or potential persisters were allowed to recover by switching the media back to growth medium only. True persisters were noted as cells that survived antibiotic killing, regrew in the growth media and were then killed again by a second round of antibiotic administration. We have tracked such persisters in the E coli high persistence mutant hipQ and analysed the individual cell parameters. Our aim as described in the grant was to enable us to track backwards and determine the growth rate of persisting cells which we have successfully carried out in the E. coli hipQ high persistent mutant. We are currently analysing wild-type cell for comparison. \nMycobacterial single cell experiments have also been carried out using this system with the antibiotics streptomycin (30/50/100 ug/ml), rifampicin (25/50/100/175 ug/ml) and pyrazinamide (30 ug/ml) with varying kill times and extended recovery times to up to 2 months. Potential &quot;persisters&quot; in M. smegmatis::pL5m1::GFP (i.e. GFP under control of the mutated promoter 1) were identified following 12 hours growth and 12 hours kill time with 175 ug/ml rifampicin. Propidium iodide staining allows dead cells to be seen in red and potential &quot;persister&quot; cells are seen in green, i.e. those expressing GFP.\nWhen studying heritability of growth rate and persistence in E. coli we have recently discovered a very interesting and entirely novel phenomenon, which we call, 'phenotypic twinning. Essentially, the correlation of growth rate (doubling time) between mother and daughter cells is close to zero - there seems to be little memory of growth rate in E. coli; yet the correlation of growth rate between twin daughters is about 0.8 - twins tend to have very similar growth rate. This can be seen in the plot which represents a mother cell (growth rate about 1.3 at generation 1) dividing to yield two daughters of growth rate 1.2 and 1.7. However, when these daughters divide, each generates daughters (the granddaughters of the original mother cell) with nearly identical growth rate (the single lines emanating from each daughter is in fact two indistinguishable lines). The subsequent lineage shows many additional examples of this phenotypic twinning. \n\nWe are currently investigating the molecular mechanism behind this intriguing phenomenon.\nTo conclude, we have made significant progress in the development of the tools (e.g. microfluidic device/ object tracking/ single cell parameter analysis/ promoter library and growth rate controlled strains) necessary to characterise and analyse growth rate and antibiotic killing at the single cell level. Analysis of &quot;persister&quot; cells is continuing and will enable us to complete the remaining objectives and to determine the relationship between growth rate and antibiotic killing. When published, the results will stimulate new approaches to antibiotic killing of bacteria. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
