Parents of children with ASD also report substantially more psychological distress than other parents. Such findings have important implications for our understanding of how best to offer support to children with ASD, their families, and our understanding of the challenges faced by these families during the child's development. Problems with existing research data include that they are derived from studies of samples that are likely to be biased (eg families referred to services for support) and ASD is also associated with intellectual disability (low IQ). Intellectual disability is independently associated with child behavioural and emotional problems and also parental distress.</p>\n\n<p>Existing research has not been designed to understand whether ASD, intellectual disability, or a combination of the two is mainly responsible for existing research findings. We will address shortcomings in previous studies by carrying out secondary analysis of large-scale population-based national databases of children where it is possible to identify both ASD and intellectual disability (and their co-occurence). This will be done in two databases - the Office of National Statistics mental health surveys of British children, and the Millennium Cohort Study.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G023727/1","grantId":"ES/G023727/1","fundValue":"103123","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Hastings","coPersons":["Gillian Ann Lancaster","Eric  Emerson","Damon Mark  Berridge","Vasiliki  Totsika"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
