{"id":"C0785EF9-420E-4E1C-A01F-3CB4529A0AB7","title":"Proteomic Analysis of the Human Serum Proteome - Reading component","abstractText":"Variations in the blood proteome, i.e. the set of proteins in the blood, occur continuously, reflecting the normal function of the body as well as abnormalities in disease. The many thousands of different proteins in the blood are released from the tissues and organs as the blood continuously circulates around the body. Subtle changes in the pattern of the blood proteome occur in cancer and in other common diseases and can be used for early detection of disease. Until recently it has only been possible to detect a small proportion of these changes by using an individual test for each of the small number of known proteins. Exciting developments in proteomic technology now provide the opportunity to analyse all of the many thousands of proteins in the serum simultaneously providing a ?fingerprint? of the entire circulating proteome. This opens up great opportunities for the development of powerful screening tests based upon differences in the proteomic pattern which occur in individuals with disease and healthy individuals. The complexity of the blood serum proteome and the very low levels of the abnormal proteins create considerable obstacles in realising the potential of this technology. This project will assess the performance of cutting edge proteomic technology for screening and diagnosis utilising a unique serum bank collected from 200,000 women involved in a cancer screening programme. In Phase I, the reliability of the available techniques will be assessed. The most promising technique will be used in Phase II to identify the ?fingerprint? patterns of protein changes in common and important diseases including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, heart disease and deep vein thrombosis and to determine the accuracy of serum proteomic analysis for early detection of these diseases. In Phase III, the identity of the proteins responsible for the disease related fingerprints will be established and in Phase IV the findings will be related to genetic and proteomic factors already identified in other studies of cancer and cardiac disease. The objective is to document proteomic ?fingerprints? which can identify individuals with cancer, heart disease and other disorders sufficiently early to allow effective treatment and save lives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0301107","grantId":"G0301107","fundValue":"492429","fundStart":"2005-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rainer Karl Cramer","coPersons":["Michael  Waterfield","Alexander  Gammerman","Vladimir  Vovk","Zhiyuan  Luo","Simon  Gayther","Ian  Jacobs","John Francis Timms","Usha  Menon"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
