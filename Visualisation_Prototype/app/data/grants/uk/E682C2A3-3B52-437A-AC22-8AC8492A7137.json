In Zambia it remains a major challenge, despite legalised abortion and a favourable policy framework. This project aims to maximise the impact of research that has investigated the socio-economic costs of unsafe and safe abortion for women, their households and the Zambian health system. Using the findings from this research, the impact maximisation project will conduct dissemination activities in Zambia to engage with health professionals involved in providing or referring for abortion-related care, international NGOs involved in abortion care delivery and members of civil society and parliament, in addition to international academics and advocacy NGOs. Methods include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>development of web-based materials for women seeking information about abortion and phone-in radio shows on 'pregnancy crises'</li>\n\n <li>capacity development of journalists in reporting research on abortion</li>\n\n <li>workshops for and presentations to health professionals</li>\n\n <li>focused liaison with INGO research teams and peer-to-peer research networking events</li>\n\n <li>tailored one-to-one briefing meetings with members of civil society and Parliament</li>\n\n <li>Social Science Cafes to communicate research findings and facilitate uptake among invited audiences of policymakers, service providers and journalists.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L007827/1","grantId":"ES/L007827/1","fundValue":"84452","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  On-going Impact Maximisation Grant.\nTo date, findings and expertise are used (by us or others) to support the efforts of those in a position to directly or indirectly reduce morbidity and mortality from unsafe abortions in Zambia Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Ernestina Elizabeth Coast","coPersons":["Bornwell  Sikateyo","Juliette  Mutheu","Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu","Bellington  Vwalika","DIANA WARIRA  NJERI","Susan Fairley  Murray","Rose Ndakala Oronje"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":" Grant is not funding research.
