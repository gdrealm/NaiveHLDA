{"id":"33EEA3E8-F271-41F5-8145-836D312B0BAC","title":"Adaptive Hardware Systems with Novel Algorithmic Design and Guaranteed Resource Bounds","abstractText":"Digital processing of signals and images are frequently performed in many commercial electronic devices, including computer networks, mobile telephones and computer vision systems. A steady growth in demand for high functionality and reliability in devices such as mobile phones means that many different types of computer processors are used, from general purpose processors found in personal computers to computer chips designed to perform very specific tasks. However, at present there are no efficient design techniques that allow complex devices to be built up from a range of different computer processors. This means that current designs are often inefficient in terms of power usage and their responsiveness. Thus, a key requirement for the long-term exploitation of signal and image processing technologies lies in developing the increasingly complex processors that are required for high performance.This project addresses this need. It represents a rich inter-disciplinary collaboration between electronic engineers and computer scientists collectively aimed at overcoming fundamental challenges in high-performance computing applications. The proposed research builds on recent world-leading work in signal and image processing methods, techniques to assess the performance and complexity of computer software, and complex processor design techniques. A successful outcome to this research will allow new and efficient implementations of complex signal processing algorithms to support a diverse range of applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F030592/1","grantId":"EP/F030592/1","fundValue":"296282","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Wallace","coPersons":["Greg  Michaelson"],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":" We have developed dynamically reconfigurable hardware support for implementations of complex, dynamic signal processing algorithms. We used heterogeneous architectures to encode our algorithms, ranging from multiprocessor (Beowulf), through multicore (Pentium and Nvidia GPU) to specific Xilinx FPGA implementations.\n\n\n\nWe developed new software tools and notations capable of exploiting dynamic use of hardware through formal analyses of time and power usage, using our own language Hume. Hume is a contemporary programming language oriented to systems with strong resource bounds, based on autonomous concurrent &quot;boxes&quot; interacting across &quot;wires&quot;. Hume's design reflects the explicit separation of coordination and computation aspects of multi-process systems, which greatly eases establishing resource bounds for programs. \n\n\n\nWe produced efficient parallel implementations of demanding signal processing applications.We developed monitoring and task scheduling techniques for parallel archtitectures that exploited the synergy between the algorithms and the architectures. This included a new parallel encoding of reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of LiDAR (3D image) data that gave significant performance improvements while maintaining proven accuracy of depth image creation. This also included a system for tracking multiple human subjects in a camera network, in which cameras may or may not have overapping fields of view. These parallel implementations are important as they make it possible to perform complex algorithms in real time. Remote sensing using LiDAR data (e.g. satellite and airborne imagery)\n\nCCTV networks; tracking of mobile 'actors' and detection of anomalies.\n\nSensor data processing for mobile vehicles (e.g. for autonomy or driver assistance). The development of domain specific programming languages, particularly if supplemented by reliable analysis of complexity, has generic exploitation. We have subsequently received approval to commence a new EPSRC project, EP/K009931/1, entitled Programmable embedded platforms for remote and compute intensive image processing applications, which has explicit support from Xilinx, Thales, Capna and Andor which examines potential development and exploitation in applications concerned with medical image analysis and mobile vehicle situational awareness.\n\nWe are working with a number or industrial concerns on the use of LiDAR data. This inlcudes subsequent work with the University of Edinburgh on multispectral LiDAR analysis of forest canopy data as a driver for monitoring climate change. We constructed a demonstrator using funding from CEOI/Astrium showing how our processing stratgey recovers the necessary structural and photochemical data. We have also worked with Selex Galileo on the dvelopment of algoirthms for photon counting LiDAR systems for future remote classification using 3D data.\n\nIn a subsequent EU project (www.locobot.eu), we have been using the adaptive hardware accelerated algorithms for CCTV tracking of human subjects, augmented by gesture recognition, to develop a robot helper for workers at the Audi factory in Ingolstadt.
