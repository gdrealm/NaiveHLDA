This keen insight captures a profound truth about the traditional divide between scientific disciplines. Traditionally mathematics and computing have been powerful allies in the elucidation of the problems of physics but while effective in biology they are not so widely used. For most of modern history the complexity in living systems has not been routinely unapproachable with mathematics and computing - either too little biology was well enough described, the appropriate maths tools did not exist or the performance of computers was too slow. This has all changed recently and now it is time to take maximum advantage. While the BBSRC and other agencies in the UK and institutions around the world have made great investments in specialist research centres it is now time to mobilise the larger mass of UK bioscientists. Biologists of all disciplines, working from the scale of atoms and molecules to that of living ecosystems, must make their contribution and provide their hard-won biological insight to complement the efforts of mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists and engineers who are already exploring the new territory in the emerging discipline of systems biology. To be effective biologists must learn to speak the common language of the physical and engineering science - applied mathematics and computing. They must learn to apply their skills without hesitation and to engage with the other scientific disciplines enthusiastically - SysMIC will start to make this possible. The SysMIC project's over riding aim is to enable rapid and effective 'up-skilling' of a large body of biologists and to accelerate their entry into systems biology and drive the successful study and manipulation of complex biological systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I014837/1","grantId":"BB/I014837/1","fundValue":"829946","fundStart":"2012-01-04","fundEnd":"2017-01-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The SysMIC project has provided a nationally (and potentially internationally) significant strategic training platform in mathematics, computing and statistical training for interdisciplinary research in the life sciences.

However the school and university training pathways for the majority of these scientists excluded the formation of a strong foundation in mathematical, computational and statistical sciences. In the 21st Century the research landscape has changed dramatically. In some cases data is become increasingly inexpensive to acquire and problems arise in translating this into new knowledge. Alternatively data can be extremely difficult to obtain and consume large resources yet remain incomplete or otherwise compromised. In both scenarios the increased ability to bring powerful mathematical and statistical tools to bear on a bioscience problem - facilitated by modern computational tools - is extremely desirable. In order to put these skills and approaches into the hands of the bioscientists nearest the experiments and best placed to interpret the data the SysMIC project was sponsored by the BBSRC. So far we have reached approximately 1,000 researchers - equivalent to about 20% of all BBSRC researchers) with our advanced training. Outcomes include: new scientific papers of higher impact; new or expanded research collaborations that include mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists, engineers and statisticians; an expanded skills base in industry and academia. A four year delivery plan 2013-2016, reaching 1,250 scientists was envisaged for SysMIC training - we are almost 2 years ahead of schedule as demand has been much stronger than expected and reflects a deep appreciation of the need for these skills at the research frontline. Particularly noteworthy is the almost universal adoption of SysMIC by BBSRC Doctoral Training Partnerships through to 2023 (our resources allowing). Lastly, we are moving towards sustainability from 2017 onwards and have piloted training derived from SysMIC for the UK bioscience industry sector. We have also offered SysMIC to other UK research sponsors including Research Councils and charities and are investigating the formation of a spin-out company to deliver world-leading SysMIC training internationally. Researchers sponsored by UK Research Councils besides BBSRC have successfully completed SysMIC training. \nResearchers sponsored by UK charities have successfully completed SysMIC training. \nResearchers sponsored by companies in the UK biosciences community have successfully completed SysMIC training. \nUK civil servants have successfully completed SysMIC training.\nNew university courses for both undergraduate and postgraduate students have been developed.\nOutreach materials for UK schools have been developed and used by the SysMIC team.
