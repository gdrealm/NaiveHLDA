{"id":"BF37C232-5234-4678-B53C-1659AB6434C4","title":"Mathematical Relationships: Identities and Participation","abstractText":"<p>This seminar series uses theories on ‘identity’ to explore processes of inclusion in and exclusion from maths. The key questions are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How does identity help us to understand processes of inclusion in and exclusion from learning maths?</li> \n <li>How does social policy influence learner identities in relation to maths and what policy changes might promote participation?</li>\n</ul> \n<p>The starting point is the apparent paradox of better results in GCSE and A-level maths juxtaposed with an increasing rejection of maths. It is only through switching the focus towards the relationships that learners are forming with maths that it is possible to begin to make sense of this situation. The three selected interdisciplinary lenses on identity - socio-cultural theories, discourse theories and psychoanalytic approaches - have interesting and contrasting things to say on the key concerns, focusing respectively on practices and participation, language and power and the role of the unconscious. Each of the first five seminars in the series will look at the two question above through a theme – selection and assessment, pedagogy, curriculum, choice, and teacher development – and from each of the three selected perspectives; the sixth will be designed to bring together the discussions in the first five seminars.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4267","grantId":"RES-451-25-4267","fundValue":"14349","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Heather Fiona Mendick","coPersons":["Yvette  Solomon","Margaret Louise Brown","Melissa  Rodd","Laura  Black"],"organisation":"London Metropolitan University","findingsText":" N/A project already reported.
