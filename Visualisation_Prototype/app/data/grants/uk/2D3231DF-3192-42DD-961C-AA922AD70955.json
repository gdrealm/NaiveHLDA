{"id":"2D3231DF-3192-42DD-961C-AA922AD70955","title":"The Virtual Seismic Atlas Project","abstractText":"The Virtual Seismic Atlas (VSA) Project will generate an independent, free-to-use, community-based internet resource, which will capture and share the geological interpretation of seismic reflection data in picture and workbook format. Seismic data are expensive to acquire and process, yet give key insights into geological structure and processes. They have revolutionized understanding of Earth surface processes, structural geology, submarine hazards, and shallow crustal processes such as basin fluid migration. They can be used to track hydrocarbons during production and CO2 during subsurface sequestration. Seismic data are a core geoscience resource. Their interpretation, however, needs substantial experience. The skills and knowledge gained in the interpretation of seismic data and the advances in data processing that permit modern studies are dispersed through industry, universities, and government organisations (e.g. British Geological Survey). The aim of this project is to draw these communities together, capturing examples of the geological use of seismic data, and creating a comprehensive common heritage from which to launch future developments in research and training. VSA data, including seismic data and their derivatives, will be searchable and downloadable. Users will be able to search for seismic images, interpretations, data samples and related documents using various geological, geophysical, geographical and technical criteria. The VSA will therefore provide a platform for the community to find seismic examples and analogues, and to compare interpretation strategies and experience. It will generate new research opportunities and will provide an image library for public understanding of science activities. The VSA will be built on the industry-leading getknowledge data management/ knowledge transfer software, developed by BHP-Billiton and Blue Fish Development. Capacity will exceed 10 million documents and will allow 500 synchronous users. The preliminary content of the VSA is being developed with Veritas DGC and BGS who will provide sample 3D and 2D data from diverse settings (including UKCS). In addition, the project will incorporate relevant copyright material from the Geological Society of London. These initial collections are designed to promote other data/interpretation owners to add their material to the site as it grows. Community support is further indicated by the guiding involvement of our patrons, the senior petroleum geologists David G. Roberts and Richard Hardman, and of the Petroleum Exploration Society of Great Britain. Our project partners (Veritas DGC and BHP-Billiton with Blue Fish) are providing in-kind resources worth several million pounds. We request that NERC support the additional development costs of the VSA, namely: 1) a PDRA to engage in geological/interpretation of seismic data, building content and leading new research into geological uncertainty in seismic interpretation, and; 2) travel/subsistence costs for visits to data providers (Veritas, BGS) and 3) computer hardware plus VSA web server installation and support in Leeds. Beyond the VSA website, Knowledge Transfer objectives will be met in several ways: the PDRA will act as act as KT facilitator; personnel will be exchanged for short periods (BHP-B staff will come to Leeds to work on web design and Leeds staff will work with industry geophysicists in seismic data libraries); representatives of the different communities of academic, public sector and industry geoscientists will meet through the project management structure. The legacy will be a self-maintaining digital resource to serve a broad range of user communities in the oil industry, the associated science base and beyond.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E002803/1","grantId":"NE/E002803/1","fundValue":"304034","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Butler","coPersons":["William  McCaffrey","Graham  Stuart"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" Project moved to Aberdeen.\n\nSee other VSA entry as above as above Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
