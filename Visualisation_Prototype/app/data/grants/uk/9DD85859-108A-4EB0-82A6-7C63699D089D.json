Each sensory organ contains a limited number of sensory cells, named hair cells. In mammals, the loss of auditory hair cells following a noise trauma, ototoxicity, or during aging is irreversible and causes permanent deafness. But in birds, fish and amphibians, inner ear hair cells are produced throughout life and regenerate following tissue injury. Our main objective is to identify the genes and signals involved in the production of hair cells during embryonic development and their post-traumatic regeneration in the chick inner ear. In the long term, our findings could contribute to the development of new therapies for deafness.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F007175/1","grantId":"BB/F007175/1","fundValue":"347271","fundStart":"2008-02-11","fundEnd":"2011-02-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  My research is in the area of basic science, and as far as I am aware, it has not resulted in any direct economic impact. The wide societal/cultural impact that could arise from this work is difficult to measure, but some of our findings (e.g. the implication of plastin 1 in hearing loss) have been highlighted on external websites of the charities supporting our work (Action on Hearing Loss and Deafness Research UK, which have now merged) which are directed towards the wider public and hearing loss sufferers. An additional tangible impact is the exposure of supporters of these charities to our work when they visit my lab and the Ear Institute.

Using newly developed tools for very precisely manipulating gene expression in the avian inner ear, we have found that the Sox21 transcription factor can promote hair cell formation during embryonic development. We have also clarified the mechanisms whereby Notch signalling regulates the formation of a precise cellular mosaic of hair cells and supporting cells during the development of the inner ear, and during its regeneration in birds. In addition, we have identified a new gene that could be implicated in certain forms of deafness in humans. We have shown that manipulating the levels of expression of the Sox21 transcription factor can promote hair cell differentiation in the avian inner ear. This result could be very important for the design of future gene therapies aiming at stimulating hair cell regeneration in the mammalian inner ear. This research contributes to a better understanding of the genetic networks controlling sensory formation in the inner ear, an important step towards the development of the 'next-generation' therapies for deafness.\nThe identification of plastin 1 as a candidate gene for hereditary forms of progressive hearing loss could also lead to better diagnosis and prevention of this condition in the future.
