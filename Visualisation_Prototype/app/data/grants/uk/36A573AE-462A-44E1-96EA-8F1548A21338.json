We hope to understand the consequences of this reaction, which is predicted to generate a broken chromosome. If the chromosome is indeed broken, we will study its repair in a reaction called recombination that uses the genetic information present on another copy of the same chromosome. This analysis is important in the context that long DNA palindromes are sites of chromosomal rearrangements that occur between generations and during the development of cancer. Recombination is important as it is a key mechanism for repairing DNA breaks however they are generated.\nSimilar analyses will be carried out on repeated DNA sequences such as those implicated in Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy and fragile-X syndrome.\nThe work will concentrate on the analysis of events occurring inside cells and will take advantage of new techniques of fluorescence microscopy to visualise events as they occur in living cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401313","grantId":"G0401313","fundValue":"1049530","fundStart":"2005-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Leach","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
