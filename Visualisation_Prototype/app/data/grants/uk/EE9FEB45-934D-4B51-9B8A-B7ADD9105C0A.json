{"id":"EE9FEB45-934D-4B51-9B8A-B7ADD9105C0A","title":"Electron Microemulsions in Correlated Quantum Systems - Visiting Researcher","abstractText":"In recent years, it has become apparent that the phase behaviour of strongly correlated electron liquids very often involves the formation of electron microemulsions (ME). The aim of the present proposal is to facilitate the expoloration of ME phase phenomena through the support of the visit of Prof. Spivak. Several applications are discussed ranging from ME formation in layered systems to micro-domain formation in manganites.
