{"id":"7EAD2B93-FD2D-4F63-9E8B-9C1472BE5627","title":"Broad-based community alliances: a comparative study of London and Sydney","abstractText":"<p>This is a comparative study of different union and community forms of civil engagement in Australia and the UK, with a particular focus on economic and social justice and the interests of vulnerable workers. </p>\n\n<p>It will compare union involvement in 3 broad-based community coalitions, focusing on the Sydney Alliance, London Citizens and the UK's TUC's Active Unions, Active Communities initiative. These organisations and forms of organisation can be characterised as 'new actors' in the industrial relations arena, but are much more than this. They are an attempt to rebuild civil engagement of citizens in local communities, teaching the 'art of politics' to people who may be disconnected from either politics or civil society. </p>\n\n<p>The study is concerned with how the organisations have/have not been able to develop alternative means of giving representation to workers - particularly workers who are vulnerable or under-represented within society. </p>\n\n<p>The difference between this research and past work is not only its comparative nature, but that it goes beyond the specifics of a particular campaign to assess whether there are more fundamental elements in industrial relations systems that are either conducive to coalition building or that create barriers for possible joint working.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I001018/1","grantId":"ES/I001018/1","fundValue":"76574","fundStart":"2011-02-10","fundEnd":"2012-07-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Holgate","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
