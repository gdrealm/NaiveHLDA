Moreover, surveys suggest that if money was not an issue far more women would undergo such procedures, which are seen as increasingly 'normal', 'routine' and part of the 'beauty regimes' of 'ordinary women'. This project will consider the beauty norms which underlie this trend from cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral perspectives. The assumption of the network is that beauty image is becoming ever more demanding and defining of women, and increasingly men, irrespective of their professions. The project will ask whether this is the case, and how this norm is constituted and how it impacts upon women. It will also ask whether the dominant beauty norm is increasingly a global beauty norm, and thus open to less cultural and sub-cultural resistance. The project is especially concerned with role of technology in this. In particular, that procedures which were once regarded as 'exceptional' such as the use of surgery, are now regarded as 'normal' or even 'required' in certain contexts. Other increasingly demanding beauty requirements include hair removal and 'non-invasive' procedures to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. All of these procedures, whether 'routine' or 'exceptional', require time and effort to maintain, and arguably the 'minimum' required is increasing; fewer women go 'bare faced' or bare their flesh without hair removal. This project will explore the extent to which beauty norms are changing and how as well as what this means for individuals, for regulation and for clinical practice. It will explore the 'perfectionist trend' that extends the use of medical and scientific procedures to 'cosmetic procedures'. In light of this it will explore how the use and development of such procedures in the service of such norms changes the concepts of 'health', 'normality' and 'perfection' and in turn how these feed into self-understandings and identity, social expectations, medical practice and regulation.\nThe project is timely as it connects 'moral panics' about the sexualisation of culture (which is often connected to claims about appearance and clothing) to worries about the number of cosmetic procedures performed on young girls (often to be 'normal') and the rise of eating disorders. All of these signify the increasing importance of appearance, the narrowing of what is considered 'normal', the increasing pressure to comply to such norms and the increasing reliance on, and expectation of, technology (whether surgical or non-invasive procedures) to provide a means to achieve these ideals. This project looks at the changing ideals, how technology is used, and at the practices, policies and regulation of these practices. It asks whether such changes are fundamental (either to understandings of beauty or to understandings of such practices as 'medical') and whether current practices, such as consent or balancing risk, are appropriate to regulate such practices, or whether the changes are social and as such require different frameworks to address them. While there has been significant work on this in popular literature there has been much less genuinely multidisciplinary engagement connecting the underlying concepts and assumptions to the duties of the medical profession, and to regulation and legislation. This network will address this gap in collaboration and partnership with policy makers, particularly with the Nuffield Council of Bioethics (NCoB). The PI and the NCoB will collaborate on gaining policy buy-in to the work which is of such import to the pubic.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L01548X/1","grantId":"AH/L01548X/1","fundValue":"26108","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Heather  Widdows","coPersons":["Jean Vanessa McHale"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
