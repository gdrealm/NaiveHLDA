Focusing on development NGOs in Nepal at a time of considerable political turmoil, it will describe and analyse the impact of violence and conflict on the experience of NGO workers, and on everyday practices in the NGO setting.</p>\n\n<p>The research will be guided by the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>How have NGO workers at different levels experienced the conflict?<br /></li>\n\n <li>What strategies have organisational actors developed at individual and institutional level in response?<br /></li>\n\n <li>How have the experience of conflict and individual and institutional responses to it transformed the nature and meaning of NGO work and activity?<br /></li>\n\n <li>What have been the consequences for the ability of NGOs to carry out 'civil society' functions and to claim a space within Nepal's civil society?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It will be based on intensive fieldwork in the headquarters and the field offices of two national NGOs, and informal and formal discussions with managers and staff of the organisations at all levels. These data will be supplemented with documentary evidence of the implications of the conflict on NGOs (eg newspapers, NGO reports and publications) collected in situ.</p>\n\n<p>The study will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>build theory around non-governmental public action.&nbsp; It will contribute by enhancing current understanding of how the organisation and meaning of non-governmental public action is transformed under civil conflict;<br /></li>\n\n <li>generate new and detailed empirical knowledge on the day to day activities of non-governmental organisations under conflict; and<br /></li>\n\n <li>strengthen the co-production of knowledge between researcher and researched, practitioner and academic communities, in particular, through exploring collaboratively methodological issues and approaches to doing research under conditions of civil conflict.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research will contribute both empirically and theoretically to several research fields.&nbsp; It will also provide empirical data with which to inform the design of NGO training programs and support.</p>\n\n<p>User groups will include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>NGO sector in Nepal and internationally;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Academic audience in Nepal and internationally; and<br /></li>\n\n <li>Donors, bilateral agencies in Nepal/UK; agencies involved in NGO training and support.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-155-25-0088","grantId":"RES-155-25-0088","fundValue":"114876","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Celayne  Heaton Shrestha","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
