In cancer, these structural alterations can alter or disrupt the normal function of important genes and the biological systems in which they participate that may contribute to disease initiation, progression and later confer resistance to therapy and contribute to the spread of the disease to other systems. These structural alterations can be detected using high-throughput genome sequencing on a genome-wide scale at the theoretical resolution of a single DNA nucleotide. \n\nVarious international collaborative efforts have enabled extensive catalogues of structural alterations to be built for various cancers and so that the effect of these structural variations can now investigated alongside other genetic abnormalities in studies of disease etiology, prognosis and therapeutic effectiveness. Yet, it is interesting to note though that despite the fact that we have analysed many cancers, the structural analysis of new cancer specimens is conducted no differently from the very first cancer that was studied. Existing knowledge is not utilised in spite of the fact that many structural variants are recurrent in cancer. \n\nThe aim of this project is to construct libraries of cancer-related structural alterations based upon existing data resources and to develop advanced statistical algorithms that utilise these libraries to identify and classify structural variants from genome sequencing data of new patients. These algorithms will allow us to identify recurring patterns of structural abnormalities that are shared by patients and whether these relate to particular genetic and clinical features as well as track disease progression where multiple specimens are obtained from the same patient. These algorithms may enable patients to be identified who maybe suitable for novel targeted therapies or treatment regimes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L001411/1","grantId":"MR/L001411/1","fundValue":"345267","fundStart":"2014-02-27","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Yau","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
