{"id":"5D6DAF14-3D59-4BB9-AB64-E0B1F012E018","title":"Towards strategies for Power-Aware Networking","abstractText":"The Internet and the World Wide Web are using between 2% and 5% of the energy in the developed world and this is fraction increasing rapidly as demand for new services such as online video (Youtube) and Social Networking, Internet voice and video communication, and online shopping expand. We need to characterise where and when this power demand comes from, and then see if we can apply techniques to trade of power and performance - if demand falls, then can we use energy proportional techniques to slow down computing and communications technology, so that (e.g. at night time) we get an equivalent reduction in consumption.This project is to fund a sabbatical visit by a leading practitioner in Internet Measurement and Green Networking, as part of a larger initiative to tackle these problems. Professor Barford has proposed a particular approach to one aspect of the problem, which is to devise a microrouter , which is a kind of small building block, that provides the essential communication facility of the Internet, but can be stacked up (metaphorically speaking, a bit like Lego bricks) to build faster (but more energy hungry) communication when needed, or pub back in their box (turned off, logically) when not needed. Finding the best dynamic strategies (when to add more microrouter blocks, when to take them away) is the second main outcome of this project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I012583/1","grantId":"EP/I012583/1","fundValue":"141873","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This work led to better models of Internet Energy use, and helped disseminate work from the EPSC INTERNET project to US researchers as well.

As well as giving several seminars, he also assisted with PhD advice and produced 4 papers on relevant topics, and provided fantastic assistence getting data and access to expertise on power grid and router hardware architecture, which will be reported elsewhere (under the EPSRC INTERNET project grant Research Outcomes, which is due later). The outcomes are several - one is we have used the advice to help BT, CIsco and the BBC to look at ways to reduce power consumption in their infrastructures.
