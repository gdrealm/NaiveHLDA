Its core remit is to maintain a ‘safe setting’ so users can access the confidential census and administrative data held in the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study (NILS), whilst protecting the anonymity of individuals, and to support users from making research applications through data extraction and analysis, to the clearance of final outputs.Beyond this, the NILS-RSU also aims to promote the research and policy use of the NILS by the development of a research agenda in cooperation with its users and through outreach and dissemination to policymakers inside and outside government.A special focus is the linkage of 2011 Census data to the NILS which will permit analyses of ‘Northern Ireland in Transition 2001-2011’.The work future programme also recognises the changing external environment by looking to other UK longitudinal studies and ESRC investments for economies of scale in user training and the promotion of longitudinal research, in developing remote access protocols for users, in widening the user base, and in exploring and meeting the aspiration for a UK-wide longitudinal study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000462/1","grantId":"ES/K000462/1","fundValue":"949048","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Shuttleworth","coPersons":["Michael  Rosato","Tony  Gallagher","Mark  Birkin"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
