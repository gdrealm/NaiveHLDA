Even if Scotland opts to remain within the UK, there may well be moves towards further significant devolution.</p>\n\n<p>Scottish Social Attitudes (SSA) is an annual, independent high quality survey that has tracked the preferences and attitudes of people in Scotland about should be governed ever since the advent of devolution in 1999. This project will exploit this legacy by including a module of 40 questions on the 2012 SSA. The results will be compared with those for previous years to assess whether there has been any significant change in the pattern of attitudes. At the same time the project will examine how far support for independence reflects people’s emotional feelings (such as their sense of Scottish identity) and how far it reflects what they think the material consequences might be (such as its impact on Scotland’s economy). This approach will also be extended to analysis of the basis of support for further devolution.. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006355/1","grantId":"ES/K006355/1","fundValue":"49740","fundStart":"2012-08-15","fundEnd":"2014-02-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John Kevin Curtice","coPersons":["Fiona Malcolm O'Hanlon","Lindsay  Paterson","David  McCrone","RACHEL MARY ORMSTON"],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
