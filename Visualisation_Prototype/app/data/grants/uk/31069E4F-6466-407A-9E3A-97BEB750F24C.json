Our brain processes information in a network of nerve cells. The communication between these nerve cells occurs via specialized structures called synapses. When an electrical signal (action potential) travels along the nerve cell and reaches the synapse then a messenger substance is released from the synapse. This messenger substance is received by a receptor protein in the membrane of the adjacent nerve cell. The firing of action potentials of individual nerve cells and the communication between these cells via synapses is very important for the processing of information, but it might not be sufficient. To allow efficient information processing by individual nerve cells, their action potential firing might have to be embedded in a temporal context. Such a 'clock signal' in the brain might be provided by so called network oscillations. These 'brain waves' arise from voltage changes in the extracellular space of the brain, which are caused by the ion flux that is associated with synchronous activity of large groups of nerve cells. Using electrodes that are inserted into the brain these waves can be measured. It was found that there are different types of brain waves and that each of them is associated with a particular behaviour in an animal. The hippocampus is a brain structure which is important for learning and memory. Here different brain waves are hypothesised to be necessary for the encoding of information in different phases of memory formation. However it has not been possible to directly test this. In the experiments I propose in this application I want to test the function of brain waves in memory formation. We have developed a new technique that allows us to interfere with selected synapses and thus with communication between selected nerve cells that are important for the generation of different types of brain waves. By interfering with nerve cell communication in different parts of the nerve cell network we want to find out which parts of the network generate which type of brain waves. Once we have this information we will selectively disrupt distinct types of brain waves and test how this influences learning and memory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H001123/1","grantId":"BB/H001123/1","fundValue":"429934","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peer  Wulff","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" We have been able to selectively target and functionally remove defined populations of GABAergic interneurons in circumscribed brain circuits to elucidate their relevance in cognitive processing. We have discovered that parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus selectively support spatial working memory but not reference memory (Murray et al., Nat. Neurosci. 2011). In contrast, we found that somatostatin-positive interneurons are required for high resolution spatial reference memory (manuscript in preparation). These findings strongly suggest differential and task-dependent roles for interneuron subclasses during learning. In addition we found that parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the prefrontal cortex control prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive performance (e.g. spatial working memory and cognitive flexibility) but not prefrontal cortex-dependent social behavior (manuscript submitted). This has important implications for schizophrenia research where affection of parvalbumin-positive neurons in the prefrontal cortex is a robust histological finding. First experiments using multi-site recordings of oscillatory activity during working memory tasks indicate that inactivation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the prefrontal cortex not only alter theta and gamma oscillations (thought to be required for working memory) in the prefrontal cortex itself but also in the hippocampus, offering a potential explanation for the dependence of spatial working memory on both hippocampal and prefrontal circuits.\nWe will continue to explore the alterations in oscillatory activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during working memory tasks after functional removal of parvalbumin-positive interneurons. We will investigate changes in power, frequency, cross-frequency coupling and prefrontal-hippocampal coherence during an alternation task in a Y-maze. \nA second line of research that evolves from our current data concerns the physiological basis of the different behavioural effects we found after targeting either parvalbumin-positive cells (working memory deficits) or somatostatin-positive cells (reference memory deficits) in the hippocampus. This work is an expansion of objectives 1 &amp;amp; 2 as new tools (a Somatostatin-Cre driver line) have become available to dissect the hippocampal circuitry and its oscillatory activity. The different behavioural effects after inactivation of parvalbumin- and somatostatin-positive interneurons we found offer a unique opportunity to explore the involvement of different circuit elements and possibly neuronal oscillations in specific cognitive tasks. \nWe also succeeded to develop a refined virus-based strategy for cell-type-specific manipulation of neuronal activity with Zolpidem (objective 1) and are in the process of preparing a proof of principal paper.\nPublications from the project so far:\nMurray, AJ, Sauer, JF, Riedel, G, McClure, C, Ansel, L, Cheyne, L, Bartos, M, Wisden, W, Wulff, P.
