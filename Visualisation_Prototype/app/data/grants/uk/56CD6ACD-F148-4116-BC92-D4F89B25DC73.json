Dr Geoghegan will trace the new ‘Tree Health Surveillance Framework’ for Britain, conducting empirical research with citizen scientists, plant pathologists, technicians and users of citizen data, as well as international comparative research on citizen monitoring projects in Australia, a leader in biosecurity.</p>\n\n<p>As well as investigating the socio-personal implications of enthusiasm, the research will offer a deeper understanding of how citizen science practices are articulated. Topics will include the use of Web 2.0 technologies, the requirements of scientists involved in studying and managing environments for health, and the relative contribution of citizen data to the resulting science.</p>\n\n<p>She will work in partnership with Forest Research, Sylva Foundation, and the Science Museum. Dr Geoghegan will collaborate with colleagues at the University of Washington and McGill University, as well as spend time as a Visiting Fellow at the Australian Centre for Cultural Environment Research at the University of Wollongong.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001426/1","grantId":"ES/K001426/1","fundValue":"169601","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Hilary  Geoghegan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
