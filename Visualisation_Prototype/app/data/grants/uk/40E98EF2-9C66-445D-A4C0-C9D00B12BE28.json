However, their large-scale manufacturing is still in its infancy with an urgent need for a manufacturing technology capable of the continuous production of nanoparticles, overcoming the current limitations associated with size control and agglomeration. \n\nIn this project we plan to combine experience in reaction engineering and catalysis (Torrente, Bath), fluid flow control (Sharma, Southampton) and advanced materials characterization (Haigh, Manchester). Uniting different expertise and research interests will enable us to identify alternative approaches to overcoming current challenges in the micro-reactor field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L026651/1","grantId":"EP/L026651/1","fundValue":"25121","fundStart":"2014-07-31","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Laura  Torrente Murciano","coPersons":["Atul Stefan Sharma","Sarah Jane Haigh"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
