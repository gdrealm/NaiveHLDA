Both father's rights groups and Women's Aid have raised concerns about institutional bias, ineffectiveness and a lack of transparency. However, the inherently closed nature of decision-making in the family courts has prevented greater understanding of how decisions are reached.</p>\n\n<p>This study addresses this gap by undertaking a detailed analysis of in-court conciliation meetings where parents negotiate over contact with the assistance of a judge or court social worker.</p>\n\n<p>The research uses conversation analysis to explore precisely how the actual, real-time work of family courts is undertaken in and through the communicative processes of spoken interaction. </p>\n\n<p>The study will explore, for example, the interactional processes by which agreements are achieved, negotiated and/or impeded, and how the rights and needs of children and parents are discursively framed by conciliators and disputants. </p>\n\n<p>The study has three aims:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to advance theoretical and empirical understanding of decision making within the family courts, \n</li>\n <li>to enhance transparency, inform policy and identify specific areas of professional practices and competences that may be improved, and \n</li>\n <li>to demonstrate the benefits of the conversation analysis method for socio-legal research.<br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F03220X/1","grantId":"ES/F03220X/1","fundValue":"78428","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth  Trinder","coPersons":["Alan  Firth","Christopher Joseph Jenks"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
