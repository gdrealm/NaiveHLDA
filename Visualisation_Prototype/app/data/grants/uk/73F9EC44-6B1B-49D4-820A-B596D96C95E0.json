A preliminary phase involves observations of interim court hearings to obtain an overview of the process in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; A second element will comprise a set of contemporaneous case studies.&nbsp; A third element will comprise interviews with legal representatives and other key personnel involved in the process, to explore wider conceptions of the role, adding breadth to the case studies.&nbsp; \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F036566/1","grantId":"ES/F036566/1","fundValue":"189179","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Julia Frances Pearce","coPersons":["Judith  Masson"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
