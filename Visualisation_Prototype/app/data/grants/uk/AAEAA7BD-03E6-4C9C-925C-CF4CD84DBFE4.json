We still believe this to be the case. However, the most relevant outputs for non-academics are likely to be the forthcoming paper on the generality of six identity motives across diverse cultural systems, and the yet-to-be-published paper on cultural diversity in self-construals. Both of these papers in different ways will challenge popular stereotypical thinking about culture. The identity motives paper will show that, beneath superficial differences, there is more commonality in underlying motives than might at first appear between members of very different cultural groups. The self-construals paper will challenge the popular &quot;East-West&quot; dichotomy that dominates much popular and academic discourse about cultural differences, in particular showing the presence of meaningful and predictable cultural differences between clusters of nations that are more commonly lumped together under the dismissive label of &quot;non-Western&quot;. Thus, although the research has not yet had an economic or social impact, we believe that the potential for such an impact is there, and we hope to achieve this once our academic findings are accepted and established.  ","person":"Vivian Laurence Vignoles","coPersons":["Rupert  Brown"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":" [From our original End of Award Report:] Beyond basic needs for food, water, affiliation and security, people's thoughts and actions are often guided by symbolic needs. These include identity motives, which predispose people to see themselves in particular ways. Previous research has shown that people in contemporary Western societies are motivated to see themselves positively (the self-esteem motive), as distinguished from others (the distinctiveness motive), persisting through time (the continuity motive), accepted within their social circles (the belonging motive), competent and capable (the efficacy motive), and imbued with meaning and purpose (the meaning motive). However, little was known about the generality of these motives to people in non-Western cultures--the majority of the world's population--and theories were polarized between 'universalist' and 'relativist' positions. \n\nWe assembled a new research network spanning 38 nations and conducted two large-scale survey studies measuring the strengths of identity motives, different sources of motive satisfaction, and cultural beliefs and values, among 14,000 participants. \n\nOur findings support a middle way between univeralist and relativist perspectives. Supporting universalism, identity motives show little variation in strength with beliefs, values or practices across diverse cultural groupings. Supporting relativism, ways of satisfying each motive vary across cultural groupings. Thus, a common set of motives underlies the different expressions and outcomes of identity observed across cultures. [From our original End of Award Report:] This improved understanding of the interface between culture and identity motives may be especially beneficial to UK practitioners seeking to intervene in a culturally sensitive manner in multicultural domains from psychotherapy to education, health promotion, business management, social cohesion, and international relations.
