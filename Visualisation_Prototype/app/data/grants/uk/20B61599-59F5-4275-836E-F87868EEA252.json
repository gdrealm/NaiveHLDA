In school visits, a dedicated table-top experiment, consisting of coupled double-pendulums, will spark their curiosity to explore its movements. This being the mechanical analogue of matter-antimatter oscillations will allow them to explore an aspect of particle physics in a playful way. The project's aim is to be maximally approachable for school children by working with a group of enthusiastic undergraduate students who have recently founded the Manchester Particle Physics Research Society.\n\nThe results of a set of proposed measurements will be collected centrally to enable children from all schools visited within the project to compare their results and to contribute to a large collaboration. The publication of the construction guide and background information will allow anyone interested to participate as well and to contribute to this collaborative effort.\n\nReaching out to children with physical impairments, who often dismiss scientific carriers as an option due to their conditions, is essential to help them fully experience science and live out their potential. Therefore, one of SCIENCE HANDS aims is to explore the possibility of including this audience through targeted additions to the outreach material, such as a device to transform mechanical movement into sound to aid the visually impaired. Gender equality will also be actively encouraged by having equal numbers of female and male student representatives at each school visit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N001990/1","grantId":"ST/N001990/1","fundValue":"2242","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Marco  Gersabeck","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
