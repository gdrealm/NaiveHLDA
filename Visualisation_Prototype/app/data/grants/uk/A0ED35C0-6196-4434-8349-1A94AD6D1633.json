It is envisioned that such a device could ultimately be used, for example, in conjunction with a dual-plane Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) system to enable velocity profile measurements of both (all) phases to be made in two (or three) phase flows. Recent numerical simulation work at Huddersfield has demonstrated that induced voltage electromagnetic flow meters can be used for velocity profile measurement of the conducting continuous phase and that the influence of the mixture conductivity is relatively small. An 18-month research associate will be required for a theoretical and experimental study of electromagnetic flow measurement using an electrode sensor array. The proposal seeks to achieve the generation of a new type of electromagnetic multiphase flowmeter with the novel capability of a high performance dynamic response on velocity profile measurement, together with a proof-of-concept prototype.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E013031/1","grantId":"EP/E013031/1","fundValue":"110620","fundStart":"2007-08-30","fundEnd":"2009-02-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gui Yun  Tian","coPersons":["Gary  Lucas"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
