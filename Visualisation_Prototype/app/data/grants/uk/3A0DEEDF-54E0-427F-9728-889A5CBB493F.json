The feasibility studies will be in the general area of the physicochemical characterisation of asphalt materials and address the adhesive properties and interfacial relationships between the material components using a range of cross-disciplinary techniques and testing methods developed during a Collaborating for Success through People Grant. In addition, the feasibility studies will be extended into new research areas that are linked with the general area of the physicochemical characterisation of asphalt materials through cross-disciplinary collaborations with groups in Organic Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Nanotechnology.The feasibility studies will be undertaken by post-doctoral researchers (PDRAs) working in the area of asphalt technology and pavement materials at NTEC. The PDRAs will be bought out of their existing projects and seconded for the period of the Feasibility Account to undertake these dedicated, cross-disciplinary feasibility studies. Successful areas of cross-disciplinary research resulting from the short-term research studies, in terms of their potential to have a significant impact on society and the economy, will be identified through a series of workshop, seminars and sandpits and built into large scale research proposals and projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H024549/1","grantId":"EP/H024549/1","fundValue":"201244","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The impact of the research has been slow due to the traditionally conservative approach of the pavement engineering construction industry.

The research was targeted at asphalt (bitumen-bound) pavement materials used as the riding surface or underlying structural layers of a road and involved a number of short-term, speculative feasibility studies addressing key areas of material performance. The specific, project-focussed, cross-disciplinary, speculative feasibility studies have addressed issues such as the adhesive and cohesive properties of asphalt materials; the production of alternative synthetic and environmentally sustainable binders/adhesives; and the use of nanotechnology to increase the understanding of asphalt mixture failure and distress mechanisms. \n\n\n\nThe research has shown that through a combination of thermodynamic surface free energy and adhesion fracture energy measurements, it is now possible to understand, predict and even enhance the resistance to moisture damage of asphalt mixture pavement materials. This truly fundamental approach to the understanding of moisture damage will allow the appropriate selection of asphalt mixtures components to deliberately mitigate its effect on the long term stability of the road material. The research used a combination of adhesive fracture energy measurements on bitumen-aggregate systems using monotonically-loaded tests together with intrinsic adhesion calculations based on thermodynamic surface free energy concepts to produce a step change in the moisture damage performance and material screening of asphalt mixtures. The introduction and development of these new methods and novel approaches will provide the tools needed for the better selection and water induced damage prediction of appropriate pavement materials. This combined approach contributes effectively to improving the understanding and prediction of such damage in asphalt mixtures and thereby provides a tool to achieve the project goal of enhancing moisture damage performance.\n\n\n\nThe research collaboration between chemistry, chemical engineering and pavement materials has also shown that it is possible to produce synthetic polymers, with similar rheological properties to conventional bitumen, through catalytic chain transfer polymerization (CCTP). A range of methyl acrylate (MA) and butyl acrylate (BA) synthetic polymers of specific, targeted molecular weights and with polydispersity index values in the range of 2 - 4.5 were subjected to standard rheological and viscometry testing. The results showed that it was possible to produce a range of synthetic polyacrylates with different rheological responses by altering the reactant type, reactant concentration and polymerization conditions to match the rheological properties of road bitumens. These findings suggest that sustainably sourced, polyacrylate binders may allow a move from petrochemical feed stocks to be made. In addition, the ability to engineer these synthetic binders should allow them to be targeted to specific road pavement design requirements based on local climates, predominant distress mechanisms and traffic levels by offering improved mechanical robustness.\n\n\n\nThis research project has provided a crucial step in managing the risk and reliability of the UK highway infrastructure by improving the understanding of pavement distress and material response through a series of cross-disciplinary studies incorporating the skills and expertise of these different disciplines. With the highway network being the largest UK infrastructure asset worth some ?600bn, establishing these interdisciplinary teams to tackle the performance of asphalt paving materials is considered extremely timely. The asphalt construction industry have plans to use the screening tests developed in the grant to optimise material selection in order to reduce future failures and decrease maintenance costs.\n\nThe work on synthetic binders has been used to produce binder rejuvenators that are critical to the successful use of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) material in recycled asphalt materials.
