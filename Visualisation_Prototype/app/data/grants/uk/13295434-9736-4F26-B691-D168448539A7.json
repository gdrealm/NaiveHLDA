Both social mixing of pregnant sows and tail docking are common practices within the pig industry and investigating their impact on animal welfare is of practical importance. \n\n\n\nSocial mixing of young sows, pregnant for the first time, with older larger sows produced higher than usual stress levels (indicated by an increase in stress-related hormones). This maternal stress produced a variety of negative effects in the offspring at various stages of their lives. Prenatally stressed pigs were found to show a greater pain reaction to tail docking. Their immune system also develops differently which means they could be less healthy than other pigs and the research found altered levels of brain receptors critical to stress and fear processing, which could mean they are less able to handle stressful situations. From a farm production point of view, these pigs were also found to have a reduced growth rate after they were weaned from their mother, and some changes to reproductive physiology, both of which could reduce the efficiency of production and have a negative effect on farm finances. When they were kept through to reproductive maturity themselves, prenatally stressed sows were also found to show poor quality maternal behaviour such as shifting posture a lot, or lying in positions that made it difficult for their piglets to feed. When kept in a loose farrowing system this caused a tripling of piglet mortality.\n\n\n\nIn summary, it appears that prenatally stressed pigs do not cope well with many of the normal challenges (tail docking, weaning, mixing and giving birth) they face in a farming environment. Prenatal stress may be an underlying and unappreciated cause of poor welfare in commercial pig production. This study has advanced our understanding of this issue and suggests alterations to farm management that could help alleviate the problem.\n\n\n\nWithin the project we also investigated emotionality in pigs. Specifically, the validity of different ways of assessing fear in pigs was examined; for example we looked into the method Qualitative Behavioural Assessment and how it can be used to identify behaviours shown by fearful pigs. This work could greatly improve the quality of information that such tests provide and could contribute to better assessment of the emotional consequences of prior experiences in pigs.\n\n\n\nPiglets showed signs of behavioural distress immediately following tail docking, which can be lessened by giving the animal a local anaesthetic first. However, tail docking did not affect the pigs' response to painful or non painful stimuli in the long-term and there was no evidence of on-going chronic pain as an effect of docking. In fact there were relatively few long-term consequences of tail docking. However, reproductive development in both male and female pigs was found to be affected by the procedure; male pigs which had gone through tail docking had smaller testis and both sexes were found to have lower levels of the hormone oestradiol. While we do not know yet why this is, it could be significant for both pig farming and even for human reproductive biology. Tail docking remains a controversial practice in worldwide pig production and the acute behavioural evidence supports the suggestion that it is painful. Although there appears to be no long term effects to their sensitivity to pain pigs could experience other more subtle and far reaching consequences which could have implications for farm production efficiency.\n\n\n\nFinally, given that aggression can lower welfare either directly or indirectly through prenatal stress, we explored the genetic basis of aggression. This was investigated by looking for associations between genetic markers and behavioural aggression. We found that aggression has a complex genetic basis with a large number of markers all contributing a small amount to the trait. Although there may not therefore be single genes that individually have a large impact on aggressiveness it was possible to identify important chromosomes containing genetic variation for aggression. Information such as this could one day contribute to efforts to reduce the negative welfare consequences of aggression through genetic selection for less aggressive pigs in commercial production.
