Although all dynamic systems are nonlinear, classical approaches to analysis and design are almost universally based on linear time invariant approximations to the dynamic characteristics. However, classical approaches are no longer adequate becauseof the increasing performance needs of modern industry, which require plants to be operated in regions where there are constraints and strong non-linear behaviour. Combined with the fact that most existing non-linear control techniques used by industry are empirically based and, as a result, difficult to tune and analyse, there is a real need for a scientifically more rigorous framework for practical non-linear multivariable control.This is a cooperative project in which the research work is divided between the Industrial Control Centre, University of Strathclyde and the Department of Aerospace Engineering, University of Glasgow. It builds upon the new nonlineargeneralized minimum variance (NGMV) control design ideas developed at University of Strathclyde. The project will attack the problem of synthesising nonlinear controller design using two complementary philosophies: the traditionalapproach of a purely theoretical foundation tested through realistic case studies and the alternative, practical view of tailoring advanced control research to address specific engineering problems. Motivation for this second approach comesfrom the fact that bespoke nonlinear controllers already exist in many engineering systems and this practical experience should be harnessed in the search for complete theory. The project involves five very significant and difficult scientificchallenges that should make the proposed method suitable for the most challenging real-time applications. These theoretical challenges include:1. Development of a Nonlinear Predictive Control facility which is much faster than existing solutions for machinery controls and faster processes.2. Include new Constraint Handling features in both the predictive and non-predictive versions.3. Introduce measures to guarantee some minimum Robustness Margins.4. Develop real time Labview based implementation with pre-specified low order Restricted Structure implementation.5. Introduce a Learning and adaptation feature for applications where plant models change slowly.The last feature may seem particularly ambitious but the NGMV family of control structures has a useful property that its structure is very suitable for learning or adaptive system. That is, any nonlinear plant subsystems affect the controllerstructure and solution in a very simple way.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F031734/1","grantId":"EP/F031734/1","fundValue":"108399","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Anderson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":" This grant helped to fund the development of a research laboratory to support investigations into new algorithms fro sightline control. This encompasses fast, nonlinear control algorithms for stabilisation, pointing, tracking and image processing of electro-optic systems. The NGMV control algorithms developed were shown to be very useful in practice, at least in the limited set of test vectors we were able to perform. Our findings support the assertions of the NGMV creators that the control strategy deserves further study.
