{"id":"FB259EAF-18E4-4DC8-A69A-6176FEA3D318","title":"SUPERGEN: Delivery of Sustainable Hydrogen","abstractText":"We seek to deliver new technologies capable of clean and cost-effective conversion of low-carbon electricity and various carbon sources, including biomass and waste, into hydrogen. We have set up a consortium to address this target involving 14 University research groups. This will achieve significant critical mass and provide a proactive consortium, well linked to a range of industrial actors, to address these major long term problems. The main strands of the project relate to advanced catalytic and membrane production routes for conversion of carbonaceous sources and the integration of such processes, advanced electrochemical production and conversion of hydrogen and socio-technical analysis and appraisal of these technologies. The project will be carefully managed to encourage networking, exchange of people and ideas, training of personnel, knowledge transfer activities, outreach and dissemination.WP1: Production of hydrogen from carbonaceous sourcesThe purpose of this WP is to investigate and optimise the production of high purity hydrogen from hydrocarbon and oxygenated-hydrocarbon sources. We will develop innovative processes for both low and high temperature catalytic hydrogen production processes. We focus on low temperature reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons because of favourable thermodynamics. These systems can be employed with or without hydrogen permselective membranes for enhancing hydrogen purity. For high temperature reforming of hydrocarbons we focus on membrane developments and thermochemical cycles (chemical looping) to separate hydrogen from the reaction mixture.WP2: Sustainable hydrogen from electronsThe purpose of this WP is to develop more cost effective and efficient technologies to produce hydrogen from sustainably produced electricity, especially for distributed, smaller scale systems. Electrolyser concepts will be tested and modelled novel system concepts investigated. High temperature electrolysis, which offers enhanced electrical efficiency, will be developed and the possibility of combining this with an innovative liquefaction process investigated. Electrochemical routes to alternative hydrogen containing vectors will be explored.WP3: Socio-technical analysis and appraisal of hydrogen productionThe purpose of this interdisciplinary WP will be to bring together the engineering and socio-economic dimensions of the consortium's research, benchmarking current and future technological performance, and undertaking rigorous interdisciplinary analysis and appraisal of the potential for the novel catalytic and electrolytic hydrogen production, and post production conversion processes, being developed by the consortium to contribute to the large-scale delivery of sustainable hydrogen.WP4: Management, knowledge transfer, dissemination and networkingThe consortium will strongly promote industrial engagement and dissemination in order to maximise knowledge transfer and technology uptake in this key environmental and commercial topic. We will provide a rounded training in hydrogen production and energy systems to our 20 researchers through exchanges, workshops and training schools. Part of this WP will also analyse the knowledge transfer process looking at innovation systems and socio-technical transitions in relation to delivering sustainable hydrogen.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G01244X/1","grantId":"EP/G01244X/1","fundValue":"4943130","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Metcalfe","coPersons":["Kang  Li","David  Infield","John  Irvine","Martin  Wills","Andrew  Cruden","SCE  Tsang","David  Book","Shanwen  Tao","Neil  McKeown","John Christopher Whitehead","Bartlomiej Andrzej Glowacki","Malcolm  Eames","Valerie  Dupont"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" Newcastle 1 - Novel process for pure hydrogen production using syngas and water, with inherent separation, using chemical looping\nAbstract: Researchers at Newcastle University, led by Prof Ian Metcalfe, have developed a novel technology, using a process called chemical looping, for the production of two pure AND separate streams of hydrogen and syngas directly from natural gas and water. The syngas produced by this process can be used as a reactant for methanol or ethylene synthesis. \nAn auto  Agriculture/ Food and Drink,Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
