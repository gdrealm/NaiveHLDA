Moreover, each has a significant cross-national dimension and there is a significant EU competence. This raises the potential for multi-level governance. </p> \n<p>The project is located within the Centre for International Policy Research at the Department of Politics, University of Sheffield, and will be conducted jointly with the South East European Centre, a collaboration between the University of Sheffield and City University, Thessaloniki, Greece.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E004474/1","grantId":"ES/E004474/1","fundValue":"268820","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew John Taylor","coPersons":["Andrew Peter Geddes","Ian  Bache","C  Lees"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
