The aim is to produce targeted policy and practice resources in collaboration with Kids Company (a charity supporting challenged and challenging children and young people) their service users and other specialist practitioners. Two core products will be produced as an outcome of a co-ordinated programme of knowledge exchange:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>A policy directed 'Manifesto for Learning' detailing specific policy recommendations.<br />This will involve joint working with Kids Company practitioners as well as the children and young people who use their services focusing on and refining findings from the original research to clarify policy implications.</li>\n\n <li>A practitioner directed 'Reflexive Toolkit' to prompt and facilitate critical, reflexive awareness among teachers and other professionals working with pupils at risk of school exclusion. This activity will synthesise findings from the original research with the insights and experience of a specially selected panel of practitioners to generate a practical overview of the dynamics commonly framing school conflict. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both resources will be launched at a one day seminar for policymakers and practitioners.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I002294/1","grantId":"ES/I002294/1","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2011-01-10","fundEnd":"2013-01-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Val  Gillies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London South Bank University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
