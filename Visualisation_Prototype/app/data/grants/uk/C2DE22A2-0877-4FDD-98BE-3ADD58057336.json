{"id":"C2DE22A2-0877-4FDD-98BE-3ADD58057336","title":"Workshop: From complex nanophotonics to complex nanodevices","abstractText":"The community that investigates light propagation, localization and its nano-scale interaction with quantum emitters in complex photonic and biological media is currently not represented by a dedicated conference, instead it is drowned in much larger very large meetings. Despite this, a new generation of scientists engaging with the topics of complex nanophotonics is emerging from different fields, from single-molecule nano-optics to biomedical imaging and sensing, from quantum networks to light management for solar cells, from Anderson localization of light to high sensitive biosensing.\nIn this workshop we will discuss the latest progress, future developments and will facilitate the formation of a community driven by the next generation of junior scientists linked by the common passion for complexity and nano- and bio- photonics, by giving them visibility and building a contact network around them.\nIn the organization of the workshop we want to break from the traditional conference format, which are often showcases of career-long investigations, to try to engage the creativity of early-stage scientists and create new scientific connections, fostering critical thinking. For this reasons we have chosen to stress the importance of the poster session (often neglected) and organize evening debate sessions to discuss science-related topics like science outside the academia, open access, and peer-review.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N008596/1","grantId":"EP/N008596/1","fundValue":"10909","fundStart":"2015-08-18","fundEnd":"2015-11-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jacopo  Bertolotti","coPersons":["Riccardo  Sapienza"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
