There has been a long association between the Alzheimer?s Society and the IAH: Professor Jim Edwardson is national Vice President, Professor Edwardson and Professor Ian McKeith are on the Society?s Medical and Scientific Advisory Panel, and Professor Clive Ballard (recently moved to KCL but co applicant on the Vascular Factors programme grant) is part-time national Director of Research for the Society. Members of the Brain Ageing and Dementia Group are extensively involved in public lectures, talks to carer support groups and media events organised by the Alzheimer?s Society. The links between dementia research and gerontology have been repeatedly addressed in public lectures, talks to lay groups and in popular books and articles by Professor Tom Kirkwood. Ethical issues around ageing and health, and the health and welfare of older people are addressed in a number of forums. There is a ?Medical Ethics in Gerontology Group? (MEGG) within the IAH involving clinicians, basic and social scientists, philosophers, ethicists and interested lay people. MEGG has strong links with the ?Policy Ethics and Life Sciences? Research Institute which is a cross- university collaboration between Newcastle and Durham. Several conferences involving PEALS and the IAH have been held, including ?The Ethics of Ageing Research? and ?Dementia ? Mind, Meaning and Personhood?. A conference on ?Brain Repair: Exploring the Ethical and Social Limits of Neurosurgery-based Interventions? is currently in planning. The IAH enjoys good relationships with the local media. In the context of this application, it is worth noting that in the media frenzy following Alder Hey when NBTR representatives were interviewed, the Newcastle Journal carried the headline ?More Brains Needed for Dementia Research? and we have had no significant problems in obtaining consent for brain donation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400074","grantId":"G0400074","fundValue":"955656","fundStart":"2005-01-10","fundEnd":"2009-11-09","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Grant McKeith","coPersons":["Raj  Kalaria","Tuomo  Polvikoski","Robert Henry Perry","Chris  Morris"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
