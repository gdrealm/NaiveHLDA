{"id":"D14974F3-19DB-4BE0-BDE9-6B5E183AD6A2","title":"LAWYERS IN SOCIETY 1258-1558","abstractText":"<p>This project will yield an historical reconstruction of the social milieu and ethos of members of the legal profession in medieval and Tudor England. It will complement what we know of the legal world inhabited by lawyers by examining their private lives: how they conducted themselves, how they managed their estates and households, where they lived, what their houses were like, their cultural pursuits and the nature of their marriages and alliances. The project assesses how men of law fitted into local society and by tracing their social aspirations, achievements and disappointments, evaluates the permeability of class boundaries and the acceptability of new entrants to the aristocracy. It examines evidence of lawyers’ view of themselves, including how they represented themselves to neighbours and the general populace (especially in portraits and funerary monuments). It also analyses the overlaps between their public and private worlds, especially lawyers’ recourse to the courts in a private capacity and their role within aristocratic networks. In so doing the project endeavours to calculate the location and distribution of lawyers within specific towns and regions and contextualise the perceptions engendered by activities carried out in a professional capacity.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E025633/1","grantId":"ES/E025633/1","fundValue":"80640","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Joseph Musson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
