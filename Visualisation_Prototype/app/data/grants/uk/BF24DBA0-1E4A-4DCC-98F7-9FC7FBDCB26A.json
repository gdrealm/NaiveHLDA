{"id":"BF24DBA0-1E4A-4DCC-98F7-9FC7FBDCB26A","title":"The meaning of wellness and resilience for older people with osteoarthritis: a qualitative longitudinal study","abstractText":"The self-image of older people with chronic illness is often that of someone who can ‘keep going’ (resilience) and who therefore rates their health as good (sense of wellness). However, in accessing support and services they may feel the need to emphasise their difficulties, undermining this image.\n<br />\n<br />In this study the concepts of resilience and wellness in people with a long-term painful condition – osteoarthritis – will be explored. The study will also look at how people with osteoarthritis use health services, the changes in how people think about themselves and their condition, and what factors are linked to these changes.\n<br />\n<br />These areas will be investigated using an approach which is driven by the participants. Initial interviews with people with osteoarthritis will be carried out and then diary sheets will be sent to them each month. They can then choose whether to be contacted that month and how they wish to communicate their experiences with the researchers. Options will include interviews, unstructured diaries, email, audio-recordings and photographs.\n<br />\n<br />It is anticipated that this research will contribute to understanding of how older people can maintain their health and independence and how they can access support and services without presenting themselves as ill.\n<br />\n<p></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2812","grantId":"RES-000-22-2812","fundValue":"71919","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Richardson","coPersons":["Janet Claire Grime","Pauline Bie Nio  Ong"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
