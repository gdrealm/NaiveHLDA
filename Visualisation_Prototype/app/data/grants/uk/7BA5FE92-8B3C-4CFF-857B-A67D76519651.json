First of its kind in the world, the&nbsp;series brings together practitioners and policymakers with researchers from a range of disciplines including Adult and&nbsp;Organisational Learning, Sociology, Industrial Psychology, Human Factors Engineering and Ethnomethodology to provide new&nbsp;theories, methodologies and organisational change methods that can be applied by organisations to improve learning from safety incidents across a range of industries.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Running for two years, the series comprises six interdisciplinary seminars,&nbsp;including presentations from researchers, practitioners and policymakers, allowing sufficient time for debate and discussion and stimulating co-production of knowledge. The series includes participants from the UK, Finland, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Norway, among other countries. Outputs from the seminar series include an interdisciplinary research agenda in learning from incidents&nbsp;and an edited volume, synthesising scientific contributions from research and relevant case studies from industry.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000512/1","grantId":"ES/L000512/1","fundValue":"28961","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Not yet - the project is still in progress.

Seminars included a wide range of speakers and participants nationally and internationally from a variety of disciplines across Social Sciences, Life Sciences and Engineering and sectors, including academia, 3rd sector organisations (British Safety Institute, professinal bodies (Energy Institute), government (HSE), and the industry (BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Dana Petroleum to name a few). The seminars raised awareness of the importance of learning from incidents in the industry and exposed the participants to the wide range of disciplinary and sectoral research, practices and policies in learning from incidents. We have secured participation of a significant number of representatives of research users (amounting on average to a third of the total number of the series participants), including a range of industries, government, and professional and third-sector bodies. In the short- and medium-term, these potential beneficiaries' exposure to innovative, interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological insights from a range of disciplines they do not yet collaborate with could trigger insights for novel applications within their own organisation. The concepts and thinking they help evolve through the seminars will stimulate fresh ideas, which these beneficiaries are committed to taking back to and implementing within their organisations, and potentially integrating these into their operational plans and activities. Co-production of series outputs by industry and policy stakeholders alongside researchers extends shared ownership, improving the likelihood of adoption and application of research in real-world settings.
