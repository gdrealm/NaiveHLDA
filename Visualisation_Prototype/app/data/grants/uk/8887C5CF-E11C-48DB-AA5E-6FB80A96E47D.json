In particular the research will compare the rate and impact of internet-based or online forms of contact to more traditional or offline methods such as by phone and face to face in recent elections in two countries - the US and the UK. To date, there has been only limited investigation of the extent and effect of online contacting compared with other modes and much of it has been done in the US.</p>\n\n<p>The project will extend this understanding by analysing a range of original and existing data that includes the 2012 the American National Election Study and compare it with findings from the 2010 British Election Study. The comparative element of the research will allow for an examination of the extent to which political context shapes the nature and impact of these contacts.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J019453/1","grantId":"ES/J019453/1","fundValue":"22726","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Results were disseminated at the 2013 American Political Science Association's annual meeting in a very well attended panel that provided a retrospective evaluation of the 2012 Presidential election and included eminent scholars of U.S. politics. Key findings were also presented in a paper presented at a specialist academic workshop organized by the PIs in Manchester. Other international experts in the study of voter mobilization presented papers (Green, Hansen, Schmitt-Beck, Panogopoulos, Pattie, Fisher), and we developed a proposal for a special issue of Party Politics on 'Voter Mobilization in Context' which has been accepted. The papers including our own are currently under review with publication likely in 2015. Publishing our work in this special issue will maximize its scientific impact given the established reputation of the contributors. Results from the study were presented by Prof Gibson to the public at the Scottish Parliament's 2013 Festival of Politics where she joined a panel of media and campaign experts discussing the value of social media (this included Michael White of the Guardian). Findings have been publicised through blog posts for the Democratic Audit run by the LSE Public Policy Group and University of Manchesters 'Westminster Watch', and a report for the current ESRC Britain in 2014 magazine. Key findings will be disseminated to A level students in a forthcoming issue of the Sociology Review that the PI has been asked to contribute to.

This holds true whether contact comes directly from the party or indirectly i.e. it is mediated through online social networks. This latter finding is significant in that it counters the widely publicised findings of a so-called 'Facebook effect' on turnout reported in Nature using experimental methods. \nThird, beyond turnout, there is evidence from our results to suggest that online contact may be a way for campaigns to maintain engagement among their activists.\nFourth, our study shows there has been a slight fall in rates of overall contacting in the U.S. and UK over the past decade, particularly of more personalized forms. Given that this has occurred during the period where campaigns have switched to use more online tools, this indicates e-campaigning may be becoming a substitute for traditional methods. \nFinally, despite the fall in use of more traditional methods, our results show that U.S. parties are much more likely to engage in direct online contacting than their UK counterparts. Levels of indirect online contact, i.e. political messages from friends and family about one's vote however are similar across the two countries. This discrepancy is very interesting in that it confirms that British parties lag behind their American counterparts in the use of web campaigning, but that the public at large are just as comfortable to use the new tools to interact about politics during the election. \nThese findings suggest that there is a need for further analysis of the levels and impact of online contacting on turnout and other types of campaign activity in countries outside of the two cases examined here in order to assess whether they apply across different institutional contexts. We will undertake this analysis in a paper now accepted for presentation at the 2014 American Political Science Association Meeting (APSA). We will examine the same questions in at least 10 other countries that have conducted the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) module of questions on which our analysis is based and use multi-level modelling techniques to analyse the data. The findings from the research are useful to political parties and candidates in the U.S. and UK particularly in that they show that contacting voters through personal i.e. face to face methods remains the most important way to ensure they vote. Use of digital channels do not appear to be particularly helpful in this regard. That said, the use of web campaigning appears to be important in sustaining levels of involvement of activists and ensuring existing volunteers and members are kept involved. Also while online methods of contact may not be effective on their own, an investment by campaigners in understanding how they can be used to increase and support better offline contacting would seem to be a worthwhile step. In particular, this suggests the merits of a two-step approach to voter mobilization and disseminating the campaign message whereby digital communication and resources are used to support activists who then go on and engage in wider personalized canvassing.\nThe findings are also of strategic value for campaigners in political organizations more generally, i.e. third sector groups and community campaigners seeking to engage more people in a cause or issue. Based on our findings a clear recommendation is that such groups would do well to focus on how to use digital channels to support and extend their face to face and personalized forms of contacting. Online contact may be quicker and cheaper but at least based on current trends is not particularly effective. Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
