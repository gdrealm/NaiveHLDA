Community groups themselves will be encouraged to specify the kinds of research areas and methods where collaboration or help would be welcomed. We are especially keen to involve those who have encountered barriers to enjoying the heritage, and an important part of our project will be the role to be played by local and virtual communities in the interpretation of their own backgrounds and surroundings, including web- and digital-based activity to encourage virtual volunteering as a communal activity, undertaken both by people who are connected by place and/or by shared experiences and interests.\n\nAmong our partners will be the National Coal Mining Museum for England, English Heritage, the Royal Armouries, as well as local community groups, with all of whom we shall be working to develop ideas for projects involving free access to archive materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013463/1","grantId":"AH/J013463/1","fundValue":"19804","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2012-12-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our project set out to extend public engagement in research for community heritage.

There is a large appetite for such participation, although the form it takes and the ways in which it expresses itself vary from place to place. Hence, while we put much the same effort into promoting open days at Barnsley and Oldham, Barnsley was predisposed to greater participation by its existing tradition of community history, whereas the prevailing view we met at Oldham was that the town offers little or nothing to be interested in. Yet Oldham's potential for community heritage is as rich as anywhere. While great effort was aimed at hard-to-reach groups, there is more to learn about how this can be targeted. \n\nBarnsley taught us that too large a group at an open day can be unwieldy: presenters can find themselves spread thinly if they are much in demand during informal sessions or sub-groups, the researcher contributions run the risk of becoming lectures rather than interactive exchanges, while eager community groups may be vocal and keen to ask questions, perhaps at the expense of others. This was reinforced at Oldham, the second and least well attended open day, which was nonetheless particularly productive because of the scope for extended discussion and exchange that this intimacy enabled. We accordingly factored this into the planning for Huddersfield, where we ran a number of parallel sessions, most of them repeated at intervals through the day, so that visitors could hear about and discuss more than one subject, and informally meet different researchers in between.\n\nPresentations given at two open days told of a previous oral history project on the experience of Anglo-Bangladeshi first generation migrants. The work was clearly important; we heard that those who had consented to take part had done so because the recordings were being made by members of their own community, and there had been scope and time for preliminary confidence-building contact. The results accordingly included material that might not have come to light in any other way. However, the makers of the survey had gathered more material than could be processed under the original grant. Moreover, they were determined to publish the transcriptions in their entirety (and were raising further funds from the Bangladeshi business community to do so) and saw this as taking priority over editing or a strategy for dissemination. While this witnessed impressive commitment, it also suggested that provision of practical guidance at an earlier stage would have been beneficial. Our experience suggested that some groups are already well able to engage in the 'hunter gatherer' stages of research and need little advice from academics in doing so. The areas in which the kinds of support we could best provide lie rather in the area of underpinning skills - e.g. editing, indexing of digital images, means of description for databases, publication, and archiving of data. More knowledge of the nature and scale of demand and/or need for such skills would inform support for public engagement.\n\nTwo of the successful All Our Stories public engagement community heritage projects engage those who have experienced mental illness and learning disability to enable them to tell their own stories. The findings in this area are important and deserve wider currency. Environment,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
