It will investigate how interactive technologies can promote older peopleâ€™s engagement with their physical and social environments, and encourage new forms of interaction with younger people. Designers and cross-generational participants will co-design novel interactive devices and situations will be created that challenge age-based stereotyping and encourage younger participants to reflect on ageing. Detailed analysis of participant's experiences with the devices and systems will provide a rich source of information for the design of future innovative technologies and services and also help specify best practice for involving older people in design.</p>\n\n<p>The project will proceed by 3 case studies: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Window-on-the-world - will focus on engagement with the local environment to explore issues of mobility and sense of place</li>\n\n <li>Digital Place - explores virtual worlds as a medium for older people to interact with one another and with younger people</li>\n\n <li>Engagement in the public sphere - develops systems for public places to support interaction with the wider community.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-352-25-0030-A","grantId":"RES-352-25-0030-A","fundValue":"73419","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  There were two material outputs from the project, namely the Photostroller, and the Prayer Companion. \n\nThe Photostroller was relocated from the Residential Home for which it was designed and deployed for over 18months (Jacob's House), when it closed. It is now being used in a nursing in York (Lamel Beeches) . \n\nIn addition to academic publications (see findings), we have undertaken 2 art exhibitions to raise awareness of ageing and technology, including the City Screen in York, and our residential home, which was open to the public during the exhibition. There has also been significant press and media publicity for the project locally, nationally and globally, totalling 10 releases including;\nThe Prayer Companion has been selected for exhibition at MOMA (The Museum of Modern Art) in New York, one of the world's most prestigious galleries. which receives 2.5 million visitors annually. \n\nThe Prayer Companion and the Photostroller have been nominated for Ars Electronica, the world's premier festival of art, technology, and society. \n\nA ?500K follow-on proposal was submitted to the LLHW programme.

We explored this question in two very different settings: a cloistered monastery, and a care home. These settings gave contrasting views of the experience of growing older. Having taken vows of enclosure, the nuns might seem to have turned away from the very engagement that interests us. But during our visits, the nuns explained that their prayers of intercession embody their commitment to community. In response, we built them the Prayer Companion, a device that gathers information from social networking and news sites to help keep their prayer pertinent. In the care home, we pursued a variety of 'design experiments' to explore the residents concerns including, a 'video window' on the world; events in which local artists and school children painted portraits and wrote poems with and about the inhabitants; and shared slide shows from the world wide web. Building on these experiments we developed the Photostroller, a device which allows the residents to influence the themes of a on demand Flickr slideshow. Not only did our designs directly benefit our participants, but they taught us a number of lessons: perhaps most importantly, that when designing technologies for the older old it is crucial to recognize their diverse social and spiritual concerns and values, and avoid viewing them solely through a lens of frailty and need.\nThese findings are reported in the following publications\nGaver, W.B., Blythe, M., Boucher, A., Jarvis, N., Bowers, J., and Wright, P.
