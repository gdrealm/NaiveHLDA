DNA itself is generally organised in highly compacted structures, in particular supercoils in which the helical axis of DNA is coiled about itself. Supercoiling has a dramatic effect on the expression of genes and has been shown to act as a global regulator of gene expression. Our understanding of how supercoiling influences the behaviour of DNA is far from complete, particularly at the molecular level. Therefore we have developed a model system involving small DNA circles that we can analyse both by experimental methods and computer modelling. By combining these experimental and theoretical approaches we aim to understand how DNA recognition is affected by supercoiling, and how we can use supercoiling to influence biological processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I019294/1","grantId":"BB/I019294/1","fundValue":"437374","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Not aware of any use yet; grant still running  ","person":"Anthony  Maxwell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":" We have set up a model system to understand the effect of supercoiling on the interaction of protiens and drugs with DNA.
