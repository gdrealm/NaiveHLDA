A major constraint to global food security is crop loss due to plant pests and diseases. With the increasing stringency of conditions under which chemicals are approved for agriculture, the choice of effective fungicides and pesticides will become more limited in the near future. Furthermore, as introgressed host resistance genes are rapidly defeated by pathogens and pests in the field, there is an urgent need to explore sources of disease and pest resistance that are durable and will provide long term food security.\nPlants face a constant barrage of pest and microbial threats and defend themselves by employing at least two layers of inducible defence responses. The first layer involves recognition of Pathogen-Associated-Molecular-Patterns (PAMPs) by cell surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to mount PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Successful (adapted) pathogens secrete and deliver molecules, effectors, inside host cells to suppress these defences. The second defence layer involves recognition of effectors by immune receptors, or NB-LRR proteins, to evoke effector-triggered immunity (ETI). This recognition is often based on detection of changes by NB-LRRs in the conformational/biochemical state of host proteins that are targeted by effectors. \nMost plants are resistant to most pathogens, which is termed non-host resistance (NHR). By definition this is effective against all genetic variants of a pathogen species, and thus durable. Effector recognition by NB-LRR proteins has been proposed to be a major determinant of NHR in plant species that are closely related to the pathogens' natural hosts. In contrast, evidence exists that inducible NHR in plant species that are distantly related to the pathogen's natural host(s) is the result of the inability of effectors to appropriately target plant proteins and suppress immunity. Recent progress in the identification of plant pathogen effectors, and their targets, has opened new avenues to investigate the contributions of these proteins to determining non-host resistance.\nThis proposal aims to generate a key understanding of the role of effectors, their targets, and NB-LRR proteins in non-host resistance in the Solanaceae. The Solanaceae include economically important food crops, such as pepper, tomato, and potato, the latter being the world's fourth largest food crop, and the second largest in Europe after wheat. \nWe will exploit effector sets from 2 important solanaceous pathogens with differing host ranges: the oomycetes Phytophthora infestans (infects potato and tomato but not pepper) and P. capsici (infects pepper and tomato but not potato). We will assess the contribution of Phytophthora effectors to defining host range. Our key objectives are to (i) assess whether effectors trigger NB-LRR-mediated immunity in non-host solanaceous plants, and (ii) whether inducible NHR in Arabidopsis, constitutes a failure of effectors to modify intended targets and thus suppress PTI. We will exploit the genome sequences of potato, tomato, N. benthamiana, N. sylvestris and pepper to identify targets for P. infestans and P. capsici effectors. We will then be able to investigate their role in mediating effector recognition in non-host solanaceous plants.\nThe proposed work will shed light on the contribution of NB-LRRs, and the effector targets they monitor, to NHR within solanaceous crops. We will establish an essential platform that determines the molecular basis of NHR, identifies the critical effectors that activate NHR and paves the way to targeted searches for associated genes. Moreover, we will identify Arabidopsis PTI regulatory components, insensitive to effector activity, that can be deployed in Solanaceous crops. This approach will build a highly durable barrier to infection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K018183/1","grantId":"BB/K018183/1","fundValue":"270697","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The scientific progress of this project has been reported to the scientific community at various national and international meetings including the OMGN meeting (Norwich 2014), MPMI (Rhodes 2014) and COST FA 1208 (Zakopane, Poland).

The first part of this objective was to clone priority effectors from P. infestans and P. capsici into plant expression vectors. Following microarray studies performed in-house for P. infestans, 90 RXLRs-containing virulence determinants were cloned into agro-binary vectors. These have been cloned into the plant expression vector pGRAB, and 77 have so-far been cloned into the viral vector pGR106 (PVX). Following homology-based MCL clustering and microarray studies for P. capsici, 50 RXLR-containing virulence determinants have been cloned or synthesised and are currently being transferred into plant expression vectors. \nThe second part of this objective was to identify recognition events of RXLR-containing virulence determinants in non-host plants. We determined that PVX was the best vector for RXLR expression screens in genotypes of potato, pepper, and tomato. However, agro-infiltration of expression constructs into Nicotiana sylvestris provides the most reproducible and facile screening procedure for potential NHR recognition. N. sylvestris emerged as a promising route to seek candidate NHR resistance genes - it is diploid, the genome has been sequenced, and transient expression is as facile as in N. benthamiana. Critically, as a common non-host, any follow-up work to seek R genes could involve cloning all R gene candidates from only this plant for subsequent functional assays in N. benthamiana with recognised effectors from both P. infestans and P. capsici.\nAs a result, all 90 P. infestans RXLRs have been expressed in N. sylvestris in replication and 12 P. infestans RXLRs are recognised in N. sylvestris, 5 of which are Avrblb2 family members. Of the remainder, 5 have not been associated to our knowledge with recognition in the host potato. Screens of P. capsici effectors on N. sylvestris will commence in the coming months. \n\nObjective 2 aimed at establishing whether effector activity determines pathogen host ranges within Solanaceae and/or Arabidopsis by identifying host protein targets of candidate effectors from P. infestans and P. capsici. \nOn a previous grant (BBSRC LOLA), &gt;70 Pi effectors have been screened to considerable depth in a potato-P. infestans interaction Y2H library. This has revealed approx. 200 potato proteins as candidate targets of these effectors.\nAs our ultimate aims are to transfer Arabidopsis (At) orthologues of Pi/Pc effector targets into Solanceous crops (potato, tomato, pepper), we have focussed on Arabidopsis as a main priority. As part of the previous grant indicated above, 90 P. infestans RXLRs have been screened against the set of 12000 Arabidopsis genes cloned into yeast that has recently been reported for screening by effectors from G. orontii (Wessling et al 2014 Cell Host-Microbe 16:364-375). This has formed a basis to compare the non-host interactome of Pi-At with the host interactomes of At with H. arabidopsidis (Hpa), P. syringae tomato (Pst) and G. orontii. Analyses of the data are ongoing.\nSo far, more than 160 candidate At orthologues of the potato proteins interacting with P. infestans RXLRs have been cloned into yeast for Y2H analyses.In addition, an N. benthamiana Y2H library has been made as part of a separate grant which we can use for screening with P. capsici and P. infestans RXLR effectors.\nTo identify the potential targets of novel and shared RXLRs from P. capsici, a number have been screened in the N. benthamiana Y2H library. The At orthologues of potato interactors (following P. infestans RXLR screens) have themselves been screened against 90 P. infestans effectors and against all cloned effectors from Hpa. Potential breakdown of interactions for several Pi RXLRs with At orthologues of their interactors in potato has been observed. Interestingly, several of these are nevertheless apparently targeted by effectors from the host-adapted pathogen Hpa, suggesting they are 'common' targets The Industrial partners Simplot and Syngenta have expressed significant interest in the Arabidopsis orthologues genes of Solanaceae host targets that, however, evade the interactions with P. infestans/ P. capsici RXLR effectors. This work will be part of Objective 4 that is due to commence in year two. Following this screen and verification, selected Arabidopsis orthologous genes will be transformed into Solanaceous plants for detailed resistance testing.
