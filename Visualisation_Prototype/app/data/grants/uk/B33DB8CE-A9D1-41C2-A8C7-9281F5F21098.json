It is currently possible to screen dairy and beef cattle genomically, but responses to selection are impeded by waiting for the gestation of the calf on which genomic selection is performed. The screening of bovine embryos, however, would optimise the delivery and amplification of superior genetics by advancing the time of selection and reducing &quot;wastage&quot; of unwanted calves of inappropriate sex. This project will, therefore, combine advanced embryo breeding technologies with state-of-the-art genomic screening (so called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis), and karyomapping (combining parental DNA information with the offspring's genomic information to provide more genetic detail). It will develop strategies for: (i) optimal bovine embryo culture using sexed semen, (ii) embryo biopsy in order to extract a small number of blastomeres for genomic analysis, (iii) karyomapping SNP genotype data from Multiple Displacement Amplification products and (iv) ehnancing pregnancy establishment of frozen-thawed embryos. Proof of principle that the new technologies can be used to deliver superior genetics more efficiently to the breeding herd will be confirmed by conducting genomic analyses of calves.\n\nImportantly, this project is geared towards the development and use of a unique and highly marketable product (i.e. genetically evaluated sexed embryos) that will deliver superior genetics to the global market at low cost, and in a high-welfare and bio-secure manner. This will have huge economic benefits for the UK based commercial companies concerned, and for both the dairy and beef sectors of the UK cattle industry; and ensure that the UK remains at the cutting edge of technical innovation retaining its competitive advantage over larger breeding companies currently situated in Europe, North and South America.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L017415/1","grantId":"BB/L017415/1","fundValue":"126535","fundStart":"2014-01-06","fundEnd":"2016-01-05","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  As the project only started in January 2014, it is too early to say  ","person":"Kevin  Sinclair","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" Work currently in progress (commenced January 2014) with no outputs to report.
