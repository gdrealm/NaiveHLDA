The human automatic signature verification (ASV) modality is a key player in the biometrics market with particularly strong uptake in financial, legal and retail security. While considerable research has been conducted into the assessment of the algorithmic performances of biometric technologies, a range of new issues concerning the measurement of usability factors within biometric systems have emerged which require urgent attention following large scale deployment of public systems. A vital component in selecting and implementing a biometric system is to ensure that it performs adequately to meet the security requirements of the application. Conventionally this has been measured using a number of error rate metrics including false accept rate (FAR - the number of impostors erroneously verified as genuine by the system) and false reject rate (FRR - the number of genuine subjects rejected as being impostors), alongside other metrics assessing the rate of successful enrolment and biometric sample detection by a sensor. Although widely used to provide an indication of computer-based system performance, these statistics do not quantify other errors contributing to the overall performance of the system, specifically i) relating to the environment within which the system is used and ii) how the test subject interacts with the system. As biometrics become more widespread and the community becomes more experienced in testing and evaluation, standardised testing methodologies and their associated evaluation metrics need to be re-examined. This application seeks funding for the development of research collaboration links between the Image and Information Engineering Research Group at the University of Kent and the Biometrics Standards, Performance and Assurance (BSPA) Laboratory at Purdue University, US. Both partners in this proposal have recently independently worked on novel methods for the performance evaluation of biometric systems and, recognising this complementarity in methods, have held informal research planning discussions electronically as part of the ISO International Standardisation processes within which both centres are actively involved.In this study we will combine the research strengths at the two institutions to assess and apply the Human Biometric Sensor Interaction (HBSI) framework to the ASV modality by establishing how users interact with signature devices and systems beyond the normal system performance metrics.Specifically this application is to enable the PI to travel to Purdue to: 1) facilitate further interaction between the two research centres, 2) to define an experimental procedure to investigate the usability of ASV systems using the HBSI model, 3) to implement a cross-Atlantic data collection exercise to enable ASV system interaction to be analysed and 4) to facilitate the presentation of talks, teaching material and generate future research initiatives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I014608/1","grantId":"EP/I014608/1","fundValue":"8952","fundStart":"2010-10-30","fundEnd":"2012-01-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Development of signature usability metrics have been incorporated into the international standards on human/system performance.\n\nThis work has enabled the development of a number of further funding applications both in the UK and US and furthermore has resulted in a signficant amount of join work being undertaken by the Universities of Kent and Purdue (including joint PhD supervision).
