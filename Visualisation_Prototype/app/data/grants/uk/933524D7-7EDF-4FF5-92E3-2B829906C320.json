{"id":"933524D7-7EDF-4FF5-92E3-2B829906C320","title":"Business Models for Sustainable Industrial Systems","abstractText":"Research and practice on business model innovations to support industrial sustainability is developing rapidly. However the long-run implications of such innovations are poorly understood and unquantified. There is limited understanding of the behavioural characteristics of manufacturers and consumers needed to support successful innovation for sustainability. Consequently, the sustainability benefits of business model innovations often fall far short of expectations and can be counter-productive. This proposal seeks to advance the study of industrial sustainability by extending the application of agent-based modeling techniques to explore system-level implications of sustainable business models. The research will build an understanding of the impact of business models on the industrial system. It will identify key leverage points which will support industrialists and policymakers in facilitating greater triple-bottom-line sustainability. The project will produce guides for manufacturers and researchers to enable investigation and experimentation with alternative sustainable business model innovations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L019914/1","grantId":"EP/L019914/1","fundValue":"352523","fundStart":"2014-06-30","fundEnd":"2017-06-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Yvonne Barlow","coPersons":["Elisabete A.
