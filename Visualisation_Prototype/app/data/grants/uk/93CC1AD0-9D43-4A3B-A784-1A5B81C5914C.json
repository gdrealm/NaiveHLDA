The aim of this project is to undertake research to underpin the development of new oilseed rape varieties with increased resistance to insect herbivory. Exposure of plants to UV-B wavelengths, which are a natural component of sunlight, has been shown to reduce the attractiveness of plants to insect herbivores by altering plant chemical composition. Several plant responses to UV-B are mediated by a protein called UVR8 and the defence response to herbivory involves the regulatory molecule jasmonic acid. In this project, we will examine the potential of UVR8 and a protein called MYC2 that mediates the response to jasmonic acid to increase resistance to insect herbivory in oilseed rape. We will test whether transgenic over-expression of specific genes increases resistance to insect herbivory as 'proof of concept' that manipulation of the UV-B response could be used to develop new varieties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I017518/1","grantId":"BB/I017518/1","fundValue":"377625","fundStart":"2011-09-17","fundEnd":"2015-05-25","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth Islwyn  Jenkins","coPersons":["Anna  Amtmann"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
