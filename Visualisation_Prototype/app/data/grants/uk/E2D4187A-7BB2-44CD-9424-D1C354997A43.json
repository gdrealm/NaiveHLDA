By manipulating the stimuli along some dimension, and measuring the change in the subject's response, we can infer something about the properties of the underlying visual system. Unfortunately, such measures of the intact/complete visual system do not grant us direct access to the processes that intervene between the stimulus and response. Physiologists, by contrast, have the advantage that they can make recordings within the (non-human) visual system by inserting electrodes directly into visual pathways. The use of visual nonlinearities goes some way to redress this imbalance. With them, the psychophysicist also has an 'electrode' with which to record and introduce signals within the visual pathways and so functionally 'dissect' the human visual system. In this project, we propose the novel use of visual nonlinearities to study the two primary human visual pathways, the chromatic and luminance pathways--from the inside. A visual nonlinearity is a stage in the visual pathway that distorts signals that pass through it to produce new signal components that were not present at its input. The two nonlinearities that we will study distort sinusoidal flicker signals to produce--in addition to flicker--a steady change either in colour or in brightness, which appear superimposed on the flicker and disappear when the flicker is turned off. For example, a red disc of light (c. 670 nm) can appear yellower when it is flickered (colour distortion) or a greenish-yellow disc (c. 565 nm) can appear brighter ('brightness enhancement'). Figures 1 and 3, below, illustrate these effects for flicker that slowly varies in amplitude ('amplitude-modulated flicker'). By carefully manipulating the stimulus presented to the subject, and thus the new signal components produced at the nonlinear site, it will be possible to measure separately the temporal frequency responses before and after each nonlinearity. Two nonlinearities will be investigated in the M- and L-cone pathways: one, which is compressive, causes flicker bursts to change in apparent colour and saturation, while the other, which is expansive, causes them to change in apparent brightness. Our expectation is that we will be able to determine separately the early and late properties of the two principal human postreceptoral pathways: the putative chromatic and luminance pathways, and thus provide new insights into the postreceptoral organization of the human visual system and the processing changes going on in them. The colour and brightness changes that we will investigate are distinct: first, because they can occur separately, and, second, because they are consistent with different types of nonlinearities (compressive or decelerating in the case of colour; expansive or accelerating in the case of brightness) and different percepts. Taken as a whole, these observations suggest the exciting possibility that the two nonlinearities are in the luminance and chromatic pathways, the two principal postreceptoral pathways in the human visual system. We believe that this project will provide a unique window into the internal workings of the human visual system, and will identify key signals and sites that will yield to physiological and/or anatomical study in other species.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E016235/1","grantId":"BB/E016235/1","fundValue":"359191","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Stockman","coPersons":["Lindsay Theodore Sharpe"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" Flickering monochromatic lights near 560 nm appear brighter than steady lights of the same mean intensity, whereas lights near 520 or 650 nm appear yellower. Both effects are consistent with the visible distortion of the representation of the visual input signal at a nonlinearity within the visual pathway, but the brightness enhancement is consistent with an expansive nonlinearity whereas the hue change is consistent with a compressive one.
