Such stresses result from the highly localised application of heat, which in turn leads to localised thermal contraction strains that are incompatible with material further away from the weld. A conventional strategy for reducing weld residual stresses would involve subjecting the item of interest to a post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) procedure, whereby it would be heated to an elevated temperature for a specified duration. However, if components are large or thick-walled, a PWHT operation is often not possible once they are assembled. As a consequence, high levels of detrimental tensile residual stresses often reside in the vicinity of welds.In the past few years an exciting area of research has emerged, based on the possibility of exploiting the solid-state phase transformations that occur in steels in order to mitigate the residual stresses that arise during welding. These transformations, or changes in the arrangement of atoms, have associated strains which, depending on the transformation mechanism and temperature, can be engineered to compensate for the thermal contraction strains that arise as a weld cools. In this way the design of smart weld filler metals with carefully engineered transformation temperatures could lead to dramatic reductions in the residual stresses that arise in welds, thus inspiring the development of a new philosophy for welding, based on prevention rather than cure . However, there are still some significant obstacles to the potential of this low-transformation-temperature (LTT) technology being realised. Firstly, in order to optimise the transformation temperature of a steel, it is vital that the magnitude of the transformation strains can be predicted beforehand. Other important challenges include the ability to design steels that have optimised transformation temperatures while also meeting other important material property requirements such as being tough or resistant to corrosion.In this work, the aim is to quantify the extent to which two mechanisms of transformation plasticity (i.e. Greenwood-Johnson transformation plasticity and variant selection) contribute to transformation strains in steels during welding thermal cycles. Greenwood-Johnson transformation plasticity arises, during a phase transformation, when the growth of a hard or strong daughter phase induces plastic flow (deformation) in the softer parent phase. Meanwhile, variant selection occurs when the presence of mechanical stress during a transformation favours the formation of some crystal orientations over others, leading to a transformation strain that is dependent on direction within the material. In quantifying the contribution of each of these mechanisms, a framework will be established for the inclusion of both mechanisms for transformation plasticity in to finite element models for welding.In this work state-of-the-art diffraction techniques will be applied, using neutrons and high energy X-rays, to investigate some complex aspects of the behaviour of steels during a solid-state phase transformation. The results that are obtained with these techniques will be validated against measurements made by more conventional means, such as dilatometry. This research will assist in the development of new steels that have improved performance after welding, and it will also improve our ability to assess the remaining life and likely performance of existing welded steel structures.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H048294/2","grantId":"EP/H048294/2","fundValue":"58237","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  It is too soon to assess the impact arising from this work.  ","person":"John Anthony  Francis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" Transformation plasticity refers to an irreversible strain that arises within a material due to a solid-state phase transformation taking place. In steels, there are two primary mechanisms by which transformation plasticity can manifest. One of those is referred to as the Greenwood-Johnson Mechanism and the other is referred to as the Magee mechanism. Prior to this work, the extent to which each mechanism might contribute to the overall transformation strain in welded joints was not clear. In this work we have obtained preliminary evidence that the Greenwood-Johnson mechanism is active in an important nuclear steel. To date, there is no evidence that the Magee mechanism is active in this steel. The findings arising from this work will be of benefit to professional engineers who estimate the stresses within nuclear components, and particularly those stresses arising from welding and other processing operations. Practitioners of computational weld mechanics will be able to focus on accounting for the Greenwood-Johnson mechanism when estimating weld residual stresses, while knowing that there is a preliminary basis for excluding effects associated with the Magee mechanism for the steel under investigation in this work.
