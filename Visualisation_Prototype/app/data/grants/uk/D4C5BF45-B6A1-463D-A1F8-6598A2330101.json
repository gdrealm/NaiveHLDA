Over 250 sterols and related compounds\nhave been reported in plants, insects, vertebrates and lower eukaryotes such as yeasts. Steroid hormones control cell\nproliferation and tissue differentiation and modulate gene expression. Hence, steroid based pharmaceuticals are important\nfor human and animal health in; (a) disease prevention (antitumor, anti-estrogenic); (b) disease therapy (cancer, obesity)\nand (c) life-style choices (menopause, human fertility). As a result, about 300 approved steroid drugs exist to date and the\nnumbers are growing. Indeed the market for steroid drugs lies second only to that for antibiotics; the global market for\nsteroids is in excess of US $10 billion and more than 1,000,000 tons annually. In recent years the conversion of\nagricultural, food or cellulose industrial wastes containing phytosterols into high value steroid compounds has become a\nhighly attractive goal. However studies to date indicate that improvements are needed in phytosterol culture broth solubility,\nmicrobial strains, and product recovery. Project MySterI will focus on improvement of the known bioconverting bacterium,\nMycobacterium sp. NRRL B-3085, to replace the existing microbial/chemical multistep processes with single-step\nproduction processes for androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (AD) (intermediary precursor), 11alpha hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-\ndione (11-alpha-OH-AD), 3beta-hydroxyandrost-5-ene-17-one (DHEA) or testosterone from phytosterols. The use of singlestep\nbioconversion processes will reduce costs and loss of yield associated with the multistep processes, and will be\nenvironmentally cleaner. The MySterI pipeline includes the development of genetic engineering tools, strain improvement\nsupported by 'omics information, scale down and up process and simplified product recovery, all of which comprise a\ncomplete improvement of the production process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L003619/1","grantId":"BB/L003619/1","fundValue":"312246","fundStart":"2013-06-10","fundEnd":"2016-06-09","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret Caroline Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
