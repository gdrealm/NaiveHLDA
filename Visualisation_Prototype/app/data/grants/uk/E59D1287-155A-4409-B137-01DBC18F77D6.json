{"id":"E59D1287-155A-4409-B137-01DBC18F77D6","title":"Negotiations and Dynamic Accumulation","abstractText":"<p>The main focus of the project is to investigate repeated bargaining situations, within a game theoretical framework, in which the agreement negotiators reached at one round affects the situation parties face in the next round (dynamic accumulation). In particular, the main aims of the project are to answer the following questions:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>What are the main incentives that negotiators need to take into account when they bargain over a current agreement given that this affects future bargaining possibilities?</li> \n <li>What are the features of the equilibrium agreements that parties can reach when they can affect future negotiations?</li> \n <li>What are the implications for policy makers and regulators involved in these types of conflicts?</li>\n</ol> \n<p>The projectâ€™s research area is relatively neglected within the substantial bargaining literature, despite many real-life negotiations are characterised by dynamic accumulation. For instance, parties with ongoing business relationships or political parties do not solve disputes in a single set of negotiations, but they must return to the bargaining table to build on/revise existing agreements.</p> \n<p>To provide further insights about negotiations characterised by dynamic accumulation, the theoretical framework will then be applied to specific problems. Policy implications will be also derived.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0084","grantId":"RES-061-23-0084","fundValue":"26144","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Francesca  Flamini","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
