The research provided a comparative examination of similarities and differences in the ways in which a sample of undergraduate students at four universities adapted (or did not adapt) over time in relation to a range of personal, pedagogical and situational factors.</p>\n\n<p>Questionnaire surveys of 1,288 students and in-depth case studies of a sub-sample of ten of these students provided new data documenting the way in which personal, educational and situational factors impacted on international students, the way these students reacted and adjusted in different conditions and at different times during the course of their studies, and how such experiences impacted on them personally and on the pursuit of their studies.</p>\n\n<p>The systematic, mixed method approach enabled the study to reveal the complexities of international students' transitional experiences both in terms of their maturation and human development and their intercultural adaptation within a different educational environment and a different culture and society. These two types of transition interactively influence the nature and process of students' change and development over time. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E007643/1","grantId":"ES/E007643/1","fundValue":"71619","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Qing  Gu","coPersons":["Michele  Schweisfurth","Christopher  Day"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" The systematic, mixed method approach enabled the study to reveal the complexities of international students' transitional experiences both in terms of their maturation and human development and their intercultural adaptation within a different educational environment and a different culture and society.
