Approximation theory has many applications,including monitoring computer networks and in computer graphics forgames. I hope to use my own expertise in computer algorithms tocontribute to interesting new research at the interface of Mathsand Computer Science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D052262/1","grantId":"EP/D052262/1","fundValue":"29782","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-09-24","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rajeev  Raman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
