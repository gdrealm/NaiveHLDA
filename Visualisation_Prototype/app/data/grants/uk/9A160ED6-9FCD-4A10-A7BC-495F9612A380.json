The overall aim of the work is to promote community connectivity in bringing to the fore the different layers of interaction, meaning and identity which are placed upon the existing local landscape and its features. Work is set in a cross disciplinary context (architecture, haptics, well-being and art practice) with collaboration with a local community group and an international landscape practice. The findings will be assessed to help inform future research, including the implications for community, the wider well-being agenda, art &amp; design practice and associated policyareas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011711/1","grantId":"AH/J011711/1","fundValue":"31981","fundStart":"2012-02-09","fundEnd":"2012-08-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Prytherch","coPersons":["Cathy  Treadaway","Richard  Coles"],"organisation":"Birmingham City University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
