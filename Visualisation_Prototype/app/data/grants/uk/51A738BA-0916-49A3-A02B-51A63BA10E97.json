The purpose of this mission is to gain insight into how buildings and infrastructure performed during this earthquake and the consequent effect on the local community. To do this a team of six people will spend approximately 1 week in the field collecting data. On their return, this data will be analysed using novel disaster management tools that will be developed as part of the project and the findings disseminated to both researchers and professional engineers. This grant application seeks financial assistance for the academic members of the EEFIT group to participate in this mission.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H043616/1","grantId":"EP/H043616/1","fundValue":"28046","fundStart":"2009-11-06","fundEnd":"2010-09-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sean  Wilkinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" The key findings of this ifield investigation are \n\noThe design and construction of schools was such that they had poor earthquake resistance and as a result, schools suffered very badly. \n\noThe engineered buildings observed in Pariaman, although much closer to the epicentre, seemed to fare better than those in Padang (although this is difficult to say with certainty as there were far fewer of them). The reasons for this seemingly superior behaviour could have been due to either the focus of the earthquake being very deep and/or different soil conditions in the two areas resulting in significantly different characteristics of the ground shaking or differences in the quality of the design and construction of buildings in the two regions.\n\noIn Padang, extensive damage was observed in many engineered buildings. Implementation of strong column/weak beam design philosophy has not been widely adopted in Padang and so soft storey collapse was the major failure mode observed in engineered buildings. \n\noThere were examples of buildings that had received strong ground shaking (evidenced by the major damage to masonry infill) that had suffered little structural damage. This suggests that the latest Indonesian earthquake code, its design practices and construction, is capable of providing the guidelines for designing and constructing buildings that are seismically sufficient for an earthquake of this intensity (structurally, at least).\n\noThere was extensive major damage to masonry infill. This is a major problem with West Sumatran (and possibly Indonesian) construction. \n\noIt is likely that buildings are either not being designed to the code, or what is being designed is not being constructed (although this may only be true for older buildings). Building supervision and approval procedures should be revised.\n\noThe response of lifelines was variable, with the major problems resulting from lack of electricity for 10 days, damage to the main water line, and lack of mobile phone coverage. Temporary water tanks, water storage trucks, and transportable, diesel_generator mobile phone masts were used as short_term solutions. The main Padang hospital (Dr. M. Djamil) responded well and effectively gathered its resources to treat all incoming patients from surrounding areas. \n\noTsunami evacuation plans need to be revisited. The warning time for the tsunami is too long to effectively stop the evacuation response due to non tsunamigenic earthquakes and the evacuation routes may be inadequate for tsunamigenic earthquakes.\n\noBuilding foundation failures were minimal in Padang, which indicates proper foundation design for engineered buildings in general. Settlements were most significant near the coast, with continuous cracks on floor slabs of buildings and flexible road pavements. Evidences of soil liquefaction in the form of sand boil deposition and upheaval of floor slabs were observed. Lateral spreading was also seen along the coastline.\n\noLandslides are a major threat to this region. The landslides visited by the team can only be described as &quot;enormous and lethal.&quot; The greatest number of deaths from this earthquake resulted from landslides and there was very little chance of survival for the residents of the houses in the paths of the landslides. Considering there is likely to be another event in the not_too_distant future, there is an urgent need to assess the risk posed by earthquake induced landslide in Western Sumatra. The devastating effect that these landslides had on the communities in Pariaman is also a very strong argument to perform hazard assessment in other regions of the world. our publications on landslide hazard assessment, could be used to inform policy on risk to communities in the region and our methodology could be used to assess landslide risk in other regions Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction","dataset":"gtr"}
