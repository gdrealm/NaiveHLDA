These are;</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>How schools can nurture behavioural change to support sustainable communities;</li>\n\n <li>The factors which lead individual learning to create spill over effects into family and community;</li>\n\n <li>The skills and knowledge necessary for teachers and other school based practitioners to engage students more effectively in the promotion and development of sustainable lifestyles;</li>\n\n <li>How different international approaches to the development of skills and knowledge for sustainable communities can interact with local inquiry based processes to inform the development of future strategies on sustainable communities.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The project works with six schools that are working with agencies who are delivering programmes of education for sustainable development. The project supports community peer research and action research processes in each of these schools. These feed into a wider forum which enables learning across the schools and by other organisations working in the field.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-182-25-0038","grantId":"RES-182-25-0038","fundValue":"54640","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Barry  Percy-Smith","coPersons":["Danny  Burns"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
