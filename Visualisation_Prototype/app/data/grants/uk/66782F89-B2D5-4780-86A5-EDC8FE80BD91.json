The quick eye movements made to move gaze from one point of interest to another are called saccades. These are the most common movements made by man; on average three times a second. We can manipulate these movements in the laboratory to force motor adaptation to take place over a short period of time, a process called saccadic adaptation. At present it is not precisely known how or where the brain process the changes that underlie this adaptation. \n\nModern techniques in neuroscience allow us to manipulate the excitability of the brain in healthy subjects. The techniques are temporary, harmless and painless. The stimulation is accurate and specific enough to allow us to alter the activity in a small part of the brain to investigate whether that area is involved in saccadic adaptation. We will use two techniques i) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and ii) transcranial direct-current stimulation (TDCS). TMS can be used to temporarily interfere with a small region of the brain. We will use this technique to probe sites in the brain during saccadic adaptation. At present we think that there are several that are involved in the process, both the cortex and an area at the back of the brain called the cerebellum. \n\nNerve cells in the cerebellum become more excited when the saccades are adapted to become larger than they originally were, and less excited when saccades are adapted to become smaller. Depending on the polarity of stimulation TDCS can be used to excite or inhibit brain activity. Therefore, using TDCS to excite cells in the cerebellum should facilitate the adaptation of saccades to become larger and hinder the adaption to decrease saccade size. The exact opposite should be the case if we use TDCS to lower excitability of cells of the cerebellum. We will test this idea. The results will not only inform us about the nature of the mechanisms of adaptation but will also affirm the theory of how we think TDCS works, which as a novel technique is not entirely understood.\n\nWe will also investigate how the output of the cerebellum changes, as the saccades are adapted. Some patients with tremor have surgery to implant electrodes into a part of the brain called the thalamus. Stimulation of this part of the brain can reduce tremor. The technique is called deep brain stimulation. The procedure is done in two operations, one to implant the electrode, another to implant the stimulator a week later. In the intervening period we can record neural activity from the electrode. The part of the thalamus implanted is the part of the structure that receives input from the cerebellum. We have already recorded eye movement related activity in this part of the thalamus. If the electrophysiological changes that are seen in monkeys during adaptation are replicated in humans, we will see changes in the electrical activity in the cerebellar outflow as recorded in the thalamus when the subjects adapt their saccades.\n\nFinally we will also record local field potentials from the cerebellar thalamus at rest and during eye movements before and after TDCS. An Increase or decrease in cerebellar excitability induced by TDCS we be seen as predictable changes in electrical activity in the thalamus. In this way we will be able to better understand how TDCS influences the excitable properties of the brain. These final two undertakings will be first such recordings in human physiology.\n\nOur plan of work will not only provide invaluable new information on where and how in the brain adaptive mechanisms occur but will also shed light on the mechanisms of the developing technique of TDCS. Such information will be invaluable for assessing plastic and induced plastic strategies for rehabilitative interventions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J004588/1","grantId":"MR/J004588/1","fundValue":"332624","fundStart":"2012-09-30","fundEnd":"2015-09-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ned  Jenkinson","coPersons":["Rowland Christopher Miall"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
