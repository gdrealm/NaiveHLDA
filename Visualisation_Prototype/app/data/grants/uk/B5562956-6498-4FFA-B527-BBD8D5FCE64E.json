{"id":"B5562956-6498-4FFA-B527-BBD8D5FCE64E","title":"Exploring Gendered Inclusion in Contemporary Organizations","abstractText":"The last three decades have seen an unprecedented rise in the number of women in work and the mainstreaming of the equal opportunities agenda. In this context, we are also witnessing a growth of postfeminist rhetoric, suggesting that gender workplace equality has been achieved and that women's progress now depends on individual capabilities, such as confidence levels, because structural barriers have been dismantled. In Sheryl Sandberg's words, women simply need to 'lean in' in order to succeed alongside their male colleagues. Despite this optimism, academic research continues to highlight disadvantage experienced by women in the workplace, such as the gendered pay gap, the glass ceiling, women's concentration in lower-paid industries and low representation at senior levels, comprising only 8.6 per cent of directors in large UK firms in 2015.\n\nUnderstanding this paradox has direct implications for academic research, as well as for organizations, employees and policy makers. How can we talk about, theorize and formulate new policies to facilitate an inclusive and fair workplace when gender inequality is believed to have been 'solved'? This question is especially relevant given the recent government agenda to get more people into paid work. The current theoretical focus on gender exclusion lacks power to account fully for new and/or often less visible patterns of contemporary gender workplace inequality. Therefore, we suggest that, in order to advance these debates, a shift is required from analysis of exclusion to a critical analysis of gendered inclusion in the workplace and the different forms it takes.\n\nThis seminar series will make a timely contribution by providing the first forum for multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder discussion of gendered inclusion. We seek to challenge the simple dichotomy in which exclusion has a negative connotation whilst inclusion is seen as always positive. Instead, we aim to gain a more complex and critical view of the notion of gendered inclusion by exploring contemporary workplace gender roles and expectations. How can inclusion be defined? Under what conditions and to what extent are women and men included in organizations? How is inclusion maintained and negotiated? Has the increase in the number of women challenged dominant gender norms, expectations and workplace culture? How do men fare in contemporary organizations in which new forms of gendered inclusion have emerged? How might existing patterns of gendered inclusion generate new forms of workplace inequality?\n\nTo debate these issues we aim to bring together scholars from a variety of international contexts (UK, Europe and North America) and disciplines (organization studies, sociology, cultural studies, politics, media, etc.). Given the novelty of this discussion, one of our main objectives is to actively engage PhD and early career researchers in the development of the field. We also aim to stimulate a dialogue with businesses, civil society groups and policy makers to explore how organizational and state policies may be shaped to facilitate more effective gender workplace inclusion.\nThe series will comprise seven one-day seminars over 28 months. Seminars 1 and 2 will debate changing workplace expectations and roles in a contemporary postfeminist and neoliberal context, and explore the concept of, backdrop to and rationale for critical exploration of gendered inclusion. Seminar 3 will be an interactive workshop exploring various ways to study gendered inclusion. Seminars 4 to 6 will examine different work contexts through the gendered inclusion lens, debating the nature of women's and men's inclusion in large organizations, traditional and new industries, the field of entrepreneurship, and leadership and managerial positions. Seminar 7 will draw conclusions, set out future research agendas and debate the possibilities of using a critical inclusion lens to explore intersectional workplace inclusion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N008685/1","grantId":"ES/N008685/1","fundValue":"26412","fundStart":"2015-11-02","fundEnd":"2018-11-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Adamson","coPersons":["Patricia  Lewis","Martyna Anna Sliwa","Nicholas Michael  Rumens","Elisabeth Kristina  Kelan"],"organisation":"Middlesex University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
