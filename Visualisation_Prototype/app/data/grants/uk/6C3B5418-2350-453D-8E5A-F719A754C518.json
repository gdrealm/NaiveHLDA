The spectrum of illness is wide, from considerable fatigue with skin rash and joint pains at one end of the spectrum to severe renal disease, which may cause renal failure and early death, at the other end. Lupus tends to occur in young women and affects all human populations; it is more common in those with Asian and African ancestry. We have a limited understanding of what causes the immune system to start this inappropriate attack on the body. The disease has a strong genetic component; there are many genes involved in influencing lupus: each gene exerting a modest effect on risk. If we can identify the genes and establish how they affect immune function, we can gain fundamental insight into how the disease develops and how best to treat individuals who suffer from it.\n\nConsiderable advances in genetics have been made over the last decade: examples include the sequence of human genetic material, DNA (Human Genome Project) and increasing understanding and cataloging of how this DNA sequence varies between people. DNA can be pictured as a code; variations in DNA code (or sequence) alter the structure and function of genes that are coded in the DNA. Genes affect the growth, function and development of the body, including the immune system. It is hardly surprising therefore that difference in the DNA code alters immune function and thereby influences the development of immune-related diseases, such as lupus. \n\nWe can compare the pattern of variation in DNA between healthy subjects and those with any particular disease, such as SLE. If we perform these studies in large numbers of subjects (thousands) we can build up a list of differences in DNA code that are much more likely to occur in individuals with disease when compared with healthy people. Studies in SLE reveal about 50 such examples, many of which are shared by other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The next important question is to determine how these genetic differences affect immune function and by implication how they alter disease risk. One major hurdle preventing progress on this question is identifying the exact difference in the DNA code that affects disease. Although we state that 50 such differences across all human DNA have been established, we are not able to pinpoint the actual disease-causing genetic difference. This is because gene differences that a close to one another are usually inherited together. Thus, the 50 genetic factors in lupus are actually strings of 50 correlated gene DNA differences. Untangling some of these strings is the purpose of this project.\n\nHow do we achieve this unraveling? The pattern of these related strings varies according to inheritance and ancestry. We propose therefore to investigate a subgroup of 7 of the 50 lupus DNA regions by sequencing the DNA from people with SLE from European, Indian, west African and Chinese ancestries. This will provide a comprehensive catalogue of all the DNA differences that exist. We will then compare these pattern and frequency of these differences in SLE cases and healthy controls from these four ancestries. We know that the length and composition of the associated strings of correlated DNA variations differ in these ancestries. By lining them up against one another we can determine which DNA differences are consistently present in the disease group. Once we have established what the precise location and nature of the DNA code that affects disease, we can begin the process of working out how the genetic factors influence immune function. If we do not precisely locate the causal alteration in the DNA code that affects disease all subsequent experiments to pursue function will be flawed. This study is an essential component of future work on the genetics of autoimmune disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L002604/1","grantId":"MR/L002604/1","fundValue":"120560","fundStart":"2014-01-13","fundEnd":"2015-04-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy J Vyse","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
