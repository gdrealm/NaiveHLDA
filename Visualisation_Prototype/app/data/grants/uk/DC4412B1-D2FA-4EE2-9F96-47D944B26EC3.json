{"id":"DC4412B1-D2FA-4EE2-9F96-47D944B26EC3","title":"Specification Tests for Nonlinear Time Series","abstractText":"&nbsp; This research will develop new methods of evaluating econometric models to be used for forecasting, policy simulation and theoretical investigations. Recent researches in model construction make heavy use of nonlinear features such as models of conditional volatility, threshold models, regime switching etc. However, the techniques of evaluating models of this type have not kept pace with these developments. We do not yet know how to say whether a complicated nonlinear model gives a coherent account of the data. This is in contrast to the theory of linear models, whose evaluation has been extensively researched. There is a pressing need to make up this theoretical deficit, which has particular consequences for areas of practice such as financial modelling and policy analysis. This research will provide reliable and computationally simple tools for testing the validity of estimated models in nonlinear time series. Although, the research will be mainly theoretical, the new class of omnibus specification tests that will be developed has strong implications for the empirical researchers and practitioners allowing them to establish more reliable conclusions about a wide range of economic theories and to obtain accurate forecasts.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2845","grantId":"RES-000-22-2845","fundValue":"81969","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James Eardley Davidson","coPersons":["Andreea Gabriela Halunga"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
