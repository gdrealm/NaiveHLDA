Most previous scaling studies have characterized bone shape with length and midshaft diameter and quantified loading on the bone with the mass of the animal. In this interdisciplinary study we will integrate engineering analyses, including image analysis, detailed mechanics, kinematics measurements and statistical shape modelling to determine how bones change across a range of species and sizes. We will investigate 5 species from each of the following clades: bipedal birds, mammalian carnivores (cats, dogs, wolves, lions), Macropodoidea (kangaroos, wallabies), bovine artiodactyls (hoofed mammals), and catarrhine primates (terrestrial monkeys). We will use computer tomography images, similar to 3D x-rays, to determine the structural characteristics of the bone that affect the bone's mechanical properties and its ability to withstand load. We will measure the locomotor behaviour of each animal using a multi-camera motion analysis system and force plates. This will allow us to determine joint angles, ground contact forces, limb positions, and stride characteristics that are integral components of locomotor behaviour and hence bone loading regimes. Using a range of statistical techniques we will determine the relationship between bone structure and the locomotor behaviour. The shapes of some irregularly-shaped bones, such as the scapula and pelvis, are difficult to quantify. Unlike long bones where structural measures, such as cross-sectional area, are simple to determine, irregular bones have no obvious dimensions to measure. Statistical shape modelling overcomes this difficulty by creating a virtual model of the bone and comparing its shape to an average bone. The technique considers all variability and highlights were the most variability in shape occurs. These statistical shape models can be used to predict the shape of the corresponding bone in a joint. This technique would prove extremely useful for palaeontologists who often have incomplete skeletons and must predict the shapes of missing bones. It will also show how closely the shapes of articulating bones are linked via their interrelated loading regimes. Bone is made up of tiny spicules called trabeculae. The size and orientation of the trabeculae are influenced by the loading on the bone. Few studies have examined how the trabecular structure varies across species. We will obtain trabecular bone samples from each species and image them using microCT, which has a resolution up to 5 micrometers. We will obtain standard 3D measures of the trabecular structure, such as trabecular thickness and orientation. Trabecular structural measures will be correlated with locomotor parameters in order to determine how the loading, size, and locomotor behaviour influences bone micro-structure. Our study will also take research on musculoskeletal scaling into a new, extremely integrative direction. We have designed a study that (1) examines all bones in the appendicular skeleton at multiple structural levels, (2) uses a wide range of taxa and sizes, (3) applies a mechanistic approach to understanding bone structure and locomotor behaviour, and (4) employs rigorous statistical techniques to determine relationships between structure and function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F000863/1","grantId":"BB/F000863/1","fundValue":"335577","fundStart":"2008-01-30","fundEnd":"2011-01-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our bone scaling work has led to a new industry collaboration with F+P (architecture firm), with PhD student starting 1 October 2014.

We developed novel techniques in both arenas (analyzing bone structure and quantifying gait patterns) and have also developed a new open-source software platform for analysis of images (boneJ.org). Prior to this project, the majority of scaling studies examined a limited number of variables (mass, length of the bone, and diameter of the bone at mid-shaft), which provide a limited indication of bone mechanics. \n\n\n\nOur novel analysis methods of bone structure included 3-dimensional morphology along the entire length of the bone. This revealed that the scaling at the mid-shaft is different than scaling at the ends of bones around the joints. We have analyzed four clades of animals and revealed differences in scaling trends across clades. \n\n\n\nGait analysis was performed in zoos and wild animal parks with marker and markerless systems with a force plate(s) in the ground to record ground reaction forces. Analysis of the kinetics (forces) during animal locomotion is particularly novel across such a wide range of species (28 species, walking and running gaits for multiple individuals). We have developed our own code on a Matlab platform for obtaining joint angles and joint moments from 2D or 3D data.. We will be sharing this code with others in the community once our initial publications are accepted. \n\n\n\nThe most wide-spread impact of our research has been in the development of BoneJ, an open source plug-in for the imageJ platform that automatically analyzes image data for standard parameters. It was developed because of our frustration with commercial software and is intended to analyze the cross sectional properties of bones from computer tomography images. However, one year after its release, we realize the user group is incredibly diverse ranging from morphology of marine coral to design of nuclear reactors. The adoption of boneJ across many disciplines has happened for a number of reasons: 1) it is free; 2) it is open source so users can see how all calculations are made, 3) it is extendable and allows for other features to be easily added, and 4) we have developed a incredibly responsive user group culture, fostered primarily by the support given by Michael Doube, the PDRA on the grant at Imperial. \n\n\n\nThese contributions have established a new standard in scaling research, pushing the boundaries of traditional scaling studies to exploit current technical and computing methods, and have assembled a staggeringly large database of bone images and experimental data on locomotion. BoneJ software is open source and has been put to broad usage by &amp;amp;gt;8000 others already-- \nhttp://bonej.org/\nand\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bonej-users-and-developers Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
