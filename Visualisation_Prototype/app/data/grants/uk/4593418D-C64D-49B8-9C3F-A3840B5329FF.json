{"id":"4593418D-C64D-49B8-9C3F-A3840B5329FF","title":"New Multimedia Tools for Electroacoustic Music Analysis","abstractText":"The term 'electroacoustic music' refers to a wide-ranging body of work for which sound quality (timbre) more than pitch is the focus of the musical material and its working (though pitch is not excluded). It is composed and performed using electronic technology. Works exist in whole or in part in recorded form and/or ('live electronic music') produced through real-time sound production and transformation. For the most part composers work directly with sound (performed, recorded or synthesised) and rarely use traditional notation. It is not a single genre, but a cluster of practices and approaches around these core themes (for example, 'classic acousmatic', glitch, electronica, plunderphonics and others).\\n\\nAn analytical understanding of how the music works is less developed than for other kinds of contemporary music. There have been important attempts to establish basic principles of examining the music (for example, by Pierre Schaeffer, Denis Smalley, St&eacute;phane Roy) but these have been fragmented, not agreed on terms, the 'units' of the music or how best to approach the representation of the music visually. There has been little empirical application and evaluation of these procedures. In addition it has sometimes not been clear whether the analysis has referred to the composer's intentions or to the listener's possible perceptions and interpretations. While not excluding the composer's testimony, this project will focus on the listener's point of view.\\n\\nThis project proposes to establish an analysis research programme for this cluster of genres of music. This will draw together existing methods, engage the latest interactive and hypermedia tools, and apply them to a range of works to compare their strengths and weaknesses. This aims to illuminate both the procedures and the works. We will be better able to judge what analytical approach (or approaches) would be best suited to gain an insight and understanding of a particular genre of the music. A number of new xtensions, developments and refinements will result in a newly developed software application ('E-Analyse' derived from iAnalyse (Couprie 2009)) which can apply a range of possible approaches.\\n\\nThis can be articulated in five component objectives:\\n(1) Tool assembly: to assemble a wide range of analytical approaches and software applications, sorting out descriptive language, selectively to filter each to an appropriate, useful and useable tool set.\\n(2) Appropriate representation: examining the representation of the music, what is (and is not) encoded in different representation approaches, comparing and evaluating the available tools;\\n(3) Comparative evaluation: application of a wide range of procedures to a very wide range of works across all genres of electroacoustic music; evaluation of appropriateness/effectiveness of an approach with respect to genre;\\n(4) Making the toolkit coherent: proposals for extensions and improvements to the assembled tools; empirical testing and evaluation on a range of works.\\n(5) Software development and innovation (E-Analyse)\\nBased on the existing freeware package iAnalyse (Couprie 2009), in which additional tools for representation, parsing, grouping, specific to the needs of electroacoustic music are added. This will necessarily be informed by the preceding.\\n\\n\\nThe results of the music analysis generated by the project (including the results of three Research Symposia (year 2) along with additional specialist commissioned contributions would result in a book with integrated DVD-ROM (including E-Analyse and worked examples). There would be website distribution of the E-Analyse application (e.g. MTI and EARS). Outcomes would further include a range of journal articles and conference presentations on individual issues. The team would consist of: the two applicants, 1 researcher (part-time) and 1 research student advised by a small international group of well-known specialists in the field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H039937/1","grantId":"AH/H039937/1","fundValue":"300005","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Emmerson","coPersons":["Leigh  Landy"],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
