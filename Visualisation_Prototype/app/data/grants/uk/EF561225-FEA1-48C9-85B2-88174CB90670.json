All decisions involving uncertainty run the risk of failure. When decisions begin to go awry decision-makers may face a dilemma: do they persist in the hope of turning matters around, but at the risk of compounding their difficulties; or do they cut their losses?</p> \n<p>The dilemma may be experienced in all sorts of decisions whether to quit a fading romantic relationship, scrap a car that is in danger of becoming a liability or even just whether or not to carry on waiting for a bus.</p> \n<p>The focal question of the research project is why do some decision-makers quit sooner rather than later and why do others appear to persist until the bitter end?</p> \n<p>The research will involve interviews with indoor market traders in the north of England. Times change and many are being forced out of business. How and why do owners decide ‘enough is enough?’ Despite the poor prospects, new entrants continue to set up business and frequently fail within months or even weeks. The most important aim for practice is how can owners learn to make better decisions?</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1909","grantId":"RES-000-22-1909","fundValue":"65764","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helga  Drummond","coPersons":["Julia  Hodgson"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
