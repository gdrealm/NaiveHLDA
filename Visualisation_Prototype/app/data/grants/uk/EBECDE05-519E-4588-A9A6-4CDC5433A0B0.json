{"id":"EBECDE05-519E-4588-A9A6-4CDC5433A0B0","title":"Spectral Analysis of relativistic operators","abstractText":"The existence, or non-existence, of zero modes and resonances have profound implications for the stability of quantum mechanical systems described by the associated differential operators. For instance, the stability of matter problem concerns the question of whether the energy of the system of particles is bounded from below, and explains why some molecules exist and other configuration of particles do not. The proposal is to study such questions for a wide class of operators which includes the important standard ones of mathematical physics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E04834X/1","grantId":"EP/E04834X/1","fundValue":"3814","fundStart":"2007-04-07","fundEnd":"2007-07-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"William Desmond Evans","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
