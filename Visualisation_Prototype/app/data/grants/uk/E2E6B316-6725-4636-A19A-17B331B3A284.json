Developed by an interdisciplinary group of leading UK scientists, it will collect extensive information on the health, development and life circumstances of a new generation of children born in the UK. Engagement with policy-makers, practitioners and users will ensure that new knowledge gained will improve the lives of children now and in the future.</p>\n\n<p>This study will create a rich longitudinal data resource comprising social and biological measures, and biological samples, and linked routine health and administrative data that can be used to address hypotheses regarding early life origins of health and disease, and of physical, psychological and social well-being.
