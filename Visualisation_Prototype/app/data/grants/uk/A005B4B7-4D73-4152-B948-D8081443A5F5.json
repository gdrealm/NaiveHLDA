Staff from each organisation have spent time in the other's organisation, joint grant proposals have been developed with one has successfully awarded and another in submission. Joint publications are underway (one in press). In addition, skills have been exchanged in ways that have benefited PhD students on both sides.

One joint project is directed at understanding how attention gets distracted by motivationally salient objects (a USA grant in submission) and another examines a whole range of decision making processes in people in middle age (an ESRC funded project). The project is producing new ideas and skill sets. Thus the academics involved and their students at all levels are benefitting. The early career members of the group are also benefitting by widening their networks and skill sets. The successful grants coming out of this collaboration will have additional beneficiaries, depending on the specific project. Creative Economy,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
