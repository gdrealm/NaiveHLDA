In our work we bring together a variety of scientists and researchers from a range disciplines, alongside some of those most affected by this disease threat (including those running major sporting venues, the transport industry, and petting zoos). This unique team will then work together to produce the groundwork for a major research application on understanding infection spread, and potential aways in which infection risk can be best managed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902431","grantId":"G0902431","fundValue":"37599","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin  Goodwin","coPersons":["Ka Man Lai","Nigel  Cook","Eric  Fevre","Bryan  Teixiera","Garth John Holloway","Mark  Jit","Michele Graziano Ceddia","Hilary  Pickles","P  Johnson","David  Schley","Michael Edmond Price","Lynn  Myers","Shamsul  Haque","Richard  Stephenson","Julie  Barnett"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
