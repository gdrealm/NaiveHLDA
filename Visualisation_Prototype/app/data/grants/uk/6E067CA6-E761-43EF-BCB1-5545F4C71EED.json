{"id":"6E067CA6-E761-43EF-BCB1-5545F4C71EED","title":"Crafting Electoral Authoritarianism: The Russian Case","abstractText":"<p>Elections in Russia have become steadily less 'open' since the Beslan hostage-taking crisis of 2004. The most important changes include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>\nan entirely new election law that abolishes the single-member constituencies and thus all independents, </li>\n\n <li>\nabolition of the direct election of regional governors,</li>\n\n <li>\nabolition of the 'against all' voting facility, </li>\n\n <li>\nabolition of minimum turnout requirements.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Taken together, these changes have been described as a form of 'nondemocratic consolidation' that is intended to provide an indefinite tenure of office for the ruling group that is presently concentrated around the Putin-Medvedev presidency.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The application seeks to examine the practice of such changes within the context of comparative electoral politics while giving due weight to the specificity of the Russian experience. The primary focus will be placed on a programme of interviews with senior officials and others most directly involved in these recent changes; the research strategy also incorporates a quantitative (survey) dimension and a qualitative (focus group) dimension, extending recent work on participation, (dis)engagement and orientations towards government. It is hoped to make a contribution of international significance to both the comparative and Russia-specific literature in all of these areas. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G005125/1","grantId":"ES/G005125/1","fundValue":"257943","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Leonard White","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
