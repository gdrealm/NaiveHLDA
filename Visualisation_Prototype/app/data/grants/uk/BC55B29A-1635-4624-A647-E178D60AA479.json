{"id":"BC55B29A-1635-4624-A647-E178D60AA479","title":"The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Fibre Systems - interim funding","abstractText":"DESI is a ground-based dark energy experiment to study the cosmological expansion rate and the growth of structure with a wide-angle spectroscopic galaxy and quasar redshift survey. A wide range of additional science is possible using the 5000 fibre multi-object spectrograph required for this experiment, including studying galaxy formation and evolution, galaxy cluster surveys, the structure of the Milky-Way galaxy and Galactic archeology.\n\nIn order to undertake the proposed survey, a US-Europe-China collaboration led by the US Department of Energy has come together with the aim of constructing a 5000-fibre spectrograph that will deploy on the Kitt Peak Mayall 4m-telescope. The key science goals represent a field in which the UK has world leadership and strong scientific interest, built up through STFC support for participation in the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Dark Energy Survey.\n\nThe conceptual design review is scheduled for 28-30 Jan 2014 (CD1). Formal construction starts Oct 2014 (CD-2) contingent on passing CD-1. Installation should start in 2018 followed by start of observations later the same year. The project will be funded by a mixture of DoE money and institutional buy-ins including contributions in-kind. Durham will be requesting support from STFC to provide the fibre system for DESI as part of an in-kind UK buy-in. \n\nContinued development funding up to the conceptual design review is sought for two key areas of hardware development where the UK has internationally regarded expertise - the optical corrector, and the fibre system, and will retain UK involvement in this project.\n\nThis request is for interim funding for Durham to continue the development of the fibre systems begun (as BigBOSS) under STFC grant ST/J004642/1 and an earlier grant from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\nDESI will deploy 5000 fibres simultaneously over the wavelength range 0.4-1 um with a spectral resolving power ~4000. Durham CfAI has internationally-recognised expertise in the production of highly-multiplexed fibre systems. This includes the fibre termination and encapsulation together with the fibre-management system designed to minimise stress which would otherwise degrade performance.\n\nManpower for R&amp;D: 4 staff-months to support our chief fibre specialist Graham Murray. His participation is critical. Some mechanical design support (David Bramall) for e.g. cable design. Senior academic support, including theoretical development, will be provided by Durham University (Jeremy Allington-Smith) with management support from Gordon Talbot.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L003015/1","grantId":"ST/L003015/1","fundValue":"39542","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  Allington-Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
