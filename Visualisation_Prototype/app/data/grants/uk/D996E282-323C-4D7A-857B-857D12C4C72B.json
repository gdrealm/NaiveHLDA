Psychological research has established that there is one investigative tool that consistently produces detailed reports from an eyewitness without reducing accuracy, namely the Cognitive Interview (CI). While many police forces will be familiar with the CI in some form, its potential as an investigative tool to counteract the effects of suggestive questioning has never been explored in any depth. The only study using adult witnesses suggests that the CI could reduce somewhat the debilitating effects of misinformation but it is not clear how critical the timing of the interview is. </p>\n\n<p>Using a realistic crime simulation and by manipulating the timing of the CI (before/after) misinformation, this study will attempt to reduce false memories arising from the use of a procedure (forced confabulation) where witnesses are encouraged to confabulate their responses. In addition to the analysis of quantitative data (number of correct/incorrect details and accuracy) the interview transcripts will be coded for relevant qualitative information. For example, we will examine the relationship between participants' overt verbal resistance to answering the false event questions and their likelihood of developing false memories.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F017367/1","grantId":"ES/F017367/1","fundValue":"71750","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Amina  Memon","coPersons":["Brian Regan Clifford"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
