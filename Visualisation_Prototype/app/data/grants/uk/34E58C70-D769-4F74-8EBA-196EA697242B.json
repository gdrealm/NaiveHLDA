{"id":"34E58C70-D769-4F74-8EBA-196EA697242B","title":"Congo's War: The Legal Dimension of a Protracted Conflict","abstractText":"The research examines the legal questions raised by the on-going conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It evaluates within a determinate context the problems raised when the UK Charter regime-designed to operate in an inter-state framework - is applied to a conflict encompassing non-state actors. The project investigates two legal dimensions: (1) the normative consequences of 'state failure' within the broad framework of public international law rules on use of force; and (2) the role, place and potential pitfalls of judicial mechanisms in resolving disputes that involve the use of force (focusing on Congolese cases before international tribunals).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112869/1","grantId":"112869/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Phoebe  Okowa","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
