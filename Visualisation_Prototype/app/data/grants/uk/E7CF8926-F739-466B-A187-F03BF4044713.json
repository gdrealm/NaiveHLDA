Currently available inactivated vaccines against these viruses are produced in embryonated eggs and have several disadvantages. We have developed a novel live virus vector-based vaccine exploiting herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) as vaccine vector. The vaccine was prepared in cultured cells, and a single dose of vaccine delivered into eggs before hatch or after hatch induced life-long immunity in vaccinated chickens. Vaccinated birds showed protection against both highly pathogenic AI and Marek's disease when challenged at six week post vaccination. \n\nThis project will enhance potency and efficacy of the HVT-based AI vaccines that will protect birds at an early age (within three weeks of hatch). In addition, we plan to develop a trivalent vaccine that will protect vaccinated chickens against both H5 and H9 subtypes of avian influenza viruses and Marek's disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L004240/1","grantId":"BB/L004240/1","fundValue":"126746","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2015-07-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This grant is focusing in the development of new generation of vaccine.
