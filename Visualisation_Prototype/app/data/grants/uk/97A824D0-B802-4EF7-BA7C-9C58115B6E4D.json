The amniotic membrane (a membrane that surrounds a baby in the womb) has healing qualities which can be used in surgery to prevent scarring and promote healing of such corneal diseases. However, results can be unpredictable due to bio-chemical variations of the amniotic membrane. Also there is potential risk of cross-infection even though appropriate screening has been undertaken. We propose a collaboration between the Division of Ophthalmology and materials specialist (Tissue Engineering Group), to develop a synthetic material which resembles this membrane but is standardised and readily available. Currently, we are able to grow cells which are beneficial to the wound healing process in vitro. We hope to combine this technology with the expertise of material scientist to generate an artificial matrix that will support the growth of these cells and may be used to aid wound healing of the ocular surface. This material can be of benefit in reconstruction of other tissues of the body.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601773","grantId":"G0601773","fundValue":"91311","fundStart":"2008-02-08","fundEnd":"2009-02-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Naing  Tint","coPersons":["Kevin  Shakesheff","Harminder  Dua"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
