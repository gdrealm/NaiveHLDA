{"id":"B771D71B-BE90-4BA5-82A2-5C37B71C0107","title":"Multidimensional visualisation of archival finding aids","abstractText":"As archives make increasing numbers of their finding aids available online the problem for users of how to navigate this information increases. As yet, there are no easy means to visualise this information or the connections within and between it. This project will test one possible solution to this problem by creating a multidimensional visualisation of existing archival finding aids. With manipulation of this virtual map it will be possible to show different dimensions within and between collections and repositories. These dimensions could show different types of connections, such as date, names or function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119340/1","grantId":"119340/1","fundValue":"42354","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Anderson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":" This project established that it was conceptually possible to map from Encoded Archival Descriptions (EAD) to a ZigZag(TM) XML structure and that a stylesheet could be developed that automated this process.
