{"id":"1222EC68-5F94-40A8-A1CB-7F9AD490FD89","title":"Heterogeneity in the failing right heart","abstractText":"It is known that variations in the way in which the muscle cells of the left side of the heart work are important in its normal function. Changes in these variations are also important when the heart becomes diseased and may lead to a breakdown in the rhythmic beating of the heart. However much less is know about these variations on the right side of the heart, which pumps blood to the lungs. We will investigate the right side of the heart in normal and failing hearts using techniques that will allow us to link changes in structure to changes in the electrical activity of the heart. We will discover whether specific areas of the right heart are more affected by disease than others. If this is the case these regions may be useful targets for treatment of right heart failure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900524","grantId":"G0900524","fundValue":"368011","fundStart":"2010-03-31","fundEnd":"2013-09-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ed  White","coPersons":["Alan  Benson","Olivier Ghislain Bernus"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
