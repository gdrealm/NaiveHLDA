Individuals with BD characteristically experience periods of high mood (mania) and low mood (depression) that are noticeably different from their usual mood. Communication, impulse control and motivation are all affected by BD, making the delivery of consistent parenting more difficult(3,8). Children of parents with BD (CPB) are at significantly increased risk of a wide range of behavioural and emotional conditions including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, substance use, and sleep disorders, in addition to higher rates of BD compared to the general population(4,5,9). Left untreated, behavioural and emotional problems in children of parents with BD can increase their risk of future mental health problems(2,3, 10). There is a high demand for community based parenting support, yet there are few evidence-based parenting interventions(11,12).There is also high demand for psychological support for BD(13), as evidenced by the significant BD-attributed annual costs to community mental health teams in the UK(14). However, traditional parenting interventions do not address the particular needs of people with BD, and psychological interventions do not necessarily focus on parenting skills. We aim to tackle both issues simultaneously with an integrated bipolar parenting intervention. We plan to conduct a review of the effectiveness of interventions for parents with mental health problems in the literature. We will develop a package of support materials for BD drawing on our expertise of developing and evaluating interventions for BD. These materials will be reviewed in collaboration with our Service User (SU) Focus Group (FG). We will integrate this information with the evidence-based Triple P-Positive Parenting Program(15), which is a parenting intervention that aims to build positive relationships within families and manage behaviour problems in children. Triple P Online is newly available, will be accessible to large numbers of people in time, and is less expensive than face-to-face therapy. We aim to determine the usefulness of adapting Triple P Online to parenting with BD, which has the potential to reduce risk of future emotional problems for CPB. The current study builds on pilot work conducted by our team(6) which found significant improvements in both child behaviour and parenting for families with BD for those who received a Triple P Online compared to controls. The pilot had some significant imitations, including 1) There was significant drop-out (22/54 participants) possibly partly because there was no additional provision of support for use of the web materials, which has been shown to enhance engagement(7); 2) We were not able to formally evaluate longer-term effects of the intervention or impact on parental mental health; 3).The lower age limit (2 years) was too young for effective use with the key outcome measure, the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ:16). We intend to address the above limitations and explore an Integrated Bipolar Parenting Intervention (IBPI). We will ask 50 parents with BD (who have at least one child aged 3-10 years and at least 10 hours of face-to-face contact with their child per week on average) to use IBPI for four months. We will obtain information on how many use the website, how they used it, and their experiences of using it. Parents will complete questionnaires about parenting problems, parenting stress, and child behaviour problems before and after using IBPI, and after 6, 9 and 12 months. Their responses will be compared to those who did not have access to the website (TAU: n=50). We will ask a sample of participants (n=10) about their experience using the intervention and a sample of children of parent participants (n=15) about family life before and after the intervention.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J011886/1","grantId":"MR/J011886/1","fundValue":"307019","fundStart":"2012-09-03","fundEnd":"2015-03-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven Huntley Jones","coPersons":["Peter John Diggle","Rachel Mary Calam","Fiona  Lobban"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
