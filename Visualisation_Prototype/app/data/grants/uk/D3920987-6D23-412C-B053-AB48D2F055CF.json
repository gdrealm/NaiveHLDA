Many standards are ‘voluntary’ and have been developed and overseen by organisations from the private sector, sometimes working with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), to promote food safety and quality, good agricultural practice and labour standards. This project is concerned with private standards <i>initiative</i>s (PSIs) developing and monitoring these standards particularly those in developing countries. </p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Focusing on agri-food chains originating in Kenya, the aim is to explore what these standards and initiatives mean for 'governance' or the exercise of power.&nbsp;It explores what PSIs mean for regulation, how sustainable they are and how accessible and effective they may be for poor farmers and workers.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The project will develop a conceptual framework for the analysis of PSIs drawing on value chain analysis and approaches to regulation. The field work will involve in-depth qualitative study of selected Kenyan PSIs and their stakeholders using semi-structured interviews, focus groups and workshops with NGOs, government officials, horticulture firms, workers and smallholder farmers as well as European retailers and standards institutions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E013988/1","grantId":"ES/E013988/1","fundValue":"18838","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne Marie Tallontire","coPersons":["Adrienne Mary Martin","Valerie  Nelson"],"organisation":"University of Greenwich","findingsText":" Focusing on fresh vegetables and cut flowers from Kenya, the project explored what private standards and initiatives mean for 'governance' or the exercise of power. It explored the power relations amongst different groups participating in or excluded from Private Standards Initiatives (PSIs) with a view to identifying which actors were most powerful and how roles were changing. The powerful role of retailers and exporters in PSIs has been highlighted, but also how new actors such as donors, NGOs (international and national), researchers and auditors have played a role in shaping these initiatives. We showed how smallholders and workers have been effectively excluded from the debates and how NGOs that seek to speak for smallholders and workers have also been constrained. The dominant narratives of retailers have shaped views of potential solutions, whilst local priorities and alternative narratives have been sidelined or remain unarticulated. Our fieldwork in Kenya demonstrated the limited ability of PSIs to instigate transformative change. There have been some improvements in how labour rights and good agricultural practices standards have been implemented and some changes to standards and audits, but transformational change has been absent. NGOs working on labour rights and farmer voice in agricultural supply chains have found the findings useful in enhancing their understanding of how supply chains work and thereby inform their campaigns Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
