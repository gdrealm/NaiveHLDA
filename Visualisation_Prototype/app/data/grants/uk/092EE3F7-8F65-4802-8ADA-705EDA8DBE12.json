In the 90 years since 1916 the history of the battle of the Somme has been misrepresented: Winston Churchill's hugely popular account of the war, The World Crisis, in particular established a 'Somme myth' which has come down to posterity, and which was still evident in last year's 90th anniversry commemorations. The Somme, and in particular its first day, exercises an all pervading fascination, and has become a metaphor for all that was ghastly and wrong with the First World War. However, contrarily, as Lord Esher acknowledged at the time, 'the battle of the Somme settled the inevitable issue of the war'. For behind this narrow, Anglo-centric focus lies one of the world's great battles, and one of the twentieth century's defining events. It is a complex, multi-national story, of the clash of three great armies, British, French and German, which struggled for four-and-a-half months over a few square miles of strategically insignificant French countryside. Yet all three were prepared to endure this intense struggle, and to fight on afterwards. As a consequence, attitudes to war, politics and society changed, and Western Europe's three empires diverged along three separate but catastrophic paths. It is the enormity of this human experience which has precluded a dispassionate assessment of this battle as a military event and a historical phenomenon. The battle was a horrendous bloodletting; but it was also a turning point in history, contrary impression which need to be reconciled. \\n\\nThis study assesses the battle of the Somme as the turning point of the First World War, and of the modern age. To date its true significance as a global event has been mired in the many myths and clich&eacute;s of the western front. For example, English-language studies of the battle remain narrowly fixated on British military operations in 1916, in particular the failures o British generalship. This new study, encompassing events from 1914 to 1940 and domestic as well as military themes, has five objectives. Firstly, it analyses the French and German dimensions of the Somme for the first time. Secondly, contemporary responses to the battle on the home front, and the wider global response, are assessed. Thirdly, the battle's contribution to the development of 'modern' warfare is evaluated. The battle's significance for the outcome of the war is assessed. Finally, its long-term political, social and cultural impact is reviewed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F005555/1","grantId":"AH/F005555/1","fundValue":"31114","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Cited by Education Secretary Michael Gove as a key re-intpretation of the first world war in press discussion of the centenary, Daily Mail, 2 January 2014 \n\n&quot;Even the battle of the Somme, once considered the epitome of military futility, has now been analysed in depth by the military historian William Philpott and recast as a precursor of allied victory.&quot;\n\nRead more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2532923/Michael-Gove-blasts-Blackadder-myths-First-World-War-spread-television-sit-coms-left-wing-academics.html#ixzz3IfHW4Hok \nFollow us: @MailOnline on Twitter | DailyMail on Facebook\n\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2532923/Michael-Gove-blasts-Blackadder-myths-First-World-War-spread-television-sit-coms-left-wing-academics.html Other Cultural","person":"William James Philpott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
