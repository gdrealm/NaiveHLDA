Hip fracture usually leads to a loss of independence and can even increase the risk of dying in the very elderly.\n\nCurrently the risk of hip fracture is assessed based on how dense the thigh bone is using x-rays. This method is not totally accurate since other factors, such as the size and shape of the bone and how the bone is distributed, also affect the bone strength.\n\nWe aim to interpret x-rays of the hip using engineering techniques to take account of its size and structure in order to predict the strength of the thigh bone. A large number of subjects will be involved to ensure the study is reliable and useful. We hope to find ways to better identify patients at high risk of hip fracture so that they can be treated appropriately.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601272","grantId":"G0601272","fundValue":"187369","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Lang  Yang","coPersons":["Richard  Eastell","Eugene Vincent McCloskey"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
