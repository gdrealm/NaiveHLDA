In addition to communicating their work through the scientific press, members of the grouping also inform relevant disease-oriented societies through newsletters and lectures. Members of the group also regularly provide commentary on advances in human and medical genetics to newspapers, radio shows, and documentaries. The co-operative grouping will allow us to form a focal point for dissemination of information specifically related to neurogenetics. One of our key aims will be to accurately convey both the strengths and the limitations of what we know about how genetic variation influences health and disease. In addition, the grouping will continue and expand its efforts to advise both policy makers and ethics groups about developments in human genetics, as for example we have done in the past in pharmacogenetics and other areas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400017","grantId":"G0400017","fundValue":"180969","fundStart":"2005-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas William WoodDavid  Goldstein","coPersons":["Sanjay  Sisodiya","Elizabeth  Fisher"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
