{"id":"AFF78B6F-58DC-4381-A799-6D6F4D21D74B","title":"Improving the health systems response to chronic diseases in Africa","abstractText":"In recent years it has been observed that primary health care services in Africa, most of which are working under severe resource limitations, are confronted with the additional problem of a growing burden of treatable chronic diseases (CDs). Common CDs include HIV infection, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, asthma and epilepsy. Unfortunately current health policies and practices are often inappropriate to address this burden, and accurate data about the burden of CDs, required for health planning, are often not available. A research programme is proposed in Uganda and Tanzania that will document current policies, assess the burden of CDs in the population and document the quality of existing health services for CDs. Based on the findings and in collaboration with health policy makers and programme managers in both countries, we will design and implement an intervention package that aims to improve the health system through training and the introduction of standardized cost-effective diagnostic and treatment procedures, complemented by health education of patients and communities. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in improving the services provided by health facilities. Finally, we will work with policy makers and service managers to change policies in the light of the research results obtained.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002650","grantId":"G1002650","fundValue":"1991570","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Heiner  Grosskurth","coPersons":["Paula  Munderi","Saidi  Kapiga","Richard John  Hayes"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
