This research challenged the predominant perception that religious communities have had little impact on the process of European integration. It investigated the role of religious communities in the European Union by focusing on relations between religious policy practitioners and EU officials from the Second World War until today. Drawing on a wide range of archival sources and interviews with current and former EU officials, the research provided the following findings: 1. Despite the widespread perception that religious issues have been absent from the process of European integration, this project has demonstrated prolonged contact between churchmen, politicians and EU officials from the 1950 Schuman Declaration until today. 2. It proposed four types of relations between European institutions and 'churches, religions and communities of conviction', namely public-private (1950-82), experimental (1982-90), pro-active (1990-2007), and institutionalised (2007-today). 3. Each type reflected an increase of the European Commission's engagement with religious and convictional groups. 4. The project identified 120 religious/convictional groups in dialogue with the European Commission from the Schuman Plan until today. 5. The project identified 82 religious and convictional offices in Brussels and Strasbourg, most of which were established after President Jacques Delors launched a public debate on the 'heart and soul' of Europe in the early 1990s. 6. For the first time in the history of the acquis communautaire, Article 17 in the 2009 Lisbon Treaty institutionalises 'an open, transparent and regular dialogue' with 'churches, religions and communities of conviction' without indicating the mechanism of this dialogue. 7. Religious and convictional issues remain under the jurisdiction of EU national member states. Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
