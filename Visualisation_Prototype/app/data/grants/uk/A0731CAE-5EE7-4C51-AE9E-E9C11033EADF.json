{"id":"A0731CAE-5EE7-4C51-AE9E-E9C11033EADF","title":"Geometric non-linear analysis","abstractText":"For may purposes it is important to understand the geometric structure of various deformations. (An obvious example, that is mildly connected with this research, is in elasticity.) It is extremely important to find out how deformations behave locally as well as globally. The key problem of the study of the local behaviour is whether deformations look like affine ones close to some points, or even close to many points. The key problem of the study of the global behaviour is whether deformations may be replaced by affine ones globally, at least when one is studying certain particular problems.The goal of the proposed research is to contribute to the answer of such key open problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D053099/1","grantId":"EP/D053099/1","fundValue":"245768","fundStart":"2006-09-15","fundEnd":"2010-03-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Preiss","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
