It is important that when new medical innovations are made, steps are taken to ensure that this knowledge is exploited to its full potential and is able to make the transition from the laboratory into patient healthcare application. This proposal asks for resource to support the management of a portfolio of such innovations within the University of Birmingham, currently at an early stage of development, through to a stage where they can receive further investment and be effectively translated into new healthcare opportunities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801681","grantId":"G0801681","fundValue":"224832","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Stewart","coPersons":["Nicholas  Barnes","Kate  Bishop","Lawrence Sterling Young"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
