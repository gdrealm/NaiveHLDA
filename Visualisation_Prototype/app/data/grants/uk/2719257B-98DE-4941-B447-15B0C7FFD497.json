Upon activation, platelets become sticky and adhere to the walls of the blood vessels to form a clot. People who suffer from heart disease have platelets that are stickier than normal although these reasons for this are unclear. The inappropriate activation of blood platelets inside our arteries plays a key role in both heart attacks and strokes, and is a principal cause of mortality and morbidity in the UK. To protect ourselves from the increased stickiness of platelets, endothelial cells that line blood vessels release a chemical messenger called prostacyclin (PGI2), which inhibits platelet activity, making them less 'sticky' and reducing thrombosis. Subjects with heart disease, diabetes and obesity have platelets that do not respond very well to PGI2, making them more vulnerable to thrombosis. In this project we aim to investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate platelet sensitivity to PGI2, which are currently undefined. We will use blood from human volunteers to isolate platelets and study the proteins that are activated by PGI2. By understanding how PGI2 controls platelets in normal individuals we can begin to compare this with people with disease to understand how the pathway breaks down. The study will increase our understanding of how PGI2 protects against heart disease and may lead to the development of new antithrombotic strategies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I022171/1","grantId":"BB/I022171/1","fundValue":"215018","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This grant is still ongoing and therefore the potential for impact has been limited. \nWe believe that presenting the scientific work at a number of conferences, both national and international, has created the platform for future impact. The methodology developed during the work has now been published and provided to collaborators for evaluation in different disciplines, mainly for clinical/patients samples.\nThe other major focus of the work, examining new mechanisms by which cAMP signalling regulates blood platelets, is still ongoing. However, the development of new international collaborations in Germany, Norway and the USA will increase the potential impact.

The synthesis and release of prostacyclin (PGI2) from endothelial cells that line blood vessels inhibits platelet activity and reduces thrombosis. The inhibition of platelet function is achieved through the activation of a complex protein communication network inside the cells called the cAMP signaling system. The experiments we are performing are designed to understand how this protein network is organised. This may allow us to determine why the communication network stops working correctly in disease states leading to heart attacks and strokes.\nDuring our research we have developed a new methodology that allows us to examine how cAMP regulates platelets in whole blood, without having to isolate the cells. This more accurately reflects blood function in vivo and means that we can better understand how cAMP regulates platelet function inside the body. \nIn addition, we have found two new proteins that help control cAMP signaling networks in blood platelets. However, this work is not yet complete and we will have a better understanding in several months time when the grant is complete The protein signalling/communication network we are studying (cAMP) is ubiquitously expressed in all human and animal cells. Consequently it has been implicated a range of biological processes including immune function, cell metabolism, blood vessel development. While our work is still on going we are hoping that the methodology we developed can help others evaluate how cAMP signaling networks influence cell function. The method offers a high throughput platform for other researchers to evaluate both cell signaling and reagents that could potentially affect these signaling networks.\nThe immediate beneficiaries of work will be investigators in the field of haemostasis, thrombosis and vascular biology. The identification of specific protein signalling complexes that drive platelet activation is important in order to increase the understanding of platelet function in health and improve therapeutic strategies for controlling the activity in disease. At a broader level the data may help others understand the role of the cAMP signalling network in cellular metabolism. This may be critical in the development of new drugs and treatments to control metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity.
