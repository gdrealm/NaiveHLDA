Superimposed upon the DNA sequence, chromatin structure provides an additional layer of heritable information that we are just beginning to read and understand. All cells in our body contain an identical genotype but a single egg will give rise to numerous cell phenotypes. By controlling accessibility to DNA and subsequently controlling gene expression, chromatin is fundamental in this epigenetic process. Boveri, the father of cancer genetics, described a generalized disturbance of chromosomal organization and nuclear structure that distinguished cancer cells from normal cells. Although his writing preceded our understanding of DNA, his thoughts were based on his observation of widespread disruption of what we would call chromatin today. CTCF and its new identified partner cohesin are believed to organise higher order chromatin structure in the cell and therefore to play a central role in the processes controlling gene expression and cell differentiation. Both mutations of cohesin and CTCF cause severe developmental disorders, including cancers. Pascal Lefevre has been studied modification of the chromatin structure associated with cell differentiation process in macrophage differentiation during almost 10 years. He has recently described a new mechanism leading to abrogation of the CTCF/cohesin complex repressive effect on gene expression after macrophages inflammatory response. Using available database, he identified new CTCF/cohesin binding sites at the vicinity of genes essential for macrophages differentiation and function. The goal of this proposal is to understand the effect of aberrant expression of the CTCF/cohesin complex on the expression of these genes by using primary macrophages in culture. With both CTCF and cohesin proteins ubiquitously expressed, this project will also participate to increase our understanding of the role of this complex in general cell differentiation processes as well as in the development of malignant tissues.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801215","grantId":"G0801215","fundValue":"370692","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Pascal  Lefevre","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
