{"id":"E88E4C1A-E3F5-4AC8-AAA7-6FFF4539A892","title":"UK Photonic Systems Outreach Network","abstractText":"Photonics is the technology which underpins the Internet and has fuelled a revolution in communications over the past 20 years. Continued development of new technologies has positioned photonics well to make significant contributions to emerging societal challenges, such as energy efficiency and climate change, healthcare in an ageing society, the digital divide, the knowledge society, and public safety and security. Examples include green communication networks, photonics-related medical diagnosis, autonomous sensor networks, manufacturing and solid-state lighting are significant trends that have been identified. \nHowever this potential will often only be realised by forming cross community projects which bring researchers together from appropriate disciplines to offer 'systems' and solutions. The research community is committed to achieving this holding the view that there needs to be more cross ICT working, with activities spanning the current research themes in order to deliver solutions. \nIt is the function of the Network to contribute to achieving this by bring together the photonics research community with other related communities (e.g. computing, people and interactivity, manufacturing and quality, healthcare, safety and security, and cutting-edge materials and technology) to develop research streams which address all the the aspects needed to deliver solutions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J005371/1","grantId":"EP/J005371/1","fundValue":"152497","fundStart":"2011-10-03","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dimitra  Simeonidou","coPersons":["Ian  Henning"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
