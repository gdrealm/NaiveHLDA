{"id":"2D3B8D6D-4B05-4098-9E0D-C5666ABEE65D","title":"Development of an Innovative Modular System for Continuous Chemical Processing","abstractText":"The project, lead by Syrris, in collaboration with GSK, AMRI UK and the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in\nContinuous Manufacturing and Crystallisation will develop an innovative modular system for continuous chemical\nprocessing. It will develop modules that can be used by any chemical industry to perform unit operations such as liquidliquid,\nliquid-solid and liquid-solid-gas phase reactions, crystallisations and aqueous work-up in a continuous process, with\nanalysis. The modules will be scalable, easy to use, automatable and able to be quickly reconfigured into hundreds of\nconceivable single or multi step process systems. Within the project lifetime, this will enable GSK and AMRI to operate\nmore efficient, high quality and sustainable processes with easier scale-up. After the project, commercialisation of these\nmodules will enable the wider chemical process industry to benefit from the same advantages and generate significant\nexports for the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K504117/1","grantId":"EP/K504117/1","fundValue":"79429","fundStart":"2013-04-29","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  No impact yet generated.

Commercial products will be manufactured as a result of this research. Equipment will be characterised and tested at GSK, AMRI and University of Strathclyde. This will extend Syrris's portfolio of flow chemistry equipment for commercial sale. It is expected several publications or application notes will arise from this work.
