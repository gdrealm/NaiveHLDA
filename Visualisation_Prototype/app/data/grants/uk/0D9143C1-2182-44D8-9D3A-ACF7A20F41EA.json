{"id":"0D9143C1-2182-44D8-9D3A-ACF7A20F41EA","title":"Control of inflammation via the phosphorylation of tristetraprolin (TTP)","abstractText":"Inflammation is normally a short-lived and beneficial response to infection or injury. However, in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation persists in the absence of infection or injury, causing pain, disfunction and disfigurement. It is possible that persistent inflammation is due to the failure of resolution mechanisms, which would normally help to terminate an inflammatory response. In this project we are exploring the idea of stimulating or reactivating one of the body s natural inflammatory off-switches in order to treat chronic inflammatory diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800207","grantId":"G0800207","fundValue":"569065","fundStart":"2009-01-05","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew R Clark","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
