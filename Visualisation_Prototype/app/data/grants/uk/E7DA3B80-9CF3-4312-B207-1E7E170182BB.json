{"id":"E7DA3B80-9CF3-4312-B207-1E7E170182BB","title":"Towards a molecular understanding of deactivation issues in methane reforming catalysts","abstractText":"This research proposal brings together a grouping of specialists in surface chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, solid state chemistry, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy to identify the critical factors responsible for maintaining hydrogen yields in methane reforming catalysts. Ormerod has already prepared, and partially characterised, a number of methane reforming catalysts that display a wide range of performance, in terms of hydrogen selectivity and operational lifetime. Whereas the standard formulations display the expected catalyst deactivation characteristics, some of the modified catalysts exhibit excellent hydrogen selectivity that can be maintained over extended periods of time, i.e. minimal deactivation is observed. A workplan is presented whereby the research team will develop a mechanistic understanding of why the 'good' catalysts favour high hydrogen selectivity and avoid the carbon laydown processes, that lead to the formation of surface oligermic species and, ultimately, catalyst deactivation. This multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional research proposal has direct connections to energy requirements of the UK chemical industry and, moreover, targets key areas of the science base as highlighted in the recent Whiteside's report and the EPSRC's Research Priorities and Opportunities document.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E029388/1","grantId":"EP/E029388/1","fundValue":"14495","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stewart Frederick Parker","coPersons":[],"organisation":"STFC - Laboratories","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
