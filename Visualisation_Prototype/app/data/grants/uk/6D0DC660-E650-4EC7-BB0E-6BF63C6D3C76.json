{"id":"6D0DC660-E650-4EC7-BB0E-6BF63C6D3C76","title":"The Foundations and Scope of Reasons for Action.","abstractText":"One of the most fundamental distinctions in philosophy is that between the descriptive and the normative. Very roughly, descriptive claims about the world are concerned with what is the case whereas normative claims are concerned with what ought to be the case. At the level of intentional actions, we can distinguish between what an agent is doing and what he ought to be doing. \\n\\nMany philosophers believe that what an agent ought to do (or believe or feel) is a function of what that agent has a reason to do (or believe or feel). For many philosophers reasons are the fundamental building blocks of normativity. As Joseph Raz puts it: 'The normativity of all that is normative consists in the way it is, or provides, or is otherwise related to reasons.' \\n\\nThere is quite a lot of disagreement about what kinds of facts ('or considerations') provide reasons for action. According to internalists about reasons for action the only kinds of considerations that can ground reasons for actions are considerations relating to what an agent is, or could be, motivated to do. On this conception of reasons, all reasons for action must be grounded in what Bernard Williams has called an agent's subjective motivational set; where this set includes such things as 'dispositions of evaluation, patterns of emotional reaction, personal loyalties, and various projects, as they may be abstractly called, embodying commitments of the agent.' For internalists, reasons claims about an agent are falsified by the absence of an appropriate element in that agent's subjective motivational set. According to externalists, reasons are not necessarily grounded in such elements in agents' motivational sets, and so reasons statements are not necessairly falisified by the absence of such elements.\\n\\nInternalists argue for their theory by claiming that a particular consideration can provide an agent with a reason for acting in a certain way only if that consideration can figure in a correct rationalising explanation of that agent's action. Since all correct explanations of actions must make essential reference to the agent's motivational states, a correct normative reason statement about an agent must therefore make essential reference to the agent's motivational state as well. \\n\\nMy first aim in this project is to show that this argument stands or falls on how 'can figure in a correct explanation' is interpreted. My contention is that it fails regardless of how it is interpreted. There are only two reasonable interpretations, and on the first the argument is invalid. On the second the argument goes through, but the conclusion it ends up with is one that externalists can agree to. This discussion will then provide the backdrop for the second aim of the project which in turn consists of two parts. The first is to investigate how externalism can be reconciled with our common sense convictions about the role our preferences and choices play in shaping our reasons. My tentative conclusion is pessimistic: there is a strong tenstion between externalism and common sense here. The second claim is that we shouldn't hold out too much hope of being able to ground reasons for actions in considerations of value either. The structure of reasons and values are too different. According to a currently very popluar theory called the 'Fitting Attitudes' theory, reasons and values are intimately connected. Unfortunately, I think there are very good reasons to believe that the theory does not hold up to scrutiny. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G009252/1","grantId":"AH/G009252/1","fundValue":"21475","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kent Ingvar Hurtig","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
