In this proposal we want to use tau leptons as an efficient tool to identify events with Higgs boson production and to separate them from the copiously produced background. In the Standard Model of Particle Physics, Higgs bosons can be produced together with a W or Z boson. Whereas the Higgs boson will decay into a pair of b quarks, the W can decay into a tau and a neutrino and the Z into two tau leptons. This is only one of several possible production processes. The expected number of Standard Model Higgs bosons in the data, however, is so small that this process plays an important role in increasing the sensitivity for a signal. In Supersymmetry there are several Higgs bosons. In the so-called Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) there are five Higgs bosons, two of them charged and three neutral. About one in ten MSSM Higgs bosons decays into a pair of tau leptons. Searching for these events can help to discover Supersymmetry. In any case, it will significantly constrain the properties of the model. The other Tevatron experiment, CDF, has recently presented a deviation in its data which could be interpreted as a potential signal of a MSSM Higgs boson. The Dzero data could not confirm this signal, but also not completely exclude it. It is therefore important that we continue this work in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/F000863/1","grantId":"PP/F000863/1","fundValue":"223598","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Stefan  Soldner-Rembold","coPersons":["Terry  Wyatt"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
