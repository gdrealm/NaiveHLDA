{"id":"48F53D2F-822F-4971-82B5-12DCADA2E974","title":"Formulating vs. following rules among persons with autism","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this project is to investigate the ability of children with autism to formulate a rule, or rule-based strategy, to achieve a goal, and to compare this with the ability to follow explicitly given rules. Being able to formulate rules is a key component of many cognitive flexibility tasks, and it is a skill that ensures smooth functioning in social contexts. Individuals with autism have difficulty with social coordination and it seems they also have difficulty handling rules. However, we do not yet know whether their difficulty lies primarily with formulating rules (eg, inducing a rule that a red light means “stop” on observing that cars normally stop when encountering a red light), or whether individuals with autism have difficulty following rules that are presented explicitly. Participants will complete both a condition in which they must formulate their own rules on the basis of feedback, and a condition in which they are explicitly provided with the rules. We anticipate that participants with autism will benefit from receiving explicit instructions in the follow rules condition, performing on a par with comparison participants. But we expect to find a large between-group difference in the formulate rules condition. If the hypothesis gains support, then it would suggest that being unable to induce rules is a major obstacle standing in the way of normal social functioning in autism.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1563","grantId":"RES-000-22-1563","fundValue":"42422","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Mitchell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
