{"id":"E6234115-F2ED-44A3-ACD3-A0BFD5967393","title":"Testing the feasibility of extending the Scottish Longitudinal Study back through time","abstractText":"<p>The Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS) is a large sample of\nanonymous individuals linked through time for whom census, vital events, cancer\nand hospital admissions information are collected. It incorporates data from\nthe 1991, 2001 and, eventually, the 2011 Census and beyond. It is a 5.3 per cent\nsample, based on 20 birth dates for approximately 270,000 individuals in Scotland. The\nstudy allows for the analysis of a range of demographic, health and social\nquestions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>While we know much about the SLS members' lives from 1991,\nwe know little about them previously. Nor do we know anything about their\nparentâ€™s circumstances, except for those parents who were living with the SLS\nmember at the time of a Census. This exciting feasibility study will explore\nhow we might link back to the 1939 National Register (collected for use in\nconscription and rationing) and to vital events registrations prior to 1974,\nfor both the SLS members and their parents. This is uniquely possible because\nof the work done by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) to make\nboth these datasets more accessible. We will present our results to a workshop\nof expert researchers who will help us evaluate the outcomes of this pilot\nanalysis.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F035152/1","grantId":"ES/F035152/1","fundValue":"82865","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Boyle","coPersons":["Zengyi  Huang"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
