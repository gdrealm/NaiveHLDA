{"id":"B6345080-61E7-4360-BAB1-70CA55153304","title":"Hierarchical, Force-Based Method to Predict the Stability of a Protein","abstractText":"Proteins play an essential role in living organisms. They are important structurally in bones, muscle, connective tissue and skin, and are responsible for the majority of biomolecular processes such as synthesis, degradation, signalling, transport and motion. In addition to their biological role, they are invaluable technologically as catalysts, pharmaceuticals, sensors, biomaterials and in many other applications. However, proteins are large and complex molecules made up of hundreds of amino acids joined together in a long chain. We still have much learn about what makes proteins adopt particular shapes in order to carry out specific functions. \n\nThe goal of the proposed research is to develop and implement a new method to predict protein stability. This new method will not only be able to predict stability but also explain in intricate detail how this stability comes about. Such detail is essential to understanding protein function and guide the design of new proteins. Computer simulation is a valuable way to predict molecular structure and stability. It generates a large number of structures which can be used to predict stability. While a number of methods have already been proposed to predict stability using computer simulation, they are largely based on methods appropriate for small molecules are not yet accurate and reliable enough to be useful for proteins. My approach will incorporate a number of new features that reflect the complexity of proteins, building on my experience to calculate the stability of liquids and solutions and to study the structure of proteins. This approach has already led to the most accurate characterisation yet of the structure and dynamics of water, still a complex and controversial question. Water is a key component surrounding proteins that will explicitly accounted for and not be ignored as many approaches do. Another key attribute of our approach is that the entropy is evaluated hierarchically over the many length scales of a protein. Furthermore, our approach is able to handle the intrinsic flexibility in a protein by using the forces on atoms to determine how mobile they are, defining structure in terms of contacts, and considering all of the astronomical number of configurations. The new tool will be made publicly available to all scientists to help them study their systems. \n\nHaving developed the method, we will test it, firstly by measuring how well it predicts the solubility in water of a range of small organic molecules by comparing with results obtained using another simulation method that does work for small systems. Next we will examine how well the method works at predicting stability of small proteins by comparing with the relative stabilities measured from very long simulations. The third test will be in an experiment called CASP whereby participants have to predict protein structure based on the sequence of amino acids. As well as testing we will consider two applications: firstly, we will apply the method to determine the stability of the same set of small proteins as they are folded in order to learn about the mechanism of protein folding; secondly, we will examine how various solutes and ions stabilise or destabilise protein structure. The information gained from addressing both these questions will substantially improve our ability to understand protein function and design new proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K001558/1","grantId":"BB/K001558/1","fundValue":"267922","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  For the new method for the entropy of flexible molecules, it is is too early to judge.

Calculating entropy for flexible molecules is a challenging goal. Our method is simple to understand and apply, much more accurate than existing methods, and it should be straightforward to combine it with my existing theory for solvation entropy.\n \nTwo papers have been published in collaboration with Dr Julien Michel of the University of Edinburgh and Dr Richard Law of Evotec on the contribution of water's entropy to solvation and binding.
