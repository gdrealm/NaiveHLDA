{"id":"47EB4329-1007-4E6E-9EBA-FCEB31B4DC8E","title":"Living Multiculture: the new geographies of ethnic diversity and the changing formations of multiculture in England","abstractText":"<p>The project asks two key questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>How do people live complex cultural difference, managing increasing cultural diversity in their everyday lives? </li>\n\n <li>What role does place and locality play in this process? </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is growing interest as to the ways in which ethnically complex populations routinely interact in convivial and competent ways. Exploring the dynamics and limits of this competency&nbsp; - and its relationship to places that have long and short histories of multiculture - is at the heart of the research. In a context of dispersing multiculture the need to focus on issues of space and place is particularly important since less research has been done on suburbs, large towns and small cities with little or no histories of multiculture and/or ethnic tension.</p>\n\n<p><br />The project's core aims are to contribute to new social and spatial understandings of multiculture and to inform appropriate policy responses. It employs a mixed methodology in three case study areas chosen for the different windows they offer onto the new geographies of multiculture in England.This methodological approach combines one-to-one semi-structured interviews, repeat in-depth discussion groups and participant observation. Informed by psychotherapeutic approaches these methods allow the research team to observe, experience and ask about the types of social relations, convivial exchanges and quotidian skills that underpin lived multiculture. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J007676/1","grantId":"ES/J007676/1","fundValue":"372343","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Neal","coPersons":["Giles Marcus Mohan","Katy  Bennett","Allan Douglas Cochrane"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
