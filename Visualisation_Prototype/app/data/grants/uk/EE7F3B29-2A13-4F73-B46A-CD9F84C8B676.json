This is to be achieved by a series of workshops, public debates and other targeted interventions directed towards improving the law, policy and practice of key institutions that have a determinate influence on the security of desplazado communities returning home in the midst of the armed conflict. The input of these ultimate beneficiaries is incorporated as a crucial component of the dialogues.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-192-22-0018","grantId":"RES-192-22-0018","fundValue":"4894","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David James Cantor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of London","findingsText":" In Colombia, where five million people have been displaced by the armed conflict (desplazados), return is a highly controversial subject, as each individual return is seen as a concrete but contested expression of the State_s ability to recuperate security through military means. This political sensitivity and the difficulty in accessing research participants result in an alarming lack of knowledge about how such returns actually play out in practice and about the impact of laws and policies in this area.\n\n\n\nMy PhD combined social science and legal methodologies to address these two key gaps in the data. Based inter alia on 243 interviews in seven regions of Colombia (regional capital cities and rural return zones), it generated the following three main research findings:\n\n\n\n1. Most returns occur to zones of active conflict; \n\n2. Returnees utilise various strategies to increase community resilience to harm and livelihood risks;\n\n3. State law, policy and practice around returns display serious shortcomings, including failure to recognise/support returnees' local strategies to manage insecurity.\n\n\n\nGrounded in these research findings, the project sought to stimulate urgently-needed dialogue to create a knowledge-led policy and practice by government, international and local bodies to help mitigate the problem of insecurity in returns during armed conflict. This knowledge exchange took place primarily during the months of August and September 2010 in Colombia. The inauguration of Juan Manuel Santos as President of Colombia in August 2010, and the impetus he provided to the draft laws concerning reparation of the victims of the armed conflict and restitution of lands, provided an unexpected opportunity for directly impacting upon the Colombian legal framework on IDPs. \n\n\n\nAn unexpected opportunity to create awareness about the reality of Colombian IDP returns with Venezuelan government officials working with Colombian refugees arose indirectly from knowledge exchange activities concerning the reparation of IDPs that were undertaken as part of the project in Colombia. The regulations for implementing the broad provisions of Law 1448/11 deal in detail with the issue of return. It appears that those responsible for drafting these regulations have had access to my project findings. There is thus the strong potential for future impact here.
