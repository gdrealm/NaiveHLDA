Its aim is to understand both the nature of these activities (e.g., processes and ways of organising); as well as the consequences for localities, including the implications for social cohesion, exclusion and conflict. \n\nThe concept of cultural activism has been used to describe a diverse range of creative practice such as culture jamming, subvertising, and rebel clowning intended to challenge 'dominant ways of seeing and constructing the world' (Routledge, 2010: 4). This form of activism is often associated with a politics of resistance; to global capitalism, to an authoritarian regime, to oppressive social and cultural norms. However, in addition to its uses as a form of resistance to global injustices, there is growing evidence to suggest that activist-led forms of creative practice can serve as a way to advance particular claims to space and build place-identities. This review will make a valuable contribution to this under-explored area of inquiry by establishing a foundation and conceptual framework for future research. This new line of enquiry will be based on a synthesis of literatures on cultural activism, community activism and creative practice, and place identities. Through this work, the study seeks to inform the future shape, focus and priorities of the connected communities programme. \n\nThe review will proceed through the following four activities: \nPhase one - conducting the search: a short review process followed by an extensive search across a wide range of research databases (e.g., Web of Knowledge, the British Library). \nPhase two - categorising and classifying the research: organisation of collected literature and classification of key themes, arguments, research methods, and theories. \nPhase three - analysis and synthesis: a detailed interpretation of collected literature. \nPhase four - writing the review: a draft, and then final research review. \n\nThis project also includes a significant component of collaborating activities. The review is informed by a participatory action research approach as community members have been key players in shaping the proposal. This engagement will continue through two key events: a dialogue caf&eacute; and public workshop/exhibition in the neighbourhood of Stokes Croft, Bristol, a centre of cultural activism in the UK. Academic outreach will proceed through presentation of major themes at a series of conferences and a symposium sponsored by the University of the West of England where international scholars will discuss the review and present research on cultural activism and 'place'. \n\nThe nine-month study will be managed by Dr Michael Buser who will conduct and write the bulk of the review. Dr. Buser is an early career researcher (receiving his PhD in 2010) with a background in community planning. Professor Jane Arthurs, a leading scholar in cultural studies whose work focuses on the politics of creative resistance, will perform an advisory and mentoring role. In her capacity as Director of Research for UWE's Faculty of Arts, Creative Industries and Education, Professor Arthurs will strengthen the project's ties to the Connected Communities Knowledge Hub located in the faculty's Digital Cultures Research Centre.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011932/1","grantId":"AH/J011932/1","fundValue":"31179","fundStart":"2012-02-08","fundEnd":"2012-12-19","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The primary impact of this project has been developed locally. Over time, the project has contributed to the quality of life and creative output of the area. To focus briefly on this theme - during the original project local activists in Stokes Croft were involved in development of the project idea and subsequently with outreach aspects of the work. This has led to an ongoing collaborative relationship between UWE researchers and community interests based on real-world experiences and sharing of knowledge. What we are seeing is that the boundaries between neighbourhood, community and university are slowly being broken down. By way of example, researchers now regularly engage with community partners on urban planning and quality of life issues related to the neighbourhood. In addition, local activists have presented at the university and directed a number of student 'studio' projects in Stokes Croft.\n \nTo date (Sept 2014), two major arts intervention projects have been conducted in the area (the first was directly associated with the grant while the second was a 'spin-off' and follow-up). These have involved the creation of lasting, physical legacies. The projects (discussed elsewhere) have contributed to an improved local environment by focusing energy on disused public space.

The primary outputs were a scoping study and discussion paper, and an international seminar. The work outlined cultural activism as a set of activities which: \na) Challenge dominant constructions of the world;\nb) Present alternative spatial arrangements or 'ways of being' in the city; and\nc) Disrupt relationships between art, politics, participation and spectatorship. \n\nThe project included collaboration with groups in Stokes Croft (Bristol) where we spoke about the role of art and creativity in social and urban change. Working with local artists we installed temporary/unusual seating to challenge assumptions about a so-called 'derelict' site in the area (locally known as the 'Bearpit'). We used the seating as a playful way to have a dialogue with the local community and to celebrate the convivial aspects of being in urban public spaces.\n\nThe project report includes a series of recommendations for future research and engagement on the following themes:\n\nEmotion, affect and sensuous solidarities:Passion, the embodied nature of activist practices, and strong affective experiences contribute to the strengthening of social bonds, solidarity and shared understandings about place.\n\nDIY activism:Particularly in the context of fiscal crisis, Do- It-Yourself activism is often seen as part and parcel of 'good' neoliberal capitalism. In such a condition, the search for 'alternative imaginaries' often gives way to compromise or co-optation.\n\nCommunities and ephemerality :The radical and transformative potential of cultural activism is often situated in ephemeral 'moments' of disruption.\n\nParticipation and spectatorship: Cultural activist practices are often framed by expectations about audience behaviour which equate passivity with ignorance and active participation with emancipation. We argue for a more nuanced engagement with spectatorship and an exploration of other ways of learning and knowing.\n\nWorking across disciplines\nThe project explored the value and difficulty of working across disciplines. At our seminar, we noted divergences in language and vocabulary, outputs, values and epistemological framings. The primary non-academic beneficiaries of this review are public sector groups including politicians and policy makers; community groups and activists in the third sector; organizations engaged in social enterprise; and local activists and artists in Stokes Croft, Bristol who engaged with the review.\n\nFor the public sector, the review could inform policy-makers and politicians of the way creative practice and activist strategies are changing the nature of local places. Third sector organisations, social enterprise organisations and individuals and groups interested in local community development could benefit from a new understanding of the ways the notion of community can be mobilised to direct social action. The lessons of cultural activism in communities will be particularly valuable for those interested in the nature of engagement in local places, the role of resistance and conflict, and the implications of local activism for social cohesion. At the local level, community interests in Stokes Croft contributed to the development of this proposal's theme, the nature of proposed community involvement activities, and output. There are further opportunities to contribute to local activities by maintaining this relationship. Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
