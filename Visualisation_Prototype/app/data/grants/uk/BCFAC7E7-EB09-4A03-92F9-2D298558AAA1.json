Thus the project contributed to the current efforts to address pressing societal/economic needs for increased capacity and better future workforce in mathematics-related professions. \n\nImproving mathematics teachers’ professional practice through collaborative research:\n• The project was carried out collaboratively with two secondary mathematics teachers and was designed in a way that promoted professional reflection and development. Evidence from the project showed lasting impact on the professional thinking/practice of the participating teachers, and also spread of this thinking/practice to colleagues in their school. Furthermore, the project has contributed already to the career advancement of one of the participating teachers: the teacher’s work in the project featured prominently in her successful application for Advanced Skills Teacher status.\n\nImproving mathematics teachers’ professional practice through wider dissemination:\n• The project has reached professional audiences through a range of dissemination activities in England and abroad, communicating its research findings in forms that are tailored to the needs of teachers, policy makers, and curriculum developers. One project output, a publication in Mathematics Teaching, has been found particularly helpful by groups of mathematics teachers as well as projects and initial teacher education courses that aim to develop highly skilled mathematics teachers.

It involved development, implementation, and analysis of the effectiveness of six lesson sequences in the two classes over a period of two years – when the students were in Years 10 and 11. The lesson sequences aimed to enhance students’ proof competencies and mathematical proficiency more broadly, ranged from one to five 50-minute periods each, and were implemented by the teachers of the classes (each teacher worked with the same class in Years 10 and 11). The student participants were all 61 students who, during the first year of the project, belonged to the school’s highest and second-highest attaining Year 10 classes – set 1 and set 2, respectively. These students achieved levels 7 or 8 in the end-of-Year 9 SAT exams. \n\n\n\nThe project offered new insights into methodological practices for creating a credible picture of students’ proof competencies. First, it showed that conclusions about students’ proof competencies based only on (even extended) survey data can be seriously misleading, and highlighted the importance of testing such conclusions with follow-up interviews. Similarly, it showed that (even extended) student written arguments during a lesson can support conclusions that consistently understate the quality of students’ proof competencies when compared with the quality reflected in students’ oral presentations (during the lesson) of the same arguments.\n\n\n\nBoth participating classes – sets 1 and 2 – achieved better end-of-Year 11 GCSE results when compared to the corresponding sets in the same school the previous two years (the end-of-Year 9 SAT results of corresponding sets were comparable). In addition to the generally-improved GCSE results, the school witnessed an unprecedented increase in the number of students from sets 1 and 2 who opted for A-levels in Mathematics and Further Mathematics: from 33 and 3 students in a ‘good’ past year to 44 and 8, respectively. So there is evidence that the project not only better prepared students for advanced mathematical studies but also generated more interest among them for such studies.\n\n\n\nThree features of the lesson sequences (design and implementation) appeared to have had a major role in the growth in students’ proof competencies in both sets: (1) the students’ encounter with carefully-engineered ‘cognitive conflicts’ that challenged students’ misconceptions and created in them a need to modify existing inaccurate understandings about proof; (2) the teachers’ critical role in helping students resolve emerging conflicts and develop understandings that better approximated conventional knowledge; and (3) the social interactions facilitated by the teachers that enabled students to learn from each other. 1) The lesson sequences developed by the project can inform curriculum development and can be used by teachers, textbook authors, and teacher educators.\n\n2) As I explain below, the scientific findings of the project set a foundation for future research that could explore what it might take to scale up effective teaching practice in the domain of proof. \n The project followed a 4-year design experiment, which I had conducted with Gabriel Stylianides in the United States to address some similar research objectives but with undergraduate students. The current project’s findings showed that some suitably modified versions of the lesson sequences that we originally developed and used in the American study played out in remarkably similar ways in England. Also, the lesson sequences produced remarkably similar learning outcomes among secondary students when they were implemented faithfully to their design. These findings are important, for prior research and practice showed that such highly desirable learning outcomes are atypical among secondary and undergraduate students. Their replication in two different cultural settings and with two different student populations opens a window of optimism that it is possible to scale up effective teaching practice in the domain of proof. Yet, some fundamental questions arise. For example: What general principles can be derived from the modification process of the focal lesson sequences from one setting to the other? What kind of support did the secondary teachers receive that enabled them to faithfully implement the lesson sequences in their classrooms? How might that support be systematically documented so that it can be effectively communicated to large numbers of teachers? Education","dataset":"gtr"}
