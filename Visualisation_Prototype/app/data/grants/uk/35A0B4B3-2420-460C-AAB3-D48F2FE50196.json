{"id":"35A0B4B3-2420-460C-AAB3-D48F2FE50196","title":"Mechanical Energy Scavenging for in-Wheel Sensors","abstractText":"This project proposes to use the centrifugal force imparted to a mass, rotating within a car wheel to wind a clockwork system that can then be used to power in wheel sensors. Power is generated by the spring unwinding and driving a micro-generator.The project will investigate the feasibility of the mechanical spring system to scavenge and store enough energy to power typical in-wheel sensors. At present typical MEMS based electromagnetic and electrostatic vibrational scavenging systems offer power outputs in the 10-100 microWatt range. The energy harvester proposed here offers the possibility of over 1 milliWatt of power. The fully wound spring system stores up to 2.6 milliWatt-hr of energy and with a conversion factor of 50% for the generation; and the system designed to fully unwind over 1 hour, then there will be a 1.3 milliWatt supply for that hour. The system maintains this power level by being continually rewound by the start-stop motion of the car and any cumulative vibrational motion of the wheel in the radial direction. This generated power can be varied in the 10-10000 microWatt range by changing the speed with which the spring unwinds from seconds to hours. The system can therefore provide the short high power burst required for wireless transmission as well as the lower power of the measurement and sleep states. As part of the project the actual real journey dynamics of a car wheel will also be measured using a remote sensor pod attached to the car. This measured data will be made freely available to researchers for use in energy harvester performance modelling via an open access online database.To achieve the project goal the research will draw upon the unique skills and expertise from the Bio-medical &amp; MicroEngineering group and the Vehicle Technology Research Centre, both situated in the School of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Birmingham.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H035346/1","grantId":"EP/H035346/1","fundValue":"96510","fundStart":"2010-04-08","fundEnd":"2012-04-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings of the research have been limited to car journey data sets available for use by other researchers and stored on the project webpages. These have been accessed by other researchers but it is not possible to tell how they have used the data.

It has also recently led to an inquiry about the proposed technology from the Dynamics &amp; Vibrations Group, Technische Universit?t Darmstadt.  ","person":"Carl John Anthony","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" This research project has had two aims, i)develop a novel clockwork energy harvester system based around energy scavenging watch technology, such as the Seiko kinetic and automatic (selfwinding) watch ranges; ii)gather data of car wheel dynamics by developing a sensor system to attach to the car to measure the dynamics. The car data allows in wheel energy harvesters to be accurately modelled. \n\nThe first of these two aims has proved to be more of a challenge than originally thought. Automatic watches are designed to operate at very low torque and so the energy storage spring is insufficient to store the energy required for an in wheel tyre pressure monitoring system. The ideal clockwork harvesting system would have a spring 4800x stronger. To change the spring in the automatic watch is not the issue though; it is the mechanism that controls the release of energy, i.e. the escapement. To provide a continual power source for the tyre pressure monitor the spring has to unwind at a constant rate controlled by the escapement. However a watch escapement is carefully designed to work at low torque to be able to maintain accurate timekeeping. When the spring is 4800x stronger the escapement mechanism and balance wheel would not operate. Although high torque escapements are common place in large clocks they are not available at the scale required to be incorporated into a microsensor system. It has proved to be been beyond the scope of this project to develop a new miniature high torque escapement mechanism but initial thoughts are for the system to be based around compressed air springs with micropores to allow the gas to escape and the spring to release at a constant rate. Experimental work has been undertaken to characterise the watch technology. The kinetic micro-generator was found to produce 3 milliWatts at high rotation speed, far in excess of the power requirement of the pressure monitoring system. \n\nFor the second part of the aim a sensor system was implemented to measure car wheel dynamics. A three axis accelerometer was positioned on the car front suspension swing arm to measure wheel vibration in three directions; a magnetic hall sensor was positioned inside the wheel rim, by attachment to the shock absorber strut, to monitor the car wheel rim rotational motion; and a GPS unit was put on the roof of the car to measure location. A data logging system monitored the different sensors, recording data at the required rate for each sensor. The accelerometers were measured 2000 times/second to capture the high frequency vibrations. GPS location was measured 5 times/second. The car used was a ford fiesta. The car was driven on the urban roads around the University of Birmingham. Even relatively short journeys resulted in very large amounts of data as the three accelerometers were recording at 2000 measurements/sec. The main observation from the wheel motion data is the number of start stop occurrences when travelling in the urban environment. The clock work energy harvester relies on start stop motion to progressively wind the energy storage spring and so the numerous stops in the measured data provides some confidence that the system would be viable in a real situation. \n\nA project website has been developed and is hosted on the Microengineering group research webpage's at Birmingham. It describes the design and experimental work on the clockwork system. It also explains the car wheel motion sensor systems. The measured data has been hosted on the project webpages and is also available through the energy harvesting network database. A dissemination article has been published in the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), quarterly newsletter. The data that has been recorded on the dynamics of actual car journeys can be used to model the efectivness of automotive based energy harvesting systems. The data has been referenced on the Energy harvesting network repositry of vibration data and so is available to academic/non-academic researchers. Energy,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
