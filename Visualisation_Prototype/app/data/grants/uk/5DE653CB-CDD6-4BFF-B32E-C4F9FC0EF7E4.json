Reflecting the ethos of the network to reach beyond academia, network events are increasingly attended by members of the public, non-governmental organisations, government officials and thank tanks. These have been picked up by a range of organisations, including Compass, the British Council and Institute for Education. It would be useful to continue holding these academic/public engagement cross-over events. Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
