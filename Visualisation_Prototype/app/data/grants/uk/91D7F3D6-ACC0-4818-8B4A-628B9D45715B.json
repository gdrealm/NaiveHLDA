However, the fundamental mechanism by which synthetic jets interact with incipiently separated turbulent boundary layers subjected to strongly adverse pressure gradient is yet to be fully understood before cost-effective operational flow-control solutions can be sought. This proposal seeks funding for a joint programme of work between groups at Manchester University and Imperial College London, which would exploit complementary strengths and facilities at the two universities. The programme aims to employ a combined experimental (Stereo PIV and other conventional measurement techniques) and computational approach (LES and LES/RANS hybrid modelling) to study the detailed interaction mechanisms, so as to derive generically valid guidelines on optimal separation control in a practical setting. The outcome of the research would be of value to both the academic community and aerospace industry, the latter striving to evolve engineering solutions to flow management with a minimum of moving parts and energy input.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E038573/1","grantId":"EP/E038573/1","fundValue":"244247","fundStart":"2007-03-15","fundEnd":"2010-03-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Leschziner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
