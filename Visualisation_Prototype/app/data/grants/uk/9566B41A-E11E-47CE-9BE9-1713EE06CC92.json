In humans, STEC infection often causes severe bloody diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. In some persons, particularly children under five years of age and the elderly, the infection can also cause a complication called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), in which red blood cells are destroyed and small blot clots develop which can lead to kidney damage and failure. The HUS fatality rate is around 5%, and up to 40% of HUS patients suffer from long-term renal dysfunction. So far, there is no specific medication available, and treatment is merely supportive involving dialysis and blood transfusion.\n\nAfter ingestion via contaminated food or water, STEC bacteria adhere to the intestinal lining and produce a toxin (Shiga toxin), which moves from the gut to the kidneys to cause HUS. It is not known how this happens as there are no appropriate experimental model systems available to study this process.\nWe have recently developed a human gut cell culture system which enables us to study STEC infections at reduced oxygen levels. Usually, such kind of infection experiments are performed in air (which contains 20% oxygen) to keep the host cells alive. However, the environment in the gut only contains around 1-5% oxygen which (amongst other factors) has been shown to provide a signal to the bacteria that they have reached their final destination. Results from our previous study have confirmed this for STEC bacteria and have shown that low oxygen levels increase the production of bacterial factors which promote colonisation of the gut wall. In addition, reduced oxygen levels also lead to the production of bacterial components which increase toxin movement across the gut wall.\n\nIn this application, we propose to continue these studies to determine (1) how the toxin crosses the gut barrier, (2) how the bacteria facilitate this process and which bacterial factors are switched on by low oxygen levels, and (3) whether STEC bacteria which produce high amounts of toxin and/or are good at moving toxin across the gut wall, cause more serious disease in humans.\n\nThe information obtained by the proposed study will help understand the early events that occur in the human gut after STEC infection and might contribute to the development of treatment strategies against HUS and STEC vaccine development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J002062/1","grantId":"MR/J002062/1","fundValue":"408257","fundStart":"2012-07-02","fundEnd":"2015-10-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephanie  Schuller","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
