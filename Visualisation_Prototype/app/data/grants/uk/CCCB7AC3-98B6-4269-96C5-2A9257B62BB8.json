Some of these cells, such as macrophages, directly recognize harmful microorganisms. Others, such as NK cells, can recognize the changes that occur in the body's own cells when these become infected with microorganisms or develop into cancer cells. Unfortunately, NK cells can also recognize transplanted cells and may sometimes be responsible for the rejection of transplants, particularly bone marrow. This ability of immune cells to recognize microorganisms, diseased cells, or transplanted cells is mediated by the expression on the surfaces of immune cells of proteins called receptors. In order to maximize the probability of recognition, macrophages and NK cells express multiple receptors, some of which belong to a family of receptors known as the Ly49 family. Remarkably, the Ly49 receptors expressed by macrophages are different from those expressed by NK cells. In addition, each individual NK cell expresses a different combination of Ly49 receptors. A major question that arises from these findings is 'How do cells decide which receptors to express?' The answer seems to lie in the DNA found in the centre of the cell. Receptors are encoded by small sections of the DNA known as genes, and each of the many receptors expressed on immune cells is derived from a different gene. So the question becomes 'How do cells decide which genes to use?' The answer seems to lie in small pieces of DNA that have regulatory properties. Recently, a new regulatory element called Pro1 was found close to many of the Ly49 genes. Pro1 seems to function as a random on/off switch, and may therefore explain how NK cells express a random combination of Ly49 receptors. However, it does not explain why macrophages express different Ly49 receptors to those found on NK cells, nor does it explain how NK cells and macrophages can change their expression of Ly49 receptors in response to hormone-like substances released by other cells. We presume that Ly49 genes must contain other regulatory elements. The aim of this project is to search for these. To do this we will make use of information that has become available as a result of the Genome Project, a large proportion of which was undertaken in the UK, and which resulted in the complete sequencing of the DNA present in cells. A good method of finding regulatory elements is to take advantage of the fact that they are often in exposed regions of DNA and are therefore hypersensitive to attack by enzymes. We will therefore expose DNA from macrophages and NK cells to enzymes that cut the DNA, and determine exactly where these cuts are made in the Ly49 genes. Another method is to search for sites in the Ly49 genes that have undergone chemical modification, in particular the loss of methyl groups. We will also search for regions where the proteins that normally bind to the DNA have become modified, an event that frequently occurs when genes are selected for expression. Finally we will test whether these chemical modifications do indeed cause changes in the expression of Ly49 genes by treating cells with drugs that inhibit these modifications, the prediction being that this will cause changes in the pattern of expression of Ly49 receptors. The results obtained in this project are expected to provide new and important information on the workings of the immune system that will help us to better understand why animals and humans are generally resistant to microbial infection and cancer, yet sometimes succumb, and also why NK cells sometimes attack transplanted tissues. In addition, they may eventually help us to develop treatments that will enhance the ability of the immune system to fight disease and to prevent the immune system rejecting transplanted tissues.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D001218/1","grantId":"BB/D001218/1","fundValue":"321071","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Brooks","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
