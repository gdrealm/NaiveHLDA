{"id":"C37A5295-32D8-4271-A9C9-A41DAE1E50AC","title":"Sufism in the Contemporary Age","abstractText":"Sufism is often considered the mystical dimension of Islam, or a manifestation of love, peace and understanding, a perennial philosophy that accepts and tolerates other established traditions. As such it is the alternative to what is often called 'radical' Islam or 'fundamentalism'. Such a view has been promoted by studies that focus excessively on classical forms of Sufism in the early medieval period to pre-modern times, which includes an analysis of Sufi love poetry, or the development of Sufi orders. To its opponents, Sufism has encouraged superstitious beliefs, faith in miraculous beliefs, the powers of holy men, and excesses in the drug taking. While there are elements of truth in all of the above views of Sufism, a more sophisticated and nuanced perspective is needed to comprehend the development of Sufism in the UK in the contemporary age. There has been limited scholarly activity on Sufism in the modern period, that is to say, in the past one hundred and fifty years. The changes that have taken place within the Sufi tradition in the modern period are many and defy easy categorisation. This research project attempts to highlight some of these changes, in particular, the association of some Sufi groups with Salafism (which is considered to be one of the manifestations of 'radical' Islam); the phenomenon of transnationalism which involves the growth and development of closely linked Sufi movements in countries as far apart as Europe and the Middle East; the emergence of Sufi-esque movements which draw on New Age for inspiration, and which are not recognised by 'mainstream' Muslims as Islamic; Sufis who feel comfortable living within a 'secular' Western society, and witness no incompatibility of such a life style with Islam - indeed, such Sufis regard themselves as liberal Muslims, and view many of the 'Islamic' regimes in the Middle East with extreme distaste. This research project aims to consider the various manifestations of Sufism, although preference will be given to manifestations of the tradition that have more resonance within the UK.\\nNaturally there are no pre-determined conclusions to this research project. It is hoped, however, that a more nuanced understanding of Sufism in the UK in the contemporary period will emerge. It terms of outcomes, the project will commence with two workshops, and conclude with a large international conference. The two workshops will focus firstly on Sufism and Salafism, and secondly non-Salafi-Sufism in the UK. Post graduate students will be encouraged to attend and present papers, along with more established scholars. The selectg committee will invite the authors of the best papers from the workshops to develop their papers for the conference, and leading scholars from around the world will also be invited to present their research. Subsequently, the best papers from the conference will be published in a major publication. It is to be hoped that the project will generate interest among the wider academic community, and attract a number of students to engage in post-graduate and post-doctoral research on the topic.\\nThe topic has specific relevance to many within the UK, ranging from governmental policy makers and those in the security forces, to police, social workers, teachers, those who work in hopsitals and a variety of public services. There has been limited work on the topic of modern Sufism, and even less on Sufism in Britain. However, the co-investigators are two British experts who have published in the field, and are specialists most qualified to lead engage and help direct this project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I025263/1","grantId":"AH/I025263/1","fundValue":"29775","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  It is too early to assess whether the findings have been used.
