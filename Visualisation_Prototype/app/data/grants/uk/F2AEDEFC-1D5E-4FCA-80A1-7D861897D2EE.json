The story of Amelia Earhart who disappeared in 1937 while attempting to circumnavigate the earth, is used to communicate key mathematical concepts of Poincar&eacute; Conjecture, which uses mathematical journeys to explore a shape that's impossible to see from the outside e.g our universe. As two of the most engaging puzzles of the 20th Century, the stories of Earhart and Poincar&eacute; resonate in their ability to capture our imaginations and lead us to new conceptions and experiences of our world. Each is an explorer, whether actually or virtually, each in their own way seeking to transcend the earth through maps and mathematics. The project builds on a 2008 EPSRC early development project (EP/G001650/1) and is led by an interdisciplinary team the19thstep consisting of composer Dorothy Ker, sculptor Kate Allen and consultant mathematician Marcus du Sautoy. My role in the project was co-deviser of a piece of music theatre Amelia and the Mapmaker with Dorothy Ker, I designed the set, props/object including the challenge of representing a 4 dimensional map of the universe in 3D, a series of projections using computer programme Isadora, and costumes. I also co-devised with Topologist Katie Steckles the audience participation workshops. The theatre piece Amelia and the Mapmaker runs for 65mins is performed by percussionist Chris Brannick as the Mapmaker, mezzo soprano Lucy Stevens as Amelia Earhart and sound designer Kelcey Swain as the Library. The outputs so far are performances targeting arts-going audiences, at the Green Man Festival, the British Science Festival, the Bob Kayley Theatre UoR and the Otley Science Festival. Each performance is accompanied with a workshop led by Topologist Katie Steckles. Alongside the performances and workshops is the project website is http://www.everythingandnothingproject.com/ the performance was renamed Amelia and the Map Maker http://ameliaandthemapmaker.com/ The Public engagement evaluation and monitoring for the project was carried out by evaluator Bea Jefferson. The project is significant in its timely relation to contemporary mathematics and arts-science themes delivering narratives that weave together to take audiences on a unique multidimensional journey of the mind and senses, creating entrance points for the public to challenging mathematical concepts.
