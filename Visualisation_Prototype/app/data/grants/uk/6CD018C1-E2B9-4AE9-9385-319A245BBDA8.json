Some of these new algorithmic methods are of our own invention and some new developments are proposed. These new methods include techniques to search for fusion genes: these are genetic anomalies if which two genetic coding regions are fused to produce a novel chimeric protein which causes cell proliferation. These and other targets may be found using new algorithmic methods which search through the large amounts od adat currently appearing in the biomedical sciences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E027296/1","grantId":"EP/E027296/1","fundValue":"217338","fundStart":"2007-04-02","fundEnd":"2010-04-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Colin Grant  Campbell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
