{"id":"36DA39C5-385F-4B30-814E-BEC70F17F502","title":"Micro-channel electrode neural interfaces: restoring bladder control","abstractText":"In the Basic Technology project, we have developed a novel design of peripheral nerve interface. By placing axons into polymeric micro-channels hosting embedded electrodes the extracelluar amplitude of action potentials is greatly increased, allowing for robust recording, noise suppression and efficient stimulation. In the Translational project, we plan to implement our concept to restore bladder control first in an experimental rat model, and then in a clinical therapeutic veterinary model. The electrode interfaces will be implanted to record electrical activity from afferents, including those that encode bladder fullness and pressure. Non regenerative then regenerative nerve interfaces with their communication system will be fabricated and tested to treat incontinent dogs suffering from spinal cord injury. Results from our study will provide a direct pathway for treating the equivalent condition in human patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H00727X/1","grantId":"EP/H00727X/1","fundValue":"1055230","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have applied a bladder stimulator to a series of 30 veterinary patient dogs, who have lost bladder control due to spinal cord injury.
