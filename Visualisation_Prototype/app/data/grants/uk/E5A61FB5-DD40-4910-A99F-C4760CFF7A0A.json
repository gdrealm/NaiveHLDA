{"id":"E5A61FB5-DD40-4910-A99F-C4760CFF7A0A","title":"Brecht in Practice: Staging Drama Dialectically","abstractText":"Bertolt Brecht (1998-1956) is one of the most influential and ambitious figures in twentieth-century theatre. While he is known to a broad public for his plays, which are often performed in UK theatres, he was also a great theorizer and practitioner of theatre, and it is the dialogue between these two roles that the project aims to disseminate beyond the academy.\n Brecht did himself few favours by coining a series of terms that, on paper, can appear slippery, unachievable or obscure. Verfremdung, for example, has been variously translated as 'alienation', 'estrangement' and 'distanciation', but this process of 'making the familiar strange' in performance can be understood better in practice by articulating contradictory behaviours or attitudes. Other terms, such as Fabel, pose problems for both directors and actors who may struggle to understand how an emphasis on an interpreted version of a play's plot will help them better understand their roles. This project, then, is designed to address the apparent gulf between theory and practice, and is derived from primary research I have carried out into Brecht's practices at the theatre company he co-founded, the Berliner Ensemble.\n The project takes as its starting point the 'Brechtian method' of staging drama. The method examines dramatic material for the relationships between the opinions, actions and behaviours of individuals, and the complex ways in which their society informs them. Brechtian directors seek to identify these relationships prior to rehearsal and then use these interpretations in their work with actors. Actors are, in turn, encouraged not to prepare their performances the night before rehearsing a scene, but to understand the scene's social premises and respond in the moment to the performances of other cast members. The aim is to generate lively work predicated on the social situation, rather than the perceived psychology of the characters. As a result, the more fixed 'character' gives way to the more fluid 'figure'. New modes of performance also emerge, ones that seek to connect the figure to its social context.\n The concept of a 'method' suggests that Brecht was not only drafting new means for staging his own plays, but also those written by other dramatists. This project thus takes a play by an author not associated with the Brechtian tradition in order to demonstrate to theatre-makers and spectators that Brecht's ideas for and modes of making theatre extend beyond his own ways of conceiving drama. The play chosen for this project, Closer by Patrick Marber (1997), is, to all appearances, concerned with the complicated love-lives of its four characters. It is an exploration of the fickle nature of desire as the four couple, de-couple and re-couple over the course of twelve scenes in the pursuit of the intimacy suggested by the play's title. Brecht, however, invites theatre-makers to consider the social context of the scenes and asks why the characters are willing to 'chop and change' so frequently and why the goal of intimacy is so hard to attain. A Brechtian production may thus choose to examine a society in which human relationships have become increasingly commodified and relate its findings to the manners in which the figures engage with each other. Similarly, the erosion of community and the promotion of the individual in the post-Thatcherite 1990s also feeds into the emotional landscape of the play. A Brechtian production thus aims to relativize the autonomy of individual decision-making and frame it against the background of the given society's social codes. The link of personal behaviour to social values proposes that such behaviour can be changed if people change social structures, and this is the political hope that underlies Brechtian theatre.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N003047/1","grantId":"AH/N003047/1","fundValue":"68438","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Barnett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
