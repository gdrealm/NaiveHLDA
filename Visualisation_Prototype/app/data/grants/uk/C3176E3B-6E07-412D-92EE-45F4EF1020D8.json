Seemingly remote, cut off for much of the year by snowbound passes and blocked roads, Spiti is increasingly part of a modernising Indian world of education, satellite television and tourism. Although the community has a vibrant culture of singing and dancing, many older songs and musical traditions are being displaced by popular songs learned from Ladakhi VCDs or Bollywood tapes. The complex song cycles of cultural events like weddings are now rarely performed in full. An older generation, carriers of specialist knowledge of songs are reaching the end of their lives, conscious that their intangible culture is unrecorded and could disappear from history.\n\n\nModern India brings new potential as well as challenges to tradition. The Hirrip, lower caste musicians who perform a fundamental role in many Spitian social events are clearly declining in number, however the number of Buchen, travelling religious performers, are equally clearly multiplying, mainly as a response to tourism.\n\n\nThe Spiti Sound Archive project, directed by Patrick Sutherland, will organise a systematic programme of sound recording to document the rapidly changing tradition of music and song. It will actively involve local inhabitants from different strata of society in the process of recording and archiving their cultural legacy. It will engage them to research, catalogue and classify Spiti's songs and musical forms and to identify Spiti's population of musicians and singers.\n\n\nThe project will consult the lower caste musicians (Hirrip) as well as travelling religious actors (Buchen), wedding singers and others in the process of deciding what to record and who best to perform it. In response to the wishes of the local community, the project will primarily concentrate on recording &quot;the endangered.&quot;\n\n\nInterest in preserving and using these recordings varies within the community. A school principal wants to teach his schoolchildren the old songs. A religious leader sees the recordings as part of a wider process to preserve the language. Government administrators see them in terms of cultural tourism potential. Musicians are looking for alternative sources of income.\n\n\nAll the material will be archived in the permanent collection of the British Library. Selected duplicate recordings will also be housed in the Archive and Research Centre for Ethnomusicology in Delhi and specialist Tibetan and Himalayan digital libraries. Additionally, the project will deposit recordings on tape/CO directly within the community, with individual performers, schools and the local cultural organisations that are emerging in the valley. Ultimately it is hoped that the whole spectrum of recorded material will be available locally, though the harshness of this high altitude desert, with its dust, extremes of temperature and fluctuating electricity, militates against conventional archiving. Satellite broadband\noffering access to the British Library website is likely to offer the best solution in the future. In the meantime, public access will be made available to recordings on CD in the new culture hall of Mun-Sei-Ling School.\n\n\nThe project will significantly develop my documentation of Spiti, by extending the primary interest of my research from photography. It will disseminate material to the general public and a wider scholarly audience through a radio broadcast for Resonance FM, an interactive website combining sounds, images and text, a presentation to the International Association for Ladakh Studies and journal articles. The Spiti Sound Archive will provide substantial material for future researchers and contribute to broadening knowledge of Tibetan communities both within Spiti and outside.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E510213/1","grantId":"AH/E510213/1","fundValue":"16210","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick  Sutherland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
