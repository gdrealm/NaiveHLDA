Located between the well established microwave and optical technologies, little commercial emphasis had been placed on terahertz systems until recently with the key drivers for the last 35 years being the study of molecular spectroscopy for Earth and Space sciences. Commercial uses for terahertz sensors and sources are now beginning to emerge as the technology is seen as the enabler of new instrumentation in the medical, health, industrial and security sectors and is thus promising to bring the field to the mass market for the first time. In order for e2v ltd to satisfy the European's Terahertz community demands for semiconductor electronic component up to 600GHz and hence to establish a European source of such devices (Gunn diodes plus multipliers) fit for purpose, the main objective of this project is to execute a technology transfer from the University of Manchester to e2v ltd in order to design, fabricate and test Terahertz source components covering the range 100 to 600 GHz and with at least 1 to 5mW of electronic power at 600 GHz being the measurable goal. As higher power Terahertz frequency sources become more available this will enable portable, compact imaging instruments in the 0.1 to 1 THz to follow.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F003471/1","grantId":"ST/F003471/1","fundValue":"313605","fundStart":"2008-01-02","fundEnd":"2011-01-01","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mohamed  Missous","coPersons":["Lucio  Piccirillo"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
