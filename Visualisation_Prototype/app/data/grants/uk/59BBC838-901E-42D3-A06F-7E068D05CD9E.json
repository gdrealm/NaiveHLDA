My research will provide an academic legal analysis of some of the issues raised by the opponents to debt repayment in order to assess whether the legal validity of the creditors' claims can successfully be challenged from the perspective of Argentinean domestic law, and /or from the point of view of international law.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112839/1","grantId":"112839/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-02","fundEnd":"2006-05-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sabine  Michalowski","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
