A major reason for this is that treatment of breast cancers often leads to acquired drug resistance. Consequently there is still a real need to identify and develop novel therapeutic strategies.\nProtein function is dynamically modulated by the addition of chemical groups through a process called post-translational modifications. PRMTs are enzymes responsible for a type of protein modification called arginine methylation which is known to regulate many diverse processes within the cell. Recently, a growing body of evidence has implicated a role for PRMTs in cancer. This is particularly true within the breast; breast cancers overexpress PRMTs, and key proteins involved in the development of breast cancer including estrogen receptor are targeted for methylation. Because of this, we and others have shown that by removing PRMTs from breast cancer cells we can slow their growth. This is really exciting as specific PRMT inhibitors are currently in development; we therefore hope that in the long term drug targeting of PRMTs could be a new way in which to treat breast cancer. \nDespite this potential we still know very little about how PRMTs change a normal breast cell to a cancer cell. To help investigate this, we have recently made a number of discoveries and identified new proteins targeted for modification by PRMTs. We now want to take this further and address the following questions:\n\n1. Can we identify breast cancer specific proteins that are targeted for modification by PRMT1 and are these modifications important for cancer cell growth?\n2. What role does methylation play in changing the behaviour of proteins that we have identified as new PRMT1 substrates? What significance does this have in breast cancer biology?\n3. Can we show that PRMT1 is a good target in which new drugs might be made against?\n\nAltogether, this research will substantially increase our understanding of how arginine methylation impacts on breast cancer biology. This is important as we hope that our findings will pave the way for the development of new anti-breast cancer drugs and help identify new cancer specific methylated proteins that could be used as biomarkers for disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M009912/1","grantId":"MR/M009912/1","fundValue":"459294","fundStart":"2015-05-21","fundEnd":"2018-05-20","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Clare  Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
