{"id":"F4AF5AEF-742A-4CBC-B094-78977408CC71","title":"E-Science Network (E-SciNet)","abstractText":"The E-Science Network (E-SciNet) will seek to embed e-Science as a standard practice for research advancement across Higher Education Institutions (HEI's) and across disciplines. It will develop and share best practice in encouraging take-up of e-Research methods and technologies and in bridging the gap between applications and e-Infrastructure. A particular focus will be on sharing strategy and experience regarding outreach within HEI's and the provision and exploitation of 'Campus Grids'. The network will also channel user requirements back to e-Infrastructure providers so that the provision and development of e Science services can be more effective at meeting the real needs of researchers and their applications.The network will build on the past and continuing activities of the e Science Core Programme (eSCP), including events run by JISC, NeSC, eSI, NGS, OMII-UK and the All-Hands Meeting. It will also run a small number of 'network-specific' events driven by the needs of its members and will produce technical reports for the UK e Science report series. With its focus on dissemination and exploitation, E-SciNet will complement other Programme initiatives. The information collected by E-SciNet, in the form of technical reports and web documentation, will provide relevant input to the overall guidance of the eSCP as it seeks to broaden participation in e-Research through the coming years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E025145/1","grantId":"EP/E025145/1","fundValue":"124949","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dave  Berry","coPersons":["Clare Andria Gryce"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
