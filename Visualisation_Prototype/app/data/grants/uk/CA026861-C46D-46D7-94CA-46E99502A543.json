It is the highest energy particle accelerator ever built, with a 27 km circumference, 100 m underground, straddling the French and Swiss border outside of Geneva. It will smash together protons travelling at 99.999999% of the speed of light 40 million times per second. With this machine, conditions similar to those a billionth of a second after the Big Bang will be reproduced. The Bristol particle physics group participate in 2 of the major experiments at the LHC, CMS and LHCb. The LHC is a discovery machine. The Standard Model of particle physics has been extremey successful in describing the physics of the Universe to date, but we know it to be incomplete. The Standard Model does not explain dark matter or dark energy, neutrino oscillations, or why the matter left in the universe wasn't destroyed by antimatter created at the big bang. The Standard Model recognizes four forces: electromagnetic force; the weak nuclear force; the strong nuclear force as well as gravity. It is believed that these forces could be different manifestation of something more fundamental. With the highest energies created to date, collisions at the LHC will push forward the frontiers of particle physics where we hope to find new physics particles and processes to explain these phenomenon. The Bristol group will be at the fore of answering these fundamental questions. The physics opportunities demand the development of novel sensors, detector systems and advanced computing techniques. These developments are at the cutting edge of technology. The Bristol group will be at the forefront in developing these systems for future experiments but also ensuring the knowledge generated will be transferred to the wider economy for enhanced productivity and economic growth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H00081X/1","grantId":"ST/H00081X/1","fundValue":"693946","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Kowledge in the research field\n\nCASE studentships. optimisation of mass storage systems; structural stability of lightweight carbon fibre structures with RAL.

The group made major contributions to the design, construction and commissioning of the CMS experiment. Bristol physicists have played a leading role in early data taking at CMS, with a significant contribution to several analyses, as well as taking on a number of roles within physics management. The group's physics programme encompasses both Standard Model measurements and searches for new physics in 'conventional' and 'exotic' channels. The group successfully targeted a number of analyses designed to make use of the early data in 2010, and has continued to provide leadership in these areas whilst also turning towards higher luminosity studies with systematic limitations. Group members also play a wider role in the scrutiny of CMS output, serving in numerous formal analysis review and editorial roles. Flavour physics has unique sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). BSM particles can affect quark flavour changes through loop processes. Crucially, there is no kinematic cut-off for the masses inside the loops. This approach is therefore sensitive to new particles far heavier than those directly produced at even the highest-energy colliders - it allows us to see beyond the energy frontier. The more precisely we measure these processes, the further we can see. TheFlavour Physics group therefore had a comprehensive programme of beauty, charm and kaon physics at the precision frontier. Collaboration with Diamond Detectors Limited, to design and produce a very fast, diamond based spectroscopy system. This system will have significantly improved radiation hardness and count rates over existing detectors. It makes use of detector and readout technologies developed both in industry and within the group, and will open new markets in the medical, security and energy sectors.
