Modification of the local force equilibrium through direct stretch or pressure regulates cell differentiation and behaviour. However, uncontrolled mechanical stress is also linked to a large number of ailments ranging from abnormal wound healing, scarring and fibrosis, to pathologies associated with stress-prone organs such as the cardiovascular system, cartilage or the eye. In the eye only, scarring accounts for the pathogenesis or failure of treatment of virtually all blinding diseases, and differential response to mechanical stress may underpin susceptibility to blindness in glaucoma patients. As these complex interactions are being unravelled, the basic mechanisms that govern the response to mechanical stress remain largely unknown. Some of our earlier work suggested that the cells’ response to the stress is linked to the state of their actin cytoskeleton, a dynamic network of cables that constitutes the internal cell scaffolding. This project aims at characterizing the mechanisms involved in the cell’s sensing and response to mechanical stress, and identify novel targets to control and modulate wound healing and tissue contraction, ultimately providing the basis for the development of improved regeneration-based therapies in ocular scarring.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500927","grantId":"G0500927","fundValue":"249403","fundStart":"2006-04-24","fundEnd":"2009-04-23","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Maryse  Bailly","coPersons":["Richard  Treisman","Peng Tee  Khaw"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
