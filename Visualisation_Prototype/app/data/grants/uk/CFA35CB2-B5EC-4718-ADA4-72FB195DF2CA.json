We have been evaluating a therapeutic approach called substrate reduction therapy (SRT) that in principle could be effective in all GSL storage diseases that involve the storage of GSLs. SRT utilises a small molecule drug (Zavescaâ€š / miglustat) and has been approved for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease. Although SRT may slow the course of the disease in storage diseases with brain pathology, it is likely that other additional therapies will be required in combination with SRT to achieve maximal benefit. Our hypothesis is that combining substrate-lowering drugs and neural stem cells (as a source of enzyme and to help repair the brain) may be synergistic and provide significant therapeutic benefit. We aim to determine whether stem cell therapy will improve the clinical outcome in mouse models of these diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400834","grantId":"G0400834","fundValue":"295420","fundStart":"2005-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frances  Platt","coPersons":["Nicola Ruth Sibson","Mylvaganam  Jeyakumar"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
