Biodiversity estimates based on DNA analysis disagree markedly, even at the highest level (Domain- Archaea or Bacteria being dominant). Also, it has been suggested that bacterial numbers may be much higher (x 10) than previously estimated. These problems may be due to biases in the different methods used by various researchers worldwide. To explore this possibility an international sample comparison has been set up. Cardiff University is the only UK laboratory invited to take part in this initiative and this project requests funding to enable Cardiff to participate in this comparison. The results of this international comparison has profound implications for the determination of biomass and biodiversity in potentially the largest bacterial habitat on Earth and also has implications for similar determinations in other terrestrial sediment and soil environments, as well as subsurface environments on other planets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G001049/1","grantId":"NE/G001049/1","fundValue":"15212","fundStart":"2008-03-17","fundEnd":"2008-06-16","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Ronald John Parkes","coPersons":["Andrew John Weightman"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
