New fabrication techniques have allowed the modification of biological materials or the synthesis of novel materials and structures that are based on established biological principles. The aim is to use modern surface engineering techniques to develop hard and tough lightweight coatings for impact resistance and develop expandable foam to create intelligent airbags to minimise behind armour blunt trauma. These systems would be compatible lightweight body armour with impact resistant coating externally and intelligent airbags internally. This propsal will look at two novel and biomimetically inspired strategies to accommodate impact energies from erodents, foreign objects and ballistics to enhance damage tolerance of surfaces to high strain events: (1) hard and tough multi-layered CVD based coatings matched to their substrates that will dissipate impact energy through sub-critical nano/micro crack propagation and elastic responses; (2) plastically deforming and auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) foam based coatings that foam under high-strain to act as a double crumple zone for damage resistance and self-repair and self-protection. Energy would be dissipated via elastic and plastic deformation and auxetic performance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G042195/1","grantId":"EP/G042195/1","fundValue":"639436","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  How have your findings been used?

This rig was then used to understand how the impact energy was affected by adding internal and external layers to chosen substrate materials. It seemed that hard surface coatings would increase the energy going through the samples, while internal coatings would decrease it.\nThe original objective of the project have been partially met as the multilayer structure produced is partially bio-inspired and it reduces the impact energy. The aim of the project was to use hard and tough surface coatings to improve impact resistance, but these kinds of coatings did not make the effect we were expecting. \n\n\nMore studies could be carried out to see how different coating materials would change the properties of the multilayer structure produced. At the moment the findings are just fundamental work but have the potential of lead to improved future armour solutions for British military forces if future funding can be sourced and ideas taken fourth.
