Effective numerical methods play crucial role in studying models described by SPDEs. Numerics for SPDEs is a relatively new area of stochastic numerical analysis and its further development is essential for both practice and theory. The importance of having a large arsenal of methods for deterministic equations is well known. This is even more important in the case of SPDEs due to their higher complexity. \n\n\n\nWe developed the new approach to numerics for linear and nonlinear parabolic SPDEs. We exploited the method of characteristics (the averaging over the characteristic formula) and numerical integration of (ordinary) stochastic differential equations (SDEs) together with the Monte Carlo technique to propose new numerical methods for both Cauchy and Dirichlet problems for linear SPDEs. Special attention was paid to numerical algorithms for SPDEs arising in nonlinear filtering. Layer methods for both linear and nonlinear SPDEs were also constructed. All the proposed methods were accompanied by their theoretical analysis and tested on model problems. \n\n\n\nThe other outcomes include: variance reduction techniques which are of crucial importance for effectiveness of any Monte Carlo procedures including those used in algorithms for the nonlinear filtering; error estimates for time-averaging estimators used in numerical approximation of the long time behaviour of SDEs; a numerical method for conditional Wiener integrals applicable to computing various quantities in quantum statistical mechanics and its generalization to the case of pinned diffusions. Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of parabolic type are orginated in 1960x due to their well-known relation with the nonlinear â€¦ltering problem which is widely used for applications, in particular in Aerospace and Defence industries. Now SPDEs are used for other modeliing, for instance, for realibility-type problems in Engineering. Numerical methods proposed within the project have a potential to be used in practice for solving SPDEs arising in real-world applications. Potential beneficiaries are applied mathematicians, physicists, numerical analysts working in the theory of stochastic partial differential equations and their applications. It is expected that numerical methods constructed within this project will be an effective tool for investigating spatial distributed stochastic models from various fields of science: from combustion and fluid dynamics to finance.
