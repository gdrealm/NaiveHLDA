In a key collaboration between theatre history and geographical information science it will develop an intuitive interactive map and research database, which will layer social, cultural and economic data onto a spatial representation of the town. In doing so, the research seeks to recuperate as far as possible the social and cultural landscape through which the spectators of performance in Nottingham moved on their way to the theatre, lecture rooms, or the town's Goose Fair, enabling the researchers to bring new methodologies to researching the interrelationships of both repertoire and spectatorship.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119173/1","grantId":"119173/1","fundValue":"289045","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanna Kate  Robinson","coPersons":["Gary  Priestnall"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
