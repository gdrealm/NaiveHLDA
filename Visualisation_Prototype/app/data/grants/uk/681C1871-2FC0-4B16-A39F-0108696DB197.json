Establishing the network structure, and its relation to a system's physico-chemical and opto-electronic properties, is a prerequisite for making new materials through the principle of rational design. Here we tackle this issue by using an integrated approach to investigate the fundamentals of basic networks, using pressure to manipulate the bonding and network topology. Oxide and chalcogenide glasses along with water will be investigated, the systems chosen to be exemplars of network forming materials with different bonding mechanisms. The contrasting bonding schemes confer the networks with different characteristics and have the potential for making modified materials with tailored functional and structural properties. Applications include the recovery to ambient conditions of materials with novel characteristics, sequestration of the green house gas CO2 by geological fluids, and the effect of rare-earth clustering on the photonic properties of glass.\n\nThe inherent disorder of liquid and glassy network structures is a blessing, in delivering materials of unique scientific and technological importance, but is also a curse, in providing complexity on the atomic scale. The method of neutron diffraction with isotope substitution (NDIS) has played a pivotal role in unravelling the mysteries of disordered materials since it allows access to the so-called partial structure factors i.e. to the maximum information that can be extracted from a diffraction experiment. Over the last 3 years, Bath has led an initiative to develop the techniques for measuring accurate neutron diffraction patterns for glasses and liquids at high pressures using the Paris-Edinburgh press. Thus, the time is now ideal to exploit the NDIS method to make in situ high pressure and temperature investigations of structurally disordered materials.\n\nWe intend to investigate the mechanisms of structural collapse in three classes of system with different bonding schemes and concomitant network properties, namely oxide glasses (GeO2), chalcogenide glasses (e.g. GeSe2, As2Se3, AsSe) and water. These particular systems are chosen because they are archetypical materials for the study of disordered networks e.g. they either show or are anticipated to show polyamorphic phase transformations in which there is an abrupt change in their structure and physical properties with change of pressure and/or temperature. In the case of the chalcogenide glasses, the large structural variability leads to the possibility of recovering new materials with novel functional properties to ambient conditions.\n\nThe structure of two types of adapted networks will also be considered, namely salty water and rare-earth alumino silicate glasses. In the former, the experiments will be made under the high pressure and temperature conditions relevant for geological fluids where applications include the sequestration of CO2. In the latter, the phenomenon of rare-earth clustering will be investigated with a view to controlling the separation of nearest-neighbour ions and hence the optical properties of these materials.\n\nComplementary information will be provided, where applicable, by NMR (Warwick), high energy x-ray diffraction, EXAFS spectroscopy and other experimental techniques. The NMR work will include well established nuclei (27Al and 29Si for the alumino silicates) but will extend the boundaries of the method by using 17O, 73Ge and 77Se. A combination of isotopic enrichment and NMR enhancement schemes will maximise the amount of structural information that can be extracted by using these nuclei as probes. Importantly, the experimental work will be enriched and complemented by molecular dynamics simulations made in collaboration with groups in Oxford, Cambridge and Strasbourg.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J009741/1","grantId":"EP/J009741/1","fundValue":"467938","fundStart":"2012-06-05","fundEnd":"2015-10-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  It is important to know where the atoms in a material sit relative to one another in order to understand e.g. its functional properties.

The pressure range for in situ neutron diffraction experiments on glassy and liquid materials has also been extended to 17.5 GPa. A topical review that describes this methodology has been submitted for publication.\n\nThese new experimental methods have been applied to investigate the structures of the oxide glass GeO2 and the chalcogenide glass GeSe2. The pressure dependence of these materials has also been modelled by using appropriate molecular dynamics methods, yielding results that are in agreement with experiment. This combination of methods has provided detailed information on the mechanisms of network collapse e.g. from a tetrahedral to an octahedral glass in the case of GeO2. All of this work has been published in the Physical Review B and Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter.\n\nThe structure of B2O3 glass was investigated by in situ neutron diffraction at pressures up to 17.5 GPa, helping to rationalise the results obtained from other experiment methods. The pressure dependence of the structure, which involves the dissolution of boroxol rings, has also been investigated by using a newly developed aspherical ion model that is able to provide results of unprecedented accuracy at pressures up to at least 10 GPa. This work has been published in the Physical Review B.\n\nThe structure of SiO2 glass was investigated by in situ neutron diffraction at pressures up to 17.5 GPa. The results were combined with x-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations to develop a mechanism for network collapse that involves a successive closure of neighbouring primitive rings (the &quot;zipper&quot; mechanism). This work was been published in the Physical Review Letters.\n\nThe structures of a multitude of oxide materials under extreme conditions have been analysed, and the network transformations have been rationalised in terms of a structural map that involves the oxygen packing fraction. As the packing fraction reaches the value expected for a random lose packing of hard spheres, tetrahedral networks transform into octahedral networks. This analysis also holds for molten basalt under deep mantle conditions. The results have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe in situ high pressure neutron diffraction method has also been developed to measure the structure of disordered materials at pressures up to 8 GPa and temperatures up to 150 deg C. The technique has been applied to measure the structure of both water and salty water. To aid in the interpretation of the results, we have also developed a cell for investigating these materials at pressures up to 0.2 GPa and temperatures up to 400 deg C. A full analysis of the data is underway. The instrument developments provide the means for employing the method of neutron diffraction to measure the structure of liquid and glassy materials in situ at pressures up to17.5 GPa and temperatures up to 150 deg C. All of the apparatus is available to the scientific community at the ILL and ISIS.\n\nThe structural maps for oxide materials should prove useful for the design of new materials by offering the means for predicting when structural transformations may occur. This information will also be important for the geophysics community because structural transformations alter the compressibility and transport properties (e.g. viscosity) of magma-related materials.\n\nThe molecular dynamics methods used to investigate the structure of the selected prototypical materials under high-pressure conditions should also be transferrable to other materials e.g. from silica to silicates.
