The functionality of a traditional photonic device is usually realized by reshaping the wavefront of the light that relies on gradual phase changes along the optical paths, which are accomplished by either controlling the surface topography or varying the spatial profile of the refractive index. The thickness of photonic devices usually remains comparable to the wavelength of the light. However, further reduction in the thickness of the corresponding element is hindered by the design theory since it is based on phase accumulation along the optical path. Metamaterials can usually be engineered to exhibit electromagnetic properties that may not be found in nature or its constituent components, thus providing an unconventional alternative to optical design. Metasurfaces, the emerging field of metamaterials, which consist of a single layer of artificial &quot;atoms&quot;, have recently captured the attention of the scientific community since they do not require complicated three-dimensional nano-fabrication techniques but can control light propagation in equally dramatic ways. Unlike the phase change by the accumulated optical path in traditional optical elements, the abrupt phase change takes place at the metasurfaces, meaning that a new freedom for controlling light propagation is introduced. Metasurfaces promise a whole variety of amazing applications, e.g. ultrathin metalens, spin-hall effect of light and spin controlled photonics. Recently, the PI and his collaborators have experimentally observed several new interesting phenomena connected with the phase discontinuities occurring at the metasurfaces: i) 3D optical holography ii) broadband vortex beam generator iii) dual-polarity ultrathin metalenses and iv) polarization dependent unidirectional surface plasmon polariton excitation. These findings are still under investigation and promise new exciting applications: such as simultaneous multiplane imaging, 3D optical holography with switchable reconstructed images and a waveguide based optical switch. \n\nThe proposal aims to expand our initial findings into a research programme based on my current competitive advantage in exploration of phase discontinuities at metasurfaces. I will design and fabricate plasmonic nanoantennas and elucidate phase discontinuities on the metasurfaces. The main focus of this research will be 1) to design and construct a state-of-the-art optical measurement system to characterize metasurface devices, 2) to elucidate the nature of phase discontinuities and tailor metaurfaces with unusual functionalities, 3) to engineer and fabricate plasmonic metasurfaces and 4) to experimentally demonstrate the prototype devices for simultaneous multiplane imaging, 3D optical holography with switchable reconstructed images and waveguide based optical switch. I plan not only to fabricate new plasmonic metasurfaces and study their extraordinary optical properties but also to assess their applications, which I believe are the most promising and within my expertise. It is the PI's expertise in nanofabrication, plasmonic metasurface and proof-of-concept demonstration which forms the basis of this proposal. It represents a timely and challenging adventure as this proposal is a synergetic integration of fundamental science, nano material/structure design, and prototype device development, which will impact a wide range of fields such as imaging, communication, encryption, information handling and data storage.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M003175/1","grantId":"EP/M003175/1","fundValue":"87051","fundStart":"2014-09-26","fundEnd":"2016-09-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Xianzhong  Chen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
