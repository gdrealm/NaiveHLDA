{"id":"EF7ACAAF-ED9E-42C6-A1C0-465739DC8F25","title":"Equipment to image capillary pores and micro-cracks in concrete","abstractText":"The premature deterioration of concrete structures is a major worldwide problem. Concrete is inevitably micro-porous and all of the main deterioration processes are controlled by penetration of external species into the concrete. The Concrete Durability Group at Imperial College wishes to develop: a) an improved understanding of deterioration processes; b) more durable materials; and c) models to predict long-term behaviour. In each of these research areas, the Group's work would be greatly strengthened by having the capability to image (at the appropriate scale), the pores and micro-cracks controlling penetration.Preliminary work has identified two techniques, which used in combination, will enable this. These are 2D backscattered electron imaging in a field emission scanning electron microscope and 3D fluorescent imaging in a laser scanning confocal microscope. This proposal is for the provision of the necessary equipment plus 12 months of research assistant time to develop techniques for use in current and future research projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D061687/1","grantId":"EP/D061687/1","fundValue":"397797","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nick  Buenfeld","coPersons":["Martin Keith Head"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
