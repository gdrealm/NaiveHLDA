The new x-ray light will for the first time be of sufficient intensity to eject both electrons of each tightly bound pair. The present research involves augmenting the world-leading computer code (HELIUM) that models electron pairs around a nuclear site responding instant-to-instant to intense laser light, so that response to the new high intensity x-ray laser light can be handled adequately. This development will have the consequence of bringing the full power of HECToR and future supercomputers into play in addressing new, exciting and topical Science. Gaining the wavefunction solution to the Schrodinger equation in particular geometries can be helpful in making direct comparison with experimental results. We plan a wavefunction transformation from the spherical of HELIUM (by far the most efficient geometry in which to calculate the single-centre wavefunction) to the cylindrical, which will benefit comparison with experimemntal results at all laser wavelengths.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F011067/1","grantId":"EP/F011067/1","fundValue":"127582","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"K  Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
