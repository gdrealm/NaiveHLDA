What developmental mechanisms guide the precise formation of such vast numbers of synaptic connections? This question is at the heart of understanding brain development, but it also has implications for understanding the processes of learning and memory, and the underlying basis of neurological diseases such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. Unlike a computer, which must be fully assembled before it can function, the brain begins to function as it develops. This early activity, which is modulated by experience and the surrounding environment, is utilised by the developing brain to shape and refine synaptic connections. From a developmental point of view, this provides a mechanism to adapt the developing brain to a diverse and changing environment. The purpose of this project is to investigate how activity influences the behaviour of developing neurons to bring about changes in synaptic connectivity. We will use precise manipulations of activity in neurons within the intact developing brain of zebrafish larvae. Because zebrafish larvae are translucent we are able to use time-lapse imaging to see how such manipulations of activity influence the behaviour of neurons in real-time. By using these approaches we will gain detailed and novel insights into the precise roles of activity in shaping the developing nervous system. Such insights may prove to be invaluable for understanding the causes and progression of neurological diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801242","grantId":"G0801242","fundValue":"484031","fundStart":"2009-04-05","fundEnd":"2012-04-04","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Meyer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
