The 2009 reporting rates for Great Britain show more than 64 000 cases, an increase of 30% in Scotland and 14% in England &amp; Wales on the previous year, that has continued into 2010. Because there is substantial under-reporting of campylobacteriosis, the actual number of cases in 2009 is likely to be closer to 450 000. Further, about 10% of reported cases are hospitalised. This rise is all the more disappointing because rates of infection with Campylobacter had been falling between 2000 and 2005. Molecular strain typing, by us and others, has identified that poultry is significantly the most important source of this infection with the most common types found in human beings also being the most common in chickens. Studies on retail poultry show a prevalence of Campylobacter in this meat of over 65% with the main routes of infection being eating improperly cooked meat or cross-contamination to uncooked foods. To reduce this burden of human disease, action must be taken to reduce Campylobacter loads in poultry and The Food Standards Agency, Defra and BBSRC have all identified this as a major priority. The FSA is considering targets for the reduction in levels of Campylobacter in raw chicken at retail, to be achieved by April 2015. The target will be set and achieved through stakeholder engagement and partnership working. Interventions in the poultry industry abroad have resulted in dramatic decreases in human infection rates. For example, in Iceland where freezing of positive carcasses is used, in New Zealand where interventions and regulations were introduced and in the USA where improved hygiene and the use of chlorine washes for carcasses has been implemented. However, UK industry has largely been unable to achieve reductions. Although strategies such as poultry vaccination are attractive in the longer term, more immediately it will be through informed biosecurity interventions on broiler farms that control is likely to be most readily achieved. Indeed UK producers widely recognise that where robust biosecurity remains unbreached, as for the valuable (grand)parent birds that are used to produce the eggs that hatch into broilers, then Campylobacter colonisation is uncommon. It is in the high throughput broiler production that colonisation regularly occurs and where novel biosecurity controls, as proposed here, could play an important role. Our previous studies of the sources of Campylobacter infection in humans not only identified the principal source as broiler chickens, it also identified that the distribution of Campylobacter strains found in humans and in the reservoirs of chicken, cattle, sheep, wild birds, pigs etc, were quite distinct with some strains common to several hosts. This proposal seeks to better understand the relative importance of the potential sources of Campylobacter in broilers by using a modelling approach. The hypothesis is that some Campylobacter strains and some Campylobacter reservoirs are much more important than others in this process and that it is only by quantitating their relative importance and their interaction with each other that it will be possible to robustly identify the sources of Campylobacter in the broiler house and hence introduce effective measures to prevent the colonisation of these birds during production. The findings will enable policy to be developed (e.g. code of practice) to define which control measures are most effective in keeping broiler houses Campylobacter free. This will strongly influence industry through improved farming practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I024577/1","grantId":"BB/I024577/1","fundValue":"28808","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings are being written up for publication.

This research used a modelling approach to study whether some Campylobacter strains and some Campylobacter reservoirs are much more important than others in this process. This was achieved by quantitating their relative importance and their interaction with each other and this will allow informed and hopefully more effective measures to prevent the colonisation of these birds during production. The studies have measured the ability of relevant strains to survive in the environment under different farming and weather conditions; this tells us how well they can survive once they have been excreted by farm animals in fields surrounding a broiler farm. This tells us what the infection pressure is on the broiler house from outside. The studies have measured how readily Campylobacter cells can move from surrounding areas to the broiler house, and what the environmental influences on this are. The studies measured the ability of relevant strains to colonise chickens and whether the animal source that they had came from influenced this. This tells us whether all strains are equally likely to colonise the broilers once they have entered the broiler house from outside. All of these microbiological measurements were input into different mathematical models to create an overview model of the whole pathway of Campylobacter moving from animals in surrounding farmland to colonising the broilers in the shed. The results show that cattle or sheep farms situated in the close vicinity of broiler houses play an important role for colonisation; however, wild birds have an important contribution to colonisation of broilers only if they carry Campylobacter strains which are highly infective to chicken, periods of elevated rain will facilitate the spread of Campylobacter, hence increasing the colonisation risk. Infection pressure patterns on the broiler houses suggest the following putative mitigation strategies: - placing live stock (e.g. cattle and sheep) at distances larger than 100 m will substantially reduce the infection pressure (i.e. at indistinguishable levels). - removing high shedding ruminants substantially reduces the infection pressure if distance from the pastures to the broiler houses are &gt;30 m - infection pressure due to wild birds is high, comparable or higher to that from ruminants due to the fact that birds can excrete faeces in the immediate proximity of the broiler houses; therefore birds scarers might be used to keep them at distance from the houses. We have a much improved understanding of the differences in colonization of broilers by different strains, both from a biological and mathematical perspectives. This, along with archived microbiological samples is a resource that can be used to further understand the underlying genetic and possibly physiological basis of why different Campylobacter strains have different host specificities.
