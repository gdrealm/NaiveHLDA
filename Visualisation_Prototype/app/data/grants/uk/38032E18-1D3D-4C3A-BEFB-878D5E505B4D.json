SSCC is well established in the USA and prominent in leading journals, but historically marginalised in the UK and Japan. This undermines theoretical innovation and the often highly US dominated international literature has ignore the experiences of other states. Our premise was:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to promote SSCC research in the UK and Japan</li>\n\n <li>how the distinct experiences of UK and Japanese scholars can generate innovative research. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The meetings have fostered UK-Japanese research cooperation.Three collaborative research groups have been set up, focusing on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>domestic politics and international behavior</li>\n\n <li>international peacekeeping</li>\n\n <li>multilateral military cooperation.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Activities that have taken place include a series of joint manuscripts, joint research grant applications, a replication of a UK survey experiment in Japan, a joint project to collect data on military bases, and postdoctoral fellowship applications, and a formal collaborative agreement between the Universities of Essex and Kobe is currently in preparation.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-805-26-0016","grantId":"RES-805-26-0016","fundValue":"14719","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Skrede  Gleditsch","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
