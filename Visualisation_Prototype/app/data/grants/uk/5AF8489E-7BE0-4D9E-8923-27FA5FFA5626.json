{"id":"5AF8489E-7BE0-4D9E-8923-27FA5FFA5626","title":"Gastrocert: Gastronomy and Creative Entrepreneurship in Rural Tourism","abstractText":"Working in collaboration with partners in Spain, Sweden and Italy, the Gastrocert project will explore how the development of local gastronomy can help to protect rural heritage values, and how entrepreneurial culture can enhance locally produced food as a value-added touristic experience.\nSustainable landscape management in rural areas requires the creation of opportunities that treat landscapes in the context of their historical, cultural and social factors. The growing popularity of gastronomy efforts, as part of broader sustainable tourism development strategies, calls for study of the dynamics between 'heritage', 'tourism' and 'creative entrepreneurship'.\nThe objectives include understanding the important role that food plays in cultural identities and promotion of local and regional traditions. The project also emphasizes the significance of local knowledge, skills and practices regarding heritage assets and how experiential journeys through cultural landscapes promote gastronomic tourism.\nThe project will entail high-quality, interdisciplinary and collaborative research that will enhance our understanding of the vitally important role that food plays in cultural identities and the appreciation and promotion of local and regional traditions. Gastronomic heritages - and the associated issues of rural and regional development - are truly interdisciplinary subjects that require appreciation of history, art, landscapes, environmental conservation and social structures.\nThis project is designed to produce the following outcomes, which includes the direct transfer of study findings to SME's and policymakers:\n? Reports on how local markets can be used to preserve and sustain local producers, while maintaining local identity.\n? A blueprint for the development of regional gastronomic initiatives that involve SMEs, public bodies and destination marketing organisations.\n? A toolkit on how SMEs can communicate the importance of landscapes and traditions thrnarratives'.\n? Results synthesised into appropriate documentation and presented to policymakers, to develop a better understanding of how gastro-tourism can contribute to economic development and increased understanding and preservation of gastronomic cultural heritage.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N504439/1","grantId":"AH/N504439/1","fundValue":"157603","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Justin Varley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the Highlands and Islands","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
