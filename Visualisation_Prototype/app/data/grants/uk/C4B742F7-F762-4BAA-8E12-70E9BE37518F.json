{"id":"C4B742F7-F762-4BAA-8E12-70E9BE37518F","title":"Rapport: Robust Application Porting for HPC in the Cloud.","abstractText":"We propose to examine the feasibility of Cloud Computing for Physics and Bionformatics e-Science by porting a set of scientific applications in these domains to a variety of Cloud platforms. This work will be carried out in conjunction with application scientists in Bioinformatics and Physics. The applications that have been selected for piloting on Cloud platforms have been chosen because they present challenges in data volume, processing requirements or close-coupled parallel execution that are typical of most scientific HPC software. Project outputs will be a study of HPC Cloud feasibility which will compare performance of the selected software on a variety of Cloud platforms, seek to determine best practice for Cloud deployment of HPC software both generally and in the chosen domains, and make general recommendations about the use of Clouds for scientific HPC software within an institutional context.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I034246/1","grantId":"EP/I034246/1","fundValue":"87076","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Darlington","coPersons":["David  Colling","Sarah Anne Butcher","Neil Philippe Chue Hong"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
