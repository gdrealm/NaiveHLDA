The key purpose of our Network is to strengthen such investment in the area of Next Generation Telecommunications Networks in support of the Digital Economy. Such aspirations are pivotal for social inclusion and economic prosperity in both the UK and India. Within the UK, the situation is improving, but according to Ofcom's recent report on the Nations and Regions 2007, more work needs to be done to ensure that the benefits of the Digital Economy are accessible and affordable to all of its citizens. With a growing middle class that now numbers nearly 400 million people, India's electronics equipment consumption, estimated at $28.2 billion in 2005, is expected to reach $363 billion by 2015. Domestic production totalled $10.99 billion in 2005 and is projected at $155 billion in 2015, according to ISA estimates, thanks to such drivers as mobile phones, wireless equipment, set-tops and smart-card terminals. These developments, and the priorities of government to raise educational and business standards and address social and economic deprivation, are driving the pressure on the enabling communications and service providers to come up with cost-effective solutions that can be rolled out at scale in support of the digital economy in both countries.Within our proposed Network, we will address a number of themes that will contribute to the development and deployment of Next Generation Converged Networks. These themes build on the strengths of our Network Members and also provide the greatest opportunities for the consideration of Technology Demonstrators that will underpin the development of government policies and initiatives for both Rural and Urban Digital Economy programmes in both UK and India.For the past two years, under the invitation of EPSRC and the British High Commission in Delhi, Professor Parr has established a UK-India Advisory Group (see Letters of Support from British High Commission Personnel in India). This group has been formulating a development plan between the two nations, involving an agenda of activities within the context of Next Generation Networking; the purpose is to encourage the development of real and meaningful collaborations that will be internationally leading and economically relevant to both the UK and India. Overall, the intention is the establishment of a joint Indo-UK Virtual Centre of Excellence that will address the domain of Next Generation Networking for the benefit of both nations. The provision of core funding through this EPSRC INTERACT Programme is critical to the creation of our Network and to enable our plans to go forward on a sure footing for the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F030118/1","grantId":"EP/F030118/1","fundValue":"118919","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This EPSRC Network was established in direct response to a previous request from the British High Commission in India. It aimed to assist with the establishment and embedding of a consortium of academic and industrial partners that would work closely together explore the merits of creating the first 'Virtual' India-UK Advanced Technology Centre (IU-ATC) in Next Generation Networks Systems and Services. Overall, we have been very successful. We formed an excellent and internationally leading consortium with BT Innovate at Adastral Park to act up as its Prime Industrial Driver, together with major industrial partners from India led by InfoSys Technologies. We put in place the support infrastructure to facilitate meetings, encourage exchanges and technical discussions and this helped us to identify key government, social and economic priorities between the research active groups in both countries.\nWithin the context of this Network project we aimed to focus on:\n* gaining an understanding of the real-time problems associated with designing, deploying, operating and managing national digital fixed-wireless communications infrastructures.\n* the creation of application, configuration and resource discovery protocols and mechanisms that sit within an Enterprise-wide Service Oriented Environment in support of the Digital Economy.\n* designing and exchanging new techniques for acquiring high capacity data analytics for communications cross-layer operations and functions in a converged network architecture that will provide for greater intelligence and customer-centric solutions.\n* encouraging innovation and research capacity building between EE/CS research-active groups and industrial partners in support of Digital Economy requirements.\n* deployment of context-aware network management protocols which will underpin the ability of regional/national and international networks to support application domains such as financial services, e.business, e.government, e.health, emergency response and Location Based Services.\n* investigating and designing reconfigurable security frameworks for resilient communications across converged networks that enable a digital economy to function.\nWe have had significant success in obtaining our mission objectives to improve and ground the collaborative links between UK and India in ICT research and innovation. This Networking grant was used effectively to establish the first major India-UK consortium in Next Generation Networks Systems and Services. The consortium that was formed has developed and matured over the duration of the Network Grant through a series of workshops supported by EPSRC and the British High Commission in India, commencing with a Technical Workshops at IIT Madras, BT Adastral Park, InfosSys in Bangalore and the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland. We also attracted facilitation support from BT, and Government of India Department of Science and Technology. Through related efforts the PI attracted support from EPSRC, UKTI Innovation Scheme, FCO Global Opportunities Fund (GOF), and a British Council UKIERI-DST Research Award (No- S083). The latter provided the funding for PhD students to accompany Faculty staff on visits of longer duration to counterparts and host institutions in both UK and India. Further EPSRC PhD CASE awards with BT were also attracted by the PI (EP/G500371/1 , EP/G501823/1, EP/H501657/1) during this period. Other EPSRC awards were allocated to our Network collaborators in Cambridge, Lancaster, Southampton, Queen Mary, Surrey and Southampton during the period. Of particular note is that fact that three additional PhD project awards were allocated to our partners in India (IIT Madras, IIT Delhi and IIT Mumbai) and these projects flowed from priority research themes identified during our INTERACT meetings. The work started and encouraged by this EPSRC Network Grant culminated in the development and successful funding announcement in January 2009 of the main India-UK Advanced Technology Centre (IU-ATC) of Excellence in Next Generation Networks Systems and Services that attracted a total investment from EPSRC-DST (EP/G051674/112) and industrial/academic partners to the tune of &pound;9.2m. This major consortium now comprises 8 research-leading universities in UK, 7 leading IITs, major industrial partners in UK and India (including companies such as BT, InfoSys, Wipro, Sasken, and Tejas), and a number of SMEs. The initiative has put in place the support infrastructure to facilitate, develop and enable the Digital Economy of both countries as part of an initial 30 month Phase 1 of an overall 5-year joint programme between the UK and India. This projects support a fundamental rethink to adapt and develop novel solutions and provide for research, innovation and wealth creation opportunities between UK and India in the NGN domain. Of later, there are approximately 110 scientists working within the IU-ATC in both countries and the initiative was recently recognised by the Times Higher during September 2010.\n\nOur project also allowed for a Follow on project for the IU-ATC as part of a &pound;10.2million Phase 2 project that is still currently operating. This is Grant Ref: EP/J016748/1.\n\nOverall, as a consequence of this Network Grant we were able to generate and leverage further funding of approx &pound;20 million to create the largest UK-India Project of its kind in the ICT sector.
