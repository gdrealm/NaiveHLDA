{"id":"540C235C-8573-4177-8095-DA08C95FA36E","title":"The Silences of Science","abstractText":"Through a series of three workshops, the Silences of Science network will examine different aspects of the paradox that science depends both on prolixity and on reticence. It will seek to interrogate the assumption that open and efficient channels of communication are always of greatest benefit to science and to society. It aims to draw the attention of the research community to the creative importance of silence, of interruptions in communication, of isolation and of 'stuckness'.\n\nDiscussion of the theory and practice of science communication typically emphasises the removal of barriers (for example, between scientist and citizen) and the reduction of distortion (scientific inaccuracy and misrepresentation in the media). Restricted access to scientific knowledge becomes the object of moral censure, whilst maximised communication is frequently taken as an unquestioned social good. \n\nHowever, science - and its communication - depends as much on discontinuities, on barriers and lacunae, as it does on the free flow of information. Contrary to the ideal of science as an open enterprise, scientific innovation and scientific commerce rely on the constant use of moral, legal and technical devices that restrict, rather than encourage, the sharing of ideas. For instance, Information Property Rights procedures close off the flow of information to the scientific community, even as they enable the subsequent commercial development of an idea. Likewise, fear of plagiarism can radically restrict scientists' willingness to discuss their work openly.\n\nHumanities scholars from a range of disciplines have drawn attention to the constructive role of silence - from the meaningfulness of pauses and omissions in literature, to the role of solitude and quietude in the history of religion, or the uses of silence within the legal system. However, to date such interests have been sporadic and largely directed towards disciplinary interests. In particular, there has been no attempt to draw on this work to inform the study of the practice and communication of science.\n\nThe Silences of Science research network will bring together a range of scholars - for instance, from literary studies, media studies, legal studies, religious studies, as well as from the history and philosophy of science, policy studies and science communication studies - who are able to draw on insights from their disciplines in order to develop a conceptual framework with which to examine the role of silence within the sciences. The workshop format facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration and is intended to stimulate novel research among the academic participants.\n\nThe network will also include practising scientists and those working in science policy, with the aim of informing research communication practice and policy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K005804/1","grantId":"AH/K005804/1","fundValue":"23681","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The workshops have attracted media attention and have also fed into the exhibition/events programme at the Wellcome Collection, including a 'Silence and Noise' event in Jan 2015 which will feature the audio piece produced as part of the project.

The first workshop brought together a range of disciplinary perspectives which highlighted the generative role of silence in areas as diverse as music, religion and the natural sciences. The second workshop focussed on work in science and technology studies that considers the different manifestations of silence in the history of science and contemporary science communication. The final workshop explored scientists' views of the tensions between silence and speaking out. The Silences of Science network has helped stimulate a focus on silence in science communication among workshop participants. For instance, one participant now has AHRC funding for a workshop series on Music Noise and Silence. Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
