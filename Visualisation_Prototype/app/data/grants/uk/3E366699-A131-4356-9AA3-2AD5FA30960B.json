{"id":"3E366699-A131-4356-9AA3-2AD5FA30960B","title":"Proust Among the Nations - A comparatist study","abstractText":"The Dreyfus Affair is the defining cultural and political moment in turn of the century France with ramifications which stretch across Europe. In this project I aim to investigate the precise relationship of Marcel Proust to the Affair as part of a wider investigation of how Europe's cultural and literary representation of the Jewish Question and the issue of national minorities has implications that stretch to the Middle East which, through the founding of the State of Israel, has in many ways become heir to this difficult moment of European history.\\nProust's relationship to his Jewish background is often characterised as one of denial as his central narrator is not Jewish, while at the same time the society he depicts is peopled with Jewish characters two of them absolutely central to the narrative, Charles Swann and Albert Bloch.\\nIn this study, I will investigate Proust's relationship to Dreyfus through his precise historical engagement with the Affair and the Jewish Question in late nineteenth century France. I will focus on Proust's position in relation to key Jewish figures such as Theodor Herzl for whom the Dreyfus Affair was also a defining moment in his founding of political Zionism, and Bernard Lazare, central anarcho-socialist and writer from the same time, offering a new triangulation, through Dreyfus, of Lazare, Herzl and Proust which has not been proposed before.\\nCentral to this investigation will be the part played by both Proust and Lazare in the literary publication, La revue blanche, in the 1890s, one of the formative contexts for the development of French Jewish intellectual and cultural identity, taking in the writings of such figures as Julien Benda, Gustave Khan and Maxime Gaucher, Proust's teacher and an early writer for the review. I will also be investigating Proust's engagement in the trial of Emile Zola which he attended on a daily basis from February 7- 23 1898. In addition to the historical documentation of the Dreyfus Affair, my key sources will therefore be La revue blanche and, for Zola, the newspapers L'Aurore and Le Figaro.\\nThis research will then be used to return, in close textual detail, to A la recherche, in order to give Proust's position on the Jewish Question and the issue of national minorities a new form of historical density.\\nThe study will allow me to shed new light on Proust's involvement with Dreyfus, with French Jewish intellectual and cultural life, as well as to show how Proust's unique engagement with these questions, the complexity of his rendering, might be set alongside other versions of national identity which have been the historic consequence of the crisis he recorded with such minute attention.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H006745/1","grantId":"AH/H006745/1","fundValue":"42674","fundStart":"2010-01-05","fundEnd":"2010-05-04","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jacqueline  Rose","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
