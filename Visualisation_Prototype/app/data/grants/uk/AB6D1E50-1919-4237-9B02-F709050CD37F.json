This project aims to improve access to oxygen using novel sustainable solutions.\nThe objective of this project is to develop an oxygen (O2) delivery system for use in resource-limited settings that will operate reliably and cost-effectively with little or no maintenance and limited or absent mains power. No such solution currently exists. We propose to develop and field test such an oxygen system and to produce a specification that is suitable for production. With such a product lifesaving treatment could reach those for whom it is currently beyond reach, and do so at a much lower cost than traditional oxygen cylinders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_EX_MR/K015567/1","grantId":"MC_EX_MR/K015567/1","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2013-06-03","fundEnd":"2016-06-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Syed Mohd Akramuz  Zaman","coPersons":["Stephen Ross Howie"],"organisation":"MRC Unit, The Gambia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
