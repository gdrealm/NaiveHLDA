For example, how many times have you felt itchy or even scratched yourself when watching TV programmes where people have insects crawling over their hands and faces? In this case we know that the insects are not actually on us but the ability to recognise what is a 'true' bodily event vs. a 'false' one has implications for many common and distressing unexplained medical symptoms such as itch, numbness, tickling or tingling sensations and even some forms of pain. The purpose of our research is to find better biological markers of these bodily symptoms and help explain how the brain can 'create' bodily sensations in the absence of any actual physical input. \nIn five experimental studies we will use state-of-the-art brain imaging techniques to measure the activity of the brain before the person actually reports feeling touch or thinks they have been touched in cases when no touch has even been applied to them. We will measure the brain's response before the stimulation occurs and we will measure the person's own behavioural response indicating whether they think they have been touched or not. We will then compare the brain response to the 'true' (i.e., when touch has occurred) vs. 'false' (i.e., when it didn't) bodily event. In another study we will ask people to focus their attention on their own internal bodily sensations (such as their heartbeat) to see whether this increases the number of false bodily events reported by people and changes their brain response in a predictable way. In the final study, we will use a method that allows us to directly stimulate the brain to see whether this changes the number of false bodily events that people report in a predictable way, thus giving us a likely cause, based on differences in brain function, as to why some people experience a higher number of bodily symptoms that don't seem to have any physical cause. \nBased on evidence from our previous studies we predict that people who show a particular pattern of brain activity (involving the medial frontal and parietal regions at the centre of the brain) will say they feel touch (even when they haven't been touched) more than other people who have the opposite pattern of brain activity (involving lateral frontal and parietal regions at the outer edges of the brain). These regions in the middle of the brain have been linked to studies involving pain and hallucinations but this will be the first time they have been linked to creating bodily symptoms and the first time anyone has recorded their activity before the person is actually touched. By measuring this activity we aim to be able to predict who is more likely to be susceptible to experiencing these false bodily sensations and in the future be able to help them by developing more effective treatments that target these overactive parts of the brain and stop them producing symptoms like itch and pain.\nThe outcomes of this research have the potential to benefit a wide variety of people, from basic scientists to people with medical conditions. We will know more about the brain after completing this project, which will help other scientists to understand the brain and its role in controlling bodily awareness. It will also give us more information on the possible causes of some medical conditions such as some forms of itch, numbness and pain, which at the moment are difficult to treat because there doesn't seem to be anything physically wrong with the body. Ultimately, this research will provide us with a better understanding of the brain systems responsible for bodily awareness and improved methods for measuring these systems, which can then be used to develop more effective treatments for people with medically unexplained somatic conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L006618/1","grantId":"BB/L006618/1","fundValue":"346336","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The grant is currently in month 6 of a 3-year project and hasn't as yet produced any economic or societal impact outside of academia.

However, significant new knowledge on the role of alpha in somatosensory misperception is starting to be generated and we are developing innovative research methods to explore the data, which will result in increased research capability generated from training delivered in specialist skills At this stage our findings will have most impact on advancing research and scholarship in the basic neuroscience underlying somatosensory perception through dissemination to other scientists. We have formed a research group with a specialized interest in cognitive neuroimaging (http://www.leeds.ac.uk/coni; Twitter: @LeedsCoNi; Facebook page to follow), which has allowed us to capacity-build neurosciences expertise in the department with colleagues using cognitive neuroscience methodologies, such as EEG, fMRI and tDCS, to address questions of cognitive function, language processing and visual perception. We have also been able to attract funding for 2 PhD students. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
