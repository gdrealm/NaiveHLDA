The intersection of class and gender in women's lives in the North East'","abstractText":"<p>This project is a study of women's lives in the North East,&nbsp; unpacking the interconnections between class and gender with attention to regional specificity. The title aims to convey the multidimensional nature of this research which explores a 'new' feminised social mobility and the relevance and retention of class.<br /><br />This project contains a strong comparative dimension, crucial to the overall goal of highlighting women's varied positioning within regional transition/stagnation and the significance of gender and class in mediating identifications with 'past' landscapes and present desires, aspirations and material (im)possibilities. It investigates the emergence of new femininities in a situation of industrial degeneration and regeneration, investigating what has hitherto been under-researched when compared with the attention that has focused on boys' and men's experiences of these social processes. This is achieved by conducting&nbsp; in-depth interviews with women across class positions and age range (n=97), using three differently classed locations as the basis of recruitment.<br /><br />Taylor, Y.
