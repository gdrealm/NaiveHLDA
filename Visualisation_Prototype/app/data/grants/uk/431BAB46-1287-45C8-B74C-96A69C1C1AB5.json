{"id":"431BAB46-1287-45C8-B74C-96A69C1C1AB5","title":"e-Size","abstractText":"Today fashion e-retail, conceived as a web presence alone, is not sufficient for any high street retailer to operate or promote themselves. High street retailers still find it challenging to communicate store atmosphere and excellent service via online communication. However retailers that operate single and multiple channel strategies can provide a range of valuable benefits for customers while still maintaining heritage, luxury status and service. This can be achieved by innovative use of new technologies and digital tools such as 3d body-scanning, style advice, co-design and interactive screening, which enables an online retailer to equal or surpass that of the physical retail environment. This is becoming a key strategy for the future viability of high street retailers, as additional channels can provide additional income. In particular for garments which need to provide an exceptionally good fit, the anthropometric data generated by sizing systems such as body-scanners can actually bridge the gap between &quot;custom-made&quot; and &quot;mass-produced&quot; and ultimately lead to a substantial growth of online sales.Anthropometrics, the study of measuring the human body, has been considered by tailors and scientists for decades, but instead of using traditional methods of measurement, a good fit can now be achieved digitally. The big question for high street retailers is how accurately? This project capitalises on the widespread use of standard devices such as mobile phone and home webcam technology to take a picture of an individual in their home, upload it and use it to produce accurate body measurements that will ultimately enhance customers' satisfaction by improving their online shopping experience on the retailer's website and by therefore reducing returns due to poor fit. The choice of the most suitable application is driven by our previous research. The application is novel since use 2D images to infer 3D bodyshape and has more potential to offer &quot;true virtual fitting&quot; as opposed to the ones which use user 2D measurement data. By virtue of this software application costumers are more likely to better match their shape and measurements to garment data by overall increasing their satisfaction with the online shopping experience and by thus reducing returns. This project will focus on user experience testing by integrating feedback from customers into sizing information and guidance to improve their online shopping experience and feedback into the garment information as well. The keys to this are the quality and accuracy of the measurements, overall user satisfaction with the online experience and effectively matching body and garment measurements so the consumer can find the best fitting clothing size. Drawing on our existing research, we specifically seek to assess the implementation and the deployment of a novel software application into the e-retailer systems so that if a customer uses widely available technology such as a mobile phone or webcam as a body scan device to shop and then later decide to return an item, it will be flagged up and the customer can be asked for feedback about the reasons for returning the item. This project is specifically framed around the user experience with the twofold aim to promote the elimination of waste through reduction of returns, and to increase customer satisfaction by addressing the balance between online and high street shopping experience within the digital era.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L005220/1","grantId":"ES/L005220/1","fundValue":"85121","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alessandra  Vecchi","coPersons":["Mouhannad  Al-Sayegh","Fanke  Peng","Anthony Martin Kent"],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
