{"id":"E0D9D325-E5DC-4880-9692-46AD9D14538D","title":"Hyperuniform Disordered Photonic Materials","abstractText":"In this proposal we aim to develop novel photonic materials in which disorder is exploited as a resource, to control light emission and transport, for future generations of optical devices.\nThe use of light to communicate and process information is widely recognised as the technology that will drive innovations in the 21st century across a wide range of areas, from information technology, energy and sensing, to healthcare. So far, control of light flow has been achieved by carefully and periodically structured materials, which can bend light, slow it down and stop if for a short time, to allow for the processing steps to take place. \nDue to advances in theoretical, computational and nano-fabrication capabilities we are no longer restricted to well-defined periodic structures. Instead we can construct complex systems made of apparently random patterns, which when suitably designed, can lead to performances superior to those offered by conventional photonic systems. \nThe proposed project will focus on the development of hyperuniform disordered nanophotonic materials, a novel class of photonic structures in which structural correlations and disorder are accurately controlled. Discovered in 2009, these new materials have already attracted considerable attention as they combine the robust properties of periodic systems with the flexibility of disordered ones. We will explore the properties of hyperuniform media with the goal to control light flow, to enhance light emission, and to construct novel type of lasers and optical circuits.\nThe research proposed will enhance UK's capabilities in disordered photonic materials, laser technology and integrated photonics circuitry, will have direct impact on more efficient and cost effective photovoltaic power generation and efficient lightning; the advanced optical capabilities to be enabled by our research will support the constant exponential growth of the &quot;internet of things&quot;.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M027791/1","grantId":"EP/M027791/1","fundValue":"356874","fundStart":"2015-12-01","fundEnd":"2018-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Marian  Florescu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
