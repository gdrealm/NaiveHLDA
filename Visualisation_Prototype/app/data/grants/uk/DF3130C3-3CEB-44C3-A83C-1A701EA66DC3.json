{"id":"DF3130C3-3CEB-44C3-A83C-1A701EA66DC3","title":"Child Poverty and Social Mobility: Lessons for Research and Policy","abstractText":"In the US President Obama recently described falling social mobility, together with rising inequality, as the &quot;defining challenge of our time&quot;. But social mobility is not only a concern for US policy makers. In the UK across the political spectrum there is a strong desire to develop policies that will improve the lifetime opportunities of poor children. Working with the Commission on Social Mobility and Child Poverty - a non-departmental public body established in statute by the Child Poverty Act and the Welfare reform Act and chaired by the Rt Hon Alan Milburn - the aim of this seminar series will be to bring together leading UK and international scholars (from across disciplines); policy makers and other key stakeholders (including think-tanks and charities) to present and debate the latest research findings and policy thinking in this area. By working directly with the Commission the seminar series will present an unparalleled opportunity for researchers to inform and engage directly with policy makers, cutting across Departmental boundaries within Whitehall, and potentially reaching both central and local government.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M002179/1","grantId":"ES/M002179/1","fundValue":"30240","fundStart":"2015-02-02","fundEnd":"2018-02-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Harkness","coPersons":["Paul  Gregg","Lindsey Anne Macmillan","Matthew Ronald Dickson","Lynn Prince Cooke"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
