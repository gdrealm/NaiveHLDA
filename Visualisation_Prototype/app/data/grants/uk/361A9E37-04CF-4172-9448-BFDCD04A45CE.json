This decribes the symptoms caused by the death of the heart muscle downstream of the blockage. We are intersted in preventing the death of this muscle by studying the role of proteins known as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. These proteins aggravate muscle death and also cause on-going heart damage that can lead to heart failure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802033","grantId":"G0802033","fundValue":"627561","fundStart":"2009-10-19","fundEnd":"2013-10-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Stephen Marber","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
