It will do this by consolidating and expanding partnerships for knowledge exchange with a range of partners in the UK and in the Middle East, particularly through a range of institutional and student-led internships, and by continuing to support innovative research networks capable of generating groundbreaking research and achieving wide dissemination. Finally, it will consolidate an MSc in Advanced Arabic at the University of Edinburgh and develop a Persian language and cultural immersion programme at Manchester University that will represent key resources for advanced language and culture training. CASAW works closely with the other UK LBAS centres to sustain a vigorous programme of area studies training and dissemination events across the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L006774/1","grantId":"AH/L006774/1","fundValue":"313708","fundStart":"2014-02-14","fundEnd":"2016-08-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Marilyn Louise BoothThomas  Pierret","coPersons":["A  Ehteshami"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
