{"id":"10EABFA9-CE6B-4427-9A39-E49F2E633D4D","title":"The role of learning mechanisms in understanding spoken language","abstractText":"<p>To understand speech listeners must accurately and rapidly select the correct meaning for each word they encounter. For example they might need to determine, on the basis of sentence context, whether the word “spade” refers to a digging tool or a card suit. Despite the apparent ease with which listeners usually accomplish this task, meaning selection is known to be cognitive demanding, and is a source of particular difficultly for individuals/groups with comprehension deficits. This research explores the contribution of learning mechanisms to meaning selection in healthy adults. For example, someone who had recently taken up gardening or card-playing could potentially make meaning selection easier for “spade” by using their recent experience to make better predictions about which meaning is likely to be encountered in the future. A combination of lab-based and web-based experiments will measure the impact of different types of experience with ambiguous words on how they are processed after a delay of minutes, days or weeks. Additional experiments will explore whether listeners take into account the speaker’s identity or accent to aid their interpretation of ambiguous words. This research will form the basis for future attempts to characterise the precise difficulties of individuals/groups with comprehension deficits.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K013351/1","grantId":"ES/K013351/1","fundValue":"298855","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We are only 8 month into the funded period, and it is too early for us to have had observed impact.

More specifically, how they use past encounters with ambiguous words (e.g., BARK) to guide their interpretation of these words in the future. We refer to this use of past experience as word-meaning priming (WMP)\nIn the first 8 months of the grant we have produced two key findings\n1) The learning processes that support WMP are associative in nature\nPrior to the commencement of the grant we tested (as a student project) the directly opposing predictions made by two different theories about the nature of the underlying learning mechanisms. Specifically, we compared the predictions of error-driven and associative accounts, which make different predictions about when WMP should be maximal. Error-driven learning accounts predict maximal priming when the ambiguous word occurs early in the sentence and is highly likely to be misinterpreted (e.g., the PEN that the man wanted was for the SHEEP). In contrast associative account predict maximal priming when the listener is certain about the meaning of the ambiguous word at the point in time at which they encounter the word (e.g., the sheep PEN was the one that the man wanted). We found a significant priming advantage for the latter type of sentences which strongly indicates that the learning mechanism is associative in nature. To rule out an episodic memory account of this theoretically important result we have now compared these two sentences types in an explicit memory task. The observed null result confirms that the previous result is not due to differences in episodic memory for the two sentence types.\n2) Listeners use knowledge of speaker accents to guide their interpretations\nThese experiments have explored whether listeners can keep track of different meaning preferences of words for particular groups of speakers. We make use of the fact that the relative frequency of some word meanings is markedly different in UK and US English (e.g., &quot;flat&quot;, &quot;tube&quot;, &quot;gas&quot;). We tested both UK and US participants using a web-based word association task and confirmed that UK listeners (but not US listeners) take account of speaker accent when interpreting these words, such that they are more likely to assign a US meaning (e.g., &quot;gas - CAR&quot; )when the word is spoken in a US accent. The interaction with group is likely due to differences in their experience with the non-native dialect: US participants have considerably less experience with UK speech than UK participants do with US speech. This finding suggests that either (i) listeners use fine-grained phonetic detail about the sounds of words to modulate their retrieval of word meanings, or (ii) speaker accent can provide an overall context that modulates access to word meanings. Additional experiments are underway to compare these two alternative accounts. This research is in the early stages, and a range of additional experiments are needed to determine (I) the precise theoretical implications of these findings, and (ii) how the different factors that we have identified as being important for comprehension operate together in more naturalistic environments. \n\nOnce these issues have been resolved, our research will form a key component in the subsequent development of an effective and scientifically-informed strategy for assessing the nature of the comprehension difficulties of a wide range of clinical and non-clinical populations including both children and adults.
