These are our outcomes of interest. In a second step, we will seek to\nbuild on, test and (where necessary) extend, explanations of the variations in representation we observe. These are based on empirical theories of political\nrepresentation in liberal democracies with a particular emphasis on the impact of political institutions and macro-level contextual factors on representation.\nWith regard to descriptive representation, our objectives are to collect data on the variation in the parliamentary 'presence' of CIOs across seven European democracies at\nnational and regional levels of government, and analyse it in terms of age, gender, national origin, career and political history and examine the primary socio-economic,\npolitical and institutional factors that affect the access of CIOs to elected office. In relation to substantive representation, our objectives are to study variations and\nsimilarities of parliamentary activity of CIOs across the seven countries and analyse whether there is a relationship between descriptive and substantive representation (as\nhypothesised, e.g., by critical mass and mainstreaming approaches).\nIn relation to both types of representation, our goals are to (a) to provide the social science and stakeholder community with original data on the political representation of CIOs in seven European countries - some of which have been neglected in previous studies - making the data freely available; and (b) to describe and explain variations and similarities in the descriptive and substantive representation of CIOs using, and extending, existing empirical theories of political representation in political science with particular emphasis on political institutions, strategies, social networks and political opportunity structures.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L016664/1","grantId":"ES/L016664/1","fundValue":"495591","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Laura  Morales","coPersons":["Gabriella  Lazaridis","Maria  Sobolewska","Carlo  Ruzza","Simona  Guerra","Luis Jose Ramiro","Edward  Fieldhouse"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
