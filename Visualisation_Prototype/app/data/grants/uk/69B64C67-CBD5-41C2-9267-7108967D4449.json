It employs a three-pronged approach to examine the use and understanding of social at different levels:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Strategic (Ministry of Defence)</li>\n\n <li>Users (personal, operational and public including serving, ex-serving military personnel and their families)</li>\n\n <li>Communications (social media texts).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Data will be gathered through qualitative methodologies (interviews, focus groups and observation work) to examine the motivations, intent and understanding of social media at the Strategic and User levels. To complement this, the communications approach will use social media analytics and textual analysis to identify the extent to which the above processes (in the user and strategic approach) are evident in social media texts including, for example, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Flicker, Pinteest and Blogs (official and non-official). Using this combined approach the project aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of how social media is perceived, understood and responded to as both a tool for strategic communication and a tool for uncertainty in defence practice.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K011170/1","grantId":"ES/K011170/1","fundValue":"242159","fundStart":"2013-10-31","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Findings have not been used to date because the entire research project has been significantly delayed in starting by the Ministry Of Defence's ethics process.
