The aim is to explain how managers and senior colleagues can be prepared to become agents for the gradual enhancement of workplace learning through developing an appropriate learning culture. This involves giving priority attention to factors shown to influence learning, such as relationships, challenge, good feedback and the appropriate allocation and structuring of work.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-139-25-0255","grantId":"RES-139-25-0255","fundValue":"23195","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Ruarc Eraut","coPersons":["C  Miller"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
