To do this, the thousands of different proteins adopt different shapes (folds) that are appropriate to their task. However, it is very easy for these shapes to become disrupted and such &quot;misfolded&quot; proteins tend to stick together and play an important role in many diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease) that are particularly associated with ageing. So correct protein folding, and the prevention of misfolding, are very important for health. In the proposed research, we aim to study a newly discovered protein fold that is found in a protein, SasG, from Staphylocococcus aureus. It is interesting because, given what we currently know about protein folding, SasG should be very unstable-but it isn't and should also misfold-but it doesn't. When molecules are discovered that challenge our current understanding of an important process, such as protein folding, it is very exciting because by studying them we are likely to significantly improve our knowledge of that process. That is, the fact that SasG appears to &quot;break the rules&quot; of protein stability and folding means we don't fully understand the rules. What we aim to do is to understand why SasG is stable, how it folds-up to its normal shape and how it avoids misfolding. By studying how proteins fold, why they misfold and how some proteins avoid misfolding we will make an important contribution to a wide range research. We might also help in the future development of therapeutic strategies to reduce the protein misfolding that leads to disease. SasG is a very repetitive, elongated protein; such proteins have potential uses in nanotechnology. Thus we will also perform experiments that will help establish its potential. Finally, as SasG has a novel structure, we will solve structures of a another protein with characteristics related to SasG, to see if it also has unusual structure that appears to break the rules.\n\nThe strategy we will use is straight-forward, so is likely to work. We will change many features of SasG, one at a time, to see if we can make it unstable and to misfold. This will then tell us which features are important for stability and correct folding. We will use a combination of both well-established and state-of-the-art techniques to perform the experiments. The well-established techniques involve the use of increasing concentrations of a chemical that makes proteins unfold; the more unstable the protein, the less chemical required for unfolding. Related experiments allows us to extract the rate of folding and unfolding. Other more recent, but still well-established, techniques involve pulling on the protein to measure the force required for unfolding. In the state-of-the-art techniques we will put two labels on the protein that are able to &quot;communicate&quot; dependent on how far apart they are. We place them so they will be too far apart to &quot;talk&quot; when the protein is correctly folded but close enough when the protein is misfolded. The use of lasers allows the communication between the labels to be detected on single molecules.\n\nThe work will be carried out in the labs of Dr Jennifer Potts at the University of York (where the structures of SasG were recently determined) and of Prof Jane Clarke, at the University of Cambridge, who is an expert on protein folding and misfolding and has recently developed the sensitive methods to detect misfolding events.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J005029/1","grantId":"BB/J005029/1","fundValue":"391446","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The grant is still running so Impact is still developing.
