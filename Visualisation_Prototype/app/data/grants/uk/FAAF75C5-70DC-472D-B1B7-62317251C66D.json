{"id":"FAAF75C5-70DC-472D-B1B7-62317251C66D","title":"Who were the nuns? Database development and extending access","abstractText":"The original project made a comprehensive study of the membership of the English convents and the English members of Mary Ward's Institute established during the period when they were proscribed in England. These institutions with more than 3907 (mainly English), members were all founded in exile in continental Europe from 1600 to 1678. They remained there until the French Revolution and its associated violence forced them to leave their adopted homelands. The project and related research has shown that they were significant foundations with international connections. Prior to the project, the convents have been little studied by historians and their documents and activities have remained largely unknown. One significant additional output is the forthcoming publication (Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2012-13) is six volumes of manuscript sources from the enclosed convents and this will significantly raise the profile of the project. Queen Mary has undertaken to maintain and support the database and website in the long term.\nMost (twenty two) were enclosed convents with a further fourteen mainly smaller houses founded by Mary Ward and her followers. They were not isolated from the world: their contacts and networks spread widely, including members of the royal family of England, the archdukes of Brussels and members of lay and ecclesiastical hierarchies across Europe among their supporters. The nuns built substantial convents and schools, commissioned works of art and music, and created important libraries and centres of learning for women. They continued to attract members and all except two survived until recently.\nGiven the positive feedback currently being received by the Who were the Nuns? project, the follow-on funding will permit further engagement with a wider public audience through developing the current website and study days. We will:\n- Enhance the searches provided on the existing website based on research already undertaken for the original project.\n- Develop methodology to provide directed dynamic statistical searches in order to analyse the lives of the English nuns under three specific headings - life cycles, county communities and social networks.\n- Enhance the database by adding images of places to individual entries.\n- In partnership with the Historical Association, set up a series of four symposia for local and family historians in carefully-chosen sites for study days to develop the use of the database and related material.\nThe proposed project team builds on the experience of the individuals involved with the original grant and we have identified specialists needed to support the new IT applications. James Kelly started as the post-doctoral research assistant on the original project and proved invaluable to the project as his experience grew, working closely with the original project manager, Dr Caroline Bowden. Dr Bowden is retiring but is intent on continuing her association with the project in an advisory role. Both Dr Jan Broadway and Dr Katharine Keats-Rohan have indicated their enthusiasm and support for the new proposal. Jan Broadway has created the existing successful database (http://www.history.qmul.ac.uk/wwtn/database.html) and is eager to take it further. Computer technicians at the Institute of Historical Research will add expertise where required. Katharine Keats-Rohan, building on her fine collection of family tress, will contribute the section devoted to analysis of the social class of the supporting family networks. Members of the Geography department at Queen Mary have undertaken to provide GIS mapping support.\nThe proposed partnership with the Historical Association will secure delivery of a wider target audience making the results as accessible as possible beyond the academic world to include family historians. This will allow us to get more feedback about the possible uses of the database and website.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K000705/1","grantId":"AH/K000705/1","fundValue":"95485","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings have mainly been used by academics (historians and literary scholars) and family historians who have found their way to the family trees created by Katharine Keats-Rohan.

All such work allows historians to build ideas about the survival of Catholicism in a period when it was illegal to practice the faith openly. It also demonstrates the significance of Catholic families which has not formerly been fully recognised by mainstream historians. The project thus has much wider impact on historical studies of early modern Britain than originally anticipated. The methodology can be applied to other religious groups: it would be worthwhile developing the existing database to incorporate more data relating to material culture in the convents such as creation of manuscripts, translation activities. It suggests that more work on patronage and support networks would be worthwhile. We will shortly appear on the portal &amp;amp;quot;Connected Histories&amp;amp;quot; which I believe will generate other ideas about the ways the research can be used as the basis of new studies.
