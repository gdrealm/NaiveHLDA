{"id":"31FFA4BC-63A0-48B8-BF43-C94361528357","title":"Constructing the green economy: integrating sustainability for governance?","abstractText":"<p>Building the green economy is a critical challenge to governing for sustainability. Integrating environmental concerns into economic policy has assumed greater urgency due to the need for alternative development models to counter current global recession and also growing pressures from climate change and overconsumption.</p>\n\n<p>While still largely just a normative ideal, the green economy concept is nonetheless beginning to emerge more forcefully in political discourses. However, some environmentalists remain cautious since this notion seemingly downplays existing political commitments to long term sustainability while promoting an underlying techno-centric economic agenda. Whether countries can transition towards viable green economies and therefore ensure long-term sustainability remain fundamental points of discussion.</p>\n\n<p>These issues will be addressed in the ESRC sponsored seminar series, which is based around three central themes of the green economy, namely green budgeting, green jobs and green equity. By drawing on the comparative national experience of multiple stakeholders, both academic and non-academic, the research will aim to identify both constraints and facilitators to the green economy transition and evaluate the sustainability of approaches adopted. Findings will be employed to develop normative recommendations for policy-makers on promoting greater integration of the environment into national economic objectives.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021504/1","grantId":"ES/J021504/1","fundValue":"14698","fundStart":"2013-03-04","fundEnd":"2013-10-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Benson","coPersons":["Jenny May Fairbrass","Duncan John Russel","Camilla  Adelle","Tim  O'Riordan"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
