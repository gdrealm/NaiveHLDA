With more mesh points the flow is moreturbulent, indicated by large values of the Reynolds number.Currently the largest such simulation is the new 4096 cubedsimulation in Japan. One of the next largest is a 2048 cubeddata set created at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, USA.This data set is being brought to the UK on loaned USB disk drives.Once it is here we want to use it for identifying those structuremost prone to producing acoustic noise and we want to make itavailable to the wider UK and and European turbulence communities,but especially those trying to understand fundamental mathematicalquestions about turbulence and those developing new turbulence models.Warwick will soon have from SRIF-2 funds a computing and visualization centre capable of handling this class of data set. Funding forpost-graduate students and a research associateto assist everyone in accessing this data will come fromseparate UK applications in collaboration with users fromother UK universities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D059194/1","grantId":"EP/D059194/1","fundValue":"14291","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert McDougall Kerr","coPersons":["Peter William Carpenter"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
