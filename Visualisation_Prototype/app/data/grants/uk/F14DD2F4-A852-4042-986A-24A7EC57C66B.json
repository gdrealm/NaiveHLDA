The network comprises MPAs of international, European and national importance, including new marine conservation zones established under the MCCA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The project aims to capture the key social and ecological dimensions of marine conservation law at this turning point by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>critically assessing the role played by marine conservation law in making the protected seascape resilient</li>\n\n <li>looking at the impacts of marine conservation law on the identities and roles of sea users and other stakeholders. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is hoped that the project will not only contribute to academic literature in this area but will also make meaningful policy recommendations. Methodologically, desk-based analysis of marine conservation law complements fieldwork in three case study areas in England to compare different realities. In each case study area, participant observation and semi-structured interviews will be conducted with sea users (fishermen, renewable sector and recreational groups), conservation bodies and regulators.</p>\n\n<p>The strategies for disseminating research findings include peer-reviewed publications and academic conferences, a website with reports written in a non-technical language and stakeholder workshops.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001043/1","grantId":"ES/K001043/1","fundValue":"165697","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Margherita  Pieraccini","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
