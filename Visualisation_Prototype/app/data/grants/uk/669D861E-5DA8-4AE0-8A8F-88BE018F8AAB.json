{"id":"669D861E-5DA8-4AE0-8A8F-88BE018F8AAB","title":"FELSSO: Finite Elements with Laser Scanning for mechanical analysis of Sculptural Objects","abstractText":"In museum collections, valuable sculptures risk being damaged whenever they are handled or moved. This research aims to investigate the novel application of finite element methods - used in engineering to calculate the strength of structures such as buildings and aircraft - to marble sculptures, in order to determine what damage they may sustain during transit or if they are accidentally dropped. The research requires generation of detailed computer models of the sculptures being investigated, for which we will use precision 3D laser-scanning, a technique that is rapidly finding application in fields as diverse as medicine and fashion design.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119171/1","grantId":"119171/1","fundValue":"51446","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Angela  Geary","coPersons":["John P Harrison","Derek  Pullen"],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
