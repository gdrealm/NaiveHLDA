The latter is described by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GR) and the former by Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) such as the Standard Model. Einstein's theory is conceptually simple, but is classical and breaksdown when the force of gravity is strong, as it is at very small scales, whereas QFTs are effective theories which ignore the gravitational interactions and which cannot be trusted at very high energies. During the last three decades, String Theory has emerged as a conceptually rich theoretical framework reconciling both GR and QFT. In particular, it is a theory of quantum gravity and my research programme is firmly focused on a wide range of quantum gravitational aspects of String Theory.String theory challenges the geometrical notions of spacetime on which GR is predicated. At very small( stringy ) scales the nature of spacetime is believed to be fundamentally different from GR---its continuous structures thought to be replaced by discrete, algebraic structures. Black holes are ideal candidates to study this transition. They are thermodynamical objects allowing a classical description in terms of Einstein's equations. Just as a gas allows a thermodynamical description in terms of temperature, pressure and volume, but it also has a description in terms of statistical properties of its constituent molecules, I look for the atoms of spacetime responsible for the entropy of the black holes. I plan to extend our current understanding on supersymmetric black holes, to less supersymmetric systems, and eventually to non-supersymmetric, and thus more realistic, ones. Any progress in the latter direction would be of extraordinary importance in our field.The expansion of the universe is incontrovertible. Since its creation after the Big Bang, the universe has been in permanent evolution. One may wonder whether a physical test of string theory will come from the realm of cosmology. I propose to study both theoretical and experimental aspects of this expectation. At a formal level, I want to develop the poorly understood string theory tools to deal with these physical situations in order to be able to answer questions such as Does string theory resolve Big-Bang-type singularities? ---a natural question in view of the fact that string theory is known to resolve other types ofsingularities. I also want to explore whether our ideas on black holes can help us understand the potential thermodynamical nature of the universe accessible to a classical observer. At an experimental level, I want to derive observable cosmological consequences of string theory in an effort to falsify it or at least to constraint the landscape of possible vacua explaining the universe we live in.The main beneficiaries from my work would be the members of the scientific community working on related topics to the ones developed in this proposal : cosmology &amp; astrophysics, QFT, GR, stringtheory, statistical mechanics, information theory and mathematical physics. Any human being interested in knowing about the structure of the world in which we live, both from the measurable point of view, but also from a much more conceptual point of view, would find my work of interest.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G007985/1","grantId":"EP/G007985/1","fundValue":"319562","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  My findings have been used academically.

This is analogous to identifying the &quot;molecules&quot; of a gas in a room for these gravitational objects. Furthermore, I showed that the quantum dynamics of these &quot;molecules&quot; is governed by a very specific set of quantum field theories : two dimensional chiral conformal field theories (CFTs). I showed these arise as infinite momentum limits of standard non-chiral CFTs used in statistical mechanics and condensed matter. I have made these discussions very precise when these black holes are small.In the context of cosmology, I developed a computer algorithm to identify the subset of spaces where to compactify string theory to connect it to the real world. The main constraint used so far is to make sure such space allows a vacuum compatible with what we see without going beyond the regime of validity of the methods being used. These results have triggered a better analytical description of the mathematical properties these spaces require.In the context of holography, I have explored the use of the famous Anti deSitter-CFT correspondence conjectured in string theory to describe strongly coupled real laboratory systems such as Luttinger liquids, including their interactions with fermions. I have definite statements regarding the stability of these systems and their phase space structure as a function of the different physical parameters. Furthermore, I have proposed some preliminary extension of these holographic ideas to flat space, by identifying what the relevant symmetries are and what kind of quantum mechanical theories realise them. My findings can be directly used by the theoretical community I belong to. There are many scientific papers that build on my results, as one can check by reading the references that have cited my work. In particular, my work on extremal black holes and its connection to chiral CFTs was internationally appreciated and my recent work in flat holography opens new venues to attack this difficult conceptual problem.
