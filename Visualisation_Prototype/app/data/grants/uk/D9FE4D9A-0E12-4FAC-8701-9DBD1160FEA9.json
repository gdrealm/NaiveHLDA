Our (to our knowledge, novel) findings on the impact of the higher rate of income tax on the probability of retirement saving have already been fairly widely disseminated.\n\nSecond, we would like to bring together the econometric and non-experimental evidence to bear on the wider questions posed by the project: the extent to which individuals understand, and respond to, complex (e.g. non-linear) tax structures; the extent to which people's behaviour is governed by inertia or approximation; and the extent to which individuals behave differently (in 'elasticity' terms) in relation to 'large' and 'small' changes in the tax structure which they face.

One methodology used household data sets and econometric methods, the second methodology used an experimental, laboratory-based, setting. The results of the research have been issued in the form of two discussion papers - one based on each methodology - and disseminated through a number of presentations to academic conferences (e.g. the Royal Economic Society Annual Conference, and the Harvard University postgraduate workshop), at 'think-tanks' and similar organisations (e.g. the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Institute of Government), and to government-sponsored events organised by HM Revenue &amp; Customs and HM Treasury. \n\n\n\nA summary of the project's findings may best be conveyed by describing the project's two papers:\n\n\n\nIn IFS working paper W12/05, Crawford, Disney and Emmerson test the hypothesis that the level of take-up of private pensions increases at the higher rate threshold for income tax, since tax relief on own income for pension contributions is given at the marginal tax rate and should be more attractive to those with higher incomes. Because, in general, richer people save more, the project tests for in particular, whether there is a discontinuity in take-up at the higher rate threshold, either because marginal incentives increase at that point or because, more generally, becoming a higher rate taxpayer has an effect on the individual's perception of the need for tax planning. The paper finds evidence of a weak change in behaviour - an increase in contributions to a retirement pension by the individual at the higher threshold, but also weak evidence of a positive response by the partner. The latter is counterintuitive in a household model of optimal tax planning but consistent with the hypothesis that hitting a higher tax threshold has a 'signalling effect' to both members of the household that they should engage in measures to reduce tax liability. However, after submitting this paper to a journal, in the light of referee's comments, we have decided that an the econometric methods used in this paper (regression discontinuity) may not be the appropriate method to obtain quantifiable outcomes, and that this requires further thought. Marginal tax rate structures affecting households should have an effect on saving incentives, but these prove quite hard to tease out of the data.\n\n\n\nThe companion paper, published by our collaborator Johannes Abeler (University of Oxford) with colleague Simon J?ger, uses a real-effort laboratory setting to examine the issue of tax complexity and non-linear tax structures. Subjects decide on how much effort to exert in two decision-making settings where they receive a piece rate and face a number of 'taxes'. In one treatment, the tax regime is simple; in the second the tax regime is highly complex. However the pay-off maximising effort level and the incentives around the treatment are identical. When new tax treatments are introduced into the experiment, require effort adjustments, subjects respond to the new optimum in the simple treatment but often re-choose their previous effort level in the complex case, thereby accentuating the effects of the reform. This result confirms several other studies (including, inter alia, Disney, Emmerson and Wakefield Economica 2009) that responses to tax reforms are highly dependent on the nature and complexity of the tax structure being implemented. The main users of such research would be HMRC and HMT with a view to designing evaluations studies of tax reforms. These results will help in the design of tax policy and also in the evaluation of tax policy. Specifically, the research reinforces some well-established arguments to the effect that less complex tax systems are more likely to lead to behavioural responses by households than more complex ones. Second, by adopting both econometric and laboratory-based methods to evaluate tax structures, the project will assist in providing methods for tax evaluation that could be utilised by, for example, HMRC and HMT when evaluating specific tax programmes.
