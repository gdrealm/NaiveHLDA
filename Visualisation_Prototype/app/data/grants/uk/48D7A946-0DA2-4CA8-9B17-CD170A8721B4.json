Currently, there is no information on the effect of cooling on outcome beyond 18 months of age. We intend to assess at 6-7 years of age the children that partcipated in the TOBY trial of whole body cooling following perinatal asphyxia and compare between the children that had received the cooling treatment soon after birth and those that were not treated with cooling, the number that survived with an intelligence quotient (IQ) greater than 70, the presence and severity of disabilities, the parent and teacher reports on behaviour, performance at school and the results of brain scans. If this study confirms that treatment with cooling is safe and effective it will be adopted into clinical practice in the NHS since it is relatively simple and inexpensive to carry out. If it were shown not to be effective or to be harmful in the longer term, indiscriminate use of this treatment may need to be discouraged.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801320","grantId":"G0801320","fundValue":"965951","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Denis V Azzopardi","coPersons":["Neil  Marlow","Edmund  Juszczak","Marianne  Thoresen","Andrew  Whitelaw","Malcolm Irvin Levene","Henry  Halliday","Peter  Brocklehurst","David John Edwards"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
