{"id":"2F9CAA53-AADE-46C0-862F-09672E88DC96","title":"Research into planetary formation at Bristol","abstractText":"The work will address two key aspects of planetary science in two separate projects.\n\nThe first project is an investigation of how the Moon formed. The best current idea is that the Moon was created by a giant impact between a massive protoplanet and the young Earth. The problem is that this leads to predictions for the chemical makeup of the Moon that differ from what we measure. Alternative impact scenarios exist, and the key to choosing between them is good measurements of the mix of elements (and different isotopes of those elements) on the Moon. This project will make a far more precise set of measurements of moon rocks than has been possible in the past, with the expectation of being able to choose one model over another.\n\nThe second project involves using new data from the Cassini spacecraft to investigate the atmosphere of Saturn's giant moon, Titan. The project will determine how Titan's climate system operates\nand how the atmosphere redistributes solar energy over two of Titan's 7.5 Earth-year long seasons. Titan is one of only four terrestrial planets with atmospheres in our Solar System and provides unique insight into how planetary atmospheres operate under extreme conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M007715/1","grantId":"ST/M007715/1","fundValue":"737824","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2019-02-28","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy  Elliott","coPersons":["Ian  Parkinson","Nicholas Arran Teanby","Michael  Walter","Christopher David Coath"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
