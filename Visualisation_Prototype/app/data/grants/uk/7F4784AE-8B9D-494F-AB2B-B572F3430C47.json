How do researchers and practitioners in literature, education and psychology currently express the value of poetry in their separate spheres? How can we best combine those insights into a rigorous interdisciplinary approach that will more effectively measure and evaluate the value of engaging with poetry?\n\nA pilot forum of literary and psychology researchers and practitioners at the Shakespeare Institute in October 2011 suggested that poetry could: \n-- bring a sense of identity and comfort \n-- connect people to one another\n-- enhance emotional literacy\n-- fulfill a civic function and bring together communities\n\nTo test these impressions, our project will unite a larger team of researchers and practitioners from literature, education and psychology in a series of interdisciplinary seminars to evaluate collectively the strengths of their respective disciplinary approaches, and to develop new collaborative research methods to measure and articulate the value of engaging with poetry. \n\nSeminars will facilitate productive exchange between participants with expertise in:\n1) The history of educational uses of poetry, including how poetry accrued ethical values in eighteenth and nineteenth-century anthologies; and current emphasis on cognitive skills\n2) Practice-based insights into the affective value of poetry in therapeutic settings, including evidence from work with people from displaced communities to head injury patients that poetry enhances emotional literacy, and can help individuals to process emotional and psychological trauma, often drawing on poems remembered from childhood\n3) Scientific evidence from cognitive and developmental psychology, including the role of poetry in autobiographical memory formation, and of rote-learning in promoting neuronal plasticity in the ageing brain \n4) Discourses of cultural value as they pertain to poetry, and the institutional challenges of measuring and extrapolating from individuals' 'experiences' of culture \n\nTo promote genuine reflection and collaboration, participants will address the following questions:\n-- What research exists across our disciplines about the value of engaging with poetry?\n-- What constitutes 'evidence' in our respective fields? \n-- What is the assumed value of poetry in our fields, and how can we test that assumption? How is 'value' defined?\n-- Which of our approaches, from e.g. subjective well-being analysis to reader response, comes closest to being able to measure, evaluate and articulate people's actual experiences of engaging with poetry? Can existing research techniques transcend individual experiences without simply aggregating them? \n-- On what forms of measurement do we currently rely, quantitative or qualitative? How could these be combined?\n-- Does our disciplinary approach tend towards understanding the affective, cognitive or aesthetic role of poetry? How could we better understand these from an interdisciplinary perspective?\n-- How can we optimise the strengths of our approaches to pilot a new, truly interdisciplinary valuation of the benefits of engaging with poetry?\n\nIn the second half of the project, the team will test their emerging collaborative research techniques and methodologies at two practical workshops. Working with three different age groups (primary school pupils, university students, older people), the workshops will also use performance practice, in combination with other research techniques, to explore, in particular, the experience of memorising poetry as a mode of engagement. The second workshop will be cross-generational, enabling the project team to draw comparisons between older and younger people's experiences of poetry, and to facilitate research that goes beyond stated benefits to the individual and explores the possibilities of community learning.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L006324/1","grantId":"AH/L006324/1","fundValue":"30101","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The chief impact of the research findings lies in the potential enhancements identified for the delivery of poetry in all stages of lifelong learning, and a resulting increase in the intellectual, emotional, physical and creative benefits of engaging with poetry.\n\nThe project was completed in 2014, but some of these findings have already been put into practice. For example, a subsequent practical workshop at the Guildford School of Acting explored the benefit of incorporating memorisation, movement, and a combination of intellectual and emotional engagement with poetry, into formal actor training, thus enhancing the creative output of a new generation of actors. Further work by teachers to encourage a more effective balance of intellectual and emotional engagement with poetry in schools, universities and in lifelong learning is planned, and will be reported here.

In the study of poetry, such embodiment enables learners not only to engage meaningfully with the voices of others, but also to put them in their own voice, or re-embody them. Learning poetry by heart should not necessarily be an end in itself (as in the rote learning of 'great' literature), but could rather be a pre-condition to a deeper engagement with poetry, as memorisation is in acting. \n\nOur research also points to the importance of teaching poetry in such a way that, by engaging students' emotions, deepens and nuances their intellectual engagement, and opens up the complexity of a poem. \n\nEnhancements in the teaching or delivery of poetry could lead to an increase in the potential value of an encounter with poetry as described elsewhere in our project, in terms of enhancing people's ability to engage with its indeterminacy, and giving people a resource to build into their self-identity.
