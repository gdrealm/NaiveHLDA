Yet it is not necessarily straightforward to trace the direct link between the specific actions of the public services and their impact on quality of life. </p> \n<p>In England, the Audit Commission has drawn up a series of ten themes of quality of life indicators, in areas such as housing, community safety, education and health. Of course, the outcomes of public service organisations are closely interlinked â€“ it is not only increased health care provision, but also better housing, sanitation, income, and education which all have an impact on the health of individuals in a community.</p> \n<p>The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of the ways in which public service organisations influence indicators of quality of life at a local level, and to make quantitative estimates of that contribution. </p> \n<p>The study will explore these issues by generating a comprehensive dataset based on quality of life indicators, various measures of deprivation and some additional performance indicators of key public sector services.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D001463/1","grantId":"ES/D001463/1","fundValue":"121820","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rowena  Jacobs","coPersons":["Peter Charles Smith","Maria  Goddard"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
