Design decisions are based on the nominal values of power, and performance decisions are based on the assumption that all the transistors are alike across dies and wafers. However, in reality, when the transistors are quite small, the transistor parameters vary from die to die or even in the same die. In other words, each transistor in a die or wafer is different. The transistor parameter variations may be due to several factors, including changes in dielectric thickness, substrate, polysilicon, and implant impurity levels; surface charge; and lithographic process. Thus, the design decisions based on the nominal models may not be correct because the models are either overestimations or underestimations of actual values; hence, the resultant circuits may not be optimal. Accurate modelling and estimation of all the forms of power and performance accounting process variation, including all leakage components, are crucial for making correct decisions on design for manufacturing. Unfortunately, no comprehensive model or tools exist for accurate estimation during digital system design when the target technology is nanoscale CMOS. Some forms of the power dissipation, such as due to gate-oxide/junction tunneling, have not received much attention. Process-variation-aware modelling of any of the (leakage) current components or delay is significantly challenging when treated at system level. Moreover, no tool exists that can provide power-performance design space exploration when a system is a behavioural hardware description language (HDL). The research proposed in this project intends to develop process variation aware architectural power-delay statistical models and estimator that can be used for fast and accurate estimation of power-performance values of nanoscale-CMOS design alternatives of digital systems expressed as a behavioural HDL.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G032904/1","grantId":"EP/G032904/1","fundValue":"281402","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dhiraj  Pradhan","coPersons":["Peter  Wilson"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
