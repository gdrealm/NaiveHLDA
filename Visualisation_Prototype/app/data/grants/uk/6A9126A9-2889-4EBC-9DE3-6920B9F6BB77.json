{"id":"6A9126A9-2889-4EBC-9DE3-6920B9F6BB77","title":"A interview-based study of how contemporary artists address ethically sensitive issues concerning animal life","abstractText":"For audiences that are unfamiliar with debates about about the nature of modern and contemporary art, the controversial form of much recent art addressing questions of animal life is often seen as deliberately shocking how artists' ethically irresponsible. This project calls into question that perception by demonstrating how artist's ethical engagement with non-human life and with human-animal relationships is intimately tied to the specific form of their creative practise. In doing so, it seeks to present both an argument for the cultural importance of contemporary art, and a distinctive account of creativity to which ethical responsibility is integral.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112846/1","grantId":"112846/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-23","fundEnd":"2006-05-22","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  Baker","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
