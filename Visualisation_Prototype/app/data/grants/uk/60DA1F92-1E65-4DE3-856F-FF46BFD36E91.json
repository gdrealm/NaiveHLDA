{"id":"60DA1F92-1E65-4DE3-856F-FF46BFD36E91","title":"All-fibre universal optical waveform and attosecond-pulse synthesiser","abstractText":"The ability to control and synthesise optical waveforms has been a longstanding goal in science and technology. Very recent developments in quantum optics, photonic bandgap fibres and fibre lasers have created a new and favourable conjuncture to successfully undertake optical waveform synthesis. In this project, we propose the first attempt to develop a compact and self-contained system that would synthesise arbitrary optical intensity waveforms, including attosecond pulses, with approaching the same degree of control and flexibility as we have in synthesising electronic waves. The advent of such a synthesiser would create new and exciting opportunities in a variety of photonics-related fields, with the potential of making an impact in photonic technology as lasting as that of the frequency synthesiser in electronics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E039162/1","grantId":"EP/E039162/1","fundValue":"714877","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Abdel Fetah Benabid","coPersons":["David  Bird","Tim  Birks"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
