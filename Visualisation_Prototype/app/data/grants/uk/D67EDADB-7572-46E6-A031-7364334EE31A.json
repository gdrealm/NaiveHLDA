{"id":"D67EDADB-7572-46E6-A031-7364334EE31A","title":"An Intellectual Biography of Jose Enrique Rodo (Montevideo 1871- Palermo, Sicily 1917)","abstractText":"Rod&oacute;'s place in the intellectual history of Latin America is universally recognised. A pioneering literary critic, essayist on cultural identity, and the foremost critic of the cultural impact of the United States (especially in 'Ariel' [1900]), his work stands for conciliation and against dogma and radicalism. He has received much praise and much condemnation, with critics assuming a range of sociological, economic, religious and ideological perspectives. The project will consider these assessments whilst taking careful account of Rod&oacute;'s personal environment and intellectual evolution, accessible to a good extent via a full and as yet incompletely studied Archive of his papers held at the Uruguayan National Library.\\n \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E004989/1","grantId":"AH/E004989/1","fundValue":"31314","fundStart":"2007-09-24","fundEnd":"2008-01-23","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Gustavo  San Roman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
