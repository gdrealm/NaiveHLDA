Whether oxygen promotes life or threatens disease is dependent on its electrons. Safe oxygen has paired electrons. However, during under- or over-oxygenation, electrons may become unpaired, creating unstable molecules known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive generation of ROS, or oxidative stress, damages blood vessels leading to conditions such as heart disease, hypertension and pre-eclampsia. However, whether ROS and oxidative stress affects the blood vessels of the unborn child or unborn animal is unknown either in health or disease. This is of paramount importance because the unborn child and unborn animal is particularly susceptible to changes in oxygenation and, hence, the generation of ROS. Here, we propose that a number of effects of hypoxia on the cardiovascular system of the unborn child and unborn animal are secondary to the generation of ROS and oxidative stress. Adverse consequences of sustained under-oxygenation or chronic hypoxia in the unborn are intense constriction of blood vessels in its limbs, which promotes growth retardation and a strain on the developing heart. We will investigate whether increasing antioxidants in the fetus, with substances such as vitamin C, will reduce the effects of hypoxia on its blood vessels, protecting against the development of cardiovascular malfunction, even prior to birth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E002668/1","grantId":"BB/E002668/1","fundValue":"425002","fundStart":"2007-07-05","fundEnd":"2011-01-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dino A Giussani","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
