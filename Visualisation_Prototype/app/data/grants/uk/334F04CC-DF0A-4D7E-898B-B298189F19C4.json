Drawing upon an international range of historic penal sites, this project will integrate documentary, architectural, and archaeological research to consider the strategic mobilization of power within places of incarceration. &quot;Power&quot; will be considered a perpetual social dynamic, inducing all occupants into shifting and mutual bonds of obligation, dependency, resistance, betrayal, cooperation and desire. By contrasting material examples of institutional rejection (vandalism, black market trade, and graffiti) with those of institutional engagement (including uniforms, rations and disciplinary architecture), this project will create an archaeology of incarceration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112841/1","grantId":"112841/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Eleanor  Casella","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
