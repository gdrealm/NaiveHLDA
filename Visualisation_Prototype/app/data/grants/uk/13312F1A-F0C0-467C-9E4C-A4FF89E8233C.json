The mobile\ntelephone is perhaps the most obvious example of this, as it allows someone to be constantly connected to a range of\nelectronic resources. This trend is continuing, and more and more everyday objects are becoming electronically enabled.\nThe challenge is to be able to add electronic functionality to objects with minimal impact upon cost, and this is being\naddressed by the field known as 'large-area electronics' which looks at how electronic devices can be fabricated on a\ndiversity of surfaces (such as glass or plastics) over large areas. Although the large-area electronics industry has\nhistorically been dominated by displays, it is now diversifying to other areas including printed logic, and it is this that will\nallow electronic functionality to be added to everyday objects [Nathan, A., et al., Proc. IEEE, 100, 1486 (2012)].\nThe large-area electronic display industry has found it absolutely essential to be able to perform in-line testing (and\nsubsequent repair) of products for economic production [D. Hendricks, 'Inspection and test of flat panel displays', Proc.\nSPIE, 2174, 107-115 (1994)]. This is a consequence of the very large areas over which display manufacture takes place,\nand the statistical likelihood of a significant defect being present per unit area. The high value of the display backplane\nmeans that testing and repair is economically essential.\nA similar approach will be necessary in the next generation of large-area printed logic electronics. Although the use of low\ncost materials and processes in the manufacture of printed logic means that the cost of an individual system for integration\ninto labels, novelty products, toys and games and similar applications is orders of magnitude lower than the display, there\nis still an economic driver for testing, assuming that the cost of the test can be made to be sufficiently low. However,\nwhereas the testing of a display can be achieved economically using established techniques that employ probe cards and\nmultiple communication channels, this will not be true for printed logic where production speeds could be in excess of 1\nmillion circuits per hour. Therefore, a step-change is required to be able to perform economical testing at such high rates,\nand this is the focus of the research in this project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505201/1","grantId":"EP/L505201/1","fundValue":"194642","fundStart":"2013-10-02","fundEnd":"2015-04-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Research is ongoing and has not been taken up yet.
