Since 2010, the Comprehensive Spending Review, tax and welfare reform, and rising living costs have had a much wider impact - on the public sector, and the voluntary and community sector with the 'passporting' of cuts evident in both cities (see Jones et al below). The impact of the crisis and austerity on households has also been more widespread, with some households across all ACORN types indicating changes in their behaviour and everyday lives. However, it is households who are just &quot;getting by&quot;, or &quot;struggling&quot;, and with dependants, who are now being impacted most heavily. Debt accumulation, diminishing savings, and an inability for families to plan for the future were common as households struggled to cope with redundancies, pay freezes, lower wages and changing benefits, in contrast to &quot;thriving&quot; households who had felt little impact, were much more likely to have significant financial resilience, and be established home-owners. The importance of household resources and assets, and informal networks for resilience is revealed. Increasingly, it is lower-middle and low income households, many of whom have already adopted short-term and high-risk coping strategies, who are facing increasing and long-term economic hardship, and a more precarious short-term futures from a combination of stagnating wages, government cuts to the benefit and tax credit system and increasing living costs in the context of eroded household resources and resilience. \n\n\n\nThe marked differences in terms of global connectivity, policy histories, socio-economic structures and levels of deprivation between the two city regions of Bristol and Liverpool are being further exacerbated as austerity measures and welfare reform have begun to impact. Accompanying the growing division between the cities, is the further concentration and intensification of deprivation and increasing inequality between neighbourhoods and households within cities, representing a reversal of the gains made in previous decades. The research highlights policy concerns regarding the lack of a coherent national economic development strategy for rebalancing the economy for more sustainable growth, as well as new mechanisms for urban governance and economic development activity which are innovative, but currently fragmented, spatially and sectorally, and underfunded. In addition, the lack of balance between competitiveness and cohesion in local development activities seems likely to contribute to the further erosion of resources and resilience of particular cities and households given the starkly uneven impacts of the economic downturn. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n. The major impact of this research is to highlight the multidimensional dynamics and transmission mechanisms of austerity, the contingent ways in which these coalesce in and impact upon cities and households, and appropriate policy responses for sustainable communities and cities.
