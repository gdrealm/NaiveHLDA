Governments have been stockpiling huge amounts of the two antivirals Relenza and Tamiflu, both of which are $1 billion drugs. The influenza virus has the capacity to mutate or to generate completely new viruses, in terms of their assault on our immune system, through mixing of its genetic segments. Sadly, circulating H1N1 viruses have already developed resistance to Tamiflu. Vaccines are generally effective, but take a long time to generate and recent vaccines for pandemic swine H1N1 have had reported side effects. We are taking the novel approach of blocking the attachment sites in the respiratory tract that the influenza virus requires for infection. We have developed proteins that bind tightly to these receptors (sugar molecules called sialic acids), and they halt a lethal infection of influenza in a mouse model. Our approach has the potential to be a drug against any current and future strain of influenza and potentially parainfluenza that uses the same receptors, and could be a first line of defence in a pandemic or a prophylactic for high-risk patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902201","grantId":"G0902201","fundValue":"636290","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Garry  Taylor","coPersons":["Anthony  Nash","Bernadette Mary Dutia","Helen  CONNARIS"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
