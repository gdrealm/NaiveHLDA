{"id":"67C7EDD6-1C81-4828-BACD-1A510232914B","title":"A Public Voice - Access, Digital Story and Interactive Narrative","abstractText":"Digital storytelling is described for the public by the BBC on their dedicated web-site (www.bbc.co.uk/wales/capturewales) in the following way;\\n\\n'Digital Stories are 'mini-movies' created and edited by people like you / using cameras, computers, scanners and their own photo-albums. Everyone has a story to tell and new technology means that anyone can create a story that can be shown on a web site like the one you see here. The idea is to show the richness of life in Wales through stories made by the people of Wales. It's you who decide what these stories are.'\\n\\nDigital stortytelling is a new creative form. It amalgamates new technology, filmmaking, photography, music, story and social purpose. These activities cut across boundaries in the arts, democratising the process of media making and establishing an anti-heroic position for the artist/storyteller. The concept that is being developed is one of an interactive and conversational media that represents digital stories as an extension of the quotidian storytelling of everyday life.\\n\\nThis project will develop new understandings of how digital storytelling has developed to this point and ways it could progress in future. The BBC Capture Wales project, and the community applications which have grown from it, will provide a focus for the work.\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F006764/1","grantId":"AH/F006764/1","fundValue":"74153","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Hamish  Fyfe","coPersons":["Michael  Wilson"],"organisation":"University of Glamorgan","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
