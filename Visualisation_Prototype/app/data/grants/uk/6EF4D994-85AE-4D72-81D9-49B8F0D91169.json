Here, we propose to transform the predictive capabilities of a leading first principles code, CP2K, by adding new functionality that will dramatically enhance its ability to predict phase equilibria and extricate detailed molecular insights underlying chemical reactions. The carefully assembled, international team of chemists, chemical engineers and computer scientists has unrivalled experience in developing, optimizing and applying the CP2K code and a proven record of implementing and exploiting novel simulation approaches. Successful implementation will be transformative for understanding and predicting free energy landscapes and product yields for reactive multi-phase systems and for identifying optimal reaction conditions and separation processes for sustainable chemistry. \n\nThe call to address grand challenges in the chemical sciences has been identified by EPSRC and NSF as a key, strategic initiative of national importance. The work proposed here underpins all sectors of the chemistry field, and in particular the EPSRC prioritised theme of Catalysis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K039296/1","grantId":"EP/K039296/1","fundValue":"390310","fundStart":"2013-09-26","fundEnd":"2016-09-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ben  Slater","coPersons":["Iain  Bethune","Michiel  Sprik"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
