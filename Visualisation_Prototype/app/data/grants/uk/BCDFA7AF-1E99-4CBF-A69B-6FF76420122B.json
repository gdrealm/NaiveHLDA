Properties which determine these highly uncertain impacts are linked at the most fundamental level to the chemical components which may reside in the particle. Both inorganic and organic material can transfer between the gas and particle phase. Inorganic material is restricted to a few well-understood compounds. However, organic material can comprise many thousands, as yet largely unidentified, compounds with a vast range of properties. Owing to the complexity and diversity of atmospheric aerosol components, quantification of the properties that determine their highly uncertain climatic and human health impacts requires the development and application of novel technological applications such as the informatic software proposed here. Firstly, we must be able to predict how ever many thousands of components can exist in particulate matter. Specifically, predicting the evolution of aerosol requires calculation of the distribution of all components between the gas and particle phases which in turn requires knowledge of all component vapour pressures and other thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, the physical properties of the aerosol determining their climatic impacts require detailed knowledge of fundamental properties of all components. The many thousands of individual aerosol components ensure that explicit manual calculation of these properties is laborious, time-consuming and often impossible. Thus, automation is necessary. Secondly, to identify key components and resolve their environmental impacts we must be able to replicate chemical characteristics measured in real/simulated atmospheres. A comprehensive experimental determination of individual organic components of atmospheric aerosols is not available, leading to indirect measurements on 'chemical signatures' of mixtures. Through automation of component property estimation, combined with a gas/aerosol transfer model, these 'chemical sigmatures' as determined by state-of-the-science atmospheric sampling instrumentation will be predicted. This will be achieved by calculating instrument response functions with the predicted abundance of all components. Again, the prediction (and combination) of instrument response functions for each individual component lends itself to automation due to the vast numbers involved. The informatics suite will be built using a flexible high-level portable programming language and an open source chemical informatics package that is designed to allow extraction of appropriate sub-molecular information relevant for each property estimation method.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H002588/1","grantId":"NE/H002588/1","fundValue":"181244","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  We have engaged with a broad range of researchers from across multiple disciplines.

In this project we developed new informatics software for predicting the properties of complex organic molecules and ensemble aerosol mixtures. The software has now been made available to the research community via an online portal. The tools developed have allowed us to evaluated our current predictive capability in this area and has identified the need for additional research programs including both laboratory and field studies. It has also served as a great example of how developments in other fields can be leveraged in order to meet objectives in an efficient and cost effective manner. The automated software tools we have developed can be used to predict the properties of any number of chemical components. Similarly, the algorithms now implemented in these automated tools have the potential to model complex systems within process engineering. We are already exploring funding mechanisms to take this forward. Developing the skillset within universities to perform the research for which this software is designed can take many years and much expense. The software developed has now been made available to the research community via an online portal. This ensures maximum outreach and provides the community with the tools to tackle this complex problem of understanding the role aerosol particles have on the environment. The tools developed are also now being fed into existing NERC funded programes to develop methods for better understanding the role aerosol particles have in the atmosphere.
