It is essential for proper vision because it lets in light and focuses it on the retina at the back of the eye. Thus, a sharp image is formed and we can see properly. The cornea is a special tissue because it is transparent, and in this respect it is unlike other related tissues in the body -- the tendons that link our bones and muscles or the sclera (the white of the eye), for example -- which are made of similar components. Scientists believe that the cornea is transparent because the protein called collagen that forms much of the cornea is mostly in the form of long, thin rope-like structures called fibrils. Moreover, these collagen fibrils are formed into a very well defined arrangement that lets light through. If this arrangement breaks down the cornea looses its transparency and becomes cloudy. As a result, vision is severely compromised. Interestingly, scientists suspect that molecules called proteoglycans in the cornea influence the collagen fibrils and force them to take up the special arrangement that allows corneal transparency. Previous investigations have studied the structural relationship between collagen and proteoglycans using the corneas of mice that have been genetically modified so that they don't possess certain types of proteoglycan. This allows the structure of different proteoglycan sub-types to be understood. But, up to now it has only been possible to study the collagen and proteoglycan structures in 2 dimensions by examining very thin sections of cornea on an electron microscope, so the understanding that we can get is limited. Now, however, we are able to use a new modification of electron microscopy to produce images of the collagen and proteoglycans that allows us to see their structures in 3 dimensions. This project will thus discover the links between collagen and proteoglycans in the cornea in a detail not seen previously, and will help us to understand how the structure and transparency of the cornea is maintained.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F022077/1","grantId":"BB/F022077/1","fundValue":"310010","fundStart":"2008-11-10","fundEnd":"2011-11-09","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Carlo  Knupp","coPersons":["Andrew James Quantock"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
