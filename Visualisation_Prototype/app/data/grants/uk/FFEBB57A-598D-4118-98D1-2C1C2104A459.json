{"id":"FFEBB57A-598D-4118-98D1-2C1C2104A459","title":"Quantum Coherence: Joint Proposal for Optimising UK Research Capacity and Capability","abstractText":"The defining character of quantum mechanics is coherence / the superposition of correlated states of many particles. Quantum correlated and entangled states lie at the heart of several major areas of physics, especially quantum optics, atomic physics and quantum condensed matter. The ability to control precisely a broad range of systems from ultracold atoms in optical lattices to internal states of molecules to semiconductor nanostructures has led to important breakthroughs in the understanding and potential applications of entanglement. Because the same principles underlie the rich but sometimes impenetrable physics of quantum matter, these advances open a window on challenging problems in materials. The fortunate fertility already evident in condensed matter materials suggests strongly that major benefits will accrue from exerting full quantum control of complex systems. Within this proposal we shall tackle this demanding new challenge. The underlying concepts and technologies of coherent control and manipulation in atomic, molecular and optical physics are now sufficiently established that it is possible to consider the synthesis of designer quantum states of atoms and molecules that can address a number of outstanding problems in condensed matter and optical physics. Furthermore, the ability to build large-scale quantum coherent systems represents such a new capability that we can anticipate new physics, as yet unimagined, as well as new technologies, to emerge. The method of approach will be to increase UK research capacity by the appointment of new faculty and the establishment of state of the art research laboratories and facilities, and the nurturing of collaborative research programs across several institutions. This will be complemented by implementing new training programs at the graduate and postdoctoral researcher level that will be broadly available to the UK community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E036112/1","grantId":"EP/E036112/1","fundValue":"1823360","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research activity in quantum coherence was increased by appointing a permanent faculty member in this area at Imperial College. Research infrastructure and equipment of work-class quality was installed, research assistants of international calibre were appointed.\n\nTraining in research in quantum coherence was undertaken through internal and collaborative programs, including summer schools and exchanges.

Specifically, we have guided, focussed and decelerated beams of LiH, CaF and YbF molecules.\n\nWe have shown that to successfully decelerate molecular beams it is important that the molecules are prepared in a single quantum state and that they remain in that quantum state throughout. This places constraints on the fields used for manipulation, particularly how quickly they can vary. We have demonstrated how to produce intense beams of cold, slow-moving molecules using cryogenically-cooled sources, and have characterized these sources. We have made the first steps to show that certain molecules can be cooled to very low temperatures using a laser cooling method with multiple wavelengths. We have learned how to precisely control quantum coherences in molecular systems, and have used this control to measure microwave transition frequencies in the CH molecule, and to measure the shape of the electron, both to unprecedented accuracy. The first measurement can be used to test the constancy of the fundamental constants, while the second tests the fundamental symmetries of nature. The science we do is for everyone. We do it to expand, clarify and refine our picture of nature, to enrich our understanding of the world. A gas of ultracold polar molecules can be used as a quantum simulator to help model and understand the poorly understood phenomena that arise in strongly-interacting quantum systems. These include high temperature superconductivity and exotic forms of magnetism. To exploit this requires strong collaboration between experts in atomic and molecular physics and Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
