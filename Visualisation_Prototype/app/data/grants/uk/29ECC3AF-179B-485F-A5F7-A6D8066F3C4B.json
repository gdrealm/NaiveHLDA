The loss of skeletal muscle function in the elderly and as a result of chronic disease is a major cause of falls and decreases quality of life and lifespan. Skeletal muscle also plays an essential function in metabolism. Loss of muscle metabolic function can cause and/or exacerbate a number of chronic diseases, including heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, cancer, depression, and osteoporosis. As a result, a lot of time and money is invested in studying skeletal muscle. Beyond the human investment, every year over 500,000 animals are used to study how the physiology and function of muscle adapts to disease, genes, exercise, and drugs. Therefore, creating an alternative method for the study of muscle physiology and function could not only reduce the number of animals used for this purpose but could improve the quality and length of human lives as well. We have recently engineered a model of a muscle that has the potential to achieve this. In order to further develop our model and test its usefulness as a replacement for animal studies, this proposal looks to: i) engineer muscle from immortal cells so that animal donors are no longer required; ii) create an interface between our engineered muscle and our experimental machines; iii) create new machines that would allow us to better mimic exercise and growth and that could be developed commercially so that others could do similar experiments at a reasonable cost; and iv) compare whether the response to simulated exercise in engineered muscles is similar to the response of an animal to exercise.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F002084/1","grantId":"BB/F002084/1","fundValue":"353648","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Keatch","coPersons":["Keith  Baar"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
