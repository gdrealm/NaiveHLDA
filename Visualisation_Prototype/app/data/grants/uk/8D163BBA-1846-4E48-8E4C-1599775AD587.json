Each year we have about 1000 vistors for Stargazing Live and about a 1000 for our public observing sessions on the first Friday of every winter month. There is such an appetite to look at the stars and my students suggested we devise a system similar to the Faulkes system where the public can use the telescope much more often. We sought advice from Andy Newsam who supported the students and we initially thought we would need to buy some software to set up the system. However the students set to work programming a whole new sytem which works. What we then needed was a good camera system so that the public can take high quality pictures. The RAS gave us half of the money so we need the other half to purchase the CCD. Many schools come up to observe and some ask about taking images for their GCSE astronomy coursework - we can make this accessible to them with the camera.\nWe think this is a new approach. It doesn't quite have the scale of the Faulkes Telescope Project but it might establish a precedent that other observatories could follow. The local astronomy society, South East Kent Astronomical Society is very keen to help promote this as a way to encourage people to start observing from the comfort of their own home. We will give the project wide publicity across Kent and note by hits on the website the take up more widely - http://obs-server.thelangton.org.uk/","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L001470/1","grantId":"ST/L001470/1","fundValue":"2300","fundStart":"2013-07-17","fundEnd":"2014-01-16","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Becky  Parker","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
