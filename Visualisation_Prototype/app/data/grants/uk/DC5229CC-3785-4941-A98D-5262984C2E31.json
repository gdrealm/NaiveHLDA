Over ten years, the LSST will visit each patch of sky many hundreds of times, building up a multi-colour movie that will drive new research projects across the whole of astronomy, from potentially hazardous asteroids to the furthest quasars, and the nature of the dark energy believed to pervade space.\n\nA consortium of over 170 astronomers from 29 institutions in the UK are currently seeking to join LSST and this grant is to support their initial engagement with the LSST Science Consortia and to undertake the technical discussions needed to complete the formal proposal for funding UK involvement in LSST.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L00660X/1","grantId":"ST/L00660X/1","fundValue":"10081","fundStart":"2014-02-28","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Graham Mann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
