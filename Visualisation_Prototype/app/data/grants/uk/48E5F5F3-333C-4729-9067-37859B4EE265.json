First a set of questions on a nationally representative survey will be posed, followed by interviews with lawyers, mediators and parties with experience of different styles of AFDR. Finally, recording and analysis of a selection of mediations, collaborative law processes and lawyer-client interviews will be undertaken. Findings from the three phases will be synthesised in order to arrive at an overall 'map' of family dispute resolution pathways.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I031812/1","grantId":"ES/I031812/1","fundValue":"444596","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have already had some impact with Policy Makers and with Practitioners and we have had the support of our Project Advisory Group who represent the range of Family Dispute Resolution practitioners as well as researchers at the Ministry of Justice.\nAspects of our findings have been used by the Government Task Force on Family Mediation which published its report in June 2014, in which some of our findings (reported in June 2014) were footnoted.\nIn addition the Cabinet Office's Innovation Unit contacted us in October 2014 in order to discuss our methods and findings on the party and practitioner experience in order to inform their own research into why people do or do not take up family mediation and what makes it likely to be successful or not.\nThe Ministry of Justice asked the PI, Anne Barlow to attend an OECD conference on Alternative Dispute Resolution in Paris on 10/11/14 in order to present the research findings on out of court family dispute resolution.\nFamily Dispute Resolution Practitioner Professional Associations (Family Mediators Association; Resolution) have invited us to present findings on DR best practice and matching processes to parties and cases at two annual conferences and have discussed how to spread best practice and be more alert to screening power imbalance and lack of emotional readiness with us. \nRelevant practitioner journals have asked to publish summaries of different aspects of our findings. Practitioners writing in such journals (e.g. Bull, The Review, September 2014; Stevenson, Family Law Journal, November 2014) have separately engaged with our findings, suggesting how the research should be taken notice of and used to improve best practice.\nThe relationship agency One Plus One has agreed to work with us to develop an online tool to assist parties and practitioners to assess emotional readiness before attempting mediation with the aim of improving mediation success rates.

On awareness, we found that there is recognition of these alternatives to court in the general population, though 45% of our National Omnibus sample had heard of none of them. Less than half (44%) had heard of mediation; this rose to over two thirds among the divorced/separated population. Solicitor negotiations was poorly-recognised as a means of avoiding court even by the divorced/separated, with less than half (48%) aware of it. Media/internet are key sources of information to the general public about AFDRs but for those divorcing/separating since 1996, solicitors were the major source for all AFDRs, including mediation.\nNationally, two thirds of those who had experienced the lawyer-led AFDRs were satisfied with process and outcome, compared with under half (41%) of those who had mediated their dispute. However, in our follow-up interviews with parties, almost three quarters were satisfied with their experience of the mediation process, although far fewer with the outcome. Those who were not satisfied had often felt pressured into mediation. Perceived quality of the practitioner was key to satisfaction in all AFDRs. Overall in our follow-up sample, Mediation was seen as improving communication in around 40% of cases, whereas under a quarter of Solicitor Negotiation participants felt they benefited in this way. Generally people felt well supported by having their own solicitor or collaborative lawyer, allowing them to 'know where they stood' on finances or in relation to children. In Mediation, good communication outcomes were highly correlated with successful resolution. Collaborative Law was very well liked (combining support with a non-partisan approach) but like solicitor negotiations, was criticised for cost.\nConcerning norms brought into the processes by parties, we found this was highly gendered and differed in relation to children and finances. In children matters, parties did not feel they were steered in a particular direction, in contrast to financial disputes.\nConsidering which AFDRs are most 'appropriate' for which cases and parties, we concluded that one size does not fit all. We recommend introducing a neutral triage system (conducted by practitioners knowledgeable about all AFDRS) open to directing people to the appropriate process. Some cases are unsuited to mediation (e.g. where violence/control or mental health issues exist or one party is not 'emotionally ready'). Suitability for AFDRs depends largely on the disposition of the parties, not the nature of the case. For collaborative law or mediation, there needs to be willingness to engage and communicate; relatively low conflict; an equal power dynamic and openness to compromise. The lawyer-led AFDRs are more appropriate where there are highly complex financial issues, power disparity. Only solicitor negotiations are appropriate where there are entrenched positions, control/mental health issues or a vengeance agenda. Mediation can help in high conflict children cases to improve communication and does well for financial disputes where there is a highly skilled mediator. \nWhilst we found many mediators were trained for child inclusive mediation, we identified few parties who had experienced it. We identified a lack of confidence by some practitioners and some parents around this process and we consider the voice of the child in AFDRs needs further attention. Having followed our Pathways to Impact plan to include representatives of the range AFDR processes, we actively engaged and consulted with the practitioner community throughout the project. The Law Society, National Family Mediation, Family Mediators Association and Resolution all contributed to aspects of the project and received our findings well.\nOur final conference was attended by an audience of 70 practitioners, policy makers and academics interested in out-of-court family dispute resolution, including David Norgrove who chaired the Government Task Force on Family Mediation (of which the PI was also an invited member), and some of our initial findings were included in the Task Force Report in June 2014.\nHaving been asked to give keynote addresses and other presentations by national mediation associations and collaborative law practitioners, we anticipate that our findings will shape and influence training of mediators and collaborative lawyers, in particular, and the professional associations have confirmed this is the case. \nWe are currently embarking on a joint venture with One Plus One who provide educational online relationship support tools to help parties and practitioners assess emotional readiness for mediation and screen out inappropriate cases.
