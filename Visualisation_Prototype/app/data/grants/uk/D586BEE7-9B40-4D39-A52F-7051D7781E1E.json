Influenza viruses can evolve rapidly by swapping genes amongst strains of viruses from different hosts. However, key aspects of the processes that govern this ?pick and mix? process are not understood. This grant aims at clarifying the molecular details of influenza evolution with the ultimate aim of being able to predict which combinations of viruses might be more dangerous.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700815","grantId":"G0700815","fundValue":"602035","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Digard","coPersons":["Laurence Stephen Tiley","Julia Rose  Gog"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
