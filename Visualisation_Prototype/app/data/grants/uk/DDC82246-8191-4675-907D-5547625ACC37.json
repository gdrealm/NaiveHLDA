Existing archival and new material is used for an in-depth longitudinal study of changing social attitudes since 1981. </p>\n\n<p>Contemporary British novelists will be interviewed regarding ageing as both a textual theme, and a personal and professional experience. Critical and analytical research will draw upon the various qualitative data produced to address issues of ageing and its cultural signification in terms of readership, authorship, social attitudes and agency, and public policy. The three major outcomes will include a series of public events, a policy report, and associated academic publications in the literary field using sociological and cultural contexts.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G036942/1","grantId":"ES/G036942/1","fundValue":"286964","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Tew","coPersons":["Nick  Hubble","Jago  Morrison"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
