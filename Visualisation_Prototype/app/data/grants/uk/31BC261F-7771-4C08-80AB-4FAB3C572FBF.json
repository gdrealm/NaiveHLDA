{"id":"31BC261F-7771-4C08-80AB-4FAB3C572FBF","title":"Achieving a successful pregnancy: Epigenetic regulation of fetal-maternal signaling","abstractText":"Pregnancy, which is experienced by over 700,000 women per year in the United Kingdom, is a dynamic, exquisitely coordinated process involving systemic and local changes in the mother to accommodate the metabolically demanding and immunogenic fetus. Disorders of human pregnancy, such as stillbirth, low birth weight, preterm birth and maternal diabetes may occur as a consequence of poor or inappropriate adaptation to pregnancy illustrating the importance of this highly regulated process, both for the health of the mother and for the well being of her children. \n\nMany of the endocrine and metabolic changes that occur in the mother during pregnancy can be directly attributed to signals originating from the placenta. We are investigating the role of an imprinted gene in regulating these signals from the placenta to the mother. Imprinted genes, which are expressed in mammals from only one parental allele, play an important role in regulating embryonic growth and placental support. \n\nIn this study, we will use a model system in which we have engineered changes in the expression of the imprinted gene, Phlda2, in the placenta. Changing the amount of Phlda2 alters the composition of the placenta such that there is either decreased or increased expression of placental hormones that signal to the mother. Consequently mothers carrying these pups will be exposed to either too little or too much of these hormones during pregnancy. It is well known that in human pregnancies, abnormal levels of these hormones in maternal serum are associated with low birth weight and, in some case, fetal loss. Indeed, we observe both low birth weight and some evidence fetal loss when our mothers receive too little of the placental signals. In this proposal, we will simply ask whether mothers carrying pups with elevated expression or loss of expression of Phlda2 show indicators of abnormal adaptation to pregnancy. \n\nWhat is remarkable about this study is that we will be able to show that an imprinted gene in the fetus can manipulate the mother's physiology during pregnancy. Additionally, we will provide data on the consequences of aberrant expression of Phlda2 on the health and well being of both the mother and her offspring.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J015156/1","grantId":"BB/J015156/1","fundValue":"380792","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This grant is still active. However, work that we are doing is of relevance to healthcare. We are studying the function of the placenta in relation to maternal health. We have shown that a dysfunctional placenta causes asymmetrical fetal growth restriction but also causes global problem with pregnancy. In addition to the standard routes of publication and meeting presentation, we have established several engagement projects with clinicians and health care workers. Funded by NISCHR Children and Young People's Research Network initiative, we set up the &amp;quot;Maternal mood disorders, childhood wellbeing and Placental gene expression&amp;quot; network which was funded for one year to bring together clinicians, healthcare workers and scientists to discuss how to translate the findings from our lab to be of benefit beyond academia. As a result, we then went on the develop a research program in collaboration with two clinicians - Professor Ian Jones chair of Action Postpartum Psychosis (APP), a network of UK women who have experienced postpartum psychosis and Richard Penketh, an obstetrician with a view to developing the translations relevance of our work Healthcare Cultural,Societal","person":"Rosalind M John","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" This grant is still ongoing. However, we have acheived the key aims as listed in our milestones and timelines for this stage of the grant. We have shown that elevated PHLDA2 causes asymmetrical growth restriction (AIM1), we have found other imprinted genes that behave in a similar way to PHLDA2 (Aim3) and we are on course to achieve AIM3 by the end of the grant which is to show that mother's carrying fetuses mutant for PHLDA2 have abnormal metabolisms. This work, while the investigation of a fundamental mechanism, has great relevance for humans as low birth weight is a major complication affecting 7.2% of live births every year in the UK which has adverse consequences for the child both in the short term and for their later life health. Our work highlights a mechanism underlying low birth weight and, moreover, indicates that mothers of low birth weight babies may be at risk of other pregnancy complications and that these co-occurences arise from defects in placental development. Our findings have led to a new direction for our research program and we have just had a grant application funded for further work. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
