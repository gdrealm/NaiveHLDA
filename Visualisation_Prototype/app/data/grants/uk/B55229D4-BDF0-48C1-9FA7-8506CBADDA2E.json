Sixty oral history interviews with South Asian geriatricians who worked and are still working in what is a marginalised area of healthcare, will fill a gap in the history of the National Health Service. Migrant doctors have made a significant contribution to the NHS workforce, yet most research up to now has tended to view such migration through the narrow lens of ‘brain drain’, ‘brain strain’ or ‘brain waste’ and has usually been based on the analysis of large scale statistical datasets. </p> \n<p>This project seeks to redress that balance with accounts from doctors covering such issues as reasons for going into medicine, career moves and strategies for personal advancement, perceived experiences of race and racism in the NHS, and the limits this posed to personal advancement. Linked to documentary data in national archives, the oral history interviews will contribute to policy discussions which have contemporary relevance. It will make a contribution to the increasingly pressing issue of the medical global labour market, looking back to see what can be learned from continuities and discontinuities with past policies and experiences.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0514","grantId":"RES-062-23-0514","fundValue":"191158","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanna  Bornat","coPersons":["Parvati  Raghuram"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
