The best way to model the rich variation in the appearance of real world materials is through measurements and this process of measuring the reflectance property of a material is referred to as reflectometry. Traditionally, reflectometry has involved carefully calibrated reflectance measurements under controlled illumination. This has limited the scope of these measurements to inside the laboratory and has hindered on-site measurements in general indoor or outdoor conditions. Here, we propose a novel approach to reflectometry with portable on-site acquisition based on off-the-shelf components. Specifically, we propose employing a mobile device such as a smartphone or a tablet for measuring the reflectance properties of flat material samples in general indoor environments. We propose to further extend reflectometry to general outdoor environments, where instead of relying on controlled incident illumination, we propose to estimate reflectance properties from measurements of polarization characteristics of reflected light as formalized by Stokes parameters in conjunction with multispectral imaging. Thus, this research aims to extend reflectometry for computer graphics and vision to general real world environments which has many potential applications in entertainment, cultural heritage and virtual reality.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M00192X/1","grantId":"EP/M00192X/1","fundValue":"98662","fundStart":"2015-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Abhijeet  Ghosh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
