Together with experts from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK, they are going to test two new methods of preventing malaria and the harmful effects in pregnancy. \n\nWhen pregnant women contract malaria this can have devastating consequences for pregnancy, resulting in fever which may trigger preterm onset of labour or even pregnancy loss. It is also possible for women to be infected without showing any outward signs or symptoms, yet if these infections are undetected and left untreated, they can cause anaemia in the mother and can interfere with the growth of the fetus leading to low birth weight, which increases the risk of babies dying during infancy.\n\nThe new project will provide malaria testing to women with or without the symptoms of malaria on every scheduled antenatal visit using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). The RDT is simple to perform, uses a single drop of blood and gives results within 15 minutes. Those women testing positive will be treated with an artemisinin combination drug called dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), which is the treatment of choice in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy in Indonesia. A second method called intermittent preventive treatment, which is used in most countries in Africa but not yet in Asia, will also be tested. With this method women without symptoms of malaria will be selected to receive the same drug but without prior blood testing. \n\nBoth methods will be compared with the existing policy in Indonesia, where all pregnant women are tested for malaria on the first antenatal visit only, and those with a positive result are treated with DHP. During subsequent antenatal visits, women are only tested if they have symptoms of malaria such as fever. This means that some infections will go undetected. It is anticipated that the two new methods will either detect infections much earlier than the current approach, or prevent them altogether.\n\nThe findings of this study, together with an assessment of feasibility and cost effectiveness of each method, will be used to inform malaria prevention policy for pregnant women in Indonesia and other parts of South East Asia.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100654","grantId":"G1100654","fundValue":"2426000","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Feiko Olaf Ter Kuile","coPersons":["Din  Syafruddin","Richard Norman Price","Eric Brian Faragher","Jayne  Webster","Rukhsana  Ahmed","Eve  Worrall","Puji Budi Setia Asih","Jenny  Hill","Maria Endang Endang Sumiwi","Jeanne Rini  Poespoprodjo (Indo)"],"organisation":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
