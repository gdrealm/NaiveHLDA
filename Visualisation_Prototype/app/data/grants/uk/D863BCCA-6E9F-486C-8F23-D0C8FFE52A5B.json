{"id":"D863BCCA-6E9F-486C-8F23-D0C8FFE52A5B","title":"The protein-mineral interface in bone: a solid-state NMR study","abstractText":"Bone is a very important material in our bodies and those of other animals. It is known to consist of a matrix of protein (primarily, collagen) in which are embedded inorganic crystals of calcium phosphate. There is, at present, very little known about how the protein matrix and calcium phosphate crystals stick together, yet if they did not stick together in some way, the calcium phosphate crystals would all sink to the bottom of the bone and the bone would be floppy, and of very little use in supporting our bodies. The interface between the protein and calcium phosphate is thus of key importance in understanding how bone works as a material, how it is tough, and rigid enough to support our bodies and their movement, yet surprisingly resistant to fracture. We will use a measurement method called solid-state NMR to (a) identify which part of the protein matrix interacts with the calcium phosphate and (b) how far apart the matrix and crystals are. We will also look at how much force is required to break the link between the protein and calcium phosphate and see what effect diseases, such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis have. The hope is that this will give clues as to how to treat these diseases as well as give us important information when building mathematical models to describe the functioning of bone as a material.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D013526/1","grantId":"BB/D013526/1","fundValue":"195476","fundStart":"2006-05-02","fundEnd":"2009-05-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We have have used them to understand calcification in other tissues and have now shown that pathological vascular calcification proceeds by a very similar mechanism to the physiological process in bone.

Identification for the first time of the molecular species in bone matrix that binds to the mineral component. This project showed unequivocally that it is a chondroitin sulphate-like glycosaminoglycan (GAG), and significantly, not a protein which current opinion in bone biology (nor our original grant application!) expected.\n\n2. Discovery that this molecular species performs the same role in other mineralised tissues, namely tooth enamel, calcified cartilage and mineralised atherosclerotic plaques.\n\n3. Providing the first direct evidence that mineralisation of medial atherosclerotic plaques is a controlled process, much like the mineralisation process in bone.
