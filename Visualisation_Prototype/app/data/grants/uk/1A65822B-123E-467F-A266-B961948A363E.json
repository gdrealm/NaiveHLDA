It will deploy\nadvanced sensing and pattern recognition and robotic technologies that direct picking heads, adapted to many\nfruit or berry types, to inspect, pick and pack soft fruit in optimum condition and/or identify and remove pest\ninfected, rotten, over ripe or mouldy fruit delivering crop hygiene. AUTOPIC will develop robotic inspection and\nmanipulation systems for the care and harvesting of soft fruit; it will seek to produce systems with ultimate\noperational costs comparable to human pickers but with reduction in errors, improvement in consistency,\nallowing more predictable farm resource management. The project brings together state of the art knowledge\nof innovative robotic arms, specialised fruit picking heads and the systems integration of multiple visual and\nother sensors/cameras for positioning the vehicle as well as the necessary deep horticultural and agricultural\nmachinery knowledge to maintain the harvest potential of soft fruit, plants, trees or bushes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M005496/1","grantId":"BB/M005496/1","fundValue":"184373","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Blackmore","coPersons":["Samuel Oliver  Wane"],"organisation":"Harper Adams University","findingsText":" Not applicable this year Not applicable this year Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
