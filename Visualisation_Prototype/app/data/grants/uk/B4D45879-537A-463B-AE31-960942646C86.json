We have shown that reproduction in fish (roach, a common member of the carp family of fish) living in many UK Rivers has been damaged by exposure to EDCs contained in the wastewater treatment works (WwTW) effluents and the chemicals responsible for these effects include natural oestrogen hormones and pharmaceutical oestrogens in the contraceptive pill. \nFeminised roach have a reduced capability to breed under competitive breeding conditions and we have evidence (as yet, unpublished) for reduced breeding population sizes in wild roach living in rivers with a high effluent content. Populations with low numbers of breeding individuals lose genetic variation over multiple generations with a greater risk of extinction. Nevertheless, we find that in some stretches of these rivers with high oestrogenic exposure roach populations appear to be reproductively self-sustaining. Establishing whether fish (here roach) have adapted to oestrogenic contaminants, how they do this (the mechanisms) and the possible fitness costs of these adaptations are essential in understanding resilience (and thus sustainability) of fish populations living in these polluted environments.\nWe will examine whether exposure of roach populations to oestrogenic WwTW effluents over multiple generations has resulted in genetic selection and the impacts of selection on the susceptibility in male fish to develop oestrogen-induced effects associated with negative fitness consequences. We will examine for selection by identifying functionally significant changes in their genetic make up. Specifically we will look for differences in genetic poylmorphisms (so called single nucleotide polymorphisms -SNPs) in (1) specific (candidate) genes that we know are important in oestrogen signalling of reproductive (and other life) processes and (2) by using methods that allow us to scan the whole genome for these genetic alterations (using a technique called RAD-tag genotyping). Adopting these methods we expect to find 'footprints' of selection in fish living in rivers with a high oestrogenic effluent content, which should allow identification of novel adaptive processes and suggest important mechanisms of toxicity or survival in effluent rich environments. Uniquely, we are able to do this work because we have in depth knowledge (15 years of study) of the wild populations of roach in the selected UK Rivers that we propose to study.\nWe will establish whether roach populations exposed to high levels of oestrogenic effluent over many generations have adapted to become less responsive to environmental oestrogens and thus are now less susceptible to their associated adverse effects by comparing responses to a controlled exposure to the contraceptive oestrogen, ethinyloestradiol. We will use roach collected from the same clean and WwTW effluent contaminated sites as for the population genetic analyses described above and fish will be exposed for a period of 1 year and effects quantified on responses that have negative fitness consequences in male fish, including ovotestis. \nThis work is intended to greatly improve understanding of the ability of fish to adapt to exposure to environmental pollutants (here oestrogen) and how they do so, in turn helping to inform on fish population resilience in UK rivers receiving WwTW effluent discharges. The work will have importance in the regulation of discharges for the better protection of our aquatic resources and biodiversity and is of very wide interest to the government regulatory bodies, environment protection groups, industry and the wider public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K004263/1","grantId":"NE/K004263/1","fundValue":"387022","fundStart":"2013-04-21","fundEnd":"2016-04-20","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This project will provide the first evidence of whether fish populations in UK rivers can adapt to environmental oestrogen exposure and investigate the molecular basis for such adaptation. This is a fundamental question for establishing whether wastewater effluents in UK rivers threaten the viability of fish populations. The research will lead to a better understanding of the risk posed by exposure to environmental oestrogens in fish populations and their adaptive capability to these stressors. Importantly, this work will enhance our knowledge on the adaptive capability (and the mechanisms of this adaptation) for exposure to environmental oestrogens and in turn the resilience of fish (here roach) populations for these exposures.\n\nThe work will have importance in the regulation of discharges for the better protection of our aquatic resources and biodiversity and is of very wide interest to the government regulatory bodies, environment protection groups, industry and the wider public. We have already engaged key authorities (The UK Environment Agency and DEFRA) for this work and received their support. EDCs are high on the international agenda for human and environmental health concerns and in the REACH directive, and the registration of new chemicals will need to provide evidence for a lack of endocrine disrupting activity. Furthermore, the synthetic oestrogen, ethinyloestradiol and the natural oestrogen, oestradiol-17? are both presently under consideration by the European Commission as priority hazardous substances and there is an urgent need to better understand the population level consequences for exposure to these chemicals\n\nThis work from this project has already resulted in a series of international conferences presentations.

Our first objective is to examine for evidence of selection by undertaking an analysis of allele frequencies (SNPs) in candidate genes in wild populations. This required the identification of roach populations with a long history of exposure with estrogenic effluents, each matched with roach population with little or no history of exposure. Several of these populations had been identified previously, but we have identified additional suitable populations which has no upstream inputs that is geographically close to a population in the highly polluted river Lee and several in northern England. Predicted estrogen exposure concentrations have been modelled for river stretches where these data were absent. Fin clips from between 42-60 roach have been obtained from the selected rivers (Mole, Gade, Derwent, Hull, Foss, Aire, Lee, Cuffley Brook, Kennet, Grantham Canal and Wreake) which were fished in collaboration with the Environment Agency fisheries teams, thus completing sample collection for this project. 590 fish (all except those from the Kennet) have been genotyped using 19 DNA microsatellites and the data added to our existing database of microsatellite genotypes from our previous NERC project. Analysis of microsatellite genotypes using population trees and PCA analysis strengthened the evidence that populations we have previously included in our population-genetic analysis are restricted to their river stretches over generations (the same populations sampled in different generations group together). Our analysis also suggests that populations in northern England that have not previously been included in population-genetic analysis are suitable for analysis of selection using genetic outlier methods. Microsatellite analysis was also used to confirm that the majority fish sampled were bred roach; several hybrids from one site were identified and will be excluded from further analysis. \n\nWe have extracted high-quality DNA from 480 roach of sufficient quantity and quality for the two SNP genotyping methods that will be used: RAD-tag genotyping and SNP-chip at the NERC facility at Sheffield. A list of candidate genes that are likely to be involved in the evolution of estrogen tolerance has been compiled by undertaking an extensive literature search. In order to identify SNPs in the genes of interest we sequenced the transcriptome of roach using RNA from the livers from 60 wild roach from 6 geographically distant rivers as well as roach fry from 3 rivers. The quality of the assembly has been validated and sequences for the majority of the candidate genes (~80%) are present. We are now compiling a list of SNPs within candidate and control genes. We have also sequenced the roach genome at 30x coverage and we have written a custom script to predict intron positions and sequences for these data that are required for SNP-chip development. \n\nOur second major objective is to examine for differences in estrogen sensitivity by conducting an exposure using offspring from impacted and clean rivers. Pre-spawning roach were fished in April and May 2013 in collaboration with the Environment Agency fisheries teams and brought back to the aquarium in Exeter. Controlled crosses were undertaken by mixing the milt from 10 males with the eggs from 4-6 females from two polluted (the Mole and the Wreake) and two clean river stretches (Gade and the Grantham Canal). At approximately 1 month post spawning roach from these four sites were combined, distributed among 16 tanks and exposed to ethinylestradiol (EE2) or kept in control conditions. Monthly water samples have been taken from the exposure tanks for chemical analysis and these have been extracted onto cartridges. Chemical analysis so far has confirmed that the fish in the exposed tanks are being exposed to between 1.2 and 2 ng/L EE2. After 1 year of exposure, approximately half (~300) of the offspring were sampled and the bodies were preserved for gonadal histology and fins preserved in 100% ethanol for subsequent microsatellite genotyping (genotyping of the 62 parents is complete). Initial results from histological analysis indicate that the exposure has induced the formation of feminised ducts in some of the males, but oocytes are yet to develop. Histology of the gonads of the adults demonstrated that roach from rivers with higher exposure concentrations of WwTW effluents have a higher prevalence and severity of the intersex condition. Establishing whether fish (here roach) have adapted to oestrogenic contaminants, how they do this (the mechanisms) and the possible fitness costs of these adaptations are essential in understanding resilience (and thus sustainability) of fish populations living in these polluted environments. This work will inform relevant government agencies, environmental protection groups and industry on adaptive capabilities of fish living in rivers contaminated with wastewater effluents and serve as an important cornerstone for assessing population level impacts of these effluent discharges and regulation needs.
