{"id":"DA34F158-D4E9-453C-A966-60EF443BAC13","title":"Pairing and Molecule Formation in Cold Atomic Bose and Fermi Gases","abstractText":"The experimental breakthrough in laser cooling and trapping of atoms and the subsequent achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation have provided, for the first time, insight into the quantum mechanical nature of gases below the microkelvin temperature scale. The overall aim of our proposed research is the development of an understanding of pairing in such cold assemblies of Bose or Fermi atoms, including the formation of molecules and their preparation in exotic states. This involves quantitative descriptions of the dynamics of the cross-over from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing to Bose-Einstein condensation of diatomic molecules, the optimisation of the lifetimes of molecular gases, as well as the development of schemes for the production of cold three-atom bound states.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E025935/2","grantId":"EP/E025935/2","fundValue":"855267","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  TennysonThorsten  Koehler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" A new easy to use plasma simulation code was developed Exploited by Quantemol Ltd Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
