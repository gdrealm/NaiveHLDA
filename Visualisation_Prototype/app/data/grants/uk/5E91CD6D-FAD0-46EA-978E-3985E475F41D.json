The work outlined in this proposal will use simulation studies using a custom aerosol chambers to understand the processes leading to secondary aerosol formation. The study represents a pump-priming activity to assess the applicability of the experimental methods and the ability to measure the range of gas phase compounds. The data from the study will be modelled using the so-called master chemical mechanism to explore the development of chemical diagnostics for the formation of secondary organic aerosol.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D006813/1","grantId":"NE/D006813/1","fundValue":"42234","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Steven Monks","coPersons":["Andrew Michael  Ellis"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
