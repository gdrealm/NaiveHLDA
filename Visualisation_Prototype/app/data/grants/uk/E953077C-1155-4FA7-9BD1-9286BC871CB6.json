Each mission area (e.g. in defence, health or agriculture policy) has its own distinctive system of actors and organizations. However, mission-oriented research has tended to be overlooked by academic analysts of science and technology policy. Yet these systems are significant features of both the wider research and innovation systems and of public policy systems, and are thought to be facing profound challenges stemming from changes in public policy missions (including the emergence of significant global challenges), from financial and political pressures on the organization of government activities, from shifts in the way scientific knowledge is produced and the global distribution of scientific expertise, and from the globalization of technology and innovation. And in the current context of budgetary declines and fiscal austerity, there may be particular tensions between the need to meet short term pressures and needs, deal with longer-term problems and at the same time ensure that the right balance of knowledge and expertise is maintained to meet future, as yet unknown, challenges. \nOur research aims to better understand how these mission-oriented research systems work and how they are changing in response to these challenges. In doing so, we will contribute to academic understanding of mission-oriented science and technology policy and the growing academic debate on the future of mission-oriented science and technology policy. But we also aim to inform policy and practice in the field of mission-oriented science and technology policy, and improve the level of debate amongst stakeholders in the UK and beyond. \nSpecifically, through our research we aim to: \n1. Characterise and so better understand the different kinds of mission-oriented research systems and their distinguishing features; \n2. Understand in detail selected mission-oriented research systems and how they have evolved in recent years; \n3. Examine how actors in and stakeholders of those systems perceive the challenges and opportunities facing them, allowing us to identify challenges that may be common to all mission-oriented systems and challenges that are unique to specific systems; \n4. Assess how the selected mission-oriented research systems are responding to the challenges; \n5. Identify the opportunities for and threats to mission-oriented research systems, distinguishing between any generic implications for mission-oriented science and technology systems as a whole and any specific implications for defence and security-related mission-oriented research systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K011278/1","grantId":"ES/K011278/1","fundValue":"239182","fundStart":"2013-05-31","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  James","coPersons":["John  Rigby","Jakob  Edler","Kieron  Flanagan"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
