The project delivers a transformative educational environment creating a rich mix of openly licenced and other data from arts and humanities, science, and medical health contexts, placing 'authoritative museums' data from professional curators alongside data from more informal contexts compiled and published in collaboration with communities.\n\nThe project draws on a wide range of expertise from Newcastle University and various external partners. University contributions come from the International Centre for Cultural and Heritage Studies, with its heritage and museums academic-practitioners, the Digital Institute, whose computer scientists contribute to an important project on Social Inclusion through the Digital Economy, Medical Education, which has been at the forefront of e-learning, and Education and Communication, which has been piloting a 'Skype Seniors' project connecting motivated, skilled adults with school students. External partners include Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums (the leading museums, gallery and archive service in the North East), Woodhorn (which manages four Northumberland museums and the Northumberland Archives), Taylor &amp; Francis Group (a major publishing group), Wellcome Images (a national database of medical sciences images) and Schools Northeast (representing schools in the north east region). The partnership has a range of expertise on community engagement: both Newcastle University, through its recent Beacon North East and its Education School, and the two museum consortia have successfully developed models. \n\nNewcastle University has identified three major Societal Challenge Themes: Ageing, Sustainability and Social Renewal. Co-curate North East plays into all three. It seeks to engage and empower communities, especially those involving ethnic minorities and other 'hard to reach' groups - something central to the concept of Social Renewal - for which key partners Tyne &amp; Wear Archives and Museums (TWAM) and Woodhorn have nationally recognised track records. The Ageing theme involves a set of intergenerational priorities highly relevant to Co-curate North East, while it is important that the legacy of key assets generated by the project, particularly the range of digital datasets and learning packages, is sustainable. This will be ensured through their stewardship by TWAM and Woodhorn, who will make them available for future generations of researchers through their regular collections management policies.\n\nThe project will work with around 20 different community and school groups, many of them based in the Newcastle region but some from rural settings. They will have access to a broad range of digital collections and archives, from the exotic ethnographic objects in the Great North Museum to the scientific and industrial heritage in Discovery Museum and Woodhorn and the wealth of images from publishers Taylor &amp; Francis. Participants will be free to curate their own collections: some may wish to focus on local history, perhaps engaging with the centenary of World War 1 or maybe comparing how objects nowadays gain cultural value from a particular social context with a similar process in the 18th century.\n\nThis approach meets an identified need for Enquiry Based and Project Based Learning within a consortium of local North East schools already working with the University. The project will help develop curriculum innovation and an exciting offer to community groups (from Young Archaeologists to U3A). Evaluation will be through a case-study methodology based on Theory of Change, which involves working closely with participant organisations to help them articulate their ideas and expose contradictions between theories and practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L007991/1","grantId":"AH/L007991/1","fundValue":"322461","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  We are in the process of developing the project which will complete in March 2015 Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural,Societal,Policy & public services","person":"Eric Grahame Cross","coPersons":["Gerard Esplin Corsane","Paul  Watson","Megan  Quentin-Baxter","Iain Graham Wheeldon","Andrew  Newman","David  Leat"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" The project is due to complete in March 2015.\n\nInterim findings;\n\n1. That co-production and co-curation is a complex process of negotiation and knowledge exchange where we have to take seriously questions of the ownership of knowledge, intellectual property and protocols for sharing.\n\n2. That digital platforms and social machines need co-design or interactive design with universities, heritage collections, institutions and universities all being involved.\n\n3. That multi-disciplinary work needs to be trans and not non-disciplinary and that complex projects with multiple research partners need to examine methodologies of research quite carefully.\n\n4. That tensions can ensue around questions of what counts as official and unofficial knowledge and the development and partnership with community groups and individuals is essential to the success of a project.\n\n5. That the ways in which visual data is displayed on platforms is a complex process of interaction, negotiation and design. We have already developed an innovative digital platform which aggregates materials already existing in online regional and national museum collections, has the capacity to upload newly generated community collections, and exhibit and curate those collections in multiple narrative ways. Further our work offers new lessons for curation and the co-production of materials and significant research into those practices through observation, ethnography and interviews.\nThese findings are useful for th Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
