Its main users will be local authorities and Local Enterprise Partnerships.</p>\n\n<p>The Centre brings together leading experts from three different institutions: the London School of Economics, Centre for Cities and Arup. LSE leads the Centre and will ensure the Centre's is rigorous and robust. Centre for Cities leads on engagement, and Arup leads on evidence-gathering and synthesis.</p>\n\n<p>The Centre is funded for three years. In year one it will develop a system for ranking policies, systematically evaluate the existing evidence, and develop an online toolkit allowing users to compare policies ranked using a common currency. In years two and three, the Centre will develop effective knowledge exchange and help build users' capacity to deploy evidence effectively. It will also help embed the use of evidence in the longer term, via improved data management and demonstrator projects. The Centre will operate as an open organisation, working with users at every stage of the process. It will also actively participate in the national What Works network.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003945/1","grantId":"ES/L003945/1","fundValue":"3002940","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Henry George Overman","coPersons":["Gabriel  Ahlfeldt","Max A Nathan","Neil  Lee","Karen  Lucas","Andrew  Carter","Jerome  Frost","Paul Charles Cheshire","Stephen  Gibbons","Lynne  Miles","Simona  Iammarino","Alexandra Claire Rhian  Jones","Olmo  Silva","Ralf  Martin","Jonathan  Haskel","Andy  Pike","Alan  Harding","Christian Albin Lukas  Hilber","Joanna  Rowelle","Helen Deborah Simpson"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
