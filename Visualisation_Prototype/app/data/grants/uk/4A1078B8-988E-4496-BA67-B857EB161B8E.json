{"id":"4A1078B8-988E-4496-BA67-B857EB161B8E","title":"Vulnerable Consumers Seminar Series","abstractText":"<p>The proposed programme of discussions connects with a series of important contemporary concerns that relate to broad issues of individual and societal well-being. We focus on consumer vulnerability and characterise it as an undesirable state catalysed by a number of human conditions and contexts. Vulnerability is not necessarily experienced as a permanent state and can often be felt in times of transition - job loss, bereavement, ill health, natural disaster, ageing and the identity and the lifestyle shift required in becoming a parent. These conditions and characteristics affect how individuals experience, interpret and respond to the marketplace and often how the marketplace responds to them.</p>\n\n<p>The central aims of the seminar series are firstly to provide a space to critically engage with the notion of consumer vulnerability in order to promote dialogue and interchange between researchers, practitioners and policy makers; and secondly, to create a supportive forum through which to foster methodological good practice and encourage collaborative research projects. This more practical agenda will facilitate the exploration of the ethics of such research and the identification of research barriers within Management/Business Schools and the social sciences more broadly.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021938/1","grantId":"ES/J021938/1","fundValue":"17731","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Dunnett","coPersons":["Kathy  Hamilton","Maria Grazia Piacentini"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
