Much of this stays in the atmosphere, raising CO2 levels, but much also leaves the atmosphere after a time, either to become sequestered in trees and plants, or else to become absorbed in the oceans. CO2 staying in the atmosphere is a greenhouse gas, causing global warming; CO2 entering the sea makes it more acidic, and the ongoing acidification of seawater is seen in observational records at various sites where time-series data are collected. The changing chemistry of seawater due to ocean acidification is mostly well understood and not subject to debate. What is much less well known is the impact that the changing chemistry will have on marine organisms and ecosystems, on biogeochemical cycling in the sea, and on how the sea interacts with the atmosphere to influence climate. We propose to run a carbonate chemistry facility to undertake high quality sample analysis of DIC and TA for other research groups in the UK Ocean Acidification Programme who lack the appropriate expertise and instrumentation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H025839/1","grantId":"NE/H025839/1","fundValue":"399241","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The Carbonate Chemistry Facility has provided support to researchers in the UK Ocean Acidification Programme.
