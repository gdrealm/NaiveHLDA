These interests include cognitive systems, interaction and robotics, networked embedded and control systems. We are developing ICT based systems in support of the networked enterprise. Theme four of the FP7 initiative covers several additional research areas currently being investigated by the MCDS group. Theme four of the initiative covers nanosciences, nanotechnologies, new materials and production technologies. Our research areas encompass networked embedded and control systems, and intelligent mechantronic systems. The approach is to enhance networked production by developing advanced engineering concepts. A central feature is knowledge sharing and associated distribution of information through the integration of intelligent controls derived from modeling and simulation. Use of virtual production tools provides increased ability to communicate advanced engineering concepts. In addition, we have research applications addressing issues in FP7 theme five which covers energy and associated applications. We are currently investigating renewable energy systems and energy saving methods. In this proposal we request travel expenses for the MCDS members to facilitate participation in the FP7 Calls.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F033303/1","grantId":"EP/F033303/1","fundValue":"58738","fundStart":"2007-11-26","fundEnd":"2010-11-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Hongnian  Yu","coPersons":["Anthony  Atkins"],"organisation":"Staffordshire University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
