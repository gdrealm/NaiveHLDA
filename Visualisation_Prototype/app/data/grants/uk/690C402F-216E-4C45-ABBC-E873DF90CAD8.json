Most traditional approaches to synthesis of nanoscale materials, unlike those in biology, require stringent conditions and often produce toxic byproducts. Within biology itself, biomaterials are highly organized from the molecular to the nanoscale, with intricate architectures that allow for optimum functionality. The focus for this proposal is two-fold. In the first instance (Engineering Nanomaterials from Biology) I aim to rationally design and exploit the specific biomolecular interactions between biomolecules (peptides) to control the assembly and dis-assembly of bio-inorganic nanostructures. The engineering of such a novel generation of nanomaterials has applications in bio-sensing, devices and drug delivery. The second focus (Engineering Nanomaterials for Biology) is on exploiting our understanding of the natural biological nanostructures found in the complex extracellular matrix of tissues in order to engineer synthetic biomimetic nanostructures for improved cell growth and tissue regeneration. I now have a large creative research team with many developing international links. If successful with this proposal I will be able to manage my group to its full potential and to expand its influence and vision. The proposed research involves development of many new international collaborations in the basic sciences and is highly multidisciplinary in nature encompassing elements of engineering, biology, chemistry and physics and ranging from high-resolution techniques of surface analysis to peptide design and cell biology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E007627/1","grantId":"EP/E007627/1","fundValue":"1025520","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The grant focussed on developing several technological platforms for diagnostic technologies based on inorganic nanoparticles as well as studying fundamental nanoparticles nanoparticle self-assembly. These technologies are engineered to detect specific biomarkers corresponding to particular diseases by giving accurate yet easily interpretable read-outs (e.g. easily discernible colour change) and have been reported in numerous Nature family journals and other high impact journals/outlets. The grant also focussed on developing material scaffolds for tissue engineering.

We are building upon our established technologies for biosensing, which were reported in Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Protocols, Nature Materials and Nano Letters. Furthermore, many publications on scaffolds for tissue engineering were also published. The research that is being performed on our nanomaterial-based technologies aims to be exploited within the nanotechnological-based research and academic communities for our understanding of synthesising such materials controllably and reproducibly, while our translational research will hopefully enable prototypes that can be evaluated for their commercial potential.
