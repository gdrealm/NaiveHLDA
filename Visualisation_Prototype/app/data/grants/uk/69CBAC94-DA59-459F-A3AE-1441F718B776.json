Within each cell, thousands of chemical reactions take place, controlling everything from energy generation to DNA manufacture. All these chemical reactions are enclosed within the membrane that surrounds the cell. One set of such chemical reactions forms the focus of this research proposal, and is involved in the manufacture of a series of important compounds called polyamines. Polyamines are small molecules that play a crucial role in cell health and viability, and without them, life would be unsupportable. Changes in the levels of polyamines can cause cell death or cancer, as well as human genetic disease like the mental retardation disorder Snyder-Robinson Syndrome. Polyamines help support a range of processes central for viability. For instance, they help DNA to be correctly packaged and folded. In doing so, they help the genes encoded in the DNA to be correctly switched on and off, or 'expressed'. Polyamines also help another polymer called RNA to fold correctly, and again, RNA plays a central role in gene expression. As a final example, polyamines help protect the membrane in the cell from damage by the oxidising chemicals generated accidentally in the cell when energy is generated; as such, polyamines play a very similar role to vitamin C, an important anti-oxidant found in our diet. In a factory or chemical plant, chemical reactions are always carefully controlled, and in this respect, the cell is no different. Its chemical reactions are also subject to a series of checks and balances perfected over the course of evolution to make sure the reactions can be turned on, or off, as more or less product is required. Without this control, living systems would not exhibit the ability to respond to changes in the environment, and indeed, in some cases, would cease to be viable. The requirement for effective, tight control has resulted in many cellular chemical reactions, including those of polyamine synthesis, being subject to complex, multiple and interlocking controls. Understanding how control over polyamine synthesis operates in a living cell, how robust that control is, and under what circumstances the control might break down, for example in a disease state like cancer or Snyder-Robinson Syndrome, is a problem that can only be addressed by the new field of systems biology. In systems biology, biologists work in multi-disciplinary teams with physical scientists such as control engineers to try and understand how biological control processes interact to enable robust control to be exerted. This interdisciplinary approach is required as a direct response to the complexity of the polyamine control mechanisms being studied, which renders standard biological research approaches inadequate. In this proposal, biologists and control engineers will be working together in an interdisciplinary team to subject the polyamine synthesis pathway to a systems biology analysis. Mathematical models of the biochemical reactions will be developed, tested and employed to test hypotheses about how the pathway functions. The aim is to understand how polyamine manufacture is controlled, to understand what goes wrong with the control processes in human disease states, and to understand how robust polyamine control is i.e. how successfully is control maintained despite changes in cell biochemistry. The research project will reveal how control over this key metabolic process is exerted in a healthy cell, and how that control goes wrong in different disease states.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F019084/1","grantId":"BB/F019084/1","fundValue":"292577","fundStart":"2008-11-03","fundEnd":"2011-10-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Optimisation of translation is of considerable interest to biotechnology.

Polyamines are positively charged molecules that act in the cell to coat DNA and RNA, neutralizing their negative charges. The overproduction, or depletion, of polyamines is toxic to the cell, causing either cell death or cancer. Thus their synthesis is subject to multiple controls, including allosteric control over enzyme activity, as well as translational control over the principal pathway regulator, the protein antizyme. Antizyme targets the first enzyme step in the pathway, ornithine decarboxylase, for degradation. Antizyme synthesis is in turn dependent upon a translational frameshift event, and the frameshifting is stimulated by polyamines. Thus higher polyamine concentrations trigger antizyme production, consequent Spe1 degradation, and pathway shutdown, comprising a classic negative feedback loop. \n\n\n\nThis project aimed to develop an integrated understanding of how the pathway is regulated, and how it responds to perturbation, using mathematical modeling as part of a systems analysis of its regulation, and using yeast as a model system. The project successfully developed predictive mathematical models of the ribosomal frameshift event, and its response to different polyamines, as well as a model of the whole biochemical pathway and its control mechanisms. Overall, the understanding revealed new ways to subvert the control mechanisms of the pathway, including frameshifting so that new cancer chemotherapeutics could potentially be developed. Optimisation of translation is of considerable interest to biotechnology. We are applying the knowledge gained during this proposal to understand how best to optimise gene expression and translation through interactions with a biotechnology company, now the subject of a successful TSB proposal.
