We have been filming at CERN throughout 2012, the most exciting year for particle physics in a generation. Our aim is to give the general public a personal sense of who world-class particle physicists are and what they actually do. We have had great access to LHC teams searching for the Higgs, Supersymmetry, and exotics, and to a small anti-hydrogen experiment. We were filming when the Higgs results were coming together, and when a ground-breaking anti-matter paper was accepted for publication. We captured the emotion of these moments in real time. Such moments in physics are rare: they grab the public's attention for a few days, and our aim is to build off that interest and make the public want to know more. We do this with a series of un-intimidating, intelligent, informal short films that open the door onto the thrills and headaches of world-class experimental particle physicists. \n\nThere is a larger message here. In our profit-driven age people expect immediately quantifiable returns on investments. Great minds choose high-risk finance over long-term projects at underfunded research institutions. And so it is vitally important that the public understand the value and excitement of fundamental scientific knowledge. We\\ appreciate the pursuit of excellence for its own sake in the Olympics, but when it comes to science everyone asks: what is it good for? Of course many useful things have emerged from the technologies developed en route at places like CERN, not least the world wide web, but in a sense they are side-shows: physicists do what they do because they want to challenge nature, to see how many secrets they can unlock, how much of the universe's unknown they can come to make known in their short lifetimes. The films strive to convey this curiosity and ambition. \n\nOur focus is primarily on younger physicists, who don't speak to the cameras when big news is announced but stay up all night analysing data, preparing graphs, and tweaking the tools on which big experiments' results depend. We've chosen accessible, charismatic people who viewers will find surprising, entertaining, and inspiring. None of them will win a Nobel prize, even if their work helps others to do so; and they probably won't have the lifestyle of their friends who went into the private sector, where the mathematically gifted can make millions. They have no interest in such rewards. \n\nWhich isn't to say some don't occasionally get discouraged: pursuing exotic particles year after year, for example. with an ever-shrinking likelihood of finding them can be tough, particularly when your friends are celebrating the great Higgs-Boson-like particle discovery. But those on exotic searches explain that even ruling theories out, by finding nothing, helps the community hone in on big unanswered questions. And while the risk of finding nothing is great, the reward, should their searches turn something up, is much greater. These are physics' dreamers.\n\nInformal interviews and quiet observation of physicists at work lead us through such topics, offerring viewers a uniquely personal window onto the extraordinary collaborative skills, individual brilliance, and inordinate patience work at CERN requires. The films are in the end about the practical nature of the pursuit of pure knowledge, and the inspirational people pursuing it. \n\nCERN People is already a Youtube channel with over 90k views, and a Google+ page with 80k followers. We are applying for funding for our next round of films, and for internet outreach. The project developed out of the documentary feature, MINDS OVER MATTER, which will be broadcast internationally and shown at film festivals, museums, and educational institutions. The web films will build up a community ready to receive and for the feature, which will reach millions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K006045/1","grantId":"ST/K006045/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2013-03-11","fundEnd":"2014-01-10","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Liz  Mermin","coPersons":["Aisling  Ahmed"],"organisation":"Crow Hill Films Ltd","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
