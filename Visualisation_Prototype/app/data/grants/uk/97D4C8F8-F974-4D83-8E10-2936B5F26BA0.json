At the first stage, the primary visual cortex integrates the images from the two eyes, which is essential for stereo vision. At the same time, neurons (nerve cells) in that part of the brain have the ability to detect the orientation of line segments and contours (horizontal, vertical, etc) which forms the basis for object recognition. This 'tuning' or sensitivity for line orientation is partly innate, and partly acquired during a so-called critical period in childhood. Even in adulthood, it can still be affected e.g. by perceptual training. Similarly, the balance between the two eyes depends on early visual experience, and if this is in some way atypical visual disorders will occur that cannot be corrected later in life. In this project, we want to investigate how the orientation tuning and binocularity of individual neurons in mouse primary visual cortex are influenced and altered by early visual experience, a phenomenon known as developmental plasticity. For this purpose, animals will be reared either in a visual environments which contains only contours of a single orientation, or with one eye closed. We will then record the responses of individual nerve cells to visual stimuli using a novel brain imaging technique of very high resolution called two-photon imaging. This technique in which active cells give off fluorescence signals can even be used to monitor the responses of the same neurons over time. We want to use it to find out more about the cellular mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity. First, by using genetically modified mice we can distinguish the two main types of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory ones) which will appear in different colours. We will assess what role these two cell types play in plasticity. Second, we know that certain genes are important for how neurons communicate with each other. We will study mice lacking two particular genes in order to see whether the proteins encoded by these genes are critical for developmental plasticity. It is becoming increasingly evident that many neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Fragile X or schizophrenia involve defects in the communication between nerve cells. Ultimately, we hope that knowing more about how plasticity works under normal circumstances will help us to better understand what goes wrong in childhood developmental disorders and in the ageing brain, and will enable us to develop treatment strategies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J002089/1","grantId":"BB/J002089/1","fundValue":"323949","fundStart":"2012-05-16","fundEnd":"2016-03-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  My findings have been used in an application for follow-on funding.

We found significant differences between the mechanisms operating in young and adult mice. Our research has raised further questions that will be addressed by us and others in future studies. It also helps with understanding brain mechanisms of learning and memory in general and may contribute to understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
