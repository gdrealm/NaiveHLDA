{"id":"2AFDA1C1-B838-4541-975A-6E3BE36567B8","title":"The expression and function of glutamatergic susceptibility genes in schizophrenia","abstractText":"A number of genes that may affect people’s risk of getting schizophrenia have recently been identified. Although the evidence is still incomplete, it has been suggested that they share in common an effect on how a key chemical transmitter, called glutamate, functions in the brain. We want to investigate this question further, to help understand the mechanisms by which the genes work. To do this, we will study in detail where exactly the genes are expressed in the brain, what the differences are in people with the illness, and between people with different variants (‘polymorphisms’) of each gene. We will also study, in various experimental models, the consequences of manipulating the genes in a way that mimics the alterations seen in the illness. Overall, our objective is to discover important clues about the genetic and biological abnormalities that underlie schizophrenia, and which may help in the development of better drug treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500180","grantId":"G0500180","fundValue":"662531","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Harrison","coPersons":["Zoltan  Molnar","Philip William Burnet","Matthew John Wood","Sharon Lisa Eastwood"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
