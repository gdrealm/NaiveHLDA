For example, participants might falsely believe they saw the word&nbsp;<em>sleep</em>&nbsp;after studying related words such as&nbsp;<em>bed</em>,&nbsp;<em>dream</em>,&nbsp;<em>wake</em>,&nbsp;<em>snore</em>&nbsp;etc.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the proposed research is to explore the possibility that false memories serve a useful function by guiding future behaviour. Participants will be presented with lists of words and asked to rate them in a number of ways, including their relevance to a past event, relevance to a planned future event, or how pleasant they are (control condition). The lists will be structured in such a way as to produce high levels of false memories (based on previous research). The hypothesis is that thinking about a planned future event activates related information that might be useful in terms of planning the activity. If this is the case then rating words for their relevance to a planned future event will increase the numbers of false memories for related words.&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010565/1","grantId":"ES/K010565/1","fundValue":"265934","fundStart":"2013-09-16","fundEnd":"2016-09-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  First papers reporting the findings are currently in preparation.

Thinking about a future event enhances the activation of related information that might guide the planning of the event. Current research will investigate whether the facilitation of future planning is impaired in people with depression. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
