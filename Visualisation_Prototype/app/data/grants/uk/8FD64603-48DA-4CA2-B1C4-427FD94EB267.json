This will result in the first systematic description of Manchester's accent, and will provide the basis for comparisons with other large urban centres of the UK. </p>\n\n<p>The study will investigate the patterns of variation within the community, ie, the ways in which Mancunians' speech varies depending on age, gender, social class, neighbourhood, and ethnicity. It will be based on a sample of 132 speakers representing the socio-economic spectrum of the city across different generations and different neighbourhoods, including members of the two largest ethnic minorities in Manchester, South-East Asian and Black Caribbean. </p>\n\n<p>The informants' spontaneous speech will be recorded during interviews lasting one hour. This will be supplemented by the reading of a word list. The recordings will be analysed auditorily and acoustically. The measurements obtained through computer-assisted acoustical analysis will be subjected to a range of multivariate statistical analyses. Their results will help to assess the role of extralinguistic factors, such as ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, neighbourhood, and age, in the creation of the linguistic variation found in Manchester.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4242","grantId":"RES-000-22-4242","fundValue":"82272","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Maciej  Baranowski","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
