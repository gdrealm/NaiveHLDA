This is being driven by the UK's legal obligations\naround the installation of renewables and cutting greenhouse gases, the rising cost of energy and concerns around the security of supply - the so-called energy &quot;trilemma&quot;. Power Electronic converters are a key enabling technology for PV and a range of other low-carbon technologies (LCTs). However the use of LCTs has resulted in problems for the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) in terms of supply voltage distortion and over-voltages, which threatens to limit or delay the uptake of these technologies. The aim of this project is to mitigate this threat by exploiting the benefits of new Gallium\nNitride (GaN) power module, which will initially be developed for use in a hybrid PV-battery unit for residential applications, but will have much broader application in LV grid-connected equipment (e.g. electric vehicle, charging &amp; micro-CHP). It is anticipated that the deployment of these units would lead to an increase in the maximum allowable installed capacity on the network and will be much smaller, lighter and have lower cost than existing Silicon based units.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N509954/1","grantId":"EP/N509954/1","fundValue":"96941","fundStart":"2016-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Cross","coPersons":["Dani  Strickland"],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
