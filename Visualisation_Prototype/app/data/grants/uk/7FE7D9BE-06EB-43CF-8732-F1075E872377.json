{"id":"7FE7D9BE-06EB-43CF-8732-F1075E872377","title":"Secularism: a reappraisal of institutional arrangements for religious regulation.","abstractText":"One of the numerous disagreements in contemporary international political argument arises from assumptions and confusions surrounding what is religion, what is 'legitimate' religion, and what is the proper relationship of the state with religion. For example, secularism, which is an arrangement for managing state-religion relations, and has its origins in Christianity itself, is often regarded mistakenly as a campaign against religion, and all too frequently discussions rest upon ready-made notions of how things worked 'traditionally' or in a faroff setting in time and place.\\n\\nApart from the widespread view that France is different, we also tend to assume that in these matters there is a dividing line between certain idea of the West as a whole and the rest of the world. Yet the countries of Western Europe and the Americas exhibit profound differences in their management of religion and in the depth of the divide between the religious and the secular, and the public and the private, and this variation is evident in major areas of public policy, notably family law, human rights, sexual equality, even the drawing up national statistics. The differences are also cross-cutting, as can be seen when one unpacks religion-state relations into these many spheres\\n\\nOne widely recognized pattern is the accordance of exemptions to religion: this is rooted in a longstanding hegemony of institutionalized and hierarchical Christianity in the public sphere in Europe, Latin America and Canada, which was underpinned by a degree of consensus and trust and by institutions of the state. The hegemony in turn has led to the elision of the idea of one particular religion with religions in general, so that through European powers implanted their arrangements in their colonies irrespective of local conditions, and now that new diasporas have made their home in Europe we are ill-prepared to absorb the religious traditions and practices - Muslim and Christian / which they bring, into our institutional framework. Our institutions are based on an assumption of hierarchy and unity in a hegemonic religious tradition, but now there is no hegemony, and many religious traditions with mass followings operate with little hierarchy and no unity. The exemptions which once seemed untroublesome and unquestioned, now pose new questions.\\n\\nMeanwhile, states to the East such as Russia, Turkey and Pakistan, which in different ways count themselves as sharing a broadly secularist vocation, are governed by institutions which have no compunction in interfering in religion and in classifying their citizens according to a list of, in effect, approved religious affiliations. The notion of secular in these countries / even in Turkey / is quite different from the notion prevalent in Western Europe, the USA and Latin America. \\n\\nThese are the considerations which have led us to propose the creation of an interdisciplinary and international network of experts to try and find a common basis for the analysis and eventually even the improvement of arrangements governing state-religion relations. The participants are drawn from the disciplines of political theory, political science, sociology, social anthropology, history, and law, and from a NGO specializing in religion and the public sphere, and they are from France, the UK, Pakistan, Russia and Turkey, the five countries on which attention will principally be focused.\\n\\nThe network will have a website which will publicize its activities and publish some texts for discussion, and will welcome academics and policymakers from all institutions and disciplines to its seminars, which will mostly be held in Cambridge. It will also run workshops and will expect to produce an agenda for research and a book in which the problems of secularism and its opposing ideologies will be analysed and ways forward explored.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F007566/1","grantId":"AH/F007566/1","fundValue":"25338","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Lehmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
