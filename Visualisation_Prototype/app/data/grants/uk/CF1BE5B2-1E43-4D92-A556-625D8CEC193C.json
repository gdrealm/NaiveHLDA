{"id":"CF1BE5B2-1E43-4D92-A556-625D8CEC193C","title":"Targeting the electric field of blood vessels for the treatment of vascular disease","abstractText":"Small electric fields are present throughout living tissues and are critical for the proper functioning of the body from heart beats to memory. Alterations within electric fields play pivotal roles in the body?s response to injury and wound healing. During vascular injury, the body tries to repair its tears in the blood vessel, but this can sometimes lead to excessive healing and cause the blood vessel to become occluded. If this occurs in the coronary arteries supplying blood to the heart, it can lead to coronary heart disease, the single most common cause of death in the UK. This study proposes to characterise the changes in the electric field during vascular injury and develop new therapies for coronary heart disease based on the application of small electric fields.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701833","grantId":"G0701833","fundValue":"103400","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alex  Cheong","coPersons":["Stephen  Evans"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
