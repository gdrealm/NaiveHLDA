{"id":"5F4873FF-0B6E-4E87-8E36-B544FC08EB7E","title":"Geophysical exploration of a West Antarctic subglacial lake","abstractText":"Antarctic subglacial lakes are liquid bodies of water located in topographic hollows beneath the ice sheets of Antarctica. They have attracted considerable scientific interest over the last ten years as they are expected to contain unique microbial lifeforms and detailed records of past climate change. Examination of these contents requires scientists to penetrate into a lake, and measure and sample the lake water and sediment. No lake has yet to be explored in this way, however. This form of direct analysis can only take place once a lake has been characterised fully by geophysical methods (to uncover the morphology of the ice base and the water depth of the lake). Of the 145 known subglacial lakes in Antarctica none have been measured to the level required for meaningful direct analysis to take place. We propose to undertake a comprehensive geophysical exploration of a 10 km long subglacial lake in West Antarctica, near the Ellsworth Mountains, named Subglacial Lake Ellsworth. The result of the project will be the first fully characterised subglacial lake environment and the establishment of a candidate for future direct exploration. Data analysis and modelling will be undertaken at the University of Bristol, the British Antarctic Survey and Northumbria University. Ice thickness will be determined from ice-penetrating radar, water depths will be found using seismic exploration, and ice flow and accumulation will be obtained from direct surface measurements. A series of numerical models will be used to understand the history of the lake, the flow of ice across the lake and the circulation of water within the lake. Data visualisation will be undertaken in conjunction with Dr. Martin Jakobsson (collaborator). Following this project, the next step will be to send a probe into Lake Ellsworth. A UK-led team has been assembled to plan such work (see www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/ellsworth), and take on what is arguably the most eagerly awaited and high-profile scientific project in the history of Antarctic science. Hence, the geophysical work we propose here will be thought of, in years to come, as a hugely important first step towards the understanding of one of the greatest unexplored habitats on Earth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D009200/1","grantId":"NE/D009200/1","fundValue":"195362","fundStart":"2007-04-11","fundEnd":"2011-04-10","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Martin John Siegert","coPersons":["Andrew Mark Smith","Hugh  Corr","Edward  King","Richard Carl Hindmarsh","David Glyn Vaughan"],"organisation":"NERC British Antarctic Survey","findingsText":" Sediments could record life in an Antarctic subglacial lake Sediments found at the bed of an Antarctic subglacial lake could contain a record of unique life-forms in the lake and a history of how the Antarctic Ice Sheet has changed in the past. Surveys carried out over Subglacial Lake Ellsworth confirm there is a thick pile of sediments at the lake bed, which have probably accumulated there slowly over thousands of years. In the search for unique life-forms in subglacial lakes, the presence, or absence of these sediments is important because this is where the evidence for both micro-organisms living in the lake, and changes in the ice sheet are believed to become trapped; if no sediments exist, then this evidence will be lost. Analysis of seismic data collected over Subglacial Lake Ellsworth has confirmed the presence of a layer of sediments up to 70 m thick at the lake bed. This was crucial information for the team who tried to drill into the lake in January 2013; it identified the best place to drill and also helped design the equipment built to capture sediment samples from the lake bed. Lake Exploration missions need to know the exact dimensions of the lake environment if they are to be planned properly. The results from this project allow such planning to take place.
