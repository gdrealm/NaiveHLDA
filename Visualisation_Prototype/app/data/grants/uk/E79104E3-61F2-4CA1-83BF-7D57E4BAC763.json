{"id":"E79104E3-61F2-4CA1-83BF-7D57E4BAC763","title":"Re-Enacting the Silk Road: Transnational Encounters for the 21st Century","abstractText":"Informed by the AHRC's 'Translating Cultures' highlight notice, the research network will investigate the concept of the Silk Road as a seemingly privileged site of cultural transmission, translation and exchange, in order to consider its radical potential to challenge the bounded, oppositional geopolitics that still determine the conventional categories of 'East' and 'West'. An international, inter-disciplinary and cross-sectoral forum, the network is intended to spark new conversations and collaborations between academics, travel writers, professionals from museums, art galleries and the tourist industry, and practitioners in the creative and visual arts. In doing so, it will serve to enable a wider public re-imagining of this ancient, long-distance trade route linking towns and cities from eastern China to western Europe, so that it speaks to 21st century global concerns.\n\nThe Silk Road has featured prominently in historical geographies of Europe and Asia for more than a century, and remains a powerfully evocative metaphor around which narratives of east-west relationships are constructed. Investigations into the economic, cultural and intellectual exchanges between Europe and Asia are almost as old as the interactions themselves. The systematic study of ancient overland trade routes however, only began in the late 19th century when European historians, geographers and archaeologists produced the first scholarly accounts of the main trans-continental conduits along which people and commodities, particularly high-value, low-bulk textiles such as silk, moved in waxing and waning cycles over many centuries. Classic early works on the Silk Road include those by Scottish Orientalist Henry Yule (1820-1880), who re-introduced the adventures of the Venetian traveller Marco Polo to the Victorian reading public, and German explorer and academic Ferdinand von Richthofen (1833-1905), who coined the phrase 'Seidenstrasse' in 1877. These pioneering ideas were developed in the early 20th century by explorers, collectors and writers such as the controversial Swedish adventurer Sven Hedin (1865-1952) and the remarkable Hungarian-born traveller Aurel Stein (1862-1943), as well as by more sedentary geopolitical theorists such as Halford Mackinder (1861-1947). Since World War Two, new forms of historical and archaeological research have transformed the terms in which the Silk Road has been interpreted, rejecting the imperialist connotations of earlier accounts and emphasising instead the shared traditions and mutually constitutive encounters between regions shaped by comparable though different economic, social and intellectual forces. Despite these more critical approaches however, exoticising imaginative geographies of the routeway persist. Stories of the Silk Road reproduce images not only of intercultural exchange, but also of luxury, the exotic and the adventurous, as evident in contemporary travelogues, literary fiction, television programmes and other cultural performances produced and consumed in both western and eastern countries.\n\nIn the context of the rapid economic development of China, India and other Asian powers, and in response to increasing popular interest in the Silk Road, this network seeks to develop recent critical re-assessments of east-west economic, cultural and intellectual translation and exchange, so as to extend their impact within such public sectors as tourism, heritage and the arts. Although the network will include specialists in Silk Road studies, the workshops are not primarily designed to advance historical and archaeological research. Rather, these events will bring together academics and non-specialist professionals from the creative and tourist industries, travel writing, and the visual arts to explore how recent scholarship on the Silk Road might facilitate a wider public re-imagining of this ancient trade route.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J005304/1","grantId":"AH/J005304/1","fundValue":"32528","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  As an AHRC research network award, the primary objective was the establishment of new research alliances and collaborations. This is an on-going process. The measurable impacts thus far relate to the museums, libraries and learned societies in the UK and France that were involved in the network and that possess important, though previously overlooked collections and materials relating to the history of the Silk Road. When representatives of these institutions came together as members of the network they became for the first time about their different materials. The specific examples here are International Dunhuang Project (IDP) in the British Library, the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) in London, and the Musee des Tissus et des Arts Decoratifs (MTAM) in Lyons. Representatives from all three were prominently involved in the network, and attended all three workshops. As a direct consequence of the network, the IDP and the RGS collaborated in the organisation of a major public exhibition of photography held in the former location but displayed in the latter, the exhibition partly funded by AHRC thanks to a short extension of the network project. This was a very successful exhibition, entitled 'Aurel Stein and the Silk Road: Hundred Years On', and was co-curated by the PI and members of the AHRC network from the British Library (International Dunhuang Project) and provided a powerful commentary on changing environmental conditions in the arid regions of Central Asia over the past century. The exhibition was open from the beginning of January to the end of March 2014 and received over 7,000 visitors. The visitor book was filled with positive comments. The network therefore brought to a significant public audience previously unknown images that provide an important message on environmental change.\n\nIn addition to above, it is anticipated that members of the network (which will continue to grow thanks partly to the newly-established interdisciplinary Travel Cultures Research Seminar series at the University of Nottingham) will formulate two new projects:\n\na) a travelling exhibition of newly commissioned artwork that will tour museums and libraries along Silk Road \nb) a research on environmentally and culturally sustainable tourism in relation to the UNESCO designated World Heritage Sites on the Silk Road.

The first worshop (Silk Roads I: Translation and Exchange) was held in September 2012 at Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery in connection in connection with a Living in Silk exhibition on the history of local textiles. The second workshop (Silk Roads II: Objects, Collections and Exhibitions) was held at the Royal Geographical Society in London in February 2013 in connection with an exhibition of the Society's artifacts on Silk Road travels and explorations. The third workshop (Silk Roads III: Travels, Texts and Images) was held at the University of Nottingham in September 2013. \n\nWhile we cannot claim to have any direct impact here, the AHRC research network was partially framed by the debates surrounding the international collaborations involved in the campaign to designate the Silk Road as a sequence of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a decision ratified in June 2014.\n\nAn additional outcome, not specified in the original application, but part funded by AHRC thanks to a short extension of the project, was a very successful photography exhibition at the Royal Geographical Society on 'Aurel Stein and the Silk Road: Hundred Years On', co-curated by the PI and members of the AHRC network from the British Library (International Dunhuang Project), based on 'then-and-now' photos from the IDP collection. The exhibition was open from the beginning of January to the end of March 2014 and received over 7,000 visitors and was much praised in visitor comments. \n\nThe developments of the project were:\n\n1. The establishment of new, on-going collaborations between museums, libraries and learned societies that have collections and materials relating to the history of the Silk Road that were previously unknown to each other. The specific examples are: the International Dunhuang Project in the British Library, the Royal Geographical Society in London and the Musee des Tissus et des Arts Decoratifs in Lyons.\n\n2. The active and on-going engagement of community arts organisations in framing academic research, including the Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art in Manchester. It is anticipated that these organisations will be pivotal involved in one of two follow-on research projects (see below).\n\n3. The organisation of the workshops also provided early career experience for one PhD student, funded by a supplementary award from the Centre for Advanced Studies at the University of Nottingham. 1. Academic: A PhD project, funded by ESRC, on geographies of translation in Central Asia began in October 2013 based directly on questions developed during the AHRC research workshops. The student (a French national) attended the final workshop in Nottingham and is currently using materials from several of the museums and libraries involved in the network, including the IDP in at the British Library.\n\n2. Academic: A new inter-disciplinary Travel Cultures Research Seminar series (TCRS) has been established at the University of Nottingham, jointly funded by the four Schools (Business, Cultures, Languages and Area Studies, Geography and History) which will run through the course of the current 2014-15 academic year, based on c. 8 research seminars by international speakers, including academics, artists, writers and representatives of the hospitality, tourism and leisure industries. This is intended further to develop the AHRC network with a view formulating new research projects (see below)\n \n3. Non-academic: members of the network are currently formulating a proposal to develop a small exhibition of contemporary artwork by six young artists from the UK, China and other countries that partially define themselves in relation to the Silk Road, the idea being to tour the exhibition through museums and libraries in five cities along the ancient route of the Silk Road.\n\n3. Non-academic: one of the objectives of the TCR series this year, which builds directly on the AHRC network, is to establish conversations with representatives from the hospitality, heritage, travel and tourism industries, including those who were involved in the AHRC workshops. The objective is to develop a new follow-up project on environmentally and culturally sustainable tourism in connection with the recently designated UNESCO World Heritage sites on the Silk Road.
