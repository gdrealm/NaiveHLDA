The mechanisms of protein export have been well characterised in the last 20 years. In contrast the import of proteins into bacterial cells from the outside is a rare event that is limited to colicins; protein antibiotics produced by bacteria to kill closely related species in order to gain a selective advantage. An example is colicin E9 which has a C-terminal cytotoxic domain that has deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity. If delivered into E.coli cells the DNase attacks and degrades their DNA in the cytoplasm and leads to cell death. The process by which the cytotoxic DNase domain is delivered from outside the cell into the cytoplasm is called translocation, and involves the interaction of the N-terminal translocation domain of colicin E9 with a number of E.coli proteins. The molecular details of how the protein-protein interactions involving the translocation domain result in the delivery of the DNase domain into the cytoplasm are poorly understood. This project aims to generate data so that better models of the translocation process can be formulated. Our proposed studies have potential implications in the development of new antibiotics and improving our understanding of the process by which complexes of proteins are formed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D016320/1","grantId":"BB/D016320/1","fundValue":"361865","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  James","coPersons":["Cristina  De Matteis","Jonas  Emsley","Christopher Neil Penfold"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
