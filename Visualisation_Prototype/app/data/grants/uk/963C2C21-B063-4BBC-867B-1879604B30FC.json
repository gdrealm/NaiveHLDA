{"id":"963C2C21-B063-4BBC-867B-1879604B30FC","title":"Vision-on: Staff Training Tool for the Prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections","abstractText":"Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) caused by pathogens (infectious agents) such as MRSA, Norovirus, and Clostridium Difficile are a substantial problem in developed and developing countries and within the NHS. In addition to the distress caused to patients who are infected, the cost of HAIs to acute services in NHS Scotland was estimated in the 2007 national prevalence survey at &pound;183 million. The World Health Organisation (2014) global surveillance report on antimicrobial resistance shows that &quot;a post-antibiotic era - in which common infections and minor injuries can kill - far from being an apocalyptic fantasy, is instead a very real possibility for the 21st Century&quot;. Within this ambit, work to prevent and control Healthcare Associated Infections can in no way rely solely on the production of new antibiotics. Rather, new thinking, new research and development, and new knowledge transfer activities are needed, drawing on knowledge from beyond traditional biomedical science. \n\nThe applicants' prior AHRC funded 'Visualising the Invisible' (vis-invis) project is a good example of the contribution that the arts and humanities can begin to make through relevant multidisciplinary working. The vis-invis project investigated ways of making pathogens 'visible' in the context of the hospital ward in a multi-disciplinary collaboration involving a team from design, art, nursing and clinical microbiology. In the study, the team explored conceptions and perceptions of pathogens in relation to clinical settings, and produced prototype digital visualisations which aimed to make the pathogens 'visible' in the context of the hospital ward. From this project, through a series of workshops with key stakeholders including infection control leads, nurses and domestic staff, one of the key findings was that the adaptation of the visualisations for use in training software for healthcare staff would have significant value. This was not foreseen at the outset of the project but emerge through the development of the prototypes and in response to feedback from the workshops. It was clear from these discussions that using the visualisations as part of training would extend the potential of this earlier work to impact in a timely and valuable way - especially given the current scale of the HAI problem and the threat of increasing resistance of pathogens to antibiotics. \n\nWorking with a leading UK commercial company in the area of infection control, which specialises in the manufacture of antimicrobial products and infection-control training, two NHS Trusts and a leading microbiology specialist, this follow-on project proposal will create a visual training application, running on a tablet device, which can innovatively exploit existing context-relevant data about the nature, location and prevalence of the pathogens associated with HAIs. The visualisations will make clear the direct relationship between the ward setting and the location, behaviour, causes of spread, and prevention of spread of pathogens. The NHS project partners will be closely involved in the specification, co-design, development and evaluation of the training tool to ensure it satisfies the requirements of current NHS training programmes and to maximise the opportunities for its adoption.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M00628X/1","grantId":"AH/M00628X/1","fundValue":"73300","fundStart":"2015-04-15","fundEnd":"2016-04-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alastair  Macdonald","coPersons":["Colin Neil Macduff","David William Loudon"],"organisation":"Glasgow School of Art","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
