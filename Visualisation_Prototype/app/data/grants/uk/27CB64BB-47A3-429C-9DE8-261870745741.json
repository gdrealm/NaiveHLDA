The sensing mechanisms are important as they allow an organism to realise that they are in new conditions and have to adjust things accordingly. That not only applies to conditions such as a change in temperature but also to attack by other organisms and chemical compounds. Changes in conditions require a response so that the organism can survive. In order to get that response we first need to detect the change and then send a message to the nucleus of the cell to allow it to make appropriate responses. We have found that a major energy compound, ATP, which is classically found within cells is also present outside of cells. When this is removed the plants die. When fungi attack plants they bring about cell death. However the mechanism by which death is actually brought about is not always the same. The fungus Fusarium kills plant cells by secreting a toxin Fumonisin B1 [FB1], however if the ATP out side of the cell [extracellular] is kept high the cells do not die. This has led us to the conclusion that extracellular ATP is essential for cells to live. Signalling in living organisms is known to be mediated by proteins. In this study we aim to look for the proteins involved in sensing extracellular ATP involved with keeping plant cells alive.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D015987/1","grantId":"BB/D015987/1","fundValue":"358621","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Antoni Ryszard Slabas","coPersons":["Josiah William Simon","Keith  Lindsey"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
