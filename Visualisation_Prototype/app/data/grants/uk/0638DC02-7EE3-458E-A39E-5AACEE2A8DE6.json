Severe, persistent fatigue is a key symptom of CFS and a major factor leading to loss of productivity in this illness. The cause of CFS and the underlying biological mechanisms of fatigue are poorly understood. As a result, accurate diagnosis of CFS can be difficult and effective treatment is not available. A growing body of evidence suggests that CFS may be linked to a faulty immune system. However, in what ways the immune system is not working properly is not clear. Therefore, by uncovering the abnormalities of the immune system in CFS in detail, it will help make the diagnosis of CFS easier and more accurate as well as give us clues to develop effective treatment of this condition.\n\nSince the diagnosis of CFS is unreliable at present, a group of &quot;CFS&quot; patients may in fact consist of individuals with different diseases. This presents a major obstacle to the progress of CFS research and may also explain why data from different CFS research studies are often conflicting. Therefore, in order to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms of CFS, a different approach is needed. Recent data show that intense fatigue is also a common symptom for many chronic conditions. Interestingly, most of these conditions are due to a faulty immune system. Furthermore, research also suggests that severe fatigue in these various conditions is driven by similar biological mechanisms. If so, we may be able to find out the underlying defects of the immune system causing disabling fatigue in CFS by using one of these chronic conditions as a disease model. This is precisely what we will do in this study. \n\nWe will carry out a comprehensive analysis of the immune system of a large number of patients with a condition called primary Sj&ouml;gren syndrome (PSS). We will analyze the data obtained from these experiments to ind out what abnormalities of the immune system are linked to fatigue. Since these experiments typically produce a vast amount of data, we will apply statistical methods and mathematical modelling specifically designed to analyse large volumes of biological data (known as bioinformatics and biostatistics) in order to identify the biological &quot;fingerprints&quot; of fatigue. We will then test whether these biological fingerprints of fatigue are present in CFS patients and whether it will help us to diagnose CFS more accurately.\n\nWe chose PSS as a disease model for several reasons. (i) PSS and CFS have many shared clinical and biological features including profound fatigue. (ii) Clinical samples from over 550 PSS patients across the UK, as well as their clinical data, are available for this study. Access to such samples is a distinct advantage because this is one of the largest clinical sample collections in PSS in the world. It would be time-consuming, labour-intensive and expensive if we had needed to collect the same amount of clinical samples and accompanied clinical data from fresh. (iii) There are well-established diagnostic criteria for PSS and so this avoids the problem of studying patients with potentially mixed diagnoses as in the case of studying CFS patients. \n\nAims of the study, potential applications and benefits:\nThe main objective of this study is to find the biological fingerprints of fatigue. By doing so, it will improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms of fatigue. The data will enable us to develop treatments for the fatigue that plagues so many patients with CFS and other chronic conditions. It will also help us to design a clinical test for the diagnosis of CFS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J002720/1","grantId":"MR/J002720/1","fundValue":"451573","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Wan-Fai  Ng","coPersons":["John Dudley Isaacs","Jennifer Susan Hallinan","David Emrys Jones","Daniel Christopher Swan","Colin Stevenson Gillespie","Anil  Wipat","Simon  Bowman","Elizabeth Jayne  Price","Julia Lindsey Newton"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
