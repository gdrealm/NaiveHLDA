Significant technological advances in the reduction of turbomachinery noise alone has been achieved over the last 20 years due to the implementation of advanced fan designs and the use of jet engines with ultra high bypass ratios. Because of these advances, airframe noise and non-traditional noise sources due to the engine installation effects are becoming a major limiting factor in the overall reduction of the aircraft noise. In turn, flap noise is a very important component of airframe noise for approach conditions and, as a recent experimental study demonstrated, the flap interaction with the jet can also produce very significant noise for take-off conditions. This puts the viability of many conventional aircraft, especially those with the engine-under-the-wing configuration, in jeopardy. At the same time, as recognised by the international aeroacoustic community, the mechanisms of flap noise still remain very poorly understood. In the new project, we will develop a new physically insightful method for understanding and predicting both broadband and tonal flap noise. In this work we will combine and extend the two models developed in the framework of two previous successful EPSRC-funded aeroacoustic projects into a new unified noise prediction scheme. This scheme will capture both the tonal and broadband noise components of the high-lift devices, such as wing flaps and flaperons and their interaction with the turbulent jet. The new model will have an exact match between the sound sources predicted by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools and far-field propagation using a mixture of mathematical modelling tools. Using the new model we will systematically study the mechanisms of flap noise and investigate the effect of control devices, such as porous flap edge surfaces and vortex generators installed on the flap trailing edge, on noise.This Project is a well-balanced combination of advanced numerical modelling, high performance computing and state-of-the art acoustic analysis methods. All investigators are experts in their fields - aeroacoustics, aerodynamics, turbulence modelling and numerical methods. Thus a strong side of the Project is its multi-disciplinary and collaborative nature that ensures synergy and cross-fertilisation of ideas and methods.The planned work has great environmental importance, aimed directly at improving the quality of people's lives in the vicinity of airports. It also has commercial importance, potentially safeguarding UK jobs in a high technology area, and its results will be of interest for the leading UK airspace industry such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce plc. This is because greater physical understanding and valuable predictive technology for acoustics design will be created. These should ultimately result in more environmentally friendly, and hence commercially competitive, aircraft that can be brought to the market more quickly and at lower cost. The research will be disseminated via publications in high-impact journals and presentations at key international conferences. The international collaborative context of this project enhances the potential dissemination paths. The projects results will be also disseminated through other specialist meetings, such as at Royal Society Meetings. In addition, a series of seminar talks will be arranged for to further disseminate the projects results in leading European aeroacoustics centres. The international collaborative context of this project will enhance the potential dissemination paths. It is also expected that the new highly trained computational fluid dynamicist/aerodynamicist/aeroacoustician produced in the project will be disseminating the post-project results in her/his further work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I017747/2","grantId":"EP/I017747/2","fundValue":"129166","fundStart":"2012-08-02","fundEnd":"2014-04-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used as a starting platform for three proposals with industry with the goal to develop new jet noise prediction capabilities for design optimisation studies.

This was made possible by us finding a new way how to effectively compress flow solutions in space and time by several orders of magnitude in comparison with the methods which were available before the start of this project. This allowed us to show that similar jet noise spectra at the far field can be created by completely different mechanisms of sound generation in the jet such as fluctuating velocity or temperature. We have also developed a new computational capability based on turbulent-eddy-resolving simulations and acoustic modelling which has been validated for sound predictions for a few jet-wing interaction problems of industrial relevance. These have lead to new collaborations including one SME and research proposals with industry involvement. We have developed a new method of looking into the origin of noise generated by turbulent flows at the root level which is tractable on a small-size computer cluster. This method can be used by researchers and industry for new fast-turn-around-time noise prediction schemes. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
