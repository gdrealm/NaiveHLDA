These infections have a major impact on animal health and cause considerable economic losses to the farming industry in the UK and globally. Antibiotics and vaccines are used to combat these infections but better methods of control are required because the incidence of antibiotic resistant strains is increasing and vaccines do not provide complete protection. The development of more efficient vaccines against M. haemolytica is urgently required but the mechanisms of pathogenesis of this pathogen are poorly understood and protective antigens are ill-defined. M. haemolytica consists of genetically distinct sub-populations that are specifically adapted to, and cause disease in, either cattle or sheep. Furthermore, bovine and ovine isolates have very different forms of a cell-surface protein (OmpA) which, in other bacterial species, is involved in adherence. These data suggest that the OmpA protein of M. haemolytica might be involved in adherence to the upper respiratory tract (URT) of cattle and sheep and play a role in host-adaptation. Pathogenic bacteria possess a wide range of virulence mechanisms but adherence to mucosal surfaces is the first critical stage in the disease process. If adherence can be blocked it should, in theory, be possible to prevent colonisation and progression to disease. Unfortunately, very little is known about the mechanisms used by M. haemolytica to adhere to the URT of cattle and sheep. A major reason for this is the unavailability of suitable laboratory methods that represent the tissues and physiological conditions of the bovine and ovine URT. It is very difficult and ethically unjustifiable to carry out experiments in live cattle and sheep. Recently, air-interface respiratory organ culture methods have been developed in other species which use tissue derived from the URT of dead animals and physiological conditions that are similar to those encountered in the living animal. This project proposes to use this technology to investigate the adherence of bovine and ovine M. haemolytica isolates to the URT of cattle and sheep and to study the role of OmpA in adherence and host-specificity. The specific aims and objectives of the project are as follows: (1) To characterise in detail the interactions between M. haemolytica and respiratory epithelium by using bovine and ovine air-interface respiratory organ culture models to investigate bacterial adherence and colonisation of the URT of cattle and sheep. Air-interface cultures will be established using tissue from different regions of the URT including the nasal cavity (turbinates), the nasopharynx (tonsils), and trachea and infected with a well-characterised pathogenic bovine and ovine field isolate. (2) To study the adherence of bovine and ovine M. haemolytica isolates to organ culture models representing different regions of the URT of cattle and sheep. In this way we will determine whether adherence of bovine and ovine M. haemolytica isolates to the URT occurs in a host-specific manner and contributes to host adaptation in this species. (3) To evaluate the role of the OmpA protein in the adherence of bovine and ovine M. haemolytica isolates to organ culture models of cattle and sheep. In this way we will test the hypothesis that OmpA has a ligand-like function, is involved in binding in a host-specific manner to the bovine and ovine URT, and plays a role in colonisation and host-specificity. The air-interface respiratory organ culture models developed during the course of the project have significant potential applications in the study of other pathogens of cattle and sheep. Therefore, the proposed project will lead to the more rapid progression not only of M. haemolytica research but also research in related fields. The wider use of these models will lead to a significant reduction in the use of cattle and sheep in animal experiments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D018021/1","grantId":"BB/D018021/1","fundValue":"240097","fundStart":"2007-01-02","fundEnd":"2010-02-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The project outputs had impact in the pasteurella microbiology community through generation of antibodies recognising key surface proteins of Mannheimia haemolytica and in animal research methods addressing the 3R's through generation and characterisation of new explant organ and cell culture models for Mannhemia.

These air interface respiratory organ cultures provide a physiological infection environment for the study of M. haemolytica pathogenesis: the full complement of host epithelial cells are present; the epithelium is maintained in air, rather than in submerged culture; epithelial physical defenses are intact and microbes must interact with the muco-ciliary system in order to successfully colonise; and the host response, characterized by increased mucus production, resembles that seen in vivo. The new infection model utilizes abattoir material and so addresses the 3Rs (see below). The air interface cultures are robust and remain in an overall physiologically-intact state for 48 h (bovine) and 72 h (ovine cultures) in culture. The models provide a reproducible infection model for virulent ovine and bovine isolates of M. haemolytica and show inoculum-dependent colonization and host response. The models show differences in regional colonization ability of M. haemolytica with greater colonization of nasal tissue than trachea and an associated greater host response to infection in nasal tissue compared to trachea. In summary, the air interface models developed in phase 1 provide a suitable model for studying M. haemolytica adhesion and colonisation for use in the Glasgow phase of the project (phases 2 and 3). Furthermore, the models are likely to be applicable to other bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens and to be useful to other researchers working in the field of respiratory microbial pathogenesis. \n\n\n\nPhases 2 and 3 (University of Glasgow)\n\nDevelopment of assays for preparation of bovine and ovine primary bronchial epithelial cells.\n\nOne of the primary goals of this project was to develop air-interface organ culture models of the bovine and ovine respiratory tracts. This was achieved in Phase 1 and the methods have been described above. However, limitations became apparent in these models when they were subsequently used at Glasgow to study the adherence of multiple isolates of M. haemolytica. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) consistently revealed little or no adherence of bacteria to the ciliated epithelia of bovine and ovine explants. However, M. haemolytica did trigger a substantial tissue response in the form of mucus production and migration of immune cells onto the epithelial surface. Thus, we concluded that M. haemolytica is effectively cleared by the mucociliary apparatus from the epithelial surface of healthy organ culture explants. In a keynote presentation at the International Pasteurellacea Conference in October 2008, Dr Charles Czuprynski presented evidence to show that M. haemolytica binds to cultured bovine primary bronchial epithelial cells. This work was subsequently published (Kisiela and Czuprynski, Infect. Immun. 2009; 77, 446-55). In light of the above work and our inability to demonstrate adherence of M. haemolytica to the bovine and ovine organ culture models by SEM, we decided to adopt the use of primary bronchial epithelial cells. We subsequently not only demonstrated that M. haemolytica adheres to bovine and ovine primary bronchial epithelial cells but also showed, for the first time, that this pathogen forms biofilms on these cells. Thus, in addition to developing air-interface organ culture models, we have also developed methodology for recovering and maintaining cultured bovine and ovine primary bronchial epithelial cells. We believe that this latter approach not only complements the air-interface organ culture models but also provides a more useful and user-friendly method for studying the molecular basis of pathogen-host interactions of M. haemolytica with the bovine and ovine respiratory tracts. A significant advantage of this approach is that large numbers of epithelial cells can be propagated from the bronchus of a single animal and the cells stored for future experiments. Many more experiments can be performed with cells derived from a single animal and animal-animal variation reduced.\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction of anti-OmpA1 and -OmpA2 antibodies\n\nA major focus of this project (Phase 3) was to investigate the role of OmpA in adherence and, more specifically, to establish its role, if any, in the specificity of host-pathogen interactions. We produced recombinant proteins representing the two major forms of OmpA (OmpA1 and OmpA2) that are associated with bovine and ovine isolates, respectively. The recombinant proteins were purified by affinity- and gel-filtration chromatography and refolded. Anti-OmpA1 and anti-OmpA2 antibodies were produced and affinity purified; Western-blotting confirmed the specificity of these antibodies. We aimed to determine (a) the surface-exposure of the OmpA proteins and (b) the specificity of the anti-OmpA1 and -OmpA2 antibodies towards bovine (OmpA1) and ovine (OmpA2) isolates, respectively, before using them in adherence inhibition assays. In particular, we were concerned that access to OmpA might be blocked by the surrounding capsule. The surface-exposure of OmpA and specificity of the anti-OmpA antibodies were examined by immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy. We demonstrated that OmpA is indeed surface-exposed under normal laboratory growth conditions and that OmpA1 and OmpA2 contain unique epitopes (located in the surface-exposed loops) that might play a role in host-specific adherence mechanisms. These antibodies can be used to further explore the role of OmpA in the interaction of M. haemolytica with the bovine and ovine respiratory tracts.\n\n\n\nAnimal research outputs: 3R's\n\nThe development of methods that are either not available or not well characterized (e.g. the air-interface organ culture and primary bronchial epithelial cell culture methods developed in this project) to investigate the interactions of M. haemolytica with the bovine and ovine respiratory tracts should stimulate further research to better understand the molecular pathogenesis of this important pathogen. Adherence and colonization of the respiratory tract is the first step in the disease process. Identification of the molecules and mechanisms involved in these processes will allow the development of strategies designed to interfere with and block these initial stages in disease. Furthermore, the development of these methods can be applied to studies of other veterinary respiratory tract pathogens that infect host species other than cattle and sheep. For example, at Glasgow we are also studying Pasteurella multocida which causes economically-important infections of cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. These technologies can also be applied to the study of viral infections and extended to studies of the human respiratory tract. The outputs from the project overall may have indirect animal welfare benefits through contribution to a better understanding of M. haemolytica pathogenesis and potentially providing possibilities for clinical intervention from follow-on projects. The outputs of this research may also indirectly lead to improved animal welfare involving other pathogens and animal species.\n\nThe outputs of this project (development and characterization of new, in vitro respiratory infection models) will make a significant contribution to the 3Rs through reduction, refinement and replacement of experimental animals for the study of M. haemolytica pathogenesis. The tissues used to generate the new models (both the air-interface organ culture and primary bronchial epithelial cell culture models) are harvested from commercial abattoirs and thus make use of offal by-products of the slaughter process. The air-interface respiratory organ culture models provide a highly physiological infection environment for the study of M. haemolytica pathogenesis and represent a significant advancement over current, existing in vitro infection models. The models allow study of microbial interaction with the host respiratory epithelium in a near-physiological manner: the bacteria must interact with, and overcome, the intact muco-ciliary system of the air interface organ culture models, events resembling those of the natural infection. The models show regional anatomical differences in the ability of bacteria to colonise, a significant advantage over other in vitro infection systems, and, again, a feature that resembles the situation in natural infection. Furthermore, the host reaction to infection, characterized by increased mucus production, observed in the new model system resembles that seen in the in vivo situation. The primary bronchial epithelial cell culture model provides a complementary approach that has a number of advantages over the organ culture model (e.g. less labour-intensive, greater reproducibility, more suitable for biological assays).\n\n \n\nTogether, the air-interface organ culture and primary bronchial epithelial cell culture models can be expected to contribute to each of the 3Rs as follows:\n\nReduction. The models will allow reduction of the numbers of experimental animals used for respiratory microbial pathogenesis studies by enabling screens to be carried out in vitro, thus informing the design of later, definitive animal experiments. Examples of the primary screens that would be highly appropriate for these new models include (i) screening of libraries of wild-type isolates for ability to adhere and colonise respiratory epithelium and/or ability to induce host epithelial pathology and pathological responses to infection; and (ii) screening of microbial mutants for altered colonization competence and epithelial pathogenicity.\n\nRefinement. The models will also allow refinement of animal experiments by establishing infection kinetics in vitro and allowing detailed time-courses to be carried out allowing the timings of key events in pathogenesis to be determined, thus informing the design of experiments involving animals.\n\nReplacement. Whilst air interface respiratory organ cultures cannot completely replace the use of experimental animals for studying respiratory microbial pathogenesis, they will allow replacement of animals for studying certain aspects of respiratory pathogenesis, specifically host epithelial adherence, colonization and host epithelial responses to infection. These aspects of infection can arguably be studied in greater detail using the infection models than in animals since large numbers of replicates can easily be used and detailed time-courses with many time points can be studied: interrogation that would be difficult to justify in live animals. There is limited potential for use in a non-academic, non-commercial context because the models and reagents generated have a specific role in microbial pathogenesis studies and are applicable to basic science approaches to the study of Pasteurellaceae infections and possibly to vaccine and novel therapy development. The outputs of the work have potential for commercial exploitation in vaccine development and for in vitro screening of antimicrobial compounds for therapy of Pasteurellaceae infections. Dr Davies did have preliminary discussions with pharmaceutical companies along these lines towards the end of the project but the opportunities were not developed further by the companies concerned.
