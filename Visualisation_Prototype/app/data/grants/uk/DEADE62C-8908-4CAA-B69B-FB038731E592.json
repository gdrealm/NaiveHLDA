The virus can evade our immune system as a result of its segmented genome, its ability to reassort in various species (e.g. man, pig, duck), its high mutation rate, its ecological niche in nearly all aquatic birds and its ability to subvert various aspects of our innate immunity. Groups at risk from the virus include the very young and very old, pregnant women, the immunocompromised and those with a chronic underlying cardio-pulmonary disease. Vaccines remain the cornerstone of protection, although have only 30-50% efficacy in the elderly. Seasonal vaccination affords reasonable protection (although recent vaccines have reported effectiveness of 25% or less against circulating H3N2 viruses), but would have no effect on a new pandemic strain if one was to emerge - and history tells us this is more likely than not. New vaccines take several months to develop and to generate sufficient stocks to treat whole populations. \n\nThe emergence and threat of the avian H5N1 virus in 2005 led several governments to invest huge funds (particularly in the US where President Bush committed &gt;$7billion) to develop new vaccine technologies, new therapeutics and to stockpile influenza neuraminidase inhibitors, particularly oseltamivir (Tamiflu, Roche), although zanamivir (Relenza, GSK) was also stockpiled by several countries: the UK spent &pound;500M on Tamiflu. Overuse of drugs can elicit resistance, and this was clearly evident in the 2008-2009 season when nearly all circulating H1N1 seasonal strains became resistant to Tamiflu. The currently circulating H3N2 and swine H1N1 viruses appear susceptible to both Tamiflu and Relenza, but resistance could easily arise in the future. There are now great efforts to develop novel vaccines, some of which are claimed to be 'universal' against all strains, and to develop novel therapeutics against several proteins of the influenza virus. The ever-changing virus may become resistant to these new thrapeutics in time.\n\nOur approach is to target the host rather than the virus. The influenza virus binds to the carbohydrate sialic acid that decorates the surface of most mammalian cells. We have used genetic engineering to create proteins that contain several copies of a small protein domain (CBM) that binds to sialic acid. Multivalency enables us to achieve high binding affinity, such that a protein with six CBM modules binds 10,000 times more tightly than a single CBM module. We have shown that these multivalent proteins can be administered intranasally in a single dose to mice and protect them from a lethal challenge with swine H1N1 influenza virus. The treated mice are healthy, gain weight and show no clinical symptoms. Most importantly, as well as surviving a lethal challenge with virus, the mice mount an immune response to the virus meaning that they would be able to face a subsequent challenge from the same virus. We therefore believe we have developed a novel therapeutic (or protein biologic) that has potential as a prophylactic against any strain of the influenza virus that may emerge, as the virus is unlikely to shift the receptor it uses to gain access to cells. \n\nOur studies will continue to involve mouse experiments at the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh and at St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis. St Jude has one of the World Health Organisation's collaborating laboratories on influenza, headed by Robert Webster FRS, one of the world's top influenza experts. We are now focusing on our two lead biologics that both contain six copies of the sialic acid-binding CBM. The aims and objectives of this new application, a 1 year extension to our current 2 year MRC DPFS grant, is to examine several aspects of the two lead biologics through in vivo studies in mice and ferrets, and through in vitro studies using a cilliated cell line derived from the human epithelial airway.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L012847/1","grantId":"MR/L012847/1","fundValue":"365031","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Garry  Taylor","coPersons":["Bernadette Mary Dutia","Helen  CONNARIS","Anthony  Nash"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
