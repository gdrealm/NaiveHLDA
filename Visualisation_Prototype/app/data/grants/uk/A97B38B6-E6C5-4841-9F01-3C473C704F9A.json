In developing countries, boys tend to be favoured in access to schooling and health care. Women earn less than men and women also work longer hours than men. What are not understood so clearly however are the critical factors for determining resource allocation within the home.</p>\n\n<p>Using experiments, surveys and ethnographic interviews across selected countries we aim to test theories of how resources get allocated within households. We have brought together a team of development experts, anthropologists and experimental economists and, as part of our preparation for this funding, we have already conducted a successful pilot experiment in Uganda.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the research, we anticipate a clearer picture of how efficiency and perceptions of fairness determine household allocation. But we also aim to provide evidence on the value of experiments in a development context. This is an issue that has not received much critical attention despite the increasing popularity of experiments in development studies. Our work will therefore inform policy-makers seeking a clearer understanding of intra-household decision-making for households living in poverty, as well as those seeking guidance on the value of experiments in a development context.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0251-A","grantId":"RES-167-25-0251-A","fundValue":"503321","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alistair  Munro","coPersons":["Nitya  Rao","Bereket  Kebede","Arjan  Verschoor","Cecile  Jackson","Vegard  Iversen"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" 1. Household decision-making is inefficient and inefficient in predictable ways. In all sites and all experimental treatments, couples rarely make the decisions that would maximise the rewards for the household as a whole. \n\n\n\n2. Household efficiency varies systematically with whether husbands and wives earn their incomes, whether the husband or the wife is in charge of household finances, and household structure (e.g. polygamy).\n\n\n\n3. Cultural norms about marriage are associated both with household efficiency and inequality of intra-household allocation, suggesting the importance for economists to take culture into account when they devise household models and that the search for a universal model of the household, common in economics, is inappropriate  ","dataset":"gtr"}
