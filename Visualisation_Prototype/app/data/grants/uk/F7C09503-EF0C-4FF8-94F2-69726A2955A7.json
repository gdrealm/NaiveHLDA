The solutionwill be based upon a multidisciplinary approach combining expertise in thesynthesis of novel tailor-made macrocyclic compounds (reporter materials),formulation of lipid bilayer membranes within a robust self-assembled organicfilm, high sensitive optical registration of surface/analyte interaction andall optical sensor interrogation methods. Fundamental investigations intochemical and engineering sciences will be targeted to meet the end users'specifications and the original scientific and engineering knowledge in thesensor technology will form the basis of a further technology transferprogramme into developing a marketable product by industrial collaborators. Itis important that any developed sensor is shown to be robust and fit forpurpose and instant feedback is essential for security alert. Minimalmaintenance requirements are to be achieved for commercially viable replacementof current practices. The detection limit should also be three orders ofmagnitude better than the ppm range capability of existing technologies.A common case for support is being submitted by QMUL and UEA.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E028446/1","grantId":"EP/E028446/1","fundValue":"210934","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Provided groundwork for materials development for thin-film formulation of FET-type devices.

Sensor behaviour was monitored, along with fundamental molecular electronic behaviour. Again, the chemistry developed feeds directly into diverse programs. In particular it has led to alternative sensor designs, but also has potential to form the design framework for high-value components in organic electronics devices. This work led to materials and design strategies that are more widely applicable - most notably in light-harvesting systems and molecular electronics Chemicals,Electronics,Environment,Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
