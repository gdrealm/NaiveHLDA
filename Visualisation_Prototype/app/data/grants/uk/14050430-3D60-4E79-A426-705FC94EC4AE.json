The properties of synapses differ between cells and between parts of the brain and they can adapt over short or longer terms to modulate the strength and pattern of information transmission. Longer term changes in the strength of transmission are thought to provide a storage mechanism for learning and the process of learning may, in turn, help to sculpt patterns of information flow between networks of cells and between different structures in the brain. Understanding how synapses work, and how they can be modified, is fundamental to our understanding how the brain works and this, in turn, is an essential starting point for repairing brain function when it is damaged through injury or disease. In this proposal, we aim to generate strains of mice that have been genetically modified to express proteins that are fluorescent. These fluorescent proteins can be visualised microscopically and they alter their properties under different pH environments. By attaching these artificial proteins to natural protein structures that are involved in cell signalling and plasticity, we intend to develop methods that allow the real time visualisation of aspects of synaptic transmission, plasticity and communication in living brain cells. In the cerebellum, part of the brain necessary for the execution of skilled movement, information is transmitted from granule cells to Purkinje cells. Purkinje cells provide the sole output from this part of the brain and they are largely responsible for processing the information that enters the cerebellum. Activity within Purkinje cells triggers substantial increases in intracellular calcium, a chemical essential for cell signalling and plasticity. Calcium increases are accompanied by an acidification of the cell. By incorporating a fluorescent protein based pH sensor selectively into Purkinje cells, we aim to generate mice in which the activity of Purkinje cells can be directly visualised. We will then use brain slices prepared from these mice to evaluate how different patterns of neuronal input to the cerebellum are processed and passed on within this model network. Communication at a synapse requires the release of a chemical transmitter that diffuses across the synaptic space between the two cells and acts on a receptor present in the post-synaptic membrane to produce a response. Long-term changes in the strength of signalling between cells are thought to arise, in many cases, by either an increase or a decrease in the number of receptors present in the post-synaptic membrane. The movement of a receptor from the synaptic cleft to the inside of the cell (down-regulation) or vice verse (up-regulation), is accompanied by a sharp change in pH from the alkaline extracellular surface to the acidic inside of a transport vesicle. By tagging specific receptors expressed by Purkinje cells with a fluorescent protein pH sensor, we aim to develop mice in which we can directly visualise the movement of receptors to and from the membrane under conditions thought to produce learning. Brain slices derived from these mice will be used to examine the input conditions that produce changes in the number of receptors at a synapse and hence the strength of synaptic transmission within this part of the central nervous system. These mice will provide valuable tools to the research community and if successful, provide proof of concept for the development of other probes with uses in other parts of the brain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E001246/1","grantId":"BB/E001246/1","fundValue":"340487","fundStart":"2007-05-28","fundEnd":"2010-11-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The purpose of this application was to develop ways of visualizing synaptic transmission using novel fluorescent protein sensors that we developed. This has led to several publications as well as leading to the production of a transgenic mouse model that is currently being used for a related grant that is ongoing (BB/K008382/1 ). The sensors that we have developed have been shared with other groups but the main development, that goes beyond the academic impact of our publications, is with the new transgenic mouse model. This model is very useful because it allows observation of calcium signalling in presynaptic terminals. This is very hard to do using standard imaging techniques but we can not only do this easily, we can do it in aged tissue allowing us to examine the effects of calcium homeostasis in young, middle aged and elderly mouse models.
