People with caste backgrounds which used to be referred to as 'Untouchable' form roughly 20% of India's population. The term 'Dalit' (meaning 'broken' or 'crushed' in Marathi) has been chosen by 'Untouchables' themselves as a nom de guerre. Dalit literature with its representation and assertion of subaltern cultures is the most significant development in Indian literature in the last three decades, but this unique literary corpus has not yet received the international recognition it deserves. \n\nDespite the fact that the 1950 constitution of independent India abolished Untouchability, discrimination against people of untouchable caste backgrounds has continued, validated by Hinduism. Inspired by the political activism that challenged the discrimination on the grounds of caste in Maharashtra in the 1970s, Dalit writer-activists developed a highly politicised literature in the vernacular language of Marathi. This set the precedent for the emergence of other regional Dalit literatures in vernacular Indian languages such as Tamil in Tamil Nadu, Malayalam in Kerala, Telugu in Andhra Pradesh, Kannada in Karnataka and Hindi. Dalit literature is often highly innovative in its form, narrative perspective and use of language but so far only the work of a few Dalit authors has been translated into English and other European languages.\n\nThis project, undertaken under the aegis of Nottingham Trent University's Centre for Postcolonial Studies, will open up an international dialogue on hitherto unresearched dimensions of Dalit literature. Even when studied in India by critics familiar with the original language of Dalit writing, the analysis of the literary quality of Dalit literature has been neglected; instead it has been almost exclusively explored from a sociological and historical perspective. This project aims to produce a network whose research outputs contextualise Dalit literary texts in order to make them accessible to a wider audience, but also analyse them as literary artefacts, drawing on the methods of literary criticism and postcolonial and feminist theory. Academic postcolonial literature courses increasingly include course texts in translation but rarely from Dalit literature because academic studies do not exist that specifically enable the non-expert to engage with these texts. This project, with its varied research output, intends to close this gap. \n\nThe grant will fund a series of conferences, workshops and other events that are exclusively dedicated to the analysis of this exciting and previously almost 'invisible' literature outside of India. The project will thus establish an international dialogue between key researchers in the areas of Dalit literature, foster the close collaboration of UK and European academics working in the field of literary and cultural studies with Indian scholars researching in this field and cultivate contacts with authors, translators and publishers of Dalit literature. \n\nThis project will produce several published research outputs, such as a multi-contributor volume and several articles in peer-reviewed journals, thus allowing non-experts in South Asian Studies, researchers in literary studies, students and the public to engage with this work, which tends to be produced in vernacular Indian languages for a regional audience. These outputs are aimed at sustaining the network and drawing attention to and discussing this wealth of literary material that has been largely neglected outside of India and thereby contributing to a dialogue with previously marginalised cultures and communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L013509/1","grantId":"AH/L013509/1","fundValue":"35886","fundStart":"2014-06-02","fundEnd":"2016-06-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicole W.
