The order book for shipbuilding in India has a nine-fold increase in just four years. India has been building merchant ships as well as ships and submarines for the navy and continuously improving their designs as well as analysis capabilities and modernising their ship production equipment and methods. Parallel with this increasing shipbuilding activity in India Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering Departments in the country have been active in research to improve the hydrodynamic design of ships and to investigate the use of alternative fuel with a view to reducing ship emissions. The results of the research support the shipyards in the country with retrofitting the existing vessels to lower emissions or with new designs that will have low emission characteristics. Until the late 20th century, ship breaking took place in port cities of industrialised countries such as UK and USA. Today, most ship breaking yards are in Alang in India, Chittangong in Bangladesh, Aliaga in Turkey and near Karachi in Pakistan due to lower labour costs and less stringent environmental regulations dealing with the disposal of lead paint, and other toxic substances. China used to be an important player in the 1990's. It is now trying to reposition itself in more environmentally friendly industries. Ship breaking can occur in a wide variety of facilities. They range from advanced sites like Van Heyghen Recycling and other Green Ship Recycling approved facilities in industrialised ports, to low tech facilities such as at Alang, India. At present the only truly environmentally correct option is the use of Green Ship Recycling at approved facilities. These facilities can recover up to 99% of the ship's materials and correctly process hazardous waste substances.The proposed trip will provide and excellent opportunity to collaborate and expand our knowledge further on the Indian shipping industry and its research and educational needs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I012311/1","grantId":"EP/I012311/1","fundValue":"5276","fundStart":"2010-09-14","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Atilla  Incecik","coPersons":["Purnendu Kumar Das"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
