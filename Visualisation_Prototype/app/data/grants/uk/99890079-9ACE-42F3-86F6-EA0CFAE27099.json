{"id":"99890079-9ACE-42F3-86F6-EA0CFAE27099","title":"MRC CLASICC Trial - extension of follow-up and adhesion sub-study","abstractText":"The MRC CLASICC Trial aims to compare standard open surgery with laparoscopic (key-hole) surgery for the treatment of colorectal cancer. As well as examining the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic surgery, the cost of the two techniques and patients quality of life are also being compared. 794 patients were recruited to the trial between July 1996 and July 2002 from 27 hospitals. Information collected up to 3 months after patients operations has shown no differences between the two techniques, but we need to collect information for a longer period of time in order to confirm this. Currently, we collect information up to three years after surgery and we would like to extend this to seven years after surgery for all patients in the trial. \n\nFollowing bowel surgery, some patients may experience a complication known as adhesion formation, which can cause an obstruction in the bowel and may require further surgery. It is thought that this problem may not occur as often following laparoscopic surgery than following open surgery. This needs to be confirmed by carrying out some more research to find out how often adhesions occur after bowel surgery and whether there is any difference following open and laparoscopic operations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9328312","grantId":"G9328312","fundValue":"1001460","fundStart":"1996-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Pierre John Guillou","coPersons":["Joanne  Walker","Julia  Brown","Philip  Quirke","Helen  Thorpe"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
