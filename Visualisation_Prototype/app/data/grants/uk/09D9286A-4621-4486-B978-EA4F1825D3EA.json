Unusually for bacteria, they exhibit a complex differentiating life-cycle that has implications for antibiotic production. Due to their importance, the BBSRC and Wellcome Trust funded the complete genome sequencing of the model species S. coelicolor. As a consequence, we know this bacterium possesses about 8000 genes. However, as yet we only understand the biological function of a small proportion of these genes. Understanding gene function is important as it enables us to learn more about the biology of Streptomyces and, in particular, the complexities of the regulation of antibiotic production and differentiation. In addition, S. coelicolor is a genetically tractable model to understand conserved processes it shares with important human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A critical aspect of understanding gene function is the creation of mutants in which a specific gene is no longer active. By comparing characteristics of the mutant with those of a non-mutant, it is possible to learn about the function of the gene in question. The proposed research intends to complete the construction of a versatile resource that is currently being used by researchers worldwide to create specific gene mutations in S. coelicolor. This resource is made by insertion of a 'jumping gene' or transposon into the DNA sequence of each S. coelicolor gene. These insertions are made in gene copies cloned in a cosmid library: this library was used to obtain the S. coelicolor genome sequence. So for each original cosmid carrying approximately 30 contiguous genes, we construct a sub-library consisting of individual cosmids each carrying an individual insertion in each gene. With access to these mutant cosmids, researchers can easily construct a S. coelicolor mutant defective in a gene of interest. Information on the systematic cosmid mutagenesis programme is accessible to any researcher via an online database, allowing them to select and order specific mutant cosmids for their own use. In addition, we will ourselves use the resource to investigate in more detail how Streptomyces adapt to the varying moisture content of their natural environment. This itself impacts on the life-cycle and antibiotic production.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E019242/1","grantId":"BB/E019242/1","fundValue":"218565","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Dyson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
