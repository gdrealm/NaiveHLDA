They are considering the feasibility of using fresh ideas, generated by an examination of policy and practice in North America and Western Europe, to initiate innovative practice and policy that will boost the production of affordable housing for rent in the UK. The research is building on previous research into housing supply overseas by CCHR. &nbsp;There is an emphasis on financial incentives to boost housing construction for affordable rented housing in the USA and France (although incentives in other countries are also being considered). </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The lesson learning from experience overseas is being addressed through a series of discussions, presentations and seminars involving PfP staff and other stakeholders including housing organisations and government departments. The target audience for the research is non-academic stakeholders in the private, public and civil society sectors. It will thus be of relevance to a range of housing producers, including private firms and housing associations. It will furthermore have significant implications for government policy towards housing production.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K007564/1","grantId":"ES/K007564/1","fundValue":"58980","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael John Oxley","coPersons":["Joanna  Richardson","Timothy John Brown","Ros  Lishman"],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
