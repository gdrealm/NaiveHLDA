However, the specific biological function of DR3 has remained obscure. Our preliminary research has identified a role for DR3 in the development and function of CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells represent one of the cytotoxic arms of the immune response, generating cells that kill virus-infected and cancerous targets. CD8+ T cells can also be responsible for autoimmunity when their regulation is disrupted. This project is designed to define the role played by DR3 in CD8+ T cell function. In so doing, we may learn how to manipulate the CD8+ T cell response, which is a major target for immunotherapies against virus infections, cancers and autoimmune disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300180","grantId":"G0300180","fundValue":"643575","fundStart":"2004-08-17","fundEnd":"2009-12-16","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Eddie Chung Wang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Wales College of Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
