The use of complex statistics, computational resources and genetic information has greatly facilitated our understanding of human disease. For Africa to fully benefit from the technological advances in computing and ways to store and manage &quot;big scientific data&quot;, we will need to ensure that African researchers have access to such resources locally. As part of an international collaboration, we aim to build a computational network and resource in Uganda, and train the next generation of African computer scientists as part of this initiative. This project will help facilitate our understanding on diseases in Africa and also provide a way to assess changes in the prevalence of these diseases, including HIV and other chronic diseases such as diabetes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_EX_MR/L016273/1","grantId":"MC_EX_MR/L016273/1","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2019-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Pontiano  Kaleebu","coPersons":["Dominic Peter Kwiatkowski","Gordon  Dougan","Nicholas John Wareham","Paul  Kellam","Manjinder  Sandhu"],"organisation":"MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit on AIDS","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
