This it has achieved with outstanding success. Subsequent to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, launched by the Prime Minister in November 2008, Professor Sir Michael Marmot was invited by the Secretary of State for Health to undertake a national review of the evidence. The Marmot Commission, due to report early in 2010, will propose the most effective strategies for reducing health inequalities in England from 2010 on. \n\nOur current proposal marks a change of direction for the study, namely to combine our existing wealth of data on social inequalities and chronic disease with new clinical measures of cognitive function, mental disorders and physical functioning to build Whitehall II into a world-class, interdisciplinary study of ageing. Ageing is not characterised by universal decline, rather variations in the speed of ageing result in people of the same age becoming increasingly dissimilar in terms of cognitive, mental and physical health and functioning over time. Using existing self-reported measures we have shown physical functioning to decline faster with age in low socioeconomic groups, suggesting that inequalities in functioning will become an important public health issue as the population ages. Understanding the causes of this age-related individual heterogeneity and its distribution by social group will be the core focus of our future work. By the proposed next medical screening, our eleventh wave of data collection, Whitehall II will be optimal for studying outcomes in the elderly. Ninety percent of participants will be 65+, more than 30% 75-85, and our data will span an age range of 50 years. In addition to providing insights into individual and social difference in the development of frailty, disability, dependence, and dementia, our work will enable the determination of optimal time windows and targets for interventions that lower risk and optimise healthy-ageing and independent living.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902037","grantId":"G0902037","fundValue":"2100000","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Gideon Marmot","coPersons":["Mika  Kivimaki","Tarani  Chandola","Eric John Brunner","Martin John Shipley","Annie Rebecca Britton","Archana  Singh-Manoux","Jennifer Anne Head","Aroon Dinesh Hingorani"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
