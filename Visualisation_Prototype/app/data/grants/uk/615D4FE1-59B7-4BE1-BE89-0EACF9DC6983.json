{"id":"615D4FE1-59B7-4BE1-BE89-0EACF9DC6983","title":"High specificity test media for chemical warfare agents (CWAs) and toxic industrial chemicals (TICs)","abstractText":"We have developed unique, highly-specific tests for the detection of chemical warfare agents(CWAs) and toxic industrial chemicals (TICs). Their strengths are they: (1) display no false positives; (2) are highly sensitive; (3) are effective for volatile/ non-volatile CWAs; (4) are inexpensive; (5) require no power source; (6) work non-destructively on sensitive substrates (e.g. skin, clothing, electronics); and (7) require minimal training. We will collaborate with GE Healthcare to develop a simple, integrated swab and test-paper kits to provide a definitive, cost-effective means for the rapid, on-site detection of CWAs. The system will be suitable for civilian and military end-users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I500235/1","grantId":"EP/I500235/1","fundValue":"102213","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Commercialization of chemical warfare agent sensors Aerospace, Defence and Marine Economic","person":"Ian Andrew  Fallis","coPersons":["Ian Rhys Morgan"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
