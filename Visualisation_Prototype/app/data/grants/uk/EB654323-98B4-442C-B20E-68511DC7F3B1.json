This was achieved through a week-long residential training workshop for early career researchers to share skills and build relationships, and the formation of a long-term support network.</p>\n\n<p>The training workshop was held at the University of Edinburgh.&nbsp;Thirty early career researchers and PhD students attended from Chile, Australia, USA, Canada, Germany and the UK. Invited experts&nbsp;- people working on the boundary between the arts and academia&nbsp;- presented their work and led practical sessions. The training covered working with narrative, sound art techniques, film, site-specific work, video analysis, sound walking and relevant theory. Participants went on short field trips around the city and spent time doing their own small projects. Evening social activities allowed friendships to form. The atmosphere was vibrant and convivial, with a strong sense of shared enthusiasm.</p>\n\n<p>After the workshop, an Experimental Research Network was set up, operating primarily through an email list, to sustain and build on the connections made at the workshop. This now includes 220 subscribers across the globe. The list is used to publicise experimental research events, projects and opportunities, and to share advice.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-810-21-0025","grantId":"RES-810-21-0025","fundValue":"31954","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael David Gallagher","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
