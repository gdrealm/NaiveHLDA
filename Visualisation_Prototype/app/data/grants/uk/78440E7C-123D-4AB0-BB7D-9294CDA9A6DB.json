{"id":"78440E7C-123D-4AB0-BB7D-9294CDA9A6DB","title":"The University of Manchester S Gaskell","abstractText":"Our overall aim in proposing the Manchester Discipline Bridging Initiative is to ensure maximum opportunity and delivery of cross-disciplinary thought and research across the University of Manchester, leading to innovative advances that would not arise from within single disciplines alone. To do this we will:\n\n1. Build upon the current strong cross-disciplinary ethos of the University.\n\n2. Establish a programme of activities (including a cross-disciplinary seminar/workshop programme and ?sandpit? discussion fora) designed further to raise awareness of cross-disciplinary opportunities in the University by involving clinicians, life scientists, physical scientists, engineers, and social scientists.\n\n3. Provide funds to promote new discipline-bridging research projects, using mechanisms that will include pump-priming of new projects, support of targeted temporary staff transfers between Schools and Institutes, and funding of Visiting Researchers to establish new areas. \n\nIn the first instance, the MDBI will be focused around three of the University?s most significant areas of cross-disciplinary research excellence: Systems Biology and Medicine; Neuroscience and Imaging; and Tissues Regeneration and Biomaterials.\n\nThe University of Manchester, formed in October 2004, is now the largest in the UK by many measures and is explicitly committed to promoting and supporting cross-disciplinary research through a range of newly developed mechanisms. These make the University very well suited to carrying forward the programme of activities set out in the MDBI proposal and to ensure that significant added value results from this. \n\nOverall research strategy of the new University, including the promotion of cross-disciplinary work, is developed by a Group chaired by the Vice President for Research (Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell) and comprising the Associate Deans for Research from each of the University?s four faculties. The Associate Vice President for Research, Professor Simon Gaskell, is also a key member of this Group and will be the MDBI Research Facilitator. This will ensure that the MDBI is placed at the heart of the University?s research decision making and strategic planning structure.\n\nThe University statutes specifically include the formation of Research Institutes spanning disciplines and faculties. Six have now been established, including the Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre, the Neuroscience Research Institute, and the Photon Science Institute. The University has also established cross-disciplinary initiatives in Imaging Sciences, Tissue Regeneration, and Integrated Bioinformatics and Health Informatics and is developing less formal Research Networks to promote the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas, and the development of collaborative programmes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0502255","grantId":"G0502255","fundValue":"365554","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon James  GaskellNancy Jane Rothwell","coPersons":["Timothy  Hardingham","Karl  Herholz","Douglas Bruce Kell","Philip  Baker","Nicola  Tirelli","Brian  Derby","C  Taylor"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
