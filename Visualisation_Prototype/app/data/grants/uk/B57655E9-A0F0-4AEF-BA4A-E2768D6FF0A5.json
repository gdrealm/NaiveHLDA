The project discusses the relevance of Nietzsche's conception of economics to his treatment of central philosophical themes, such as temorality, community, society, subjectivity, ethics, power and human nature. Sedgwick thereby seeks to show how understanding Nietzsche's deployment of economic concepts forms the basis for an interpretation of the politics of his thought.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112705/1","grantId":"112705/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-03-07","fundEnd":"2006-07-06","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Sedgwick","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
