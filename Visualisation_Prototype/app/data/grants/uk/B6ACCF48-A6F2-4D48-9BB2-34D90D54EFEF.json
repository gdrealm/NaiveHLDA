{"id":"B6ACCF48-A6F2-4D48-9BB2-34D90D54EFEF","title":"Fluid Expansion As Supportive Therapy in critically ill African children (FEAST)","abstractText":"FEAST trial is a large randomised controlled trial in African children with severe illness examining whether the addition of rapid fluid infusion at hospital admission to standard case management improves survival compared to standard management alone. \nIn sub-Saharan Africa case fatality rates in hospital for severe infections in children remains at 15-30%. In this region well over a million children die of severe infection in hospital each year. Currently, antimalarial and antimicrobial drugs are the mainstay of treatment, however most deaths occur early, due to the complications of severe illness, and before definitive treatments have time to act. In this situation doctors have to rely upon supportive therapies to treat complications to try to improve outcome. Defining which are the best life-saving treatments has been frustrated by the lack of clinical studies. \nRapid fluid infusion to correct fluid deficits is a standard supportive treatment and practised routinely for the emergency management of children with severe illness. Currently, reticence to adopt this approach remains and thus in African hospitals children are managed with little fluid or no additional fluid. If the benefits of rapid fluid infusion were shown, then FEAST trial could potentially save thousands of lives of young children annually.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601027","grantId":"G0601027","fundValue":"1751450","fundStart":"2007-11-14","fundEnd":"2010-11-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kathryn  Maitland","coPersons":["Sarah Louise Rowland-Jones","Kalifa Abubakr Bojang","Diana  Gibb","Michael  Levin","Charles Richard Newton","Abdel Ghayoum Babiker","Jennifer  Evans","Tsiri  Agbenyega"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
