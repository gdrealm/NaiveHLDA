{"id":"7119B1B7-5C76-40B9-8E42-CD28A20AD884","title":"How are enhancers activated during early embryonic stem cell differentiation","abstractText":"All of us develop into complex human beings containing millions of cells from a single cell created by fertilization of an egg. To transit from this single cell state, cells must divide and eventually change their identity and gain specialised functions. For example we need specific types of cells to populate our brains, and this project will address the early steps in the creation of these types of cells. One fundamental process that we aim to understand in this context is the mechanism of &quot;enhancer activation&quot;. Enhancers are the parts of our genome that direct gene expression ie the conversion of our DNA from our genes into useful information that provides the building blocks that determine the structure and function of our cells. Importantly, different enhancers are active in different cell types, allowing the production of distinct gene products and hence a range of alternative cell types. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these enhancers are activated, and hence we do not know the mechanisms determining cell fate. This project aims to bridge this gap in our knowledge and examine how enhancers are activated. Importantly, our studies will be conducted in embryonic stem cells, and hence will contribute to our knowledge of how to manipulate these cells which is important in the context of using these cells in regenerative medicine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M006301/1","grantId":"BB/M006301/1","fundValue":"592008","fundStart":"2015-03-31","fundEnd":"2018-03-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew David Sharrocks","coPersons":["Magnus  Rattray"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
