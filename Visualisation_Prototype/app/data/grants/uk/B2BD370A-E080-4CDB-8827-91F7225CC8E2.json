{"id":"B2BD370A-E080-4CDB-8827-91F7225CC8E2","title":"Licensing Act for England and Wales 2003 and Alcohol Policy","abstractText":"This research examines the politics behind the Licensing Act of for England and Wales of 2003 which came into force in November 2005. The research examines the genesis and implementation of the act. It looks at the respective roles of government departments and agencies and discusses the issue of ‘joined up’ government in Britain. The research examines the way in which the policy issue was framed in terms of an issue of leisure and individual behaviour rather than as one of health or public order. In addition, since the act&nbsp; involved a good deal of public and political controversy, the research looks at the role of the mass media in framing the debate as well as the part played by Parliament in changing it. The research uses the act to illuminate the nature of the policy process in Britain today and relates it to some abstract theories of the policy process, especially regarding policy change and agenda setting. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2457","grantId":"RES-000-22-2457","fundValue":"24208","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John Robert  Greenaway","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
