{"id":"A2AD42DD-15EB-41F3-9DA0-41FC9237E53E","title":"Phonological Specification of Vowels in Early Lexical Representations","abstractText":"<p>How much phonological detail do infants use to recognise words in their early vocabularies? Previous research suggests that they have difficulty differentiating words that differ by a single phoneme, eg, bat vs. hat. However, this research has only examined consonants. Four sets of experiments use mispronunciation and habituation tasks to evaluate whether infants can detect vowel changes in words and non-words.</p>\n\n<p>The first set of experiments identifies the age range during which infants begin to be able to identify whether a familiar word has been mispronounced. The following sets of experiments investigate specific characteristics of vowels (height, frontness and roundedness) that might contribute to the process of word recognition. The research aims to identify a developmental profile of the phonological detail associated with words during the second year of life.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1322","grantId":"RES-000-23-1322","fundValue":"172492","fundStart":"2006-02-14","fundEnd":"2009-05-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kim Robertson Plunkett","coPersons":["John  Coleman"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
