The breakout into this rp-process is governed by a few key nuclear reactions whose rates are presently uncertain. The aim of this experiment is to improve our understanding of one of these key reactions: 18Ne(a,p)21Na. This will be achieved by carrying out the reaction in reverse using a radioactive 21Na beam from the ISAC-II facility in TRIUMF.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G006512/1","grantId":"ST/G006512/1","fundValue":"2320","fundStart":"2008-12-17","fundEnd":"2009-03-16","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David Gareth Jenkins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" An experiment was carried out on 21Na(p,p'g) reaction at the ISAC facility in TRIUMF.
