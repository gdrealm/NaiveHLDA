In India, for example, annual imports of edible oil are a staggering 50% of the national consumption, costing of over &pound; 3.6 billion. The national average dietary intake of fat/oil in India is 9kg/person/year (kpy). In rural India, the intake is 1-7 kpy, which is well below the minimum nutritional recommendation of 14 kpy.\n White blister rust caused by the oomycete Albugo candida is one of the most important diseases of oilseed mustard and other vegetable brassicas globally. The pathogen can infect all above-ground parts of the plant, but causes the most severe damage as systemic infections of the inflorescence leading to staghead formation. The disease causes yield losses in oilseed mustard of 20-60% in India, Canada and Australia. With the development of canola quality B. juncea, many countries like Australia and Canada are growing B. juncea more extensively as a crop that is better suited for areas with low rainfall than oilseed rape. However, white rust susceptibility is a major concern, so development of new B. juncea varieties that combine durable white rust resistance and drought tolerance is needed to improve productivity in south Asia and to expand global production of this important oilseed crop.\n The integrated use of pathology and molecular genetics can provide an evidence-based strategy for assembling gene combinations around specific broad spectrum R-genes, and ultimately achieve sustainable disease control via anticipatory breeding of new resistant crop cultivars. This strategy is theoretically possible in any crop, including Indian mustard. However, molecular identification of matching host and pathogen determinants (R and AVR genes, respectively) are rate-limiting but nevertheless required to enable whole-genome selection of optimal gene combinations along with other essential traits.\n The proposed Indo-UK partnership has unique opportunity to lead in this research of global importance to food security. This will be achieved by harnessing genomics and bioinformatics tools to extend the on-going efforts towards anticipatory breeding of disease resistance, for sustainable control of white rust in brassicas, and specifically for development of B. juncea varieties that will be adapted for cultivation in India. To date, deployment of the state-of-art genomic approaches for combating white blister rust has been minimal in India and the UK. Similarly, efforts have not yet been initiated to characterize the genome level diversity of the pathogen population. The proposed project is therefore a major opportunity to establish coordinated capability in the genomic characterization of both host and pathogen, which will extend the approaches currently being used in India towards more effective breeding and disease management strategies.\nPrimary outputs will be aimed at efficient identification of genes that control white blister rust in brassicas. To achieve this, three project objectives will exploit examples of white rust resistance that have already been identified in primary and secondary gene pools, and in the wild relative Arabidopsis thaliana, to enable precise genotyping of resistance in seedlings for marker-assisted breeding of R-gene combinations, and to evaluate transgenic methods for developing sustainable white rust control in B. juncea cultivars of Indian mustard. \n A complementary pathology aim will advance capability of using pathogen-based information for evaluating the potential durability of targeted disease resistance genes in optimal combinations for use in Indian mustard varieties of B. juncea. Two project objectives will capitalise on the latest genomic resources available in Albugo, to define the pathotype variability of A. candida in India and to assess the potential emergence of variants that could overcome individual white rust resistance genes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L011646/1","grantId":"BB/L011646/1","fundValue":"1139580","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Eric B.
