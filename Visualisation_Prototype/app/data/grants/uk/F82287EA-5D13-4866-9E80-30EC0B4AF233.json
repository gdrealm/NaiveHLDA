{"id":"F82287EA-5D13-4866-9E80-30EC0B4AF233","title":"PLATFORM: Exploring the Potential of Compartmentalisation for Selections and Ultra-high-throughput Screening","abstractText":"We have assembled a team of scientists from Cambridge, France, Israel and the USA to develop the use of microdroplets in microfluidics as microreactors. These droplets (which measure a few millionth of a metre across) are equivalent to very small reaction flasks in which chemical or biological reactions can be performed on a minute scale. The droplets are made, manipulated and analysed in microfluidic systems, consisting of networks of microscopic channels through which the droplets flow in a stream of oil. It will be possible to make and analyse millions of droplets in an hour.Cambridge has pioneered the use of microdroplets for biological applications. Our current ambition is to maintain our lead in the area, while at the same time expanding the range of experiments that can be performed, and showing that the methodology has applications across biology and into chemistry and material sciences. The Platform grant will be used to fund our expanding research in this area. It will provide greater flexibility in our existing research in several ways, for example by providing extra funds for experienced researchers to spend more time with us, or to fund scientists who come with fellowships but no extra money to support their science. In particular it will make it easier for us to send our researchers to learn techniques in collaborating laboratories in France, Israel and the USA. It will also allow us to be adventurous with our science and start exploratory new projects, especially ones that cross normal scientific boundaries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C013174/1","grantId":"EP/C013174/1","fundValue":"428640","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  They stimulated further research which led to the creation of several spinouts Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Economic","person":"Chris  Abell","coPersons":["Wilhelm  Huck","Andrew David Griffiths","Florian  Hollfelder"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The platform grant has proved invaluable in providing underpinning funding for our microdroplets group and helped it develop into two major interdisciplinary research groups and a spin out company. The platform grant was used to fund science across the spectrum from device design and fabrication through to a range of diverse applications. Specifically we developed novel traps for holding droplets, a method for surface-induced droplet fusion, a way to selectively separate and de-emulsify droplets (patented). A key focus has been the detection of droplet contents by mass spectrometry (patented). This is of potentially significant commercial interest. We also developed novel fluorous surfactants. This has proved particularly important. Using funding from the Platform grant we used microdroplets in a range of application areas, including: in vitro protein expression from single genes; quantitative enzymatic and cell based assays; and in developing methodology to follow reactions on a sub millisecond timescale. Ongoing projects include establishing methods to screen for enzymatic ethanol production in microdroplets; to grow yeast in droplets to assess selectivity effects of enzyme inihbitors from growth curve measurements; and to grow mammalian cells in microdroplets, to facilitate transfection experiments.\n\nFunding from the Platform grant has been pivotal in underpinning existing collaborations, including a collaborative study with Prof Dan Tawfik (Weizman, Israel) on quantitative comparison of bulk emulsion and microfluidic droplet protocols. It has also been especially useful for catalyzing the development of new collaborations. These include:\n\n(1) on stem cells with Prof Fiona Watt (Centre for Stem Cell Research) to study single cell signalling and cell fate in cells on defined supports. We prepared monodisperse gel beads with skin stem cells compartmentalized inside that are suitable for cell growth and can be implanted in mice to study the formation hair follicles.\n\n(2) On algal biofuels with Prof Alison Smith (Plant Sciences). We have developed methodology to culture algae in droplets and simultaneously measure their chlorophyll and lipid content. This will enable screening libraries of modified algae\nthousands of times faster than present methods.\n\n(3) On enzyme expression with Prof John Oakeshott (CSIRO), and Profs Nick Dixon and Chris Easton (ANU, Australia).\n\n(4) On the fabrication of novel SERS active nanocomposites with Prof Luis Liz-Martin, (Vigo, Spain).\n\nThe Platform funding has been used to extend contracts, provide short term support, provide exploratory funding, and to develop new collaborations. It played a pivotal role in firmly establishing microdroplet technology at Cambridge. Microdroplet technology is a new platform technology that has potential applications in many areas of experimental science, most obviously molecular and cell biology, but also chemistry and material science. \n\nWe have created a University spin out company (Sphere Fluidics http://www.spherefluidics.eu/) that has already been involved in collaborations with two US companies. We have used every opportunity to promote the science in academia and industry. We have also provided advice and training Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
