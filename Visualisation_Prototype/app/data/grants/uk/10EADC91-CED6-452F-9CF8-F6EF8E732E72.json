{"id":"10EADC91-CED6-452F-9CF8-F6EF8E732E72","title":"Shiftwork and Health: optimal timing of meals and physical activity","abstractText":"Many people now work at unusual hours of the day. Shift-work is no longer restricted to heavy industry but is now more common in E-commerce and telesales occupations to meet the need for 24-hour services. Shift-work is associated with greater health problems (e.g. chronic fatigue, gastro-intestinal and cardiovascular problems) than normal 9am-5pm day-work. It is unclear whether these problems are due to disturbances of the body clock and/or a decreased opportunity to adopt the desired amount and timing of lifestyle and social factors. With more than 20 years experience in researching this area, the possession of new facilities in our shift-work simulation unit, as well as a history of field-based research, the Chronobiology Research Group at Liverpool John Moores University will address these gaps in knowledge. We will explore such questions as, how does shift-work interfere with physical activity and eating habits? How does prior exercise influence metabolic responses and performance during a night-shift? What are the longer-term acceptability and the health consequences of a physical activity/dietary intervention programme? A qualitative component to the project ensures that shift-workers inform the research process throughout. Research findings will be disseminated, as they emerge, to employers and individual shift-workers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501286","grantId":"G0501286","fundValue":"162102","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Greg  Atkinson","coPersons":["Tom  Reilly","Ben  Edwards","David  Richardson","James Maris  Waterhouse"],"organisation":"Liverpool John Moores University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
