Bioethanol for cars is now being made from food crops like maize and sugarcane. However this has had a disruptive effect on global food markets. New processes starting from biomass, meaning wood, straw and inedible grass crops, are now reaching commercial stage. Biomass materials consist of tough polymers like lignin and cellulose. Cellulose can with difficulty be broken down to glucose, which in turn is fermented to ethanol. Lignin is even more difficult to break down and it does not yield glucose or any other carbohydrate, so it cannot be fermented. Usually the residues left over after fermentation consist mostly of lignin, and are burnt. If lignin can be broken down into its constituent parts, these are rather like some of the industrial chemicals derived at present from oil, benzene for example. A very wide range of chemical processes, mostly involving catalysts, are in use to interconvert oil-derived chemicals like benzene. In principle processes like these could be used to make similar chemicals from lignin. This has hardly ever been done successfully, because lignin is a solid that does not usually dissolve in water or any other liquid. Industrial catalysts only work on liquids or gases. The only useful product made from lignin today is the flavouring substance vanillin, a severely degraded version of one of the units making up the lignin polymer. Vanillin is made from lignosulphonates, sulphur-containing soluble by-products of the Kraft process from which brown paper is made. The process of vanillin manufacture is a harsh oxidative one, lacking the flexibility that can be achieved by catalytic modification. The innovation that we propose is to isolate lignin from the fermentation residues remaining after biofuel production, using a modified version of what is called the organosolv process. In this process lignin is broken down gently into large, polymeric fragments that dissolve in solvents like ethanol. These organosolv lignin fragments can be recovered in a pure, soluble form very suitable for controlled catalytic conversion to single units and then, potentially, to a wide range of other products that are made at present from oil. The organosolv process has been used already with a different aim, to remove lignin from the raw material so that the cellulose can be broken down more readily. There are other ways to improve access to cellulose, though, and currently these are preferred: the most important issue is the amount of ethanol that can be made from the cellulose. Because we propose to apply a variant of the organosolv process to the residue after fermentation this problem is no longer relevant. Our proposal is also novel in making use of catalytic processes to break down the lignin to single units and to convert these products to useful chemicals. The purity and solubility of the organosolv lignin are the key features that permit the catalytic approach. To put this idea into practice we shall need to alter the organosolv process to make it suitable for the more resistant lignin that will be found in the residues after fermentation. We also need to devise catalytic methods for completing the breakdown of lignin to single units and for converting these to other products. The catalytic conversion to a full range of other products will not be attempted, only one example. The intention is that the research will lead to other projects in which a wider variety of products can be made in collaboration with industry. The two investigators bring new skills to the UK biofuels community. Dr Jarvis has a lifetime's experience of the analysis of cellulosic materials in the food and timber industries, while Prof Jackson's expertise in catalysis has been accumulated within a chemical industry founded on oil. These complementary skills will be necessary to complete the project but will also be an asset in the IBTI Club's other activities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I005528/1","grantId":"BB/I005528/1","fundValue":"375069","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Charles Jarvis","coPersons":["S David Jackson"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
