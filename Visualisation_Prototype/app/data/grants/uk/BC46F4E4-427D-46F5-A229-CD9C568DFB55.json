Their function is abnormal in most human tumours. Investigation of the pathways activated by RAS proteins has identified molecules which can be targeted by drugs to inhibit tumour growth and spread. \nRAC is a protein structurally similar to RAS which indeed mediates the cancer-inducing properties of RAS. RAC activates a wide range of processes such as cell migration and invasion. RAC cycles between two different states 'on' or 'off' controlled by two families of proteins known as Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEF) and the GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) respectively. In its active or switched 'on' state RAC is able to bind various other proteins to elicit consequent responses in the cell.\nThe T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (TIAM1) protein is a GEF specific for the activation of RAC and is itself required for tumour formation. However, TIAM1 through RAC can also stimulate the adhesion of cells and potentially slow down the spread of cancer. Unpublished data from our lab now indicates that TIAM1 levels can be reduced via its interaction with another protein- HUWE1- which labels TIAM1 for degradation. We hypothesize that HUWE1 may accumulate in cancer cells in order to reduce TIAM1 to an amount that still allows tumours to develop but can not inhibit cancer spreading.\nThere are three main objectives to this proposal. Firstly we will define the parts of these two proteins that allow physical interaction. Secondly, using this information we will then make 'mutant' TIAM1 proteins which cannot be degraded and by replacing normal TIAM1 with mutant TIAM1, we will functionally assess the importance of TIAM1 degradation during processes involved in cancer growth and spreading. Thirdly, we plan to use two different mouse models where the expression of TIAM1 and HUWE1 can be genetically altered, to investigate the effect of TIAM1 and HUWE1 modulation on tumourigenesis. Finally, to confirm the importance of the above findings to the field of cancer research we plan to analyse the expression of TIAM1 and HUWE1 in human tumour samples. We envisage that the knowledge we learn from these studies will increase our understanding of how abnormal RAS function results in cancer and improve the design of drugs to treat cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L007495/1","grantId":"MR/L007495/1","fundValue":"367418","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Angeliki  Malliri","coPersons":["Lynsey Sian Vaughan"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
