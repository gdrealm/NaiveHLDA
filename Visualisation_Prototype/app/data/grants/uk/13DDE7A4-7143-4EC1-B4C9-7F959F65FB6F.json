To examine these issues, we will conduct a 30 month, five wave comparative panel study in Britain and the Netherlands.</p>\n\n<p>The panel will feature a series of embedded survey experiments designed to test the impact of diversity, austerity, and various moderators on political attitudes. Identical experiments will be conducted simultaneously in the two countries, which will enable us for the first time to examine how national context mediates the effects of these factors on public opinion. We will also capture attitude change over time by surveying the same voters repeatedly, and we will examine the impact of the most powerful source of political information - election campaigns - by timing these repeated survey waves before and immediately after European Parliament and national elections.</p>\n\n<p>The data generated by the project will be made publicly available and will provide a valuable resource to the research community: comparative panel surveys are rare, and to our knowledge none has ever incorporated simultaneous comparative embedded experiments.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006126/1","grantId":"ES/K006126/1","fundValue":"137630","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Ford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
