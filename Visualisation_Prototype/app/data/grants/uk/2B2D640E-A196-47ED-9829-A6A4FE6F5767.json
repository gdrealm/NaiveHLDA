In the lung, airway smooth muscle (ASM) surrounds developing airways and may participate both in fetal lung development and also childhood asthma. Given both asthma and disordered lung development (e.g. related to prematurity or birth defect) are common, there is international consensus that greater study of prenatal ASM is required to improve chances to treat such diseases. We recently showed prenatal lung harbours pacemakers whose rhythmic ASM contractions spread via the fetal airways and appear related to lung growth. The latter relationship is supported by the observations that (i) developing ASM produces a factor essential for lung growth and (ii) specific disruption of calcium signalling in ASM halts both airway contractions and prenatal lung growth. We will investigate how the ASM pacemaker emerges and how ASM contractions relate to lung growth using cell and lung culture, calcium imaging and techniques to screen gene expression. Given the information currently available, the present project can expect to extend our knowledge of ASM development considerably. We may therefore discover new approaches to not only improve prenatal lung growth but also ameliorate ASM dysfunction in asthma.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802057","grantId":"G0802057","fundValue":"392318","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Edwin  Jesudason","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
