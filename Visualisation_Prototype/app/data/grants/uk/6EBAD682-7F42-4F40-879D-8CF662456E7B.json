The aim of the project is to develop a mathematical theory of nonlinear waves propagating in layered elastic waveguides with extended inhomogeneities representing damage/delamination. This will be achieved using mathematical models of different complexity and the application of a wide range of analytical methods and numerical simulations. Theoretical predictions will be tested experimentally to verify the mathematical theory. Traditionally, nonlinear waves in fluids and solids are studied by different communities of researchers. However, it becomes increasingly clear that there are many analogies in the mathematical approaches to seemingly different problems. One of the best known problems in the area of nonlinear waves in inhomogeneous media is the classical fluid mechanics problem of the dynamics of surface gravity waves propagating over smooth bottom topography. This problem has been studied in various formulations, including monochromatic waves, shallow-water solitons and wave packets. The present project aims at the theoretical and experimental study of nonlinear wave processes in imperfectly bonded layered elastic waveguides with extended interfacial inhomogeneities (modelling poorly bonded areas), which can be considered, in a sense, as an analogue of the classical problem described above. Indeed, we can assume that coupling between the layers varies slowly along a layered waveguide (modelling the areas where the cohesive forces between the layers are weakened by the presence of defects). We can then use the variational formulation of the problem and methods developed for surface gravity waves propagating over variable topography to describe the slow evolution of a nonlinear wave (such as a strain soliton, monochromatic wave or a wave packet). In particular, given the initial velocity of the strain soliton, we expect to be able to find the characteristics of the damaged region sufficient to cause the propagation failure of the soliton. This last effect can be potentially used for the non-destructive testing of layered structures, using nonlinear waves.Note that although similar mathematical methods have already been developed for some classical fluid and solid mechanics problems, their application to the described problem of nonlinear elasticity will be completely new and highly nontrivial.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D035570/1","grantId":"EP/D035570/1","fundValue":"121689","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Some of the key findings of the research (published in Phys.

The number and parameters of generated secondary solitons depend on the number of layers in a waveguide and potentially can be used to detect poor adhesion / delamination, complementing currently existing techniques. This effect has been predicted in theory and confirmed in experiments. Our theory is based on a weakly nonlinear solution for a Boussinesq-type equation derived for a waveguide made of an isotropic nonlinearly hyperelastic Murnaghan material. The developed approach uses matching of two asymptotic multiple-scales expansions and results from the theory of integrable systems. Experiments were performed using holographic interferometry and laser induced generation of an incident compression solitary wave in two- and three-layered polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bars, bonded using ethyl cyanoacrylate-based (CA) adhesive.\n\n\n\n(b) Difference in the behaviour of nonlinear waves in a nearly symmetric layered structure with an imperfect interface compared to the limiting case of the perfect (or ideal) interface: classical solitons, exponentially decaying to zero in their tail regions are generally replaced with radiating solitary waves, having a co-propagating oscillatory tail. This effect is believed to be linked to the observed increase in the decay rate of a nonlinear longitudinal bulk strain solitary wave in some imperfectly bonded structures compared to the decay rate in a perfectly bonded structure. Indeed, the amplitude of the core solitary wave gradually decreases due to the radiation of a co-propagating wave. First observation of the radiating bulk strain solitary wave in a layered solid waveguide was reported in our recent paper. See exploitation routes. Theoretical and experimental findings of this project indicate that longitudinal bulk strain solitary waves can be useful for nondestructive testing of delamination in layered structures. This could find both industrial and medical applications.\n\n\n\nThe results may also be relevant to interpreting some seismological data.
