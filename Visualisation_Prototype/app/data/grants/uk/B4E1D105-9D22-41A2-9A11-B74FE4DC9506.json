One suggestion is that they possess internal spatial “maps”. However, a range of simpler strategies have also been shown to support human navigation and spatial memory. One such strategy would be to use view matching to recognise “visual snapshots” that are not map-like, but are tied to a particular viewpoint. It has been suggested that a combination of snapshots and other simple strategies may be enough to explain many human spatial abilities. However recent evidence suggests that the navigational flexibility seen in adulthood does also include the ability to represent spatial relations on internal maps that are not tied to any particular viewpoint. The developmental trajectory for the acquisition of this ability in childhood is not known. The present project will use a novel developmental spatial task to systematically distinguish spatial mapping from other possibilities. Results from this will have the potential to resolve a long-standing debate concerning the nature of spatial representations and how they develop, and will also be relevant for approaches to education in visuospatial skills.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2486","grantId":"RES-000-22-2486","fundValue":"78667","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Janette  Atkinson","coPersons":["Marko  Nardini"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
