By understanding how these particles interact, insight will be gained about the origin of the Universe. To study these particles and their behaviour highly specialised detectors and equipment must be used. One such example is the Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) neutrino oscillation experiment, based in Japan. \n\nIn 2011 the T2K experiment reported evidence indicating that the third neutrino mixing angle was non-zero. With additional data in 2013, T2K confirmed electron neutrino appearance in a muon neutrino beam which provides the possibility of CP-violation in the neutrino sector of the Standard Model. I will continue to work with the T2K experiment and will focus on the measurement of Neutral Current cross-sections using data from the near detector. Such measurements are important for current and future neutrino oscillation experiments. \n\nFuture long baseline experiments are planned to investigate and quantify delta, the parameter associated with CP-violation. If delta is found to be non-zero, it could help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. I am currently involved with the design and optimisation of data acquisition systems for the planned HyperKamiokande experiment. Such systems will be important for HyperKamiokande and other future neutrino experiments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M00001X/1","grantId":"ST/M00001X/1","fundValue":"6069","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  I have used findings from the T2K experiments in the following: \n1. lectures/classes given to undergraduates\n2. postgraduate recruitment \n3. undergraduate recruitment \n4.
