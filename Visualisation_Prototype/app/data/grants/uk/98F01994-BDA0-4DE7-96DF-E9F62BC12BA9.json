{"id":"98F01994-BDA0-4DE7-96DF-E9F62BC12BA9","title":"From Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience to the Couch: Is There a Common Language?","abstractText":"<p>Until recently, psychoanalysis (PSA) was de-emphasised by biological psychiatry and cognitive psychology, but it remained a relatively popular method of psychotherapy, and also it has a persistent and penetrating influence over the social representation of psychology.&nbsp;Moreover, as the study of emotions and motivation came to the forefront of psychological and neuroscientific research, an increasing number of leading scientists turned their attention to psychodynamic theories. There have been many passionate scientific campaigns, for or against PSA, almost always showing lack of mutual understanding and unshared vocabularies.</p> \n<p>In this context, we joined forces with scientists associated with the Society for Neuro-psychoanalysis, in order to create a forum for interdisciplinary dialogue and to generate a practical and reliable glossary, in which cognitive and neuroscientific findings are used to provide scientifically informed definitions of key psychoanalytic terms.</p> \n<p>Secondary objectives are to:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>review and evaluate the conceptual underpinnings of previous relevant interdisciplinary efforts;</li> \n <li>select key concepts that can serve as a basis for a fruitful interdisciplinary dialogue;</li> \n <li>apply a thorough cross-disciplinary check to these concepts; and</li> \n <li>eliminate sources of conceptual confusion.</li>\n</ol> \n<p>The anticipated outcome is an academic reference tool to be used by researchers, clinicians, theorists, and public opinion makers. We are hoping that this tool can further contribute to (a) the increase of understanding between fields, (b) the avoidance of unwarranted interpretation, (c) the facilitation of access to specialised knowledge, and (d) the promotion of further research and collaboration across fields.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4264","grantId":"RES-451-25-4264","fundValue":"10651","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Aikaterini  Fotopoulou","coPersons":["Martin A.
