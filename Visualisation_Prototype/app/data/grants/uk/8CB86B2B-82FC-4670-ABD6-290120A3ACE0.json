When the body reacts against a disease-causing organism, some of the white blood cells turn into antibody-producing factories, a process which involves major changes within the cells. We want to investigate how this happens, looking at the processes involved in live cells through innovative microscopy techniques. Jellyfish green fluorescent protein has become one of the most popular tools for cell biologists for the study of dynamic processes inside living cells by enabling direct tagging of proteins normally found inside cells. We now wish to label different steps involved in antibody production with fluorescent proteins, to investigate how the cell changes and how the antibodies are then directed out of the cell along the cell’s so-called secretory pathway, into the bloodstream. By understanding the mechanisms involved in normal, healthy cells, we hope to apply the knowledge to human diseases attributable to these white blood cells and malfunction of their secretion, such as arthritis where some cells lose control of antibody production, or Burkitt’s lymphoma, a cancer prevalent in African children, caused by infection by Epstein-Barr virus which piggy-backs on the cell’s secretory system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400373","grantId":"G0400373","fundValue":"239527","fundStart":"2005-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Theresa  Ward","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
