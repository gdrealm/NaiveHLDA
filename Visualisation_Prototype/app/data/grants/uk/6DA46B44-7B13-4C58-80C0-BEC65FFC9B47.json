However, patients and care teams are not currently provided with the behavioural tools necessary to achieve and sustain a physically active lifestyle. The lack of tools to enable patients and their care teams to support an active lifestyle present a significant barrier to the use of physical activity and exercise in the clinical care of people with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.</p>\n\n<p>The Movement as Medicine for Cognition project will directly address this unmet need by creating the first scalable behaviour change platform designed with and for people with cognitive impairment and their care teams. The project will also ensure acceptance and fidelity in clinical care. Combined, the project will create a system that will enable <em>anyone</em> with cognitive impairment and <em>anyone</em> involved in their care with the skills and tools they need to achieve and sustain a physically active lifestyle to assist in management of cognitive decline.</p>\n&nbsp;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K007688/1","grantId":"ES/K007688/1","fundValue":"100473","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We have been working with the Alzheimers Society to develop new lifestyle pathways to help people at risk of or who have early stage dementia. These service pathways are the first of their type in the UK and hold the potential to impact upon the care of people at risk of or who have early cent and their carers. These pathways will undergo clinical trial in 2015.
