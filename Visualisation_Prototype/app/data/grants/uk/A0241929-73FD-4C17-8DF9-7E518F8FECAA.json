{"id":"A0241929-73FD-4C17-8DF9-7E518F8FECAA","title":"Reverse engineering digital data: Enhancing understanding of digital information through the creation of data-objects","abstractText":"This research will explore how the creation of physical artifacts or 'data-objects' based on data extracted from complex digital information systems can change the way we read, interpret and respond to computer-generated scientific information. \n\nWe will examine how data-objects can facilitate cognitive access to technical data to different communities beyond the engineering/scientific sector, as an alternative way of communicating complex statistical information. The research is based on the premise that scientific graphics remain abstract and unintelligible for people outside of the scientific community and that if this the case, then we need to explore alternative ways in which to visualise the increasingly complex and dense data which is being generated through the use of computing technologies. \n\nIn this first study we are using engineering statistics gathered on age, strength and dexterity and this relationship to packaging 'openability' as the starting point for the creation of data-objects. We will be looking specifically at how these types of interventions can assist designers, healthcare workers and care seekers in the understanding of this data.\n\nThese data-objects will be created by translating digital information/statistics into 3D computer models, which can then be output into real-world objects using 3D printing techniques. The research will explore if the creation of material based data-objects can bringing better understanding and increased accessibility to scientific data.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013072/1","grantId":"AH/J013072/1","fundValue":"23180","fundStart":"2012-02-06","fundEnd":"2012-08-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  To generate interest in novel, more inclusive data visualization methods in health and communications sectors.

Transforming digital data into physical objects is an interesting and appropriate activity to open access to data to larger communities. What visual forms and material choices chosen to communicate data play a important role in how this data is understood. The concept of the data-object is transferable to almost any sector and this research has only scratched the surface of what is a developing field of inquiry.
