{"id":"9C8A4EA5-ECF0-4D74-9DC5-9EF57E2029A7","title":"Social and cognitive predictors of success in the transition to school","abstractText":"<p>Starting school brings important social challenges, such as making and keeping friends, complying with rules and routines, coping with rejection and the threat of either academic or social failure. This project capitalises on an existing study of a socially diverse sample of 270 children (135 friendship pairs) seen at age 4. By following these children (plus new friends, predicted sample size of 320) at age 6 our aim is to examine the independence and interplay of children’s cognitive characteristics and close relationships as predictors of success in the transition to school.</p> \n<p>Children’s social adjustment will be assessed via structured interviews with children, teachers and parents, as well as through filmed observations of children playing with their friends in free-play and in both co-operative and competitive play; cognitive skills (e.g. verbal ability, social understanding, planning and working memory) will be assessed via individually-administered tasks and puppet games.</p> \n<p>Using detailed data at ages 2 and 3 (available for one child in each friendship pair) we also plan to investigate the long-term significance of early individual differences in children’s cognitive characteristics and family interactions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1371","grantId":"RES-000-23-1371","fundValue":"266557","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2008-02-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Helene Hughes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
