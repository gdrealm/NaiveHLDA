{"id":"2EBC3447-DF99-4C75-A78B-7D0434F440DA","title":"Analysing Political Violence and Terror: Integrating Divergent Approaches, and Identifying the Research Agenda","abstractText":"<p>Divisions amongst academic experts and the gulf between theory and practice have impeded the development of new understandings of ‘terrorism’ and counter-terrorism. This series of four seminars aims to facilitate dialogue between policy makers and academics of various schools of thought on four under-studied areas. The first seminar will examine the emerging field of ‘critical terrorism studies’, and what it has to offer in comparison to ‘traditional terrorism studies’. The second will explore what is known about how terrorism ends. The third will explore the role of trust in resolving conflicts involving terrorism. The fourth will address the impact of the War on Terror on ‘the South’ and ‘Southern’ perspectives on the War on Terror. Run by the Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Contemporary Political Violence (CSRV) at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, with the BISA Working Group on Critical Studies on Terrorism, INCORE, University of Ulster and the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, University of St Andrews, outputs will include a special journal issue, papers on the CSRV, INCORE and the BISA websites, and an edited book.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4224","grantId":"RES-451-25-4224","fundValue":"12244","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marie Brigid Breen Smyth","coPersons":["Gillian Margaret Robinson","John  Horgan","Jeroen Willem Gunning","Richard  Jackson"],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
