Situating ourselves in the island of Lesbos, we examine the key actors on the island - humanitarian, social, political - and the contestation over fields and spaces of action opening in the midst of this emergency and the greatest population move in the continent in decades. Broadening our scope, we also look at Greece as a vector of its own contradictions and as the object of political decisions which will inevitably compromise its already weak position within the EU. In the third and largest of our cognitive concentric circles (Lesbos, Greece, the EU), we are trying to understand the crisis of Europe's own decision-making and executing mechanisms as a whole: to read through the inconsistencies and gaps in these and to follow and map out what emerges out of these transformations.'","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N013700/1","grantId":"ES/N013700/1","fundValue":"117604","fundStart":"2015-09-14","fundEnd":"2017-05-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Antonis  Vradis","coPersons":["Joe  Painter"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
