Such effects are compounded by the lack of knowledge of the rate and time at which 'weaning' from the machine should occur. This project aims at developing an adaptive decision support system to assist ICU staff in the optimisation of ventilation and weaning processes. To help achieve this, an adaptive hybrid model which describes the patient-ventilator interaction during ventilation as well as weaning phases will be elicited. In addition to knowledge gathered through data relating to blood gases and lung expansions, the project aims at exploiting a revolutionary technique developed at sheffield, called Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) which consists of measuring, in a non-invasive fashion, the degree of expansion or collapse of the lungs and the effect of the ventilation strategy upon these. Two important aspects of this project relate to the inclusion of the EIT measurement technique to improve the monitoring of the patient's respiratory demands and to the use of granular computing for the hybrid model represented by the neural-fuzzy layer. The elicitation of such a model will form the basis for the design and development of an adaptive decision support system for optimal therapeutic advice on ventilator settings and weaning operation. On-line and off-line validation of the system in a series of ICU trials are envisaged.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C520807/1","grantId":"EP/C520807/1","fundValue":"224214","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research findings relate mainly to the exploitation of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) (a Sheffield University invention) in General Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as an effective tool for decision support in cases of sepsis, We have indeed devised a portable decision support system which uses intelligent system technologies to administer 'optimal' therapy to critically-ill patients.

Used the information provided by the images to design a decision support system that administers therapy to ICU patients to help them breath on their own. The findings can be exploited in two-fold:\n\n1. Use the electronic system based around Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) to develop a portable system that takes images of the patient lungs in a flexible and economic way;\n\n2.
