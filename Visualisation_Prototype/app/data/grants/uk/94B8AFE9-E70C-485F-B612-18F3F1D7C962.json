The long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of anti-poverty interventions in Bangladesh","abstractText":"While Government and NGOs in Bangladesh have undertaken many interventions designed to help households escape poverty, little is known about their long-term impact. Using a new longitudinal data set spanning 12 years and more than 1800 households, this project will investigate the long-term impact of three anti-poverty interventions—microfinance, agricultural technology, and educational transfers—on several measures of well-being and compare their cost-effectiveness.\n<br />\n<br />Specifically, it will investigate:&nbsp; (1) the long-term impacts of each of the interventions on per capita consumption, gender disaggregated measures of monetary and non-monetary well-being, and physical and human capital accumulation; (2) the underlying processes, at the household, community, and national levels, that have contributed to the success or failure of these interventions; and (3) the cost-effectiveness of the three interventions.\n<br />\n<br />Both quantitative and qualitative techniques will be used. The main quantitative techniques include matching beneficiaries to comparable nonbeneficiaries and panel data regression analysis, while the main qualitative technique will involve analysis of the focus group discussions and life histories that have been collected as part of the ongoing longitudinal study.\n<br />\n<br />The user engagement strategy aims to stimulate a policy dialogue among key stakeholders inside Bangladesh and contribute to the design of future anti-poverty interventions.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0361","grantId":"RES-167-25-0361","fundValue":"247059","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The series of papers produced by this project are among the few to estimate long-term impacts of anti-poverty interventions and compare them with earlier estimates of short-term impacts. One of the papers has also been singled out as a 'model case' of an ex-post impact assessment that paid attention to gender issues by a review conducted by the Standing Panel on Impact Assessment of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).\n\nThe use of both quantitative and qualitative methods in this study also contributes to the growing acceptance of &quot;q-squared&quot; research for undertaking economic and social impact assessment. \n\nMaterial from the project was also used in a course on &quot;Special topics in Gender and Development,&quot; at the Intensive Summer Program, National Graduate Research Institute for Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan, August 9-13, 2010.\n\nThe research undertaken in this project has helped influence both the policy debate in Bangladesh and in the wider development community concerned with the design and evaluation of anti-poverty programmes. While it is difficult to attribute causality, towards the end of the project, we learned that changes to the primary education stipend program in Bangladesh were to be made. The Bangladeshi government has referred to our work (in addition to other IFPRI work on gender and food security) in devising its Food Security Investment Strategy and related activities under the US Government's Feed the Future Initiative; there is a strong focus on addressing gender inequalities in its food security initiatives. \n\nIn the broader development community, donors such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are paying greater attention to reduction of gender asset inequality in evaluating development projects; both DfID and the US Government have placed increased emphasis on food security and gender inequality in recent initiatives (notably the Feed the Future Initiative of the US Government). \n To date, we can only demonstrate impact on the design of new anti-poverty or development initiatives; whether our findings affect outcomes of these initiatives can only be discerned in the longer term.

Long-term impacts on household-level consumption expenditures and asset accumulation were insignificant in the improved vegetables sites, but were positive in the individually operated fishponds sites. At the individual level, early adoption had beneficial effects on nutrient intakes in all sites, but impacts on anthropometric measures of nutritional status were gender-differentiated. Among early adopters in the improved vegetables villages, women's Body Mass Index (BMI) increased while men's BMI decreased. The proportion of stunted girls and thin boys decreased substantially among early adopters in the improved vegetable villages, but stunting rates of girls were higher among early adopters in both individual and group fishponds villages. Differences between short- and long-term impacts of the agricultural technologies arose from dissemination and targeting mechanisms; divisibility of the technology; and intrahousehold resource allocation. \n\nWomen's assets were found to increase more when technologies were disseminated through women's groups. In the improved vegetables and group fishpond sites, dissemination through women's groups reduced gender asset inequality in the long-term but husband-wife asset disparities increased in the individual fishpond sites. These results suggest that social capital, as embodied through women's groups, substituted for physical assets in the short run and helped to build up women's asset portfolios in the long run. \n\nThe Primary Education Stipend (PES) program was shown to have negligible impacts on school enrollments, expenditures, calorie and protein consumption at the household level. At the individual level, the PES had a negative impact on grade progression, especially among boys from poor households who are ineligible to receive stipends at the secondary level. There were some improvements in height for age among girls and BMI among boys. Nonetheless, the impacts of the PES were remarkably small for a program of its size. Poor targeting, particularly limited coverage and lack of geographical targeting, plus the declining real value of the stipend were the most plausible reasons for this lack of impact.\n\nThe qualitative analysis found that educational transfers contributed positively for 29 percent of participants, but its impact was limited by low monetary value of benefits. More than half of respondents had used microfinance for some kind of income-generating activity in their lives. For almost a fifth microfinance was an important cause of wellbeing improvement, but about a third had used microcredit to cope in crises. The life-histories showed little long-term benefit from the agricultural technology programmes, possibly because the technologies were bundled with microfinance and difficult to attribute.\n\nThe mixed results of comparing impacts on monetary versus non-monetary measures of well-being illustrated the dilemmas of using cost-effectiveness to rank anti-poverty interventions with different objectives and measures of impact. While the PES and individual fishponds did increase per capita expenditures or assets, they did poorly in terms of improving nutritional status. Assessing the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of competing development interventions therefore involves trade-offs between objectives, with all the difficulties of welfare ranking and weighting that such trade-offs imply. We expect that the project will have impact in the future by increasing attention: (1) of development organizations to the need to monitor and evaluate project impacts over the longer term; (2) of statistical agencies and research organizations to collecting indicators of well-being at the individual level, not just the household level; (3) to measurement of the cost-effectiveness of interventions, which implies the development of indicators to monitor different components of project cost (inclu Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education","dataset":"gtr"}
