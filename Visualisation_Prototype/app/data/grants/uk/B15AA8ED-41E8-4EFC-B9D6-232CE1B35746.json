{"id":"B15AA8ED-41E8-4EFC-B9D6-232CE1B35746","title":"Viscous fingering under elastic membranes","abstractText":"The research proposed here is motivated by recent striking and unexpected observations of the suppression of a viscous fingering instability in elastic-walled Hele-Shaw cells. The dendritic patterns that readily develop when a thin fluid layer contained in a narrow gap between two rigid plates is displaced by a less viscous fluid, is an archetype for front-propagating, pattern-forming phenomena. We have observed that elastic deformations of the plates that bound the fluid can have a dramatic effect on the onset and nonlinear development of this instability. Specifically, in an elastic-walled Hele-Shaw cell where one of the bounding plates is replaced by a latex membrane, the interface remains axisymmetric for values of the injection rate at which the rigid system already exhibits strongly nonlinear interfacial growth. The critical injection rate beyond which the axisymmetrically expanding interface becomes unstable in the elastic-walled system is approximately 1000 times larger than the corresponding value in the rigid system. Wall elasticity not only affects the onset of the instability but also has a strong effect on the structure of the fingers that develop subsequently. Moreover, if the variations in fluid pressure along the bounding plate are sufficiently large (relative to the plate's stiffness), the fluid loading can cause the plate to buckle (or wrinkle), leading to a strong interaction between two fluid- and solid-based instabilities. We propose to employ a combination of experimental, theoretical and computational approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these novel elasto-hydrodynamic phenomena.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J007927/1","grantId":"EP/J007927/1","fundValue":"363683","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Not yet.
