This proposal provides advanced equipment to apply diffraction and related methods to a series of lesser-studied sample types of great importance in technology and in understanding environmental processes. These include thin layers of material on surfaces, where information about atomic separations, particle sizes, crystal orientation and changes in the size of the lattice due to interactions with the underlying material can be obtained. This will be critical to the understanding of a range of functional materials with applications in energy conversion and storage, electronics, optoelectronics and engineering. It will also be possible to study very small regions of a material, this is important in examination of single components or regions of a sample where variations are important in understanding properties. Sample types include minerals, where the structure of individual grains will contribute to knowledge of interactions with the environment, and single components of grids of material designed to have specific interactions with light.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K00509X/1","grantId":"EP/K00509X/1","fundValue":"8139100","fundStart":"2012-12-19","fundEnd":"2022-12-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Equipment Account Annual Report submitted to EPSRC on 31 July 2014 Other ","person":"Philip Arthur  NelsonJudith  Petts","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" Equipment Account Annual Report submitted to EPSRC on 31 July 2014 Award still in early stages.
