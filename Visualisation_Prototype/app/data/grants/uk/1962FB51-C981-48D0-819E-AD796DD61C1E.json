{"id":"1962FB51-C981-48D0-819E-AD796DD61C1E","title":"MELTING POT: Food and Identity in the Age of the Vikings","abstractText":"This project will use cutting-edge bioarchaeological and materials-science techniques to undertake the first systematic and interdisciplinary study of the role of food and cooking in forging social relationships in Viking-Age Britain. Though often seen in purely nutritional terms - in both archaeology and contemporary policy making - food is central to the production of identity, particularly in contexts of migration and culture contact, and is thus an important but overlooked element in the study of the Viking Age. Understanding of this period is fundamental to the study of later and contemporary culture; it was the social, economic, political, and religious crucible of English and wider European society. We need to understand:\n1. The role of material culture in cuisine. Is it possible to associate for the first time particular vessel forms with particular functions or foodstuffs?\n2. The degree to which culinary practice was subject to change and innovation, was there variability in time and space, and can this be identified at individual sites?\n3. The impact of migration, urbanisation and commercial expansion on local cuisines. Were the cuisines consumed in the cosmopolitan entrep&ocirc;ts of York and Ipswich significantly different to those experienced in contemporary rural sites?\n4. The relationship between food and local politics: may distinctive cuisines be identified in politically disparate areas such as the 'Danelaw' settlement of northern and eastern England, or the southern areas of England governed by Anglo-Saxon Wessex, or the Scandinavian 'homelands' of Denmark?\n\nUsing cutting-edge scientific techniques to identify manufacturing techniques, wear analysis to characterise mode of use, and analysis of lipid residues to establish vessel contents, we will strategically record, sample, and analyse a large quantity of pottery from well-stratified sites across the British Isles and Scandinavia. Our work will be organised into four work packages. Each WP will asses variation in different traits, informed by evidence from environmental archaeology and documentary history, and supported by a successful pilot study.\n\nWork package 1 will compare the results of residue analyses on ceramics of diverse ware and vessel form, with various characteristics of use-wear and damage. This will tell us if particular forms of vessel were being used selectively in order to store, transport, process, present, or consume particular foodstuffs, and thus what role was played by material culture in the making of cuisines (Obj 1).\n\nWork package 2 will consider intra-site variation, through controlled comparison between sherds from multiple contexts separated in time and space. This will tell us the degree to which culinary practice was subject to change and innovation at any given site (Obj 2).\n\nWork package 3 will compare the results of residue analyses on ceramics from sites of diverse character. This will tell us if the cuisines consumed in the cosmopolitan entrep&ocirc;ts of York and Ipswich were significantly different to those experienced in contemporary rural sites (Obj 3).\n\nWork package 4 will compare the results of residue analyses on ceramics from sites in the Danelaw, southern England and southern Scandinavia. This will tell us whether distinctive cuisines can be identified in politically disparate areas (Obj 4).\n \nOur results will be disseminated via open access journal articles, conference presentations, museum display materials, a website with blog, associated social media, and downloadable resources and events for the public and interest groups (Scouts, Girlguides and Young Archaeologists' Club). The project will benefit the scholarly study of the Viking Age, and of food studies more generally. Its application in events and resources for children and local communities will aid the effort to improve understanding of the complex expression of identity in today's world of global mobility and culture contact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M008568/1","grantId":"AH/M008568/1","fundValue":"197524","fundStart":"2016-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven Paul  Ashby","coPersons":["Oliver  Craig"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
