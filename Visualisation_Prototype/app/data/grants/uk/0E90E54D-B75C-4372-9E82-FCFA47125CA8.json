The main aim of the proposed research is to investigate the underlying causes of this productivity weakness in the UK, examining in particular the mechanisms by which the banking sector crisis might have affected the supply side of the UK economy and how it has affected company performance. These mechanisms are identified by examining differences in the performance of individual companies or sectors according to their reliance on bank finance in order to grow. The research also examines the importance of other factors, unrelated to tight credit conditions, that may have helped protect UK employment at the expense of productivity during the recent downturn, analysing company- and sector-level data from a range of secondary data sources, and highlighting patterns in the data consistent with different explanations for the productivity slowdown. Understanding the reasons for recent productivity weakness is of first order importance to macroeconomic policy.

Here we outline key findings from our analysis. \n\nLending by UK banks to private non-financial companies has fallen consistently since 2008. This is different to the US where growth in bank lending to similar companies resumed after 2010. Our review of the evidence and analysis of Companies House data suggests that bank weakness was associated with a reduction in credit supply to UK companies, affecting companies that were more exposed to weak banks.\n\nWe explore how this credit supply shock relates to sectoral performance (reference 1). We find that output declined by more in sectors characterised as relatively bank dependent compared to that in less bank-dependent sectors, consistent with banking sector weakness reducing the supply capacity of the UK economy. But, at the sector level, we find no clear relation between bank dependency and the productivity short-fall relative to trend.\n\nThere are a number of channels through which a banking crisis might reduce productivity growth and the supply capacity of the economy by hampering the efficiency of resource allocation. Using ONS business micro data we decompose aggregate productivity growth relative to trend into contributions from changes in productivity within firms and, separately, from the reallocation of resources across more and less productive firms (reference 2). This analysis suggests a widespread reduction in productivity (labour productivity and total factor productivity) within incumbent firms that survived the recession. This points to the importance of factors not specifically related to the crisis in the banking sector in explaining aggregate productivity weakness. Nevertheless, we find evidence that banking sector weakness dampened productivity growth to a more limited extent by reducing the efficiency of resource allocation across firms.\n\nAnalysing Companies House data we find that banking sector weakness is likely to have led to an increase in company deaths amongst exposed companies, consistent with international evidence (reference 3). We find that credit constrained companies were more likely to reduce their capital stocks relative to what they might otherwise have done. This may have adversely affected companies' productivity, e.g. via capital labour substitution, but direct evidence of this link is less clear.\n\nEstimating firms' labour demand using ONS business micro data we find evidence that weak labour costs have enabled firms to retain labour since the financial crisis. We find little evidence that firms have demanded labour in excess of what might have been expected given the path of wages and output (i.e. little evidence of labour hoarding). This is also true for firms that tend to be more reliant on skilled workers.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the banking sector has reduced credit supply to UK companies. Our research suggests this has had a noticeable impact on the performance of some companies and sectors, but the relationship to productivity is complex and dependent on other factors such as wage flexibility.\n\nSubject to future funding, we plan to explore the potential for further research in this area using linked longitudinal business datasets. \n\nWord Count: 516 \nReferences: \n1.

Our research has contributed evidence to the current policy debate on the importance of demand versus supply side explanations for the recent weakness of UK economic performance and appropriate policy responses. As noted above we have communicated our findings through publications and presentations where senior policy makers have participated. While it is difficult to isolate the effect of our own contribution, our analysis provides contextual evidence to a live debate that affects the setting of monetary and fiscal policy with potentially significant impacts on overall living standards (see e.g. reporting of our research in the RES newsletter). For example, one concern that has been prominent in the debate is the role of banking sector impairment in directly contributing to productivity stagnation through resource misallocation. We provide evidence that, in and of itself, this may not be as important as some commentators have suggested. All things considered, this has implications for the appropriate stance of monetary policy. \n\nWe have also made extensive use of existing secondary data sources, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. We would hope that one outcome of our project will be to contribute to improvements in the collection and linking of different sources of company-level data so as to avoid some of the pitfalls of small useable sample sizes hindering scientific enquiry and understanding.
