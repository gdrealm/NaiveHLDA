The theory of argument has found wide application in artificial intelligence, providing mathematical structures for automated reasoning, communication protocols for distributed processing and linguistic models for natural language processing. A key stumbling block, however, has been joining together models that focus on abstract, mathematical relationships with those that focus on concrete, linguistic relationships. The first objective of this project is to develop for the first time a theoretical account that connects static, monologic argumentwith dynamic, multi-person, dialogic argument and ties together abstract, mathematical models with concrete, linguistic representations.Furthermore,models of argument have been predominantly confined to the lab. Our goal is to translate the research advances into high profile, large scale deployments using partners with enormous user bases. Prototype systems in this area have been sufficient to demonstrate the unique advantages of practical argumentation systems to potential users of this research such as those within the broadcasting domain. There is a demonstrated public demand for argument-based exploration of current issues with complex scientific and ethical dimensions, demonstrated, for example, by the longevity and success of high profile programming featuring topical issues discussed in a stylised argumentative debate format. The second objective of this project is to develop the theory into implemented components that can form a foundation for application development to support actual programmes with prototype testing Unique advantages afforded by the technology will allow users to interact with the programme material as if they were themselves contributors, allowing arguments to be probed, tested and extended, and the distinction between in-programme and post-programme content to be blurred. The interaction metaphor shifts from 'message-then-next-message' to 'question-answer-riposte-challenge...'.The rich structure is natural for users, and provides rich metadata for programme-makers. Finally, in 2007 an exciting vision of the world-wide argumentation web (WWAW) was laid out, in which systems such as those constructed to work alongside practical prototypes could interact, both with each other and with other debate and argumentation systems, both populist and academic.Argument fragments, expressed as resources on the Semantic Web, can cross-refer, allowing different debating systems to navigate the WWAW according to various rules of dialogue captured by dialectical games. To bring this vision of the WWAW into reality, the third and final objective of the project is to allow execution of arbitrary dialogue games on a platform that provides interfaces for human players, and both interfaces and control for computer players of dialogue games. In this way, we want to harness the enormous channel to market and the high-profile reference case that is offered by collaboration within broadcasting. At the same time, the project will be developing platform technology that can support exploitation in other areas. During the project, we will work with the Scottish Mediation Network in the context of mediation tools, with the Ontario courts in the context of judicial summaries, and with the Universities of Lugano and Groningen in the context of legal education to identify exploitation routes for the technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G060347/1","grantId":"EP/G060347/1","fundValue":"561059","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Released as an RDF specification and a database schema (soon to be accompanied by a website targeted at developers and users as well as academics, and to be further accompanied by an academic publication coauthored by an international consortium of 24 academic and industrial contributors), the AIF2 represents an international standard for argument representation which will allow exchange between a wide variety of tools and systems in an increasingly crowded academic and commercial space. The harmonisation developed by the standard aims to be a game changer in facilitating the massive upscaling and reuse of resources and tools.

With this foundation in place, the remainder of the project will focus on publication of results concerning the connection between monological and dialogical forms of argument and debate in both theory and practice, and on the practicalities of real-time analysis. Various tools developed under the aegis of the project have potential for non-academic use, including a stable release of the OVA analysis software suitable for classroom use, and the argublogging tool aimed at the Web 2.0 community of bloggers and content-creators. Further non-academic contexts will be explored further during the remainder of the project. We are continuing to focus on our relationship with the BBC as a primary means to exploitation. A project extension has been sought to facilitate this route to exploitation.
