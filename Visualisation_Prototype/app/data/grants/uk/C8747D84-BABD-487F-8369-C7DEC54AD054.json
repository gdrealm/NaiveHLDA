There is an urgent need for low cost instrumentation that can provide an early warning of slope instability to enable evacuation of vulnerable people and timely repair and maintenance of critical infrastructure. This project aims to design and assess field performance of a prototype acoustic slope displacement rate sensor. Sensors developed through research will be re-engineered and these new sensors will be installed at problem road and rail slopes to investigate how they perform compared to traditional more costly instrumentation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I502041/1","grantId":"EP/I502041/1","fundValue":"41624","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Outputs from trial sites have been used by stakeholders in UK, Italy, Austria and Canada to manage problem slopes and they have demonstrated to end users the benefits of the new approach that has been developed.

It also extended the number of field trials of the sensor and compared performance with traditional deformation monitoring methods. Additional sensors have been installed at a large rock slide complex in the Italian Alps in collaboration with CNR, Italy, and monitoring has detected deformation events in response to rainfall events. In addition, monitoring at a Network Rail cutting and at a coastal landslidewith Halcrow has demonstrated the robustness of the measurement technique and provided proof that the Slope ALARMS sensors can detect periods of slope deformation and indicate displacement rates. Slope ALARMS has the potential to become a standard monitoring approach for detecting landslides. A contract is in progress with German company INGLAS to develop and trial a slope monitoring system, incorporating Slope ALARMS, for the Austrian Railways. Discussions are in progress with potential collaborators around the world to carry out further site trials. The aim is to license the technology. Construction,Environment,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
