MRC?s DPFS initiative is therefore timely and forms an integrated approach with the MRC Translational Funding initiative. This application is for underpinning resource to support UCL?s portfolio of DPFS studies. This will be in the form of staff who will provide research project management support to accelerate the translation of fundamental research ideas into tangible patient benefit. We envisage that UCL will develop an expanding portfolio of DPFS projects supported by the MRC. These will aim to develop new drugs, medical devices and diagnostics in areas of unmet clinical need (including diabetes, heart and brain disease, and infection) that affect the ageing population. We request support for two research project managers to co-ordinate these programmes, work closely with and draw upon a pool of consultants as needed and as our portfolio develops, to manage the entire developmental pathway.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802652","grantId":"G0802652","fundValue":"422611","fundStart":"2009-06-08","fundEnd":"2012-01-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan James Thompson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
