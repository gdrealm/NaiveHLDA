The hypothalamus is one of the most important brain regions involved in the regulation of appetite. When injected directly into the hypothalamus, NPY causes dramatic hunger and obesity. NPY is found in two areas of the hypothalamus, the ARC and the DMH. ARC NPY powerfully stimulates appetite. However, the role of NPY in the DMH in the regulation of appetite is unknown. In obesity, NPY levels are decreased in the ARC but increased in the DMH. My pilot data suggests NPY in the DMH acts to reduce body weight. I will therefore determine the role of NPY in the DMH in the control of food intake and body weight. I hypothesise that NPY in the DMH is important in the regulation of appetite. I will investigate this by increasing and decreasing NPY in the DMH using gene therapy techniques. I will then study the effects of these alterations by measuring food intake, body weight and energy expenditure. These studies offer a possible exciting new insight into the control of appetite and body weight.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E021972/1","grantId":"BB/E021972/1","fundValue":"272603","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a substance occurring naturally in the brain. The hypothalamus is one of the most important brain regions involved in the regulation of appetite. When injected directly into the hypothalamus, NPY causes dramatically increased hunger and results in obesity and this orexigenic action of NPY has become standard dogma. \n\nHowever, NPY is found in two areas of the hypothalamus, the ARC and the DMN. While ARC NPY powerfully stimulates appetite, the role of NPY in the DMN in the regulation of appetite is unknown. Surprisingly, although NPY is down-regulated in the ARC in ob/ob obese mice, it is up-regulated in the DMN suggesting the role in this nucleus is opposite to that in the ARC. To test this hypothesis we used a gene therapy approach. We found that increasing expression of NPY in the DMN decreased food intake and weight gain. The same results were achieved following acute injection of NPY into the DMN; food intake was decreased rather than increased (as it is when NPY is injected into other areas). These findings may explain other studies that have inactivated the NPY gene in mice and found they become obese rather than lose weight as expected. This work has reinforced the differential role of particular neuropeptides in different circuits and thrown light on why global NPY knock-out animals and administration of systemic antagonists of NPY unexpectedly produce a variable phenotype.

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) combined with bilateral stereotactic micro-injection lead to successfully over-expression of NPY specifically within the DMH of male Wistar rats. The over-expression of NPY in the DMH resulted in 52% increase in hypothalamic NPY release. \n2. In line with the pilot data, over-expression of NPY within the DMH resulted in a marked reduction in weight gain and energy intake compared with control animals. This decrease in weight was due to a decrease in body fat with no loss of lean tissue. There was no effect of NPY in the DMN on energy expenditure. \n3. This long-term data is supported by acute injection of NPY into the DMH which resulted in a reduction of food intake in contrast to marked increase in food intake seen when NPY is injected into the PVN. These data suggest that NPY acting within the DMH reduces food intake and body weight. This research may spur the development of pharmaceutical agents which target the NPY system to regulate energy homeostasis Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
