It aims to develop research-informed arts policy and arts interventions designed to improve the wellbeing of older people.</p>\n\n<p>This will be achieved through three seminars that aim to develop new arts policy with partners, identify which interventions work most effectively in different contexts and develop training for carers and art professionals who wish to engage older people. The training will incorporate the design of the facilitated sessions for older people. These sessions will involve participants viewing and considering art, and in some cases creating their own artistic responses to it. This is intended to allow participants to benefit, for example through the exercise of skills in relation to stimuli, the development of knowledge and awareness of art, self-understanding, self-expression and social interaction.</p>\n\n<p>The evaluation of the facilitated sessions will feed into further training to be undertaken with c.100 artists and carers in the region, it will be incorporated into MA programmes delivered at Newcastle University (80 students a year) and rolled out nationally through a presence on the Culture and Wellbeing website and the dissemination strategy.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J001023/1","grantId":"ES/J001023/1","fundValue":"98424","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Newman","coPersons":["Anna  Goulding","Christopher Mark Whitehead"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
