This award will cover our travel and subsistence costs to both STFC and non-STFC observing facilities. The major topics of observational astrophysics research to be covered by the PATT Linked Grant include: \n\n\n- investigations of supernovae and the end stages of stellar evolution; \n\n- high temporal, spatial and spectral resolution observations of the solar atmosphere and those of other cool stars; \n\n- studies of solar system bodies, including comets and asteroids; \n\n- astrochemistry, including that of interstellar and circumstellar clouds; \n\n- detection and characterisation of exoplanets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K001620/1","grantId":"ST/K001620/1","fundValue":"42340","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Grant was not to undertake research, but only to provide travel funds to telescopes to obtain data.
