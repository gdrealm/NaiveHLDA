{"id":"94AB369C-18D7-4720-944B-FD204CB68F3A","title":"MICA: Development of a Clostridium difficile Vaccine","abstractText":"Clostridium difficile infection is a growing problem in the UK, Europe and the USA. In reality this disease which leads to almost 4,000 deaths per year in UK hospitals (4-times more than MRSA) is present worldwide and is a growing burden to public health. The disease affects mostly the elderly and particularly those in hospitals and who are undergoing antibiotic therapy. The only current treatment is the use of antibiotics and no vaccine which could prevent infection by C. difficile is available. In an effort to design and evaluate a suitable vaccine to C. difficile this project will evaluate a novel vaccine which could be taken either orally as a solution, soft tablet or fast-dissolving film. The technology supporting this form of vaccine delivery is already developed and, based on our work to date, should work in humans. The technology is highly innovative, patented and goes beyond the current strategies being developed by industry. As a prelude to evaluation in humans this project will use a rigid program of evaluation to identify the most suitable dose and regimen to prove efficacy. If successful this vaccine to C. difficile would be patient friendly and heat-stable both of which are attributes much needed in future second-generation vaccines. We are partnered with a major industry partner with a long history in vaccine manufacture and this adds to the probability of long-term project delivery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K015354/1","grantId":"MR/K015354/1","fundValue":"474327","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Cutting","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
