It will focus on the importance of memory in establishing and disrupting the emergent local and national communities and in defining relations between place and community, and it will investigate the connections between individual and collective memory. It will also explore the ways in which this period is remembered today, and how communities of interest may emerge in relation to representations of the past (for example reenactment societies or local heritage initiatives). Through its focus on these ways in which popular memory is kept alive over time, the network will ask how studying the making and unmaking of community in the past can illuminate the processes that affect the formation and experience of community in the present. \n\nThe network aims to establish dialogues among individuals and groups working on memory and community in early modern Britain across different academic fields - history, English, archaeology, memory studies. The period was one of rapid and dramatic change. Early modern communities were undergoing transformation and reconstruction, as economic, religious and social change generated new concepts of the nation, reshaped confessional identities, and redefined relations between local and national, urban and rural, rich and poor. Notions of individual identity, and the relation between the self and various wider groupings, from family to nation, were correspondingly reshaped as well. In all these transformations memory played a crucial part: the past was deployed both to establish and to challenge emergent communities. Memory was invoked in the service of competing discourses: for example, to establish national history or common rights; to maintain adherence to the old faith or to reclaim the purity of the early church; to assert ancient lineage or to distribute property amongst descendants. Through a series of four symposia held over two years, the network will explore these various dimensions of memory and community, contributing to a broader understanding of how communities change and develop over time, and of memory as a dynamic social and cultural force. \n\nThe network also aims to build connections between academic and non-academic participants. It will focus on the relationship between memory and place in the making of communities, in order to highlight the links between academic research and the uses of memory work in heritage and regeneration activity. It will explore representations of this period in popular culture - such as films, TV serials, and historical novels - in order to enrich our understanding of how we access and give meaning to the past in our everyday lives. It will engage with a number of modern-day organizations and initiatives, both professional and non-professional, in order to explore the ways in which the memory of the early modern period continues to shape notions of community today. Heritage and culture industry professionals, historical novelists, local history groups and reenactment societies, among others, will be invited to participate in symposia and reflect on the meanings of this period in contemporary culture. The symposia and the project website will thus aim to stimulate creative thought about how early modern memory work in different sectors may be used to enrich and sustain the identities of today's communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J005703/1","grantId":"AH/J005703/1","fundValue":"31834","fundStart":"2012-08-31","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Katharine Delia Hodgkin","coPersons":["Ramona  Wray"],"organisation":"University of East London","findingsText":" Please note that as the project finished two weeks before the deadline for submission of this form it has not been possible to complete our reflections and commentary on the findings as yet.
