{"id":"DB6BF598-A99B-4756-87F3-0065892B2C6C","title":"Flexible Innovation Management of Under Uncertainty","abstractText":"<p>In markets characterised by increasingly rapid change, UK organisations struggle to respond to competitive and technological uncertainties. Unpredictability deters British firms from committing to investments into innovation. The Project Management Institute estimates that more than half of all business development projects fail.However, national and regional economic development falters without sustained investments into innovation. To allow UK firms to maintain a leading position, their innovation processes require the capacity to adapt to environmental dynamics. A greater degree of resource allocation flexibility is needed.</p>\n\n<p>Bidirectional knowledge transfer between the Centre for Strategic Studies (CSS) and Capgemini Consulting aims to address this problem. Capgemini is a leading provider of consultancy services and maintains a network of practitioner experts in innovation. CSS has developed a four-step strategic management approach to investments into high-technology innovation. This approach relies on recent insights from real options research, yielding new methods for placing a statistical value on managerial decision flexibility. If applied correctly, firms can afford to pursue more options simultaneously while controlling capital exposure. However, this requires organisational changes, including enhanced monitoring and selection mechanism. Learning from best-practices in these areas, and disseminating consolidated knowledge to wider audiences, are the key objectives of this impact project.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-185-31-0025","grantId":"RES-185-31-0025","fundValue":"80891","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ronald  Klingebiel","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Anglia Ruskin University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
