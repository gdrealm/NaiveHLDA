{"id":"C98D94D0-D6C5-4C43-AD91-3A0CA1BEAF06","title":"Poland's Influence in the EU: the Case of its Eastern Policy","abstractText":"Whether the European Union will ‘widen’ or ‘deepen’ over the next 10 to 15 years is a question of vital significance to scholars and practitioners working on European integration. This project focuses on two under-researched issues that stand out as particularly important to determining the future direction of the EU. First, will the EU be ‘wider’, specifically what kind of relationship will the EU have with its eastern neighbours: Russia, Ukraine and Belarus – what could be called ‘EU Eastern Policy’. Second, will the EU be ‘deeper’, that is how will the relationship between the EU and its Member States evolve in the medium to long term. The proposed research aims to shed light on both of these crucial areas by looking at the impact of a new Member State on the making of policy towards the EU’s eastern neighbours. It will explore the proposition that the enlargement of the EU has had a profound effect on the EU’s relations with its new neighbours. The case of Poland has been chosen since of all the new Member States, it has the greatest ambitions in shaping policy towards the Union’s eastern neighbours.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2723","grantId":"RES-000-22-2723","fundValue":"8527","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nathaniel William Copsey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
