These components consists of large collections of proteins and lipids, the building blocks of cells, that actually work together to create higher level functions. A useful analogy is that of a city and a cell. A city often requires a wall (an outer lipid membrane), power plants (mitochondria from animal cells, and chloroplasts from plant cells) and factories and engineering firms to repair the city infrastructure (lipid homeostatic machinery). Each of these units is run by workers and machinery (lipids and proteins).In this project, we aim to take apart cells, but not at the level of the workers , instead at the level of the city infrastructure and bring them back together in a different combination with a view to constructing a new city (novel self-assembling micron scale machinery). These components, that we will be 'hi-jacking' from cells will be housed within artificial lipid vesicles that will provide a housing which mimics the ability of cells to ring-fence and protect their infrastructure. It is not yet known which components can be coupled in this manner and this is something that we aim to explore.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H024425/1","grantId":"EP/H024425/1","fundValue":"201409","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The aim of our feasibility account was to investigate how self-assembling amphiphilic structures and various sub-cellular components can be coupled together to make hybrid, self-sustaining microscale machinery (HSSMMs).

This has been achieved by hijacking and manipulating component parts of a living cell's machinery and making them function in simplified contexts within HSSMMs. This set of experiments have established an exciting portfolio of potential technological applications for these micromachines including chemical synthesis, chemical sensing and molecular delivery. \n\nThese pilot studies will make a significant contribution to innovation in the UK industry, with a 10-15 year timeframe for commercial realisation and have strengthened cross-disciplinary networks across the UK bringing together 7 research groups at the Institute of Chemical Biology at Imperial College and the University of Bristol. Our results have underpinned: (i) a successful bid for an EPSRC Programme grant and Frontier Engineering grant (ii) numerous publications (iii) a Royal Society International Meeting where we presented our feasibility roadmap (v) &gt;10 seminars including numerous presentations to industry and (vi) a CDT studentship with Kings College. The PDRAs on the project have benefitted from multi-disciplinary research training and we expect them to be future research leaders as exemplified by 4 follow-on fellowship applications submitted to build upon their contribution to this project.\nResearch highlights include constructing HSSMMs with the ability to:\n1. drive a rotary engine embedded within the containment capsule of a HSSMM. This motor has the potential to drive a micro-propeller that we have produced and that is capable of generating thrust. This engine is driven by ATP (Adenosine-5'- triphosphate). We also demonstrated that in the future it should be possible to regenerate this ATP fuel source using chloroplasts and mitochondria as bio-inspired batteries transplanted from living cells. In the coming months we aim to couple these &quot;batteries&quot; with the molecular rotary engine.\n2. release a pre-packaged cargo in response to a specific external stimulus. This microdelivery device couples a membrane based containment capsule with two molecular machines (A and B). The first (A) modifies the mechanical properties of the containment capsule by altering its chemical composition without compromising structural integrity. The second module (B), embedded within the membrane consists of a channel which can open or close depending on the mechanical properties of the membrane which it can sense. Following the action of module A, module B opens thereby releasing an onboard cargo. During these experiments we have been able to show for the first time that by harnessing nanoscale energetics within membranes, we can drive information flow between molecular machines without the requirement of direct contact. This system is now being translated to a microfluidic device with a view to manufacturing an insulin delivery system.\n3. manufacture an onboard cargo in response to sensing the presence of an external small molecule. This HSSMM contains a linear DNA genome with the genetic information required to produce a coloured gene product after detecting the presence of a specific small molecule, in this case a sugar. This HSSMM mimics the ability of living cells to adapt their response to the environment by altering gene expression. We have also started the development of HSSMMs that couple cargo production with light and evolve over generations.\n\nIn addition, we have developed high-throughput platforms for generating 2-D and 3-D microfluidic droplet interface bilayer (DIBs) networks. These can be used to build up complex HSSMM systems and are now being exploited in two follow-on projects with commercial collaborators. These technologies breakthrough downstream enabled us to develop microfluidic strategies for manufacturing compartmentalised vesicles following the project which thereby tackled a long standing bottleneck in the biotech industry. This programme will make a significant contribution to innovation in UK industry, with a 5-15 year timeframe for commercial realisation. Our early stage proof of concept studies on HSSMM technologies have demonstrated that they have the potential to drive new strategies and approaches to drug molecule-membrane screening (1-5 years), drug delivery (5 years), drug release (5 years), in-situ bio-diagnostics and sensors (5-10 years), small molecule detection/tracking (5-10 years) and the biological microreactors. The latter application is in advanced PoC stages of testing. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
