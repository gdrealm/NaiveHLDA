In the period 2006-2011 the CRS, operated by the UK Data Archive, will continue to run its online, streamlined registration service, but will extend its current functionality by adding in additional user tools, new authentication technology and a more proactive outreach strategy.</p> \n<p>Adding to the CRS will be a new Census Portal that will integrate information about the four Data Census Data Support Units (DSUs) into a single unified website, resource discovery point and census catalogue.&nbsp;In providing a similar ‘look and feel’ to census data resources, both the new and expert user's experience of data discovery and terms and conditions of access to resources will be made easier. An outreach service will provide promotion and training events and materials, and will monitor user needs via the use of user query tracking and user consultation.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D000068/1","grantId":"ES/D000068/1","fundValue":"1552200","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew  WoollardLucy  Bell","coPersons":["Kevin  Schurer"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
