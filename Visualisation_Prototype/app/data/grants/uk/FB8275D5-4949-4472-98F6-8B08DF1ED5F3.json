My excavation at Majaladares gained valuable data about horse riding in a subsistence economy that thrived around 2000 BC on the dry lands of Spain. They will help to invigorate debates about physical mobility, the rise and decline of pastoral modes of exploitations, and the eventual appearance of mounted warrior aristocracies across the whole field of later European prehistory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112543/1","grantId":"112543/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Harrison","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
