{"id":"6477F971-0591-442C-86B5-47CFDA44D420","title":"Early Modern Dress in Your Hands","abstractText":"There is an international fascination with clothing and fashion. This is, in part, because clothing brings the past closer. It seems both familiar - we can imagine ourselves wearing these garments - and exotic - how could someone have possibly managed to wear such odd and uncomfortable clothing? But dress and textiles are fragile objects that require specialist display facilities; historic fabrics cannot be shown and handled with ease. Remaining behind glass, items that the public most want to touch, try on and experience, can seem removed from all but the most expert of visitors. Paradoxically, the materials that offer one of the most accessible routes to an understanding of our shared past are amongst the most difficult to access. \n\nThe aim of this project is to break down these barriers and create a stimulating experience of Early Modern dress for a range of different audiences, an experience that is firmly rooted in AHRC-funded research. It will take the new knowledge that was developed between 2007 and 2009 through the AHRC Early Modern Dress and Textiles network and animate the understanding of Early Modern Fashion at the V&amp;A. Over a 12 month period, the V&amp;A's curatorial and learning staff and their collaborators will reach a broad audience through two in-depth, museum-based targeted projects: creating new resources for secondary school teachers and designing and delivering a performance project with a community group. These will be supplemented by additional online resources for a general audience, including a professionally produced film that will provide insights into how clothing was perceived from a literary as well as historical point of view. The entire project will be book-ended by evaluation workshops with key partners to ensure that the broader UK museum community can benefit from our learning.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N003462/1","grantId":"AH/N003462/1","fundValue":"78287","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Evelyn  Welch","coPersons":["Lesley Ellis Miller","Susan  North"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
