Industrial Network and Institutional Perspectives on Economic Growth and Well-being.","abstractText":"Many urban regions in Europe have been hit hard by the economic crisis, but some regions have been more resilient than others. The question is why. Our project will investigate how European regions have responded to economic shocks, how successful they have been in developing new industries, and whether economic resilience goes hand in hand with higher social well-being. We employ a comprehensive approach to regional resilience in which history is key to understand how regions develop new growth paths. We will also investigate whether regions that are strongly linked with other regions through different kinds of networks are more resilient, and which institutions and policy approaches have proved more effective. These questions are investigated in quantitative comparative analyses of urban regions in the EU-27, and through a more in-depth analysis carried out for a few selected regions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M008436/1","grantId":"ES/M008436/1","fundValue":"298391","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simona  Iammarino","coPersons":["Riccardo  Crescenzi"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
