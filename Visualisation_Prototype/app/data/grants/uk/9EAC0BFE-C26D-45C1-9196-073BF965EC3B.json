{"id":"9EAC0BFE-C26D-45C1-9196-073BF965EC3B","title":"Salmonella virulence","abstractText":"Salmonella species are important bacterial pathogens causing a variety of human diseases, such as gastroenteritis and typhoid. Salmonella has the ability to invade and grow inside the cells of its host, including specialised white blood cells (macrophages) whose function is to destroy potential pathogens. Having entered host cells, Salmonella resides within a membranous sac (vacuole), whose characteristics and fate are controlled by the pathogen. Salmonella achieves this by injecting a large number of virulence proteins into the host cell, some of which are inserted into the vacuole membrane itself. These bacterial proteins have two effects: they prevent the delivery of toxic materials to the vacuole, which normally occurs following ingestion of a microbe by a macrophage, and they enable bacterial replication. We identified an important group of these virulence proteins several years ago, and we now know a great deal about the genes that encode them and have gained some insights as to how the proteins work. The proposed research involves detailed investigations into their functions at the molecular level, including the identification of the cellular ?targets? with which they must interact to interfere with the host. In the process we are likely to discover new processes of pathogen and host cell biology, which could have implications for other important pathogens that replicate in host cells, such as Chlamydia (which causes childhood pneumonia and sexually transmitted disease) and Mycobacterium (which causes tuberculosis and leprosy). Our work is also likely to provide valuable information for the design of novel, rationally designed vaccines, which are essential to provide effective long term protection against Salmonella and other bacterial pathogens.\n\nInformation about our work has been communicated to the lay public through radio interviews and newspaper and magazine articles, following press releases from Imperial College and the scientific journals which publish our work. For example, following the publication of our EMBO Journal paper in 2000, I was interviewed on the Today Programme (BBC Radio 4), and articles on the work appeared in the Daily Telegraph and The Financial Times.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9717183","grantId":"G9717183","fundValue":"1762880","fundStart":"1998-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David W Holden","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
