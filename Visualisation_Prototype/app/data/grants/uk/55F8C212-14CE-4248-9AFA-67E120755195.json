{"id":"55F8C212-14CE-4248-9AFA-67E120755195","title":"EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Medical Devices","abstractText":"The EPSRC Centre in Innovative Manufacturing in Medical Devices will research and develop advanced methods for functionally stratified design and near patient manufacturing, to enable cost effective matching of device function to the patient needs and surgical environment. This will deliver &quot;the right product, by the right process to the right patient at the right time&quot; to an enhanced standard of reliability and performance. The centre will research and develop:\n1) Functionally stratified design systems, which will be initially applied to existing device manufacturing processes and subsequently to the manufacture of scaffolds, developing novel pre-clinical simulation methods, which match implant design to patient function, delivering a cost effective Stratified Approach for Enhanced Reliability (SAFER)\n2) Innovative near patient manufacturing processes, enabled by stratified and individualised definitions of patient need, to provide a more cost effective approach to personalised devices.\n\nThe two flagship challenges will be integrated with the key platform capabilities, across the centre to generate, for the first time, a closed loop design and manufacturing framework for medical devices to deliver enhanced performance and reliability. These innovative design and manufacturing advances will focus in the first instance on class 3 medical devices for musculoskeletal disease, where the cost of device failure and need for throughout life reliability are high. \n\nThe National Centre will develop, lead and integrate an international network of industrialists, academics, clinicians and regulatory body representatives in order to support the musculoskeletal medical device manufacturing industry to deliver the innovative design and manufacturing challenges and implement the outcomes into manufacturing practice in a global highly regulated market. The Centre will create the research infrastructure, tools and methods, expertise and suitably qualified personnel to support continued innovation and growth of the medical device manufacturing sector in the UK. To do so, the Centre will work across the EPSRC priority research areas &quot;Manufacturing the Future&quot; and &quot;Towards next generation healthcare,&quot; drawing upon capabilities and collaborating with existing centres of excellence. The Centre will provide a platform for fundamental innovative device manufacturing research and promote its rapid exploitation by industry through outreach and translation activities and a generic platform for diversification into other technologies. \n\nIt will grow the UK's research capability in medical device manufacturing research to underpin the development of next generation medical devices and the development of high quality manufacturing processes to provide cost effective, reliable and effective devices. It will be applied to enhanced manufacturing of existing devices such as joint replacements and support manufacture of new products and biomaterial scaffolds. The Centre will operate across five leading academic centres of excellence in the field. The Centre will be led by Leeds University (Fisher, Williams, Ingham, Wilcox, Jennings and Redmond) and will be supported by collaboration from Newcastle (Dalgarno and McKaskie), Nottingham (Grant, Ahmed and Warrior), Sheffield (Hatton) and Bradford (Coates). The Centre will work closely with major manufacturers and users including surgeons who see at first hand the challenges of patient and surgical variation. The Centre will provide a platform for developing fundamental medical device manufacturing science and promote its rapid exploitation by industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K029592/1","grantId":"EP/K029592/1","fundValue":"5666850","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Medical Devices, is developing new methodologies for stratified and personalised design and manufacture of innovative technologies and products, focusing initially on the musculoskeletal system to support 50 active years after fifty (R) in a healthy ageing population. \nResearch addresses all elements of the manufacturing value chain from product concept to patient delivery and adoption: focusing on novel virtual models for functional simulation; design and prediction of performance; near patient manufacturing; and enhanced pre-clinical test methods using Stratified Approaches For Enhanced Reliability - SAFER.\n\nEstablishing the Centre's External Advisory Board\nA twenty-strong board of global leaders in medical device innovation has provided us with industrial, academic, clinical, regulatory and policy perspectives.\nOutcomes: The Board members' valuable insights have shaped and steered the strategic direction of our programmes. Their input has led to refinement of our vision and more effective communication; helped develop our strategy; defined clinical and patient needs; and improved the definition of the market, regulatory pathways and future challenges\n\nGrowing the MeDe Innovation Network:\nDissemination of research is central to the Centre's mission and we are already building a strong community to ensure we gain input from those working across the medical devices sector in the UK:\nLaunch conference\nAlong with presentations on industry challenges from our collaborators, delegates were given the opportunity to question panels of experts in the sector; make contacts and learn more about our partners in the exhibition area; and to make suggestions and give feedback on how we can support our growing network.\nRelationship development\nAn 'Associate' membership model has been established to develop relationships made through the work of the Centre. Associate members have access to information about manufacturing research (from our Centre's research outputs, international partnerships, and clinical centres in medical device innovation); updates on sector news, through e-newsletters, network events and an annual review; and marketing opportunities through the Centre's digital channels and national PR opportunities with trade press.\nHosting sector-led events\nFeedback from the community told us that there was an appetite for detailed, research-focussed events. Three workshops in key areas of our research (biological and biomimetic materials for medical devices; in-clinic and near-patient manufacturing; and stratified design and manufacture) have been scheduled in 2014. The events give members: updates on the Centre's latest scientific progress; perspectives from across the sector including regulatory and clinical; panels of experts to gain opinions and insights; and networking time to identify opportunities for collaboration.\nOutcomes: Our launch event was attended by over 230 delegates from across the medical devices sector. Since then the network has gained strong support with a total of 398 members (over 40% from industry). Our research workshops are each attracting between 60-80 registrations.\n\nFifteen companies are working alongside us to address our key research challenges, each having pledged time, expertise and funding. These partners work alongside our academic and clinical partners developing new projects; further leveraging funding and resources, and delivering value from our research.\nOutcomes: Since initiation, forty new collaborative projects have commenced in collaboration with fifteen industry partners. The Centre has leveraged significant further funding: a ?2m direct contribution from industry and partners, further ?3m of other research leverage and ?7m leverage for training through the new CDT in Medical and Biological Engineering (?4m EPSRC). The University of Leeds has committed ?1m capital investment as well as investing in four new research posts of 3-5years with a total of ?1m investment. The total leverage of investment for the Centre, to date, weighs-in at ?14m.\n\nExamples of impact and technical outcomes and industry uptake in their development and manufacturing processes include\nNew functional design simulation methods are being adopted by industry partners\nNew enhanced pre clinical test simulation methods are being adopted by industry partners Healthcare Societal,Economic","person":"John  Fisher","coPersons":["Phil David Coates","Paul Vincent Hatton","Ceri  Williams","David Malcolm Grant","Kenneth William Dalgarno"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" The EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Medical Devices, is developing new methodologies for stratified and personalised design and manufacture of innovative technologies and products, focusing initially on the musculoskeletal system to support 50 active years after fifty (R) in a healthy ageing population. \nResearch addresses all elements of the manufacturing value chain from product concept to patient delivery and adoption: focusing on novel virtual models for functional simulation; design and prediction of performance; near patient manufacturing; and enhanced pre-clinical test methods using Stratified Approaches For Enhanced Reliability - SAFER. \n\nAfter one year since starting, over forty collaborative research projects have been started with industry engagement and collaboration.
