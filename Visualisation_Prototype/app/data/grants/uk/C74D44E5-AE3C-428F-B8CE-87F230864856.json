Despite intense selection on reproductive success paternity remains highy variable, and understanding the mechanisms underpinning this variation is a fundamental challenge in Biology. Increasing evidence indicates that an important source of variation in paternity originates from processes occurring after insemination. In most organisms the ejaculates of multiple males often compete to fertilise a set of eggs, and females can drastically influence the outcome of this competition through biased responses to the sperm of different males. Females are expected to bias fertilisation in favour of males of higher genetic quality in order to increase the success of their offspring. Because the genetic diversity (heterozyosity) of an individual promotes survival, a increasingly topical hypothesis is that females preferentially utilise the sperm of males that are genetically different from the female to promote offspring heterozygosity. However, evidence for this hypothesis is ambiguous and -contrary to theory- females may often bias fertilisation in favour of genetically similar rather than dissimilar males. Recent evidence from different species including our own work in the red junglefowl indicates that this counterintuitive response may be regulated by genetic similarity at the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). The MHC is a complex of genes that play a fundamental role in immune responses allowing the organism to recognise self from non-self and respond against cells that are not recognised as self. While this immune response enables the organism to combat pathogens and parasites it may also result in a side-effect differential response to sperm of different males. Namely, we expect the female immune system to tolerate sperm of males that share MHC genes with the female and discriminate against the sperm of males that have a different MHC profile. As it is typical of similar immune responses, we also expect female response to the sperm of a certain MHC similarity with the female to change as the female is exposed to successive inseminations with the same type of sperm. It is plausible that, through continued exposure, the female immune system 'learns' to recognise MHC-similar sperm type, thus reducing the bias in paternity. This novel hypothesis is founded on well established immunological mechanisms and represents a biologically plausible proximate explanation consistent with an emergent trend of studies indicating that fertilisation may be biased in favour of genetically similar partners. Elucidating the consequences of MHC-mediated immune responses for female sperm selection would therefore contribute to unravel the mechanisms underpinning variation in paternity in natural populations. The aim of the proposed research is to test experimentally different key predictions of the hypothesis that fertilisation is biased by MHC-mediated immunological responses of the female reproductive tract to the ejaculates of different males. We will test these predictions in a well characterised population of red junglefowl. Red junglefowl are the wild ancestor of the domestic chicken and an ideal system to study MHC-mediated female sperm selection. First, females typically obtain ejaculates from multiple males and are known to bias fertilisation in different ways, including in favour of MHC-similar sperm. Second, poultry techniques of artificial insemination and sperm assays enable us to study post-insemination processes non-invasively and under controlled conditions. Third, the MHC of the fowl is very simple and extremely well characterised. Finally, we have a deep understanding of the mechanisms that modulate paternity skews in this species, including the role of MHC similarity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H008047/1","grantId":"NE/H008047/1","fundValue":"562769","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The overall goal of the current project licence is to determine the role of female immunity in sperm selection and fertilisation bias in a population of red junglefowl, Gallus gallus. Specifically, the project seeks to address the following objectives:\n1. To investigate patterns of MHC-dependent fertilisation bias and temporal dynamics arising over experimental repeated female exposure (indicative of acquired responses).\n2. To establish which immune responses are induced in the female reproductive tract by insemination.\n3. To test the effect of immune manipulation on MHC-dependent anti-sperm responses. \n4. To determine candidate sperm-expressed MHC-linked target(s) under immune selection. \n\nThe project has produced substantial experimental results against each one of these objectives to make a very considerable contribution to our understanding of how female immune responses impact fertilisation dynamics in vertebrates. \n1. Using a dataset previously collected from the ancestral study population in Sweden we were able to demonstrate a potential role for MHC similarity in competitive fertilisation dynamics (L?vlie et al. 2013 Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. B), which has paved the way and informed further experimental work on the study population. This work has demonstrated through artificial insemination experiments that female sperm utilisation is inherently and repeatedly biased towards specific males, and that cumulative sperm exposure strongly changes such bias over time. These temporal dynamics are complex: females that don't respond strongly against the sperm of a particular male tend to mount a progressively stronger response against his sperm over successive weeks of exposure to the sperm of this male, while females that display a strong initial response against the sperm of a male tend to become more tolerant of his sperm over time. We have further shown that these temporal dynamics predict the outcome of fertilisation when the sperm of a male immunologically familiar to a female compete with the sperm of an immunologically novel male. \n2. We have developed a range of in vitro assays to demonstrate that the in vivo patterns described above are determined by two distinct responses by acquired and innate immunity. Acquired. We have detected that in vitro sperm exposure to female blood plasma leads to rapid agglutination of sperm cells and a drastic reduction in the swimming velocity of non-agglutinated sperm. These effects persist even at very low titrations, and are repeatable and differential for individual male:female combinations indicating that some females respond consistently more strongly to the sperm of certain males. These biases arise in virgin females following the onset of egg laying, indicating that sperm bias are inherent and triggered by sexual maturity. Using a combination of ELISAs, Western Blots, and heat denaturation assays we have shown that these responses are mediated by antibodies, specifically IgM. Importantly, the in vitro response of female plasma to the sperm of a male predicts the patterns of sperm utilisation by a female following artificial insemination by the same sperm donor, confirming that the in vitro assay can be used as predictive tool of in vivo responses. Work based on immunoprecipitation and proteomics is on-going to identify the sperm antigens mediating this acquired response, and their potential polymorphism in the study population. Innate. We have shown that chicken macrophages engulf live sperm cells through phagocytosis in vitro, and that the sperm of certain males trigger a macrophage response that is consistently stronger (more sperm engulfed faster) across females that the sperm of other males. In other words, variation in innate responses appear determined by male effects rather than by male:female interactions (unlike the acquired responses outlined above). Further work is on-going to identify the specific mechanisms mediating this response. Preliminary results indicate that Pattern Receognition Receptors are involved in the recognition of sperm antigens. More specificially, it would appear that recognition is mediated by avian Toll-Like Receptor 15 (TLR15), possibly triggered by hyaluronic acid generated by the enzymatic activity of sperm cells. \n3. We have conducted a vaccination experiment in which females were immunised with the sperm of a particular donor, to show that vaccination had a profound impact on temporal patterns of sperm utilisation, providing further confirmation of the involvement of acquired responses. Preliminary results show that in vivo patterns of female sperm utilisation are strongly influenced by the genetic relatedness between the female and the sperm donor. We are in the process of determining the role of MHC similarity in these immune responses. \n4. A preliminary experiment in which semen from MHC-heterozygous males was inseminated in MHC-homozygous females revealed no evidence of female selection of sperm based on sperm MHC haplotype. We are conducting a number of molecular assays to identify the sperm antigens triggering both acquired and innate responses (see above). \n\nTogether, the results confirm the general expectation that female acquired immunity generates temporally dynamic bias in sperm utilisation and fertilisation. However, the mechanisms are substantially more complex than anticipated. First temporal patterns are explained by the interaction between cumulative exposure and initial female bias. Second, the innate immunity plays an additional independent role in sperm utilisation.

We have found that in vitro the blood plasma of sexually mature females can rapidly agglutinate thousands of sperm cells together, and that repeatable variation occurs amongst male:female combinations in the rate at which sperm are agglutinated. We have accumulated in vitro evidence that sperm agglutination is largely caused by plasma immunoglobulins (IgY and IgA), and that agglutinated sperm are subsequently neutralised by macrophages. Crucially, we have demonstrated that the rate at which the plasma of a female agglutinates the sperm of a male in vitro predicts the number of sperm from this male that reach the eggs of this female following artificial insemination, indicating that the in vitro assay measures an in vivo immunological response of the female reproductive tract that has repercussions for sperm storage and fertilization. These findings have critical implications for the management of fertility in commercial poultry flocks. The results of the present project are informing a Stand Alone LINK BBSRC Grant in collaboration with a poultry industry (AVIAGEN) to resolve the mechanisms underpinning infertility in broiler breeder flocks (BB/L009587/1). We are in the process of investigating the biological significance of these findings in three ways. First, we are conducting experiments to test whether differential agglutination responses to individual males translate into differential fertilization success, by inseminating sperm from two rival sperm donors into individual females. Second, heat denaturation assays indicate that sperm antigenic properties are caused by protein(s). We are now utilising a range of molecular techniques (e.g. Western blotting, Ig depletion) to identify these protein(s). Third, we will experimentally immunise females with the sperm of a particular male to establish whether this causes changes in a female agglutination response, as predicted by immunological principles. This will lead to a fuller understanding of the evolutionary importance of these newly discovered immune responses and the underpinning molecular (and ultimately genetic) mechanisms.
