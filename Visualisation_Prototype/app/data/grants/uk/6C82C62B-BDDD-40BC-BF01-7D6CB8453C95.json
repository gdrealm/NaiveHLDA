People hold different meanings for this transition from life to death, and these different constructions shape the way in which the transition is perceived, managed and experienced by older people. Two bodies of knowledge, palliative care and gerontology, underpin the care provided for older people as they near their own dying and death. There is the potential to create a new dynamic area of knowledge that is reflective of, and relevant to older people with regard to dying in old age, synthesising knowledge, drawn from these two areas, and others. In order to develop this new knowledge the planned seminar series will focus on the following four aspects of the living-dying experience.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Seminar 1: Places where Dying in Old Age Occurs<br /></li>\n\n <li>Seminar 2: Processes of Dying in Old Age<br /></li>\n\n <li>Seminar 3: Priorities for Older People Facing Death in Old Age<br /></li>\n\n <li>Seminar 4: Planning for Death in Old Age</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Prior to each seminar a separate Open Space event will be held with older people to engage with the topic under consideration and to identify what and how older people’s perspectives on this focus will be incorporated into the seminar.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4276","grantId":"RES-451-25-4276","fundValue":"10474","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings of the Research Seminar Series have been used to generate publications and collaborative links between user groups, stakeholders and academic researchers, leading to further funding awards.\nThe findings have fed into a further book which was awarded the Society of Authors/RSM Non-Clinical Book of 2008).

For example, in Seminar 2, social science perspectives were brought to bear on palliative care issues in challenging discussion that were held, regarding whether or not dementia is a ‘terminal illness’ and what difference it would make if dementia was seen like this in clinical care. \nNew ways to understand dying in specific care settings eg nursing homes were also developed, bringing theory (Habermas) to bear upon the reality of life and death for older people in the setting. . The findings offer a way to understand living and dying in a non-dualistic way, that encompasses both elements as universal human experiences. Further publications have arisen building upon some of this work. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
