However, there are risks from premature delivery and choosing the right time is an inexact science. It has only been evaluated properly once, by the MRC s Growth Restriction Intervention Trial, which included 548 women delivering 589 babies. That trial showed that as far as mortality was concerned obstetricians were delivering babies at about the right time i.e. - stillbirths from leaving the baby too long were almost exactly counter balanced by neonatal deaths from prematurity. However, we still do not know which course of action is best for the development of the baby s brain, both the prevention of cerebral palsy and also for intellectual development. The babies from the trial are currently being evaluated at 2 years of age but some of the older ones are already nearing the age of 6. The present study is to evaluate all the babies again between the ages of 6 and 9 and look in detail at their physical and educational attainments to see if either obstetric policy is beneficial at this late stage.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9533539","grantId":"G9533539","fundValue":"975063","fundStart":"1997-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-27","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Thornton","coPersons":["Neil  Marlow","Dieter  Wolke","Andy  Vail","Malcolm Irvin Levene","Janet  Hornbuckle"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
