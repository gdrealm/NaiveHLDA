{"id":"AC7CDD4A-C3CC-4799-9BAB-DAD12E16785B","title":"The codification and regulation of architects' practices","abstractText":"The research will generate critical insight into building rules and regulations and their relationships to architecture and its conceptual schema and practices. Architecture is influenced and shaped by building regulations or rules that are formulated to provide specific and predictable outcomes for all aspects of architectural production, from conceptual design to urban form. Such regulations are not necessarily enshrined in law but are systematic sets of rules characterised and differentiated by authorship, context, and implementation. In all instances, rules and regulations pervade and influence, or codify architects' practices, yet little is known about their impacts on, and implications for, architecture and the production of the built environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119248/1","grantId":"119248/1","fundValue":"84760","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rob  Imrie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
