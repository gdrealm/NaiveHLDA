The causative virus, called Marek's disease virus (MDV) induces a very severe form of cancer of the white blood cells (lymphocytes). Once infected, the virus can persist for the lifetime of the host and is continuously shed from the feather of the infected birds into the environment where it survives for long periods. The mechanisms by which MDV causes cancer is not known. The present project is aimed to identify the mechanisms of causation of the disease by the virus. Recently, several small RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be involved in different cellular processes including several human cancers. Such small miRNA molecules have been found in the chickens and we have also recently identified several miRNAs in the virus. The present project is aimed to examine whether these small miRNA are involved in the causation of MD.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D012996/1","grantId":"BB/D012996/1","fundValue":"282631","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Venugopal  Nair","coPersons":["Michael Bryan Watson"],"organisation":"The Pirbright Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
