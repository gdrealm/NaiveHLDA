Our experience at UEA tells us that the process is much the same, whether the idea originates in the community or in the academy. An idea always leads to further questions and many possible leads. At this stage it is important to ask the right questions, provide the right advice and find a focus. As a part of the 'brokerage' phase in the wider AHRC initiative linked with the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and potentially other partners, UEA's Research for Community Heritage Ideas Bank enables us to start with the idea. This virtual bank, accessed via webpages hosted on UEA's website, linked via key partner networks and promoted via a communications plan that will include face-to-face events and meetings by a team of postgraduate researchers, will gather ideas from communities and from researchers. Our wrap-around engagement and support activities for all stakeholders, before and after the live deposit period, will underpin and provide a platform upon which researchers and communities can come together and co-create a blueprint for the community heritage projects which may be eligible for the HLF funding.\n\nWhy a virtual ideas bank - UEA is located on the hinterland of East Anglia, a region with a population of around 3.4 million people living in rural, town, city and coastal communities in Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire &amp; Essex. Hosting one or more open days either on campus or at different locations would not enable us to reach a broad enough audience and might even attract only the 'usual' suspects; that is, those who already engage with the University. The virtual Ideas Bank will give the project another dimension by enabling us to scale up our reach throughout the Region. The Ideas Bank will also be open to all UEA researchers in HUM and in other UEA faculties, particularly the Faculty of Social Sciences of which two members of the research team are members.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013455/1","grantId":"AH/J013455/1","fundValue":"19958","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2013-01-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  A key part of the Ideas Bank project was to support community groups in developing an application to the All Our Stories scheme of the Heritage Lottery Fund. The project team worked with 49 community groups across the UK, many of whom had not worked with the UEA before. Developing these relationships has been particularly important; some groups were successful in their applications to the HLF and went on to work with the project team in the second phase of the Ideas Bank project, and we have also maintained links with those who did not submit applications to the HLF (which has led to two separate projects with staff from the School of History). We worked closely with funded groups to identify their needs in terms of research support and skills training which fed into our Phase 2 project.?

The need for digital and web-based training was a particularly strong theme with many community groups. The findings from this phase of the project could be used by academics interested in the role and value of heritage within local communities, and by anyone interested in developing close working relationships between community groups and universities.
