It is significant that the technology transfer from one discipline to another has given rise to many of the emerging technologies that are of direct benefit to mankind. The PI has developed a thorough and solid grounding in structural dynamics, aeroelasticity, composite materials and symbolic computation at City University which is recognised both nationally and internationally. A significant part of his research is transferable to a number of other disciplines. Foremost amongst these, are nano-technology and biomechanics. He now intends to develop the dynamic stiffness theories of nano-structures, particularly for a nano-carbon tube for which the size effect is crucially important. He would like to diversify his research interest to encompass biomechanical engineering in which he intends to predict the strength, stiffness and dynamic properties of human bones and muscles. Stanford University which promotes and fosters these areas of research is ideally suited to the PI who wishes to be involved and gather necessary background information for future exploitation. Another important area of the PI's long-standing interest is in the interdisciplinary field of aircraft design. In recent years, the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics of Stanford University has produced a number of novel and pioneering designs of unconventional and non-standard aircraft of different types. Some of these examples include blended wing-body design, flying and flapping wings, tailless and morphing aircraft. The PI has carried out detailed aeroelastic analysis on tailless aircraft wherein he investigated the interaction of the rigid-body motion with the elastic modes of distortion. Clearly, an interaction with the researchers at Stanford University will be of great value.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G023123/1","grantId":"EP/G023123/1","fundValue":"7823","fundStart":"2008-08-04","fundEnd":"2008-11-03","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ranjan  Banerjee","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
