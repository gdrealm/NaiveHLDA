{"id":"AA45D3CF-3839-47C4-9E9C-03E19A09DAFC","title":"BepiColumbo MIXS lead Co-Investigator Bridging Grant","abstractText":"BepiColombo is the European Space Agency's mission to Mercury, expected to begin orbiting the planet in 2024. It is a highly-capable pair of spacecraft, equipped with a UK-led X-ray imager (MIXS) that will give much-needed compositional data. MIXS has now been delivered to ESA, and this award fills a one-year gap between the end of my support from the UK Space Agency and the opportunity to secure longer-term support for my role on the BepoColombo team from STFC via my Department's next Consolidated Grant proposal.\n\nAs a member of the BepiColombo 'science team' I expect to continue to attend meetings of the BepiColombo Science Working Team (annual) and usually also of the BepiColombo Science Working Group (annual). I am playing a major role in training the next-generation of UK Mercury scientists through supervision of PhD students, and this award puts me in a position to do that effectively - even though they are not funded through this award directly.\n\nI will continue to attend the Lunar &amp; Planetary Science conference (Houston), as the most appropriate annual forum for Mercury surface and compositional science, and also more local meetings such as EGU (Vienna). \n\nThere will be a solar transit of Mercury on 9 May 2016. The timing is ideal for viewing from the UK, starting 11:12 and ending 18:42 UT (12:12-19:42 BST). I aim to use my position to make this a national media event (possibly a Sky at Night or StargazingLive TV special), and to take advantage of this to interest the public in Mercury and to raise awareness of MIXS and BepiColombo in general. There are already some Mercury videos in production (with OU funding), I am encouraging amateur astronomy societies to take their solar telescopes onto the streets to show the transit to the public, and I have arranged for ESA to webstream the transit live from space for the benefit of people who are clouded out.
