We have put forward languages to specify security protocols and developed new effective ways to verify their correctness. We have been able to verify protocols before deployment and put forward techniques to detect anomalies at run time. The software we released is open source and can be suitably extended by others. The theory we developed is published in academic journals and conferences and can likewise be extended. \n\nIn a security context the methodology can be expanded to assess privacy properties in communication protocols and the robustness of evoting protocols.
