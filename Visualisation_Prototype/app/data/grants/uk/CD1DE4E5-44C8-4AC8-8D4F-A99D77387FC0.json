Highlights include:\nLabour supply modelling and Universal Credit \nIn September 2013, IFS held a conference in Westminster focused on welfare reform, Universal Credit and labour supply. Researchers launched a briefing note analysing the effect of the coalition government's welfare reforms on financial work incentives, and presented estimates of possible responses to those incentives based on labour supply models developed in other Centre-funded research. Fran Bennett (Women's Budget Group and University of Oxford) discussed the design of Universal Credit's assessment, claims and payments process, while Stephen Brien (DWP) presented a government perspective. The event was well attended and received much media coverage, including a leading article in the Daily Mail. \nSingle-tier pension policy engagement \nCentre researchers have been significantly involved in providing commentary on government proposals for a single-tier flat-rate pension. Analysts met numerous times with Treasury officials and DWP at their request, to discuss the implications of the proposed reforms. Researchers set out independent analysis of the impact of the single-tier pension in written and verbal evidence to the Parliamentary Work and Pensions Select Committee. Centre staff also published a full report on the implications of the bill. The Centre's independent analysis provided much-needed clarity for government officials, enabling them to give a more realistic picture of the winners and losers from the reform. The research also informed the wider public, as evidenced by attendees at the report's launch event, who included representatives from academia, the press, the charity sector and the private sector. The report has been downloaded over 17,000 times since its publication.

Over the course of the year, researchers at CPP have made extensive scientific contributions and engaged in numerous activities delivering both academic and policy impact. We have contributed a series of new results across the broad range of areas covered by the Research Centre. We have continued to place emphasis on the dissemination of our research to both academic and policy audiences in the UK and abroad. We have also retained our focus on capacity building through the training of young researchers in the skills of empirically founded policy research. We have secured new co-funding and laid the groundwork for the research that we hope to develop over the course of the next year. \n\nAs growth has slowly returned to the economy over the last year, there has been a heightened interest in the reform of the tax and welfare system and a huge demand for our expertise in the policy debate. This has resulted in extensive research at CPP on the modelling of households, consumers and firms and the way they react to policy. We have now also established a substantial international dimension to our work, with scientific research and policy analysis extending to Europe, Asia and North America as well as many developing country regions. \nWe do not have space in this report to detail the extensive impact we had on the day-to-day debate on the design, reform and operation of policy, which this year spanned all areas of government economic policy including direct taxes and benefits, indirect taxes, corporate taxes and government spending. Full details are well documented in the outputs and KPI sections of this report. Our findings have direct relevance to policy. They are used and will be used by policymakers and parliamentarians, as well as other practitioners and the media to understand the implications of policy proposals.
