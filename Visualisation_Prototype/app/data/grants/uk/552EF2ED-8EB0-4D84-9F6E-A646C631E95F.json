This can be due to the deposition of thermally unstable components in the fluid: such as the denatured protein that forms when milk is boiled in a saucepan or a food process plant: or from the growth of microorganisms in films on the surface. Fouling deposit endangers both food quality and safety, through the contamination of product that enters the food chain, and the possible presence of pathogens. The problem of fouling is widespread; as a result, cleaning-in-place (CIP) is a common operation within the food industry. Cleaning protocols are however often empirical and are rarely if ever optimised. The long term industrial aims of research into cleaning are: Increased food safety by improving and ensuring cleaning efficiency; minimising environmental impact by reducing the amount and COD of effluent; increased manufacturing efficiency through extension of run length and minimisation of cleaning time. To optimise cleaning requires better understanding of fouling deposits and how they change during processing (ageing) and cleaning. In this project we will study the materials properties of fouling deposits, and how they change. The forces between elements of the deposit, and the forces binding the deposit to the surface, will be measured. A model for the process will be constructed and validated against experiment. This model will then be used to study whether it is possible to change industrial cleaning methods.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D523386/1","grantId":"BB/D523386/1","fundValue":"236566","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Jonathan Fryer","coPersons":["Michael John Adams","Zhibing  Zhang"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
