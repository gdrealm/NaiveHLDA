The enhancements will include: 1) adaptation of the system for saliva sampling; 2) communication of results to an integrated database as a step towards a comprehensive UK disease surveillance programme in the future 3) an accredited sequencing service at The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) to genetically characterise positive samples found at the farm using CBL's screening system. This project has the potential to change the way the UK and international farming and food industry monitors disease threats, by establishing a joined-up diagnostic and genetic characterisation service that would improve both the quality and coverage of disease surveillance, addressing key government and industry objectives and problems. Four partners will participate with CBL: Tulip Ltd., Sarum Hydraulics Ltd., University of the West of England and The Genomics Analysis Centre.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M028410/1","grantId":"BB/M028410/1","fundValue":"141701","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Janice  Kiely","coPersons":["Richard William Luxton"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
