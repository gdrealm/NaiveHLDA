Candidate devices will have to be characterized before and after irradiation to see whether they can retain low leakage currents, and remain capable of switching High Voltages over their intended lifetime, while being exposed to very high irradiation levels.\nTo complete the test stand, a high quality High Voltage source is essential.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M000079/1","grantId":"ST/M000079/1","fundValue":"16618","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Only within our collaboration.
