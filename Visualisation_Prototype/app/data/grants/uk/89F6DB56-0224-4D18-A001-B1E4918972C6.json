The Isle of Man was one of three case studies for this project, when annual prayer walks to the remains of medieval chapels known as keeills were studied as there is no designated pilgrimage route on the Island. This original research project evidenced the demand for and appreciation of current occasional opportunities for residents and visitors to engage with the faith heritage of the Island, as well as a significant potential audience and appetite for: i) accessible resource-based interpretation material which would allow year round self-led engagement with the keeills; ii) a desire to identify one or more permanent pilgrimage routes on the Island; and iii) that these could provide a foundation for developing faith-based heritage tourism. \n\nWorking with an established network of collaborating groups on the Island, such as Manx National Heritage, Cathedral Isle of Man and Praying the Keeills, this project will identify one or more pilgrimage routes, utilising existing footpaths and heritage sites, including the keeills; and will create a guide to these pilgrimage trails, with links to maps and historic interpretation material. These resources will be available online via a dedicated website and smartphone apps (hence it being described as a virtual trail) with minimal low-impact signposting. Print copies of resources and an audio guide will also be available via Manx National Heritage for those without internet access. \n\nBuilding on previous research project findings, existing heritage resources and recent church-led initiatives, this project will provide a resource for locals and tourists to explore the intertwined faith heritage and landscape of the island, primarily through the activity of walking, with alternative route information provided for those of limited mobility who may need to travel by vehicle. It is also hoped that the trail/s will act as a catalyst for the Isle of Man's recent cross-organisation initiative to develop faith-heritage tourism as well as attracting other long-distance walkers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N00289X/1","grantId":"AH/N00289X/1","fundValue":"23900","fundStart":"2015-09-14","fundEnd":"2016-09-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Avril  Maddrell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
