{"id":"3D7A0D6A-9772-41ED-88D3-346C720BFAB4","title":"New Therapeutic approaches to Inclusion Body Myositis","abstractText":"Inclusion Body Mysositis is the most common acquired muscle disease affecting people over 50 years old and is characterized by muscle weakness and degeneration, as well as chronic muscle inflammation. IBM affects 35 people in every million in the population over the age of 50 years. There is currently no effective treatment.\n\nDeveloping new drugs for degenerative diseases is made much quicker when cell-based or invertebrate models are available. We have a simple nematode worm that has been genetically altered to mimic IBM. The diseased worms are noticeably less active than unaffected worms, which allows them to be distinguished from healthy ones. We already have a rapid working assay in place for this study and will develop an upscaled method for screening the actions of large numbers of compounds on these modified worms, to identify those which reverse the effects of IBM. This will not only provide new leads for drugs for treating IBM, but will also provide a method for screening large numbers of compounds that can be used in this and other applications. The most promising compounds will be tested on a human muscle cell line.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801760","grantId":"G0801760","fundValue":"91149","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Barry Sattelle","coPersons":["Linda  Greensmith","Michael  Hanna","Steven David Buckingham","David Ian Scopes"],"organisation":"Medical Research Council","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
