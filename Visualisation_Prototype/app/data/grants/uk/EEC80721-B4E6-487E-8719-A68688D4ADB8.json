The work to be developedflows naturally from a previous Overseas Travel Grant `ComplexMedia: Beyond Linear Isotropic Dielectrics'. A major theme of thatwork was the emergence and exploitation of covariant methodsin electromagnetics that enabled significant insights to beobtained in electromagnetics in generalized media. In particular,the author devised covariant electromagnetic techniques to addressthe claims of other groups that classical vacuum could supportNegative Phase Velocity propagation induced by gravity. These techniquesare now being developed in a number of burgeoning and relatedfields such as negative refraction in meta--media, transformationoptics and rotating media. Underpinning this approach is thecovariant description of an electromagnetic mode in the mostgeneral homogeneous bianisotropic medium (including a moving medium). The proposal seeks apply a covariant description of such modes to addres a number of topical themes such as a covariant description of negative refraction, and how electromagnetic cloaking will be affected by moving media. The authorwill visit some of his collaborators with whom he has anestablished record of working effectively.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G000964/1","grantId":"EP/G000964/1","fundValue":"8927","fundStart":"2008-06-04","fundEnd":"2008-12-03","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  McCall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
