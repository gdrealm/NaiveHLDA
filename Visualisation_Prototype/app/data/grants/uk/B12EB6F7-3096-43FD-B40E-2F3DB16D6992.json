A critical appraisal of reversal asymmetry in precambrian rocks of Scotland","abstractText":"The Earth's magnetic field reverses its polarity such that after a reversal magnetic compasses point in the opposite geographical direction. This has occurred repeatedly throughout geological time. In general, reversals of the field are anti-parallel and the directions of magnetisation before and after a reversal lie at 180 degrees to each other. However, there are now several cases where the directions of magnetisation recorded in rocks indicate that a series of reversal may not have been anti-parallel. These observations might be the products of several magnetisation events and in these circumstances the directions reflect different parts of the geological history of the sampling site and not unusual behaviour of the field. This project is designed to test if ancient magnetisations have recorded such unusual behaviour. As with many other natural systems atypical behaviour (e.g. illness) can be as informative as the normal state. Thus, these results may lead to a greater understanding of how the Earth's field behaves and has evolved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H012427/1","grantId":"NE/H012427/1","fundValue":"48448","fundStart":"2010-08-02","fundEnd":"2012-01-02","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The findings have been reported at several discipline related research meetings.\n\nThe Search for Latent Components of Magnetisation in Late Precambrian Sediments of Northwest Scotland.

This research has shown that over an interval of say 30 million years (approximately 1000 million years ago) the Earth's magnetic field reversed its polarity several tens of times but instead of the poles occupying positions 180 degrees apart they lay at 140 degrees apart; a phenomenon described as an asymmetrical reversal. Asymmetrical reversals are not restricted to this time interval and they provide information on the behaviour of the magnetic from which the source and stability of the Earth's magnetic field may be understood. During asymmetric reversals the Earth's magnetic field is acting an unusual or atypical way and this can provide information on its origins just as some diseases and occupational illnesses allowed physicians in the 19th century to determine the functions of many organs. The data an observations can be used to test and constrain mathematical models of the behaviour of the Earth's magnetic field Education","dataset":"gtr"}
