This has led to the concept of 'fetal programming', suggesting that if a developing baby is exposed to an adverse environment during early life this affects early growth and development and also predisposes the individual to heart disease later in life. Studies have shown that this effect is not limited to the individual who was originally exposed but this increased risk of disease can also be passed on to future generations. Importantly, this risk can be passed on by either the mother or the father. The mechanisms underlying 'programming' and the transmission of these effects are not well understood. \n\nWe proposed that exposure of the fetus to excess 'stress' steroid hormones (glucocorticoids) might be important in programming. Glucocorticoids are present in mother and baby and are used as treatment during premature labour, but can reduce birthweight and affect later blood pressure. Stress and illnesses increasing a mother's glucocorticoid levels during pregnancy have similar long-term effects. We have shown that exposure of the fetus to glucocorticoids has effects in the directly exposed offspring which are developing in the womb at the time and that these effects are transmitted to the next generation - i.e. the offspring's offspring. We suggest that this might happen because the cells which will form the eggs and sperm which will produce this next generation (called germ cells) are present in the developing ovary and testis from a very early stage of development - in fact while a baby is still developing in the womb. These cells are therefore also exposed to these glucocorticoid hormones. \n\nStudies have shown that the addition or removal of certain chemical groups on genes can have a major affect on the way they function. We propose that these chemical groups might be affected by factors acting in early life, including glucocorticoids, and that this might be a cause of the increased disease risk in later life. These chemical groups are particularly important in the developing germ cells and may also be vulnerable to the effects of glucocorticoids. In this project we wish to increase our knowledge of how overexposure to glucocorticoids impacts on these chemical groups in the germ cells and explain how disease risk can be transmitted across generations. \n\nCrucially, the work may indicate ways for us to prevent the complications associated with low birthweight and prevent these problems being passed on to subsequent generations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K018310/1","grantId":"MR/K018310/1","fundValue":"454114","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Amanda  Drake","coPersons":["Richard  Meehan"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
