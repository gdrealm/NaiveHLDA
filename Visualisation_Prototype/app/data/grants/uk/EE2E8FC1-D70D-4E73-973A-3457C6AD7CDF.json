{"id":"EE2E8FC1-D70D-4E73-973A-3457C6AD7CDF","title":"HRM Systems, Internal Marketing and Performance in Indian Call Centres","abstractText":"<p>Considering the rapid growth of call centres (CCs) in India, its implications for businesses in the UK and a scarcity of research on human resource management (HRM) related issues in Indian CCs, this research has two main aims. First, to highlight the nature of HRM systems relevant to Indian call centres. Second, to understand the significance of internal marketing (IM) in influencing the frontline employeesâ€™ job-related attitudes and performance. Rewards being an important component of IM, the relationships between different types of rewards as part of an IM strategy, attitudes and performance of employees in Indian CCs will also be examined. Further, the research will investigate which type of commitment mediates the link between rewards and performance and why.</p> \n<p>The data collection will be via two phases. The first phase would involve a series of in-depth interviews with both the managers and employees to understand the functioning of CCs, and development of suitable HRM systems for the Indian context. The second phase would involve data collection through questionnaires distributed to the frontline employees and supervisors to examine the relationships among IM, employee attitudes and performance. Such an investigation is expected to contribute to development of better theory and practice.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E004741/1","grantId":"ES/E004741/1","fundValue":"80397","fundStart":"2006-12-15","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Pawan  Budhwar","coPersons":["Neeru  Malhotra"],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
