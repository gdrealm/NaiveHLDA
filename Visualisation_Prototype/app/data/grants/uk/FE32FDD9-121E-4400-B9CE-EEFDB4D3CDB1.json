The goal of this project is to use mesenchymal stem cells to regenerate bone adjacent to these implants and to improve implant integration with the skeleton. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC's) are cells derived from the bone marrow which have great therapeutic potential in bone tissue engineering. MSC's are multipotent cells that can differentiate into many different cell types. By isolating these cells and expanding them in vitro, then re-introducing them at a later stage, it is possible to aid bone healing where MSC's naturally play a role. A previous award winning study performed in our Centre (Mario Boni Award,European Orthopaedic Research Society, 2005) showed significantly increased bone formation and contact to the surface of implants when treated with mesenchymal stem cells compared with untreated controls. This may have significant implications in reducing the failure rate of implants. This innovative study sprayed MSC's in a fibrin glue matrix onto the implant surface. In this proposal, we aim to investigate and optimse this technique by asking the following questions: 1) Are allogenic MSC's as efficient as autologous MSC's? 2) Do differentiated osteoblasts lead to improved bone formation? 3) What is the optimal number of MSC's required for a maximum bony response? 4) What is the fate of these MSC's in vivo?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D014190/1","grantId":"BB/D014190/1","fundValue":"301348","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Melanie Jean  Coathup","coPersons":["Gordon  Blunn","Jia  Hua"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
