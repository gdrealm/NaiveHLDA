{"id":"68CB6A89-0F9E-4606-A847-91F5818D4A6F","title":"Vertical and Horizontal Gender Segregation: Cross-National Comparison and Analysis","abstractText":"In all countries there is some tendency for men and women to work in different occupations, which restricts the choices of occupations for both women and men. The project explores the extent and nature of such differences. It is especially concerned to establish how far the occupational distribution entails gender inequality, with the less desirable occupations tending to be filled by women or by men. At the same time the project explores the extent to which the occupational distribution of women and men entails difference without inequality. Occupational inequalities will be measured by pay and by CAMSIS - a measure of the general desirability of occupations. The situation in twelve industrially developed nations will be measured for the entire labour force and for significant subsections, such as manual and non-manual work. Having established the various patterns of gender inequality and difference, the next step is to understand why they exist and why they vary within and across countries. Explanations&nbsp; will take account of the structures of the labour markets, and will draw on social, economic and political aspects of the countries studied.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2779","grantId":"RES-000-22-2779","fundValue":"74830","fundStart":"2008-07-14","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Martin Blackburn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
