{"id":"3330B170-9C98-42B2-B875-FCBF1CCBC189","title":"Runnymede Academic Fora: End Racism This Generation.","abstractText":"The Runnymede Academic Forum has been established since 2005, as a space for knowledge exchange and collaboration between academics working on issues of race equality. The Forum forms part of the work of the Runnymede Trust, which has been at the forefront of policy-focused research and thought leadership in race equality for over forty years. The aim of the forum is to bring together researchers from different disciplines and areas of research to foster dialogue, to identify emerging areas of concern, to disseminate research findings and to generate publications and interventions into the policy arena. The Forum is the only national academic network focused on issues of race equality, and to date has been very successful in producing some key interventions into the policy arena and public debate - for example around the white working class, mixed race, criminal justice and gangs. The Forum currently comprises 80 academics from across the UK, predominantly concentrated in the social sciences. \n\nThe current research network proposal aims to build on and extend this existing network, to shape the current debates around race equality in the UK. These issues are of key significance given the changing demographics of the UK, evidence of continued and increasing racial diversity and inequality across a range of policy areas in an age of austerity, and the increasing silence around tackling racial inequality at the level of policy and politics. The research network would enable the Forum to extend in five new ways: 1) to expand the disciplinary focus of the Forum, to increase participation from the Arts and Humanities and facilitate the dissemination of work from these areas into the public and policy arena; 2) to hold forum meetings in key cities around the UK to increase participation from non-London based academics, to address key regional and local issues, and engage with local state and third sector groups; 3) to develop a related network of new scholars, including research collaboration, dissemination and publication, and a training and mentoring system for new researchers; 4) to help develop and support a national network of doctoral students working on race and ethnicity, including an annual national conference; 5) to develop a website bringing new research to a broad audience of stakeholders and interested audiences, and provde a resource bank of new research for academics, researchers, policymakers, community groups, and students 6) to foster international links with academic institutions and third sector groups, initially in the US, to explore similarities and differences in different national, cultural and historical contexts, and promote international collaboration in research and dissemination.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007564/1","grantId":"AH/K007564/1","fundValue":"35659","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Elice Alexander","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
