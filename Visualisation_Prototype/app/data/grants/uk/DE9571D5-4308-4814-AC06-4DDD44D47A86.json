{"id":"DE9571D5-4308-4814-AC06-4DDD44D47A86","title":"The Development of Punishment","abstractText":"<p>Social and moral norms regulate people's interpersonal behaviour in most human cultures, both in formal and informal ways. For example, motorists have to follow traffic regulations, and most people would agree that friends should be treated a certain way. A violation of normative standards is usually met with sanctions (eg, fines for committing a traffic violation; withdrawing from a friend after a fight).</p>\n\n<p>This project investigates how children and adolescents punish the violations of social norms by combining research in developmental psychology and experimental economics. Studying the development of punishing behaviour will help shed more light on how moral behaviour develops over human ontogeny.</p>\n\n<p>The project will employ two experimental paradigms to study the development of punishment: The mini-ultimatum game assesses punishment by an individual who is a direct victim of the violation of a norm. The third-party punishment game measures whether people are willing to enforce a norm by punishing a norm violator even if they themselves are not affected by the violation. We will investigate whether the punishment of children, adolescents, and adults differs between these two contexts and whether perspective-taking ability and empathy will predict within-person differences in punishment.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H02655X/1","grantId":"ES/H02655X/1","fundValue":"73294","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  At the moment this project had mainly scientific impacts, that is impact for other researchers.
