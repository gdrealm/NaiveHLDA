Unfortunately, very little is known about the impact such nanoparticles may have on the strucutre and function of the microbial communities which exist in the soils receiving such applications. These communities are essential for the healthy function of soils: they underpin the production of food and fibre, the cycling of nutrients, the purification of water flowing through them, contribute to soil structural stability and it's ability to resist erosion, and interact closely with plants to maintain biodiversity, amongst many other ecosystem goods identified in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. So any impacts of nanoparticles on the normal functioning of soil communities is potentially very significant. This programme is aimed at providing some very basic information as to if, how and why nanoparticles have any impact on the normal composition and function of the soil microbial community, using well established techniques. These data will enable us to put the impact of nanoparticles in the context of other systems managed by humans, and to indicate the degree of risk associated with their use.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F011784/1","grantId":"NE/F011784/1","fundValue":"56857","fundStart":"2008-02-28","fundEnd":"2009-08-27","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"James  Harris","coPersons":["Jeremy  Ramsden","Karl  Ritz"],"organisation":"Cranfield University","findingsText":" Direct impacts of zero-valent iron leads to substle effects in the composition of the phenotypic profile of the soil microbial community.

The principle route, aside from the publication which has arisen, has been feeding into the formulation of the much larger TINE grant (recorded separately as an output).
