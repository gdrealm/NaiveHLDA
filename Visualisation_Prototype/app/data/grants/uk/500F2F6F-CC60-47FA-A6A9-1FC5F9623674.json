A key component of democratic accountability is for citizens to understand “who is to blame”, yet little is known about how citizens attribute credit and blame in the complex multi-level structure of the EU.</p>\n\n<p>As the first comprehensive study of attribution of responsibility in the EU, this project analyses unique cross-national survey of citizens in the 27 member states, a series of experiments and a content analysis of media coverage. It addresses the crucial question of whether citizens rely on perceptual biases or content-rich information when deciding who to blame.The answer is both. While citizens’ attributions are shaped by their partisanship and attitudes towards the EU, information also serves to bring evaluations into line with actual divisions of responsibility.This has wider implications for democracy. Promisingly, the project demonstrates that well-informed citizens can make sense of divisions of responsibility. However, it also reveals that even if citizens can navigate the multi-level structures of governance that in itself does not necessarily enable them to hold their EU representatives to account.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1522","grantId":"RES-062-23-1522","fundValue":"277980","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The main purpose of this project was to collect and disseminate data on how voters attribute responsibility in the EU to gain a better understanding of how citizens make sense of political outcomes in a complex multi-level system of governance. We believe that such evidence has the potential to have a societal impact as it is valuable for debates on the quality of democracy in the EU, not only among academics, but also among policy-makers in national and European institutions. It also provides an important benchmark for understanding blame attribution in the current financial and economic crisis in Europe. However, given the nature of the project it is difficult at this stage to demonstrate a measurable societal impact. Firstly, while the project may have had an impact on the quality of the debate on institutional reform and electoral democracy in the EU, it will necessarily be difficult to identify a demonstrable impact. Secondly, the societal impact is unlikely to be achieved within a 12 month period, since institutional reforms of national and European institutions generally take much longer to decide and implement.\n\nNonetheless, we will continue to actively disseminate our findings beyond the narrow scientific domain.

On the individual level, people rely on a mixture of in-group biases and factual information when attributing blame to political representatives. It is well-known that people in national elections have a tendency to absolve their preferred party or candidate of any blame, due to partisanship biases. We show a similar mechanism operates in the EU. Citizens who favour the EU are more likely to think that EU institutions are responsible when things are going well, and vice versa. We also demonstrate that information is a crucial conditioning variable of the extent to which citizens' allocation of power is simply a reflection of pre-existing attitudes. Some people are more informed than others, and that matters for allocating responsibility. These findings are published in the following journals:\n\n\n\no Tilley and Hobolt (2011) 'Is the government to blame? An experimental test of how partisanship shapes perceptions of performance and responsibility', Journal of Politics 73(2): 316-330.\n\no Hobolt, Tilley and Wittrock (2012), 'Listening to the government: How information shapes responsibility attributions', Political Behavior, forthcoming.\n\n\n\nAt the contextual level both of these biasing and information effects are also evident. On the one hand, people are influenced by the information they receive from the media and this may reinforce existing biases. On the other hand, citizens also employ information to bring their attribution evaluations into line with actual divisions of governmental responsibility and they rely more on information from credible sources. This has implications for the debate on democracy in the EU. We suggest that the complex institutions of the EU make it hard for people to assign responsibility correctly, and thus to hold governments to account. Equally, in contrast to the predictions of the classic model of electoral accountability, we find that voters' blame attributions only have a limited impact on their vote choice in European Parliament elections. They do, however, influence citizens' trust in European institutions, and thus help to shape the legitimacy (and lack thereof) of the European Union. These effects are discussed in the following articles:\n\n\n\no Hobolt, Sara (2012) 'Citizens satisfaction with democracy in the European Union', Journal of Common Market Studies, 50 (1): 88-105..\n\no Banducci, Susan, Sara Hobolt, and James Tilley (N.d.) 'Clarity of responsibility: How government cohesion conditions performance voting'. European Journal of Political Research, forthcoming\n\no Hobolt and Tilley (2014), 'Who's in Charge? Voter Attribution of Responsibility in the European Union, Comparative Political Studies, forthcoming September 2014\n\no Wilson and Hobolt 'Allocating Responsibility in Multilevel Government Systems: Voter and Expert Attributions in the European Union'. Working paper.\n\n\n\nFinally, the book Blaming Europe: Attribution of Responsibility in the European Union (Oxford University Press, 2013) presents the key findings from the project and also considers the implications for electoral democracy in the European Union. We anticipate that the data generated by the survey will continue to be used widely by for research and teaching purposes, thus informing research and teaching on European Union politics, public opinion and electoral democracy in multi-level systems.
