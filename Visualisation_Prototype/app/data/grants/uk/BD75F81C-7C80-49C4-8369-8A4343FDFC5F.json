Generally regarded by historians as being on the margin of Romanian politics, the project will demonstrate that the Legion was highly-organised, with broad, popular appeal. This will be illustrated through a detailed exploration of the link between the Legion and the main democratic party of the day, led by Iuliu Maniu, as well as studies of one of the main vehicles of Legionary recruitment - the work camp- and of the personal and mobilising capacities of the movement's founder and leader, Coreliu Codreanu.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111857/1","grantId":"111857/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca Ann Haynes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
