Evidence suggests that this protective effect is in part the result of substances in the fruits and vegetables called polyphenols. In recent years, berries and berry derived juices and wines have been promoted as especially healthy foods as they are high in a particular class of polyphenol called anthocyanins. These anthocyanins are reported to have activities that benefit the heart and blood vessels. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and specifically stiffness of the arteries results from accumulated damage to blood vessel walls. There is a single layer of cells that lines the blood vessels which is sensitive to agents/compounds within the blood. When this layer is damaged as a result of injury or chronic disease, it loses its ability to maintain normal blood vessel function and becomes prone to processes that lead to heart disease. Anthocyanins and anthocyanin containing foods have been shown to have direct protective effects on this cell layer, thus restoring proper function to the blood vessels. However, the anthocyanins in the foods we eat often become altered during standard food processing and storage conditions, an effect that is believed to negatively alter their function relative to those in raw fruits or vegetables. As well, when we eat anthocyanins they become modified by our bodies, resulting in drastic changes to their original form. Previous experiments have used unaltered or original forms of anthocyanins to explore how these compounds affect the cells in our bodies and blood vessels. However, no studies have explored the true activity of anthocyanins as they exist within our bodies, as altered products in our circulatory system resulting from changes during processing and digestion. The effects of these alterations on the disease fighting properties of anthocyanins are currently unknown and could be greater, different or impartial to what we currently perceive. The aim of the present program of research is to identify the actions of pure anthocyanins relative to their altered products of processing and digestion on CVD risk. In order to determine their functions, we must first identify their forms in the body after we eat them. We will identify changes that occur to anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-glucoside, the most abundant anthocyanin in nature) in common fruit juices on the UK market, during standard processing and storage conditions. We will also feed human participants a pure anthocyanin (cyanidin-3-glucoside) in order to trace its path and alteration through the body. We will then study the effects of the identified compounds on CVD risk by exploring their activities on the cells (cultured-cells) lining our blood vessels. With this study we hope to prove the usefulness of anthocyanins as a dietary treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, using the relevant compounds found in the body; thus providing informed advice on the health benefits of anthocyanins. The results of this study are also relevant to agricultural industries as levels of anthocyanins in food crops can be easily increased using breeding strategies and pre and post harvest manipulation. This project is particularly relevant to the processed food and beverage industry, as although the alteration of anthocyanins during food processing has generally been considered of negative consequence, the proposed research could establish this as a neutral or potentially beneficial outcome; providing valuable evidence to support the use of fruit juices for the delivery of beneficial components for health. This proposal will also generate findings that may be useful for future studies aimed at investigating the relative activity of other dietary polyphenols, such as those found in coffee, tea, wine or chocolate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H004963/1","grantId":"BB/H004963/1","fundValue":"290953","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin David Kay","coPersons":["Aedin  Cassidy"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" The initial study of juice processing and storage revealed differential and relatively small losses (0.7-6.4%) of anthocyanins in cranberry, blackcurrant and raspberry derived-juices during processing; however, the refrigerated storage of juices over four months resulted in substantial losses in anthocyanin content (up to 100%). The apparent loss was not associated with breakdown or degradation to phenolic acids but rather the formation of new, larger structures, which warrant further investigation. The potential impact of processing on food bioactivity, as explored in the present proposal identified new dietary constituents that could be exploited as novel bioactives in the future, however this requires further research. As juices are a major source of anthocyanins to the consumer, this work holds particular relevance to the juice industry but perhaps also the public, given the contribution of fruit juices to daily fruit and vegetable intakes and the current low intake of fresh fruits and vegetables in the UK. \n\n\n\nThe result of our study feeding pure labelled anthocyanins to humans indicates that 45% of a single dose of anthocyanins is recovered in the urine, breath and faeces within 48 hours of consumption. In addition, as 6% of the dose was recovered in the urine and 7% in the breath, this indicates that anthocyanins are approximately 13% bioavailable (i.e., available in the systemic circulation to act upon our cells to elicit a biological response). The evidence also indicates that anthocyanin absorption and clearance from the body is highly variable between participants. Here we identified 31 unique metabolites of anthocyanins in the blood and urine, indicating anthocyanins are extensively metabolised and the metabolites are present in the circulation at much higher levels than the anthocyanins themselves (as un-metabolised forms). These results suggest that anthocyanin metabolites likely hold the key to understanding how anthocyanins work within the body to elicit their reported health effects. \n\n\n\nThe metabolites identified in the human trial were screened for their health effects using established human cell culture models, where the metabolites appeared to improve key mediators of healthy blood vessel function. In models simulating the early stages of diminished blood vessel function or heart stress, the metabolites of anthocyanins were also able reduce the production of markers of heart disease progression, such as cytokines and adhesion proteins. Together this suggests that the metabolism of anthocyanins could increase their activity in the body. Based on the results of the cell culture experiments, the metabolites of anthocyanins have significant biological activity and these metabolites should therefore be the focus of further investigations exploring the mechanism behind anthocyanins reported health effects.\n\n\n\nThe findings of the juice, human and cell analysis should provide useful information required for the design of clinical studies required for establishing health claims for anthocyanin-rich foods. The findings of this research could also ultimately help the Food Standards Agency develop more informed policies regarding guidelines for heart healthy diets.\n\n\n\nEstablishing the bioactivity of anthocyanin metabolites offers potential commercial benefit and enhanced economic competitiveness to the UK, through providing evidence required to market products with known contents of these bioactive components as 'functional-foods' for health and wellbeing. Providing proof of benefit also helps produces of anthocyanin-rich agricultural products, as anthocyanin levels in food crops can be modified using pre- and post-harvest manipulation or plant breeding or genetic approaches to produced increased concentrations of anthocyanins in plants. The findings from this project will provide evidence on the potential benefits to public health of consuming processed fruit products; which is important given the current low intake of fresh fruits and vegetables in the UK diet. The impact of processing on food bioactivity as explored in this proposal identify dietary constituents that could be exploited as novel bioactives with potential functional-food, pharmaceutical and agricultural implications.\n\n\n\nEstablishing the bioactivity of anthocyanin metabolites offers commercial benefit and enhances the economic competitiveness of the UK, through providing evidence required to market products with known contents of these bioactive components as 'functional-foods' for health and wellbeing.

As juices are likely to be the major delivery vehicle of anthocyanins to the consumer, this work holds particular relevance to the juice industry. Findings from this research could ultimately help the Food Standards Agency and other EU government agencies develop more informed policies regarding dietary guidelines for the prevention of CVD. A pure 13-carbon enriched 'fit-for-consumption' anthocyanin (13C5-C3G) was developed for use in human tracer studies for establishing the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) of anthocyanins in humans. This synthesis strategy was published in Chemical Communications (Qingzhi Zhang, Nigel P. Botting and Colin Kay: 2011;47:10596-10598) and provides detailed methodology for others to reproduce this work. \n\n\n\nRecently published data from our 13C5-C3G ADME trial (Czank et al., 2013 AJCN; in press, publication date 14/04/2014) identified multiple structural targets (i.e., novel metabolites) for exploring the mechanistic bioactivities of anthocyanins in cell culture models in addition to providing pharmacokinetic data necessary for the design of future clinical trials measuring acute bioactivity. Ultimately this data is necessary for building a portfolio of evidence for industry to apply for future health claims for anthocyanin rich foods.\n\n\n\nAn analytical methods paper has been prepared for publication, providing detailed and validated methodology appropriate for others to measure anthocyanin metabolites identified in human ADME trials exploring the metabolism and bioavailabity of anthocyanins from dietary sources. Again, these data are essential to building a portfolio of evidence for industry to apply for future health claims and the FSA to validate such claims.\n\n\n\nThe metabolites identified in the human trial were screened for their health effects using established human cell culture models, where the metabolites appeared to improve key mediators of healthy blood vessel function, such as increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase and reduced superoxide production. Both of these changes would theoretically lead to improved heart health. In models simulating the early stages of diminished blood vessel function or heart stress, the metabolites of anthocyanins were able reduce the production of markers of heart disease progression, such as cytokines and adhesion proteins. Together this suggests that the metabolism of anthocyanins could increase their activity in the body. Based on the results of the cell culture experiments, the metabolites of anthocyanins have significant biological activity and these metabolites should therefore be the focus of further investigations exploring the mechanism behind anthocyanins reported health effects.\n\n\n\nThe stability of juice pigments (anthocyanins) during processing and storage was established for three common berry-derived juices (cranberry, blackcurrant and raspberry) and the data was presented at international conferences and to industry partners at multiple BBSRC dissemination events. This data is useful in the future development of juices aimed at delivering high quantities of potentially bioactive anthocyanins to the consumer/public. \n\n\n\nThis project is of particular importance to flavonoid researchers as the study design outlines an experimental approach for defining the active molecules responsible for the health benefits of flavonoids in processed foods; an approach which may be applied to future studies on other food-based bioactives such as cocoa, coffee, tea and wine polyphenols. Our findings relative to juice processing provide evidence on the structure of novel compounds found in stored berry juice concentrates, which can be utilised for the design of future dietary studies using juices.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the present project provides valuable information regarding absorption and clearance of anthocyanins and the identity of important metabolites as potential biomarkers of intake for future studies. Our findings relative to metabolism and bioactivity can be used to inform future studies necessary for the establishment of health claims for anthocyanin containing foods. This project also provides valuable evidence for academics, supporting the importance of studying the bioactivity of phytochemical metabolites.
