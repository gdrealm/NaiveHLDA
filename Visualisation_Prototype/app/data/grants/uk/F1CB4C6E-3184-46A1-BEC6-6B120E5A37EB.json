There are currently no treatments available for some of these cancers. Our proposal is to take blood cells from patients with EBV-associated cancer and turn them into killer cells directed towards the cancer cells and then inject back into the patient. These killer cells will then be able to destroy the cancer cells and cure the patient.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902209","grantId":"G0902209","fundValue":"278244","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Hans  Stauss","coPersons":["Emma  Morris","Max  Topp","Shao-An  Xue"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
