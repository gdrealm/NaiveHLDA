Understanding the dynamics of such systems is difficult in general, due to their lack of variational structure. On the other hand, the strong interaction limit is a scalar equation, so in priniciple much more easily studied. When the diffusion coefficients of the two components are the same, it is well-established that a Lyapunov function (energy) for this scalar limit problem can be used to infer information about the dynamics of the two-component system for large values of the competition parameter, including that, under some non-degeneracy conditions, each solution of the k-dependent system for large k will converge to a stationary solution of the system as time tends to infinity.\n\n\n\nDuring the period of this grant, good initial progress was made towards establishing some corresponding results when the diffusion coefficients of the two components may differ. In particular,\n\n\n\n(a) pointwise spatial segregation of the system components in the strong-interaction limit was established via `blow-up' and monotonicity formula arguments;\n\n\n\n(b) exploitation of recently established H?lder estimates enabled strong convergence results to be proved for the spatial gradients of the two components; this is a key ingredient in trying to use an energy of the limit problem to gain information about the system for large value of the competition parameter k.\n\n\n\nTo prove that solutions of the system for large values of k stay close to stationary solutions of the limit equation for all sufficiently large time, it remains to establish some properties of the limit equation - in particular, regularity properties of its solutions. This is a difficult question because of the lack of linearity of the diffusion operator, and we are working on understanding these issues at present.\n\n\n\nResults were also obtained on the so-called converse problem for systems of stationary Gross-Pitaevskii equations; that is, on whether or not a solution of the limit problem does in fact arise as a limit of solutions of the original system. These are the first such results for systems of this type, which have cubic coupling between the components. The methods used exploited the variational structure of the system, and the visiting researcher has written a preprint on this work entitled ``On the converse problem for the stationary Gross-Pitaevskii equations with a large parameter&quot; that has been submitted for publication. Strong interaction limits of PDE have potential applications in understanding ecological problems in which there is strong competition between two interacting populations.
