{"id":"3949CA56-38A5-4CEE-99FA-E82F4EDB0964","title":"Mechanical function of the primate craniofacial skeleton","abstractText":"This project aims to build computer models that allow us to emulate and experiment with growth of the facial skeleton in primates, chosen because they are anatomically similar to and therefore informative regarding human facial growth. Although genetic systems regulate the early part of post natal craniofacial growth, later development is strongly regulated by mechanical loading. The craniofacial skeleton responds to its immediate mechanical environment by passively growing where bones meet (the sutures) in response to the expansion of the soft tissues (e.g. brain, tongue, muscles). It is also resculpted by modelling and remodelling mechanisms that add and remove bone from surfaces, being modulated by the mechanical milieu. It is important we understand these mechanically regulated processes because they are essential not only in normal growth but also when things go wrong. Further we need to know how the features of craniofacial form that characterise and vary between related species come about. Commonly our teeth do not fit well to our mouths, yet in the historical past this was not the case; what has happened? The answer likely lies in the change to softer diets that alter the mechanical loading of the growing face and subsequent growth. More rarely sutures may fuse too early or skull cartilages may not grow adequately because of inherited conditions. The subsequent growth of the skull has to adapt to the altered starting conditions and optimise function. The mechanical signals are key in this. Understanding mechanical regulation should lead to better prediction of normal and altered growth and understanding of which features of the facial skeleton are inherited and which adapted to local mechanics. This is important in resolving arguments about the relationships among fossil and living species. One approach to understanding the mechanical regulation of the growth of the face is to carry out experiments in which animals are operated on to cut muscles, move teeth, excise structures etc and observe the outcomes. This has been a very profitable line of research especially in primates, our nearest relatives but now it is ethically and economically difficult to carry on this work in the UK. Our current best sources of information in these areas come from continuing animal studies outside Europe, especially in the USA. Animal experiments are very useful but they are difficult to properly control and lengthy and time consuming to carry out and interpret. They could be replaced if we had a good computer model of facial, and eventually, skull growth. While such a full model is long way off we plan in this project to emulate the mechanical regulation of facial bone adaptation that will allow prediction of the consequences of altered loading. The work will build on computer models that we have developed over the past three years employing engineering techniques for predicting how loads are distributed (finite elements analysis / FEA). We will apply them to two related old world monkey groups, macaques and mangabeys, with similar faces at birth that develop very different features of adult form. Thus macaques develop air sinuses in the maxilla but mangabeys do not, instead they develop deep excavations of the external aspect of the face, the maxillary fossae. We will extend our models by simulating what we know of how bone adapts so that initial loading is used to drive simulated bone deposition or resorption. We will then carry out a series of experiments with our computer models to test ideas about the development of features of facial form and in so doing work to improve our models and our understanding. In this way we will advance knowledge of how the face grows and develop technologies that will underpin future, more complete models of craniofacial development that will eventually underpin predictions of growth with applicability in biology, medicine and studies of human and primate origins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E014259/1","grantId":"BB/E014259/1","fundValue":"544367","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The research has provided much useful information on the relationship between biomechanical forces and skull geometry, which (with BB/E009204/1) has led directly to two follow-on projects to further elucidate: (1) the role of sutures and skull flexibility (kinesis) in some animals; and (2) the biomechanics of mandibles, which is providing information that will be useful to future dental research. In addition, the work has led to a long-term research project investigating craniosynostosis, a rare clinical condition where premature fusion of the sutures in the skull occurs. That project includes an investigation into the biomechanics of skull growth, which will have other potential clinical applications.

Our main aim was to simulate mechanical loading and its effects on the skull, both in adults and in younger individuals to test current hypotheses concerning the regulation and control of skull growth. In particular how does the skull come to develop and maintain such things as brow ridges, air sinuses, thickenings of bone and cavites within bones? \n\n\n\nIn order to investigate these questions we first had to make advances in methods for virtual simulation and comparison of skull loadings and their outcomes. The loadings applied to the skull by muscles when biting were simulated using multibody dynamic analysis, a technique that replicates the forces generated by muscles taking account of skull and muscle geometry. We built the most sophisticated models to date of any primate of adult and juvenile macaque and mangabey crania, and used these to simulate biting. Our findings replicated published data and so we can be confident that the models correctly predicted muscle forces in subsequent experiments. \n\n\n\nWe then applied the predicted loading scenarios for bites on each tooth in finite elements analyses of the same crania; simulating how they deform when loaded. We were able to show in separate experiments that the predicted deformations matched experimental ones, and so are reliable. In order to optimise our simulations we then carried out extensive experiments varying and assessing our modelling. These provided important new insights into how to build reliable functional models of the skull and how to assess the impact of modelling decisions on functioning. Additionally we discovered a potential mechanism whereby the zygomatic arch, the cheek bone, is protected from developing high strains during forceful bites. This is significant in that it potentially explains the slenderness of the arch and how the zygomatic region tolerates what until now was thought to be very high strains. Finally, we successfully extended our software (VOX-FE) such that it allows us to more accurately represent models and can now simulate how bones adapt to loads by adding and removing material as necessary.\n\n\n\nThe second component of our work explored linkages between facial loading and morphology. These indicated, amongst other things, that facial sutures do not reduce strains in the face during biting, this was thought to be a possibility. Additionally, we assessed the extent to which loadings can predict where bone is deposited or removed during growth or after altered jaw functioning (e.g. following surgery). Our results suggest that prediction is feasible, which is of potential value in clinical situations. We were also able to complete work on browridge mechanical function with the finding that the supraorbital region experiences generally low levels of strain during biting. This is consistent with what was already known but our new data suggest that, where browridges are large, they appear to act as a bar, stiffening the upper face. We developed a novel approach that allowed us to understand how the deformation of the skull during biting leads to bone wall thickenings. Finally, we were able to apply our new adaptive remodelling software with the exciting result that 'remodelling' driven by loading re-creates sinuses in skull models where these have been filled in. This supports the hypothesis that sinuses are mechanically regulated and our findings strongly suggest that much of the facial skeleton is optimised (minimum material) for the loading it experiences.\n\n\n\nThese methods and findings have given us considerable confidence that we will be able to make predictions of skull growth and of the effects of injury or surgery on skull growth, although there is much to be done before this is a reality. Further, our approaches have significance for zoologists and palaeontologists who seek to understand how and why skulls differ among related species. a) Suture work developed into further projects into mammal skull growth and research into craniosynostosis and its treatment\n\nb) New approaches to the modelling of biological systems\n\nc) Education and museums\n\nResearch continues - with increasing interest in clinical problems.
