In the next 50 years, we will need to grow as much wheat grain as has been produced since the beginning of agriculture, some 10,000 years ago. The requirement to enhance the amount of wheat grown in the UK creates a major challenge for research. We need to develop new wheat varieties which have higher yields with lower nutrient requirements, whilst retaining the quality of the grain. Historically the Plant Breeding Institute (PBI) made experimental crosses with wild wheats and related grasses, capable of transferring traits of high agronomic potential into wheat, but still requiring further breeder selection to generate varieties with elite performance. However, the PBI was privatised in 1987 and research developing new experimental crosses of this kind almost stopped. This has created a major bottleneck for wheat breeders, because they do not have the necessary new experimental lines from which to develop new varieties with increased yield. The objective of this proposal is to re-establish a pre-breeding programme in wheat developing such experimental crosses in the UK. Such a pre-breeding programme will produce wheat germplasm, characterised for the next generation of key traits, such as yield, and will identify genetic markers for selecting these traits, in breeding programmes and for the academic community. We will develop novel pre-breeding wheat germplasm, using three different but complementary strategies, to maximise the introduction of diversity and beneficial traits into a range of wheat lines. First we will develop germplasm from crosses involving wheat landraces or locally adapted varieties, derived from exiting germplasm collections. Secondly we will create synthetic hexaploid wheats by artificially crossing tetraploid or 'pasta' wheats with diploid wheat progenitors. This captures diversity in both the tetraploid and diploid wheat progenitors. The potential of these synthetics is illustrated by their success in the CIMMYT breeding programme. Thirdly we will use a technique called alien introgression, to transfer small segments of chromosomes of wild relatives containing the target genes, into wheat. Wild and cultivated relatives (alien species) provide a wealth of genetic variation for all characters of importance relative to yield, climate change and the environment. The impact of this approach has been illustrated by the transfer of rust resistance by Sears in the US saving its economy several billion dollars in the intervening years. The parental material used in the initial prebreeding crosses will be characterised to ensure the maximal levels of diversity are being exploited. New sequencing technologies will be used to generate very high density maps, providing the breeding companies with markers for 'precision' breeding, and the academic researchers with markers for fine dissection of key traits. Key target traits relating to yield, of interest to both UK breeders and academics, have been identified. We will screen for, biomass and enhanced N and P use efficiency, Take-All and insect resistance including Bulb fly and Aphids. The programme will not involve the actual cloning of the genes responsible for these particular traits, but will provide the germplasm as the starting point for such projects. The new germplasm generated in this project will be exploited by breeders for crossing with their elite lines to develop new varieties for use by farmers. All the information generated in the programme will be stored in a central database, and seed stored centrally, both being freely available within the UK to both academics and breeders alike.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I00159X/1","grantId":"BB/I00159X/1","fundValue":"443275","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2014-04-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The UK private sector wheat breeding companies are represented on the management steering committee of the project. Therefore there has been exchange of phenotpying results with the private sector wheat breeders through presentations made at steering meetings and through phenotyping datasets made available on project web pages.\n\nResults from the Nottingham field experiments have shown that spectral reflectance (NDVI) correlates strongly with\nharvest biomass from measurements during stem elongation and shortly after anthesis (R2 ranging from 0.4 - 0.5, P&lt;\n0.001) amongst 232 lines of the donor panel (AE Watkins landraces, synthetic derivatives and adapted European cultivars including UK RL cultivars). However, simultaneous measurements of all plots within a trial are not possible with groundbased platforms. In the experiment in 2011-12, the scope of an aerial imaging platform using the Oktocopter 2 at 100 m above ground with a fixed multispectral camera to collect NDVI data was demonstrated. A linear regression (r2 = 0.94, p&lt; 0.001) was established between NDVI collected from a hand-held Crop Scan radiometer MSR16R and from a multispectral camera on the Oktocopter 2. These data were used as pilot data for a successful application for a BBSRC Agri-Catalyst grant (project 14TSB_ATC_IR Exploiting novel canopy sensors for improved disease management, variety selection and resilience in wheat) to develop a field-based high-throughput hyperspectral aerial imaging platform in collaboration with wheat breeders RAGT Seeds Ltd and Agrii Ltd .

The project required refinement of field\nphenotyping methodologies for assessment of biomass, photosynthetic capacity traits and N-use efficiency (grain DM / N\navailable from soil and/or fertilizer; NUE) and NUE components. Advanced protocols were developed for scoring canopy size and senescence kinetics using spectral reflectance techniques (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) as\nwell as protocols for determining stem, leaf, and ear N content (NIRS spectroscopy). These high-throughput and low cost\nscreens allowed very large scale field phenotyping. The output of this was the identification of donor and SSD lines with\nimproved biomass and NUE compared to the UK elite check cultivars and the parent lines of the mapping populations for\ndevelopment of genetic resources at John Innes Centre (SSD mapping populations and near-isogenic lines).\nSpecifically, the germplasm screened in replicated trials under low and high N conditions in the phenotyping programme in\nfield experiments at Nottingham in 2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13 comprised:\nDonor Panel: (232 genotypes) in 2010/11 and 2011/12\n- 119 AE Watkins landraces\n- 63 Gediflux genotypes (Wide collection of European wheat cultivars)\n- 40 Synthetic-derived hexaploid wheats\n- 10 UK Recommended List cultivars (controls)\n\n8 Paragon x Watkins Landrace Single Seed Descent mapping populations in 2011/12 and 2012/13\n\n- Paragon x Watkins 034 (95 individual SSD lines)\n- Paragon x Watkins 141 (96 individual SSD lines)\n- Paragon x Watkins 209 (88 individual SSD lines)\n- Paragon x Watkins 292 (96 individual SSD lines)\n- Paragon x Watkins 352 (96 individual SSD lines)\n- Paragon x Watkins 468 (96 individual SSD lines)\n- Paragon x Watkins 729 (82 individual SSD lines)\n\nIn the donor trials, performance was compared at high and low N inputs, between sites (Nottingham and Rothamsted) and\nacross years, with in-season high-throughput growth analysis (e.g. NDVI), with final N analysis and in terms of finalbiomass and grain yields. Germplasm was idenitified for which mapping populations are now prioritized (grain yields,\nbiomass, NUE, high/low responsiveness) for ongoing phenotying in the BBSRC Wheat Improvement Strategic Programme (WISP).\n\nIn summary, field phenotyyping and data analysis has been completed in: i) a trial of donor germrplasm in each\nof 2010-11 and 2011-12 (a total of 2,880 plots) and ii) a trial of 8 mapping populations in each of 2011-12 and 2012-13 (a\ntotal of 9600 plots). These data have been supplied to John Innes Centre for genetic metaanlysis and database archiving.\nField methodologies have been developed for high-throughput analysis of biomass and NUE using canopy sensors. For a subset of 15 donor lines (5 Watkins landraces, 5 NIAB synthetic hexaploid wheats and 5 RL cultivars) with similar flowering date and plant height, flag-leaf photosynthetic rate (Amax) was measured using a Li-Cor LI-6400XT portable Photosynthesis System. Overall synthetic and elite RL wheats had higher pre-anthesis Amax (25.7 and 25.2 micromol CO2 m-2 s-1, respectively) compared to Watkins lines (20.1 micromol CO2 m-2 s-1). There was a positive linear relationship between flag-leaf Amax and grain yield averaged over years amongst the 15 genotypes (R2 = 0.76, P&lt; 0.001) and Amax in turn was positively linearly related with flag-leaf relative chlorophyll content measured using a SPAD-502 meter(R2=0.74, P&lt; 0.001). The phenotyping data generated in the field experiments at Nottingham University for the Donor panel and the Watkins x\nParagon mapping populations have been sent to collaborators at Rothamsted (for cross site-season analysis of biomass,\nNUE and their physiological components) and to John Innes Centre for genetic analysis and will be placed into public\ndatabases. All the phenotyping data will be available via data bases at John Innes Centre (based on an extension of\nGerminate data base) and at University of Bristol (based on a phenotype extension to the Cereals DB). All the published\npapers are freely accessible, either through the publishers or through open access sites,. We will also make our\npublications available through our WISP website.\n\nThe UK Wheat breeding companies are part of the WISP consortium and will utilized the project outputs to imporve the efficiency of their breeding programmes for enhanced biomass and N-use efficiency.
