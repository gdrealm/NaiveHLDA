While most demographic research treats socioeconomic status as an explanation of demographic phenomena that is unaffected by them, microeconomic analyses usually treat demographic change as a determinant of poverty, but not its consequence. The challenge to welfare posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa highlights the limitations of both analytic traditions. The size and structure of households and their economic status are intertwined. Ways of measuring household poverty that allow for this will be developed. Building on these insights, the project will investigate whether adult deaths primarily affect household welfare by aggravating money poverty or in other ways. Finally, micro-simulation will be adopted to model the impact of different social benefits and services that might mitigate the impact of the AIDS epidemic.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D003520/1","grantId":"ES/D003520/1","fundValue":"395190","fundStart":"2006-10-09","fundEnd":"2010-03-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The project has advanced study of three topics. It forms part of a revisionist body of work (including that of Gillespie, Seeley et al., Grimm, and others) finding that the medium-term impact of AIDS and other adult deaths on households is less severe than was feared. Second, it contributes to research revealing that, although being orphaned has severe consequences for children, the primary mechanism involved is not heightened poverty. Third, our research on welfare policy and AIDS in South Africa adds to growing evidence that the government's major fiscal commitment to social grants has been of substantial benefit to poor households.\n\nThus, our research identified two key areas in which government action could mitigate the misery caused by AIDS in South Africa. First, targeted support services would benefit orphans more than additional financial support. Second, making it easier for people living with AIDS to access Disability Grants - or a new Illness Grant - would both improve their treatment outcomes and greatly reduce hardship in their households. These arguments have influenced the policy debate in South Africa, if not yet government policy itself.\n\nMore generally, our findings contributed to the mainstreaming of HIV and AIDS issues across government, and particularly in the Social Protection and Community Development Cluster of Ministries, after the lack of attention that they received from President Mbeki's administration.

It analysed two\nlongitudinal studies from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where mortality has risen massively since the late 1990s and most working-age adult deaths are now from AIDS. Because both studies have collected demographic and economic data from households at least three times, we could use more sophisticated statistical methods than earlier studies to tease out the consequences of these deaths.\n\nThe effects of adult deaths vary according to the characteristics of dead person, their household, and their cause of death. Poverty in South Africa is linked closely to unemployment and, in poor households whose income derives largely from pensions and welfare grants to children, the death of working-age adults often benefits per capita consumption. By contrast, in better-off households working-age deaths reduce consumption, with their impact being largest when young adults die or the death is from AIDS. But even better-off households hit by deaths regain their earlier standard of living within a few years. The statistical models that we used had not been applied to this kind of research question before and are of more general value.
