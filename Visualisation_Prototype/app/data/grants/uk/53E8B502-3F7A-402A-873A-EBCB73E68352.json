The medical importance of mood disorders is often underestimated but the World Health Organisation has predicted that depression will be the second most important cause of disability worldwide by 2020. This global burden emphasises not only the frequency of mood disorders but also their under-treatment, their recurrent nature and the high risk of suicide. All these factors highlight the need for more effective and acceptable treatments and so one of the aims of our Group is directly to develop and evaluate therapies for mood disorder. However discovering better treatment really requires a greater understanding of the nature of mood disorders. Therefore another key aim of the Group is to use a wide range of state-of- the-art methods to investigate what goes wrong in the brain in depression and what changes when antidepressant treatments are used. Such research can help discover not only the best targets for treatment but also the factors that lead to the disorder in the first place and that might be amenable to preventative measures. Our group brings together researchers with a special interest in mood disorders with the aim of using our combined expertise (which ranges from experimental studies in animals to brain imaging in patients and clinical trials) to design and carry out research projects that would be difficult for any of us to perform working alone. In the present grant we will make particular use of new techniques of magnetic brain imaging to learn more about the brain circuits that regulate emotional experience and the way in which they are modified by clinical mood disorders and their treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9900922","grantId":"G9900922","fundValue":"654010","fundStart":"2000-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip John Cowen","coPersons":["Robert David Rogers","John Richard Geddes","Paul  Grasby","Trevor  Sharp","Paul  Harrison","Catherine  Harmer","Guy  Goodwin"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
