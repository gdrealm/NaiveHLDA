{"id":"EF040BD9-2060-4601-AFFC-6E28C73E68EF","title":"SeaScreen: expanding a bioprocess repertoire by smart marine microbe screening.","abstractText":"The aim of this proposal is to discover new oxidase enzymes with industrially relevant substrate specificities for integration with the Ingenza deracemisation bioprocess for the manufacture of enantiopure chiral amines and amino acids. Currently, the technology cannot be used on the majority of substrates in the (R)-amine or L-amino acid families due to the lack of suitable oxidases and significant markets are therefore inaccessible. Marine microorganisms represent a vast, diverse and underdeveloped source of novel enzymes for biocatalysis. This project brings together significant members of the fields of marine biotechnology and biocatlaysis for the first time and will deliver industrially useful novel oxidases by developing highly innovative and powerful screening and selection technologies and novel, high yielding, scalable and economic enzyme production systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E010792/1","grantId":"DT/E010792/1","fundValue":"128947","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The results have been used by Ingenza as industrial partner in their development of enzymatic oxidative deamination reactions, notably with respect to enzyme purification, testing and characterisation.
