{"id":"788FDC85-AD6C-4795-8078-B591C0D7BADA","title":"Automatic Generation of Content for 3D Displays","abstractText":"Humans live and work in a 3D world, so display technologies should beable to deliver 3D also. Three dimensional display systems have moved from being technological curiosities and are now becoming practical display systems used for entertainment, commercial and scientific applications. Indeed now there are several commercial, goggles free systems.The problem is that there is a lack of 3D content to play on these 3D viewers, most films and other videos of interest are 2D. What if somehow we could take an old movie (like Charlie Chaplin) and convert it into a format that we could play in 3D? This the major aim of this proposal.A secondary aim is to allow easier capture of 3D content in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C007220/1","grantId":"EP/C007220/1","fundValue":"171593","fundStart":"2006-04-28","fundEnd":"2008-11-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Reid","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
