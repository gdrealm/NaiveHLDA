Studies in genetically altered mouse embryos have helped identify the most important gene within the 22q11 deletion as Tbx1. However, the severity of symptoms can vary greatly, suggesting that other genes outside the deleted region also play important roles.\n\nOur recent studies on mouse embryos have suggested that the Sprouty genes control the development of many of the organs affected in DiGeorge syndrome. Using sophisticated mouse genetics we will remove the Sprouty genes from defined tissues to understand their roles during organ development. We will test whether changing the levels of Sprouty genes can affect the severity of defects in mouse models of this syndrome, which would indicate that mutations in Sprouty genes could also affect human patients in a similar way.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601104","grantId":"G0601104","fundValue":"580981","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michiel Albertus Basson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
