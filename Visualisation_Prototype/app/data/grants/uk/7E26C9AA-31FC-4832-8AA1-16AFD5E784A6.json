{"id":"7E26C9AA-31FC-4832-8AA1-16AFD5E784A6","title":"Towards electrochemically controlled nucleic acid-amplification strategies","abstractText":"One of the critical functions of DNA is its ability to undergo conformational change, more precisely the association (hybridisation) and disassociation (denaturation) of the double helix. While not only indispensable inside the cell, many invaluable molecular biology technologies, across many different disciplines, that exploit and detect DNA rely on this reversible function. These include for example the polymerase chain reaction (PCR, DNA biosensor and next generation sequencing for diagnostics for healthcare, biomedical research, forensics, environmental monitoring, and food and agricultural industry.\n\nMany of these DNA-based technologies rely on the large quantities of the genetic material. This can be achieved via various biochemical reactions, such PCR. Technologies exploiting production of large quantities of DNA is a rapidly growing area in life sciences in which the dominating technology is PCR. However, to copy and produce large quantities of DNA, PCR requires considerable technical instrumentation. This is because the biochemical reaction, based on the reversible association and dissociation of DNA, is driven by precise regulation of three distinct elevated temperatures. This prerequisite significantly compromises the use of PCR outside well equipped laboratories. As there is an increasing demand in making DNA-based testing portable and available outside a centralised laboratory setting, the development of these technologies is driven towards miniaturisation and integration of standard laboratory procedures into lab-on-a-chip systems. However, integration of the standard temperature-regulated PCR reaction has proven to be challenging due to the requirement and complexity of the precise temperature regulation to drive the reaction. This has thus far precluded the realisation of truly decentralised miniaturised DNA-based analytical systems.\n\nWe have recently demonstrated that we can reversibly control the association and dissociation of DNA, at a constant temperature, by means of electrochemistry. The fundamental control is based on an electrochemically switchable small DNA binding chemical compound named daunomycin. As no extreme conditions were implicated, and the precise temperature-regulation of reversible association and dissociation of DNA was circumvented, this finding has great potential to simplify future developments of miniaturised portable DNA-based analytical systems. \n\nThis project proposes a radically new way of controlling the association and dissociation of DNA as a new tool to control all types of biological reactions that rely on reversible DNA hybridisation events. A wide range of biological applications can make use of this new tool and, thus, addresses any of the strategic priorities of BBSRC relying on detection and testing based on DNA. To pump prime these developments and to show the proof-of-principle, we aim to apply this new tool to develop electrochemically controlled PCR (ePCR). \n\nAn initial study in our research group showed that the conditions utilised for the electrochemical control of association and dissociation of DNA was compatible with the standard PCR reaction conditions. Furthermore, it proved that the PCR reaction was not inhibited by the presence of the electroactive DNA binding compound daunomycin. \n\nThis early-stage investigation of a novel concept, we believe, is vital for the development and commercial success of a low-energy consuming portable DNA-based analytical platforms. As the current method is based electrochemical control, it offers a simpler, integration-friendly and cost-effective alternative to current technologies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L01808X/1","grantId":"BB/L01808X/1","fundValue":"140653","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Till  Bachmann","coPersons":["Holger  Schulze","Anthony John Walton","Andrew  Mount","Jason  Crain"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
