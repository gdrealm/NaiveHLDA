For over 80 years, the Earth's core has been considered to consist of an iron-nickel alloy; more recently it has been suggested that it must also contain a few percent of light alloying elements such as silicon or sulphur. The pressure range in the core is ~135","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H003975/1","grantId":"NE/H003975/1","fundValue":"665094","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-01","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Lidunka  Vocadlo","coPersons":["David  Dobson","Ian George Wood"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" 1. It has long been thought that, due to its proximity to iron in the periodic table, the presence of nickel in the Earth's core would have no affect on the physical properties of the core. Our research shows that this is not the case; indeed at low temperatures nickel profoundly influences the elastic properties of iron. At core conditions (360 GPa and ~6000K) the effect is much reduced. But this is as a result of temperature, not as a result of nickel content.\n\n2. The presence of nickel in FeNi strongly affects the phase diagram at high pressures and temperatures\n\n3. The elastic properties of iron show a marked pre-melting behaviour very close to melting; this could explain the previously observed differences between seismological and mineralogical models for the Earth's core.
