Most neurons of the system are grouped into ganglia that lie along the spinal column, called dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Axons from DRG neurons grow to the skin, muscle, organs and other tissues of the trunk and limbs (target fields) where specialised nerve endings sense stimuli such as heat, cold, movement, vibration and harmful chemicals. Each DRG contains a number of different types of sensory neurons each specialized to sense a particular type of stimulus. Neurons that detect extremes of heat, cold and mechanical stimuli and harmful chemicals, signal pain to us and are called nociceptive neurons. Neurotrophic factors are a group of proteins that have beneficial or trophic effects on neurons. In the developing embryo, sensory neurons require various neurotrophic factors for survival and for growth of their axons to target fields. After birth, neurotrophic factors are still required by some sensory neurons to survive. They are also required to keep axons in contact with their target fields and help axons re-grow to their target fields after injury. Neurotrophic factors also direct different types of sensory neurons to become specialized to sense particular types of stimuli. Different functional types of sensory neurons require different neurotrophic factors for survival, maintenance of axons and maintenance of specific functional properties. Macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) is a protein with numerous effects on skin, blood, epithelial and bone cells. MSP exerts its effects on responsive cells by binding to a cell surface receptor protein called RON. Much of the research investigating the roles of neurotrophic factors has been carried out in the mouse. Recently, MSP has been shown to have a novel neurotrophic role on mouse sensory neurons, promoting their survival in embryonic development in much the same way as another neurotrophic factor, NGF. It also appears to behave like NGF in regulating the expression of functionally important genes in adult mouse DRG neurons placed in tissue culture, suggesting that some adult pain-sensing DRG neurons require MSP as a neurotrophic factor for normal functioning and MSP may determine the functional characteristics of some types of sensory neurons. This project will study, in detail, the role that MSP plays in the normal development and functioning of mouse DRG neurons. First, I will carefully characterise what types of DRG neurons respond to MSP at different ages from birth to adult. Next I will determine whether MSP is required for the survival of DRG neurons, especially pain-sensing neurons, in newborn, juvenile and adult mice. To make this possible, a genetically altered mouse will be created that allows the MSP receptor RON to be functionally disabled in pain-sensing neurons when desired. Next, I will investigate whether MSP can promote the growth of newborn, juvenile and adult DRG neuron axons and whether the number of nociceptive neuron nerve endings are reduced in the skin of adult mice in the absence of functional RON. Following this, I will find out whether the ability of mice to detect heat, mechanical stimuli and chemicals is altered when the neurotrophic effects of MSP are blocked by disabling RON in pain-sensing neurons. Nerve injury and chronic diseases like diabetes can stop neurons working properly resulting in either persistent pain (neuropathic pain) or the sensation of tingling, pins and needles and/or numbness (neuropathy). The symptoms of neuropathy are often associated with a loss of nociceptor nerve endings in the skin. I will investigate whether MSP normally provides protection against nerve injury. I will do this by disabling RON in nociceptive neurons and seeing whether this makes neuropathic pain and diabetic neuropathy worse in experimental mouse models of these diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D01168X/1","grantId":"BB/D01168X/1","fundValue":"224265","fundStart":"2006-07-31","fundEnd":"2009-07-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sean Lee Wyatt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
