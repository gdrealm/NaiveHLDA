{"id":"BAC95FE2-6113-4EF2-AFEA-655B2514B321","title":"Impedance Control on Uncertain Objects","abstractText":"Robots have been able to serve the original promise to replace human counterparts in laborious, hazardous, and repetitive tasks mainly in the area of position control that includes tasks such as pick and place of components, arc welding, grinding known objects, and even in bipedal walking on fairly smooth and known grounds. However, robots still find it hard to carry out stable force control tasks on uncertain objects or walk on natural soft terrains (grass, sand, mud). Just like the difference between the way we use the left hand and the right hand can not be explained using their biomechanical basis alone, the answer to robotic survival in uncertain environments does not come from an attempt to build robots that resemble human bodies alone. From early 1980s, scientists have begun to believe that the secrets of stable interactions with natural compliant environments will come from an ability of the robot itself to be compliant. The original work of Neville Hogan on impedance control was based on this concept. Since then, a considerable body of literature can be found on how impedance control is applied in various force control applications such as rehabilitation, massaging, bipedal walking, exoskeletal robotics, and several other direct interactions with humans. However, still there is no answer to how impedance control should be adaptively managed to sustain stability when the coupled dynamics between the robot and the environment evolves metastable dynamics. The theory of Metastability states that an uncertain dynamics system can exhibit intermittent instability though it may stay stable most of the time. A human using a screw driver is one example, where the dynamic contact with the screw may stay stable most of the time, but exhibit intermittent slipping due to uncertainty in the friction between the screw and the surrounding medium. Even a human walker can fall down in rare situations due to the same phenomenon. However, an uncertain dynamic system can enhance stability if it can predict where it is likely to fail. A number of recent advances in metastable systems use the concept of mean first passage time (MFPT) as an indicator to assess the current control policy in an uncertain environment. MFPT is the expected time to the next failure situation given the current knowledge of the uncertain dynamics of the coupled dynamics of the robot and the environment.Therefore, this project aims at developing a unifying theory of impedance control for robots that are in dynamic contact with uncertain environments. The generic method that can start to perform stable hybrid position/force control on an uncertain environment with partially known dynamics and recursively build a robust internal model to perform stable position/force control on an environment that changed its stiffness, viscosity, and inertia. Then an algorithm will be developed to use a locally linearised model of the above coupled dynamic system to estimate the MFPT of the robot and the environment. This MFPT will then be used in a novel real-time algorithm to adapt a bank of candidate impedance parameter sets and adaptively choose the best parameter set to suit the environment in order to maximise the MFPT. Rigorous theoretical proofs of stability and experimental validation of methods will be given. The project will use a custom built experimental platform to evaluate and refine the fundamental theories and algorithms that will be developed in this project. The PI will closely collaborate with Shadow Robotics Company, a UK based SME who develops biomimetic robotic hands, and the robotics group led by Professor Darwin Caldwell at the Italian Institute of Technology, where the researchers strive to enable the humanoid robot i-Cub to interact with natural uncertain environments. Therefore, this project will benefit from a wealth of experiences the collaborators have already gathered on real robots interacting with natural environments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I028773/1","grantId":"EP/I028773/1","fundValue":"97667","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Thrishantha  Nanayakkara","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":" Findings were presented in the following publications:\n\n\n\nThrishantha Nanayakkara, Katie Byl, Hongbin Liu, Xiaojin Song, &amp; Tim Villabona, &quot;Dominant Sources of Variability in Passive Walking&quot;, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 1003-1010, 2012\n\n\n\n1. By conducting numerical modeling and experimental evidence for the first time, this paper presents the possible sources of variability in the dynamics of legged locomotion, even in its most idealized form. \n\n2. Here, we show that the dominant source of steady state variability of passive dynamic walking is due to nonlinear interaction between the distribution of the coefficient of friction and restitution with the collision dynamics, and not simply due to geometric variations more typically modelled in terrain. \n\n3. Our results suggest that stochastic ground collision models should play an important role in the analysis and optimization of dynamic performance and stability in robot walking.\n\n\n\nFabio Bianchi, Giulia Bartoli, Kya Shoar, Maria R.

Analysis shows that the computational challenges of robust walking on uncertain visco-elastic terrains can be reduced by investigating different combinations of internal and external impedances.\n\n2. Given the impedance of a terrain, memory primitives of steady state variability of states of locomotion (contact force distribution and distribution of angular speed at each foot collision) can be used to choose an internal impedance of the walker in order to passively migrate to a desired steady state variability, without any control.\n\n\n\nAllen Jiang, George Xynogalas, Prokar Dasgupta, Kaspar Althoefer, and Thrishantha Nanayakkara, &quot;Design of a variable stiffness flexible manipulator with composite granular jamming and membrane coupling,&quot; pp. 2922 - 2927, IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2012), Vilamoura, Portugal, 2012.\n\n\n\n1. Effect of granule shape for granular jamming: Cubes work better than spheres in terms of hysteresis and variability of stiffening and relaxation cycles.\n\n2. Effect of granule size for granular jamming: Smaller is better in terms of hysteresis and variability of stiffening and relaxation cycles.\n\n3. Effect of granule stiffness for granular jamming: Stiffer granules provide higher rigidity when jammed, but softer granules provide better hysteresis and variability across stiffening and relaxation cycles.\n\n4. Properties can be combined to create composite granules, such as stiff cubes with a soft outer layer. This composite granule improved hysteresis over purely stiff granules and improved rigidity over purely soft granules.\n\n5. Coupling the membrane to the granules can improve hysteresis as well.\n\n\n\nAllen Jiang, Joao Bimbo, Simon Goulder, Hongbin Liu, Xiojin Song, and Thrishantha Nanayakkara, &quot;Adaptive grip control on an uncertain object&quot;, pp. 1161 - 1166, IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2012), Vilamoura, Portugal, 2012. \n\n\n\n1. A statistical controller that uses a real-time estimate of probability of grip failure on an uncertain object can maintain stable grip on a randomly pulsating object without prior knowledge of its properties.\n\n2. A safety factor can be implemented into the controller to provide a general bias to close the grip than relaxing the grip.\n\n3.
