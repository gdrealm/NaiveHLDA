{"id":"2026BA30-D78E-4288-A5DE-6542BB96327E","title":"Genomic analysis of complex speciation in Heliconius","abstractText":"Recent ideas suggest that evolution of new species (speciation) may be complex, whereby different parts of the genome separate at different times rather than a simple process consisting of a single split. Even our own species has been suggested to result from hybridization with chimpanzee lineages a few million years ago, although this conclusion is contested. Recent high-throughput genomics technologies now permit detailed investigation of complex speciation in likely non-model organism candidates, such as Heliconius butterflies. Heliconius are conspicuous warningly coloured tropical butterflies distasteful to birds. The patterns of most species also mimic those of other Heliconius or ithomiine butterflies. Some species show remarkable divergence in colour patterns between geographical races or species, but others share suspiciously similar patterns with closely related species, which they could have acquired via hybridization long after speciation. Hybridization is common: 35% of species are involved. In the melpomene/silvaniform group, almost all species are known to hybridize and backcross in both lab and in nature. This fascinating system provides an excellent test group for studying recent ideas about complex speciation. In this project, we will determine the extent to which four species (Heliconius melpomene, H. numata, H. elevatus and H. timareta) have recently exchanged parts of their genomes. This project brings together British and overseas knowledge of Heliconius butterfly biology and the latest genomic technologies to understand the genetic mechanisms that lead to the origin and maintenance of species. We propose to combine new high-throughput genomic technologies (454 and Solexa sequencing, and Illumina genotyping array chips) to map genomic regions in two focal species, H. melpomene and H. numata from Peru. Next generation sequencing technology will be used to obtain large amounts of genomic sequence data from the two species to identify thousands of genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs). Subsequently, we will use these SNPs to produce high resolution genetic maps of each species. We will then genotype wild-caught specimens of H. melpomene, H. numata, H. elevatus and H. timareta. If complex speciation is occurring, we expect to find regions of shared polymorphism (indicating regions of recent exchange) and 'genomic islands' of fixed differences (indicating regions of older divergence probably surrounding sites of divergently selected genes such as those affecting mimicry, genomic incompatibility, mate choice, and ecological adaptations). A number of Eastern Andean taxa have recently been discovered that are close to H. melpomene, yet remain distinct from that species. The species contain some gene markers more similar to another species, H. cydno, but unlike that species they often share the local mimicry colour pattern of H. melpomene. We predict that these forms acquired their colour pattern via hybridization, which is a relatively common phenomenon in Heliconius. Using SNPs concentrated around these genes we will investigate the possibility that H. melpomene genes have been transferred to these segregate forms via hybridization, leading to the formation of new hybrid species. These SNPs will also allow investigation of colour pattern polymorphism in races of H. melpomene and H. numata The proposed research is a collaboration between Heliconius experts at a number of UK universities, The Gene Pool (Edinburgh), and the Centre for Microarray Resources (Cambridge). Further laboratory/bioinformatics support will be provided by the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology (Germany). Up to now, whole-genome studies have been restricted to a few model organisms such as fruit flies and mice. Our proposal outlines a means of enabling ground breaking whole-genome understanding of evolution and speciation in a wild tropical organism for the first time.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G00661X/1","grantId":"BB/G00661X/1","fundValue":"104485","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Lyon Blaxter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" The evolutionary importance of hybridization and introgression haslong been debated\n\n1. Hybrids are usually rare and unfit, but even infrequent hybridization can aid adaptation by transferring beneficial traits between species. Here we use genomic tools to investigate introgression in Heliconius, a rapidly radiating genus of neotropical butterflies widely used in studies of ecology, behaviour, mimicry and speciation\n\n2-5. We sequenced the genome of Heliconius melpomene and compared it with other taxa to investigate chromosomal evolution in Lepidoptera and gene flow among multiple Heliconius species and races. Among 12,669 predicted genes, biologically important expansions of families of chemosensory and Hoxgenes are particularly noteworthy. Chromosomal organizationhas remained broadly conserved since the Cretaceous period, when butterflies split from the Bombyx (silkmoth) lineage. Using genomic resequencing, we show hybrid exchange of genes between three co-mimics, Heliconius melpomene, Heliconius timareta andHeliconius elevatus, especially at two genomic regions that control mimicry pattern. We infer that closely related Heliconius species exchange protective colour-pattern genes promiscuously, implying that hybridization has an important role in adaptive radiation.  ","dataset":"gtr"}
