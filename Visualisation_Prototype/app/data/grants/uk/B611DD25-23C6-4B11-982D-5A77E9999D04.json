Despite public safety messages about the effects of exceeding speed limits, on an individual level these messages are often mediated by a driver's &quot;optimistic bias&quot; and their own perceived capability. Many drivers, when asked, feel they are significantly safer than the average driver. So when presented with a safety message many drivers will feel that they seldom make the mistake that is illustrated, or have the capability to cope with the situation.</p>\n\n<p>What we propose to do is develop on-line &quot;virtual reality&quot; demonstrations of a range of errors that drivers can make in judging vehicle speed and pull-out time. These will highlight how, as humans, we are limited in our ability to judge speed of approach and as a result the speeding driver creates potential errors in other road users as s/he travels through urban environments. We have run a three month demonstration of this type in the Science Museum, but this project will develop a broader set of realistic demonstrations that can be distributed through road safety charities and campaigns.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-189-25-0325","grantId":"RES-189-25-0325","fundValue":"89577","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John Philip Wann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
