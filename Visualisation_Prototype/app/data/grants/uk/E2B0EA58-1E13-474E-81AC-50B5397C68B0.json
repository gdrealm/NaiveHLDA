{"id":"E2B0EA58-1E13-474E-81AC-50B5397C68B0","title":"Gold-Catalysed Cycloisomerisations","abstractText":"Cyclic structures are are ubiquitous in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, natural products and fine chemicals. Thus the preparation of ring systems and being able to control cyclisation reactions is very important and presents a major challenge to organic synthesis. New methods to access these type of species more readily are therefore highly desirable. Shorter, more flexible, easy and efficient routes into useful molecules can have several significant benefits to the wider community. This includes the use of fewer reagents, less hazardous chemicals, and less energy to make important molecules. All of these factors have subsequent benefits in terms of using less of our limited natural resources (chemical and energy) and producing less of the dangerous waste materials that must be disposed off. Potentially, more efficient strategies and transformations can also have economic benefits, making overall processes and the resulting products less costly. The importance of developing more effective approaches cannot therefore be understated and in this research we look at using new highly efficient catalytic methods to access a wide variety of carbo and heterocyclic structures that have clear application throughout synthetic chemistry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F031254/1","grantId":"EP/F031254/1","fundValue":"159544","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings here have contributed to understanding reactivity and applicability in the rapidly developing arena of gold catalysis, recognised for its potential to access highly efficient and superbly applicable reactions to access molecular complexity. Our findings in this study have significantly informed our continued research in the field of ynamides in gold catalysis. Showing how ynamide can control cyclisation and override geometric bias the how the ynamide can be used to access exquisite regiocontrol which led into our advances in intermolecular applications. Cultural ","person":"Paul William Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" This project involved the development and study of a range of cycloisomerisation reactions catalysed by gold species. These allow quite simple, readily assembled chemical precursors to be transformed into more complex structures under mild conditions with high chemical efficiency. Key findings include: the scope of the direct keto-alkyne cycloisomerisation reaction; the importance of adventitious water in these reactions; the discovery of unexpected reaction pathways to provide new transformations; how structural modifications and changes in reaction conditions can be used to influence the varied reaction pathways. A significant advance was establishing that the geometric bias in cyclisation reactions could be overridden through the use of a particular-type of electronically biased alkyne. Novel synthetic methodology can be applied in an industrial context for the preparation of organic compounds for various ends (for instance, pharmaceutical and agrochemical) depending on the target structures. The research developed here includes novel transformations and strategies for facile molecular assembly and evaluation of the scope of these reactions to inform potential users. Specifically we discovered here a method to rapidly assemble complex 3D core structures in a single step - providing entry into new natural product-like 3D fragments and highly functionalised heterocycles. The discovery of the regiocontrolling effect can be used across a wider variety of new transformations. Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
