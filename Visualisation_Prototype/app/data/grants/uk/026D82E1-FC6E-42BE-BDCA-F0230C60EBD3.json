Over 3% of genes in eukaryotic genomes are involved in ubiquitinmediated\nproteolysis. Misregulation of proteolytic control can lead to cancer,\nmetabolic syndromes, ageing and neurodegenerative disease.\nWe want to study one of cellular enzymes that mediate the ubiquitin-mediated\nproteolysis, called the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and\nunderstand how the APC/C ubiquitylates different proteins at different times during\ncell division to ensure the timely and faithful division to produce two genetically\nidentical daughter cells. Deregulation of this process causes genetic instability, which\nis a hallmark of cancer. Thus, unravelling the mechanistic action of the APC/C is one\nof the major outstanding questions in cancer biology. Furthermore, the APC/C\nmodulates DNA replication, DNA repair, brain function and metabolic processes and\nthus a better understanding of how the APC/C works in cells will benefit for human\nhealth as new finding might provide potential biomarkers useful for early diagnosis\nand information useful for the development of new drugs.\nAt present, major difficulties in studying APC/C-dependent ubiquitylation arise from\nthe sheer size and complexity of the ligase composed of 14 subunits and thus no\nsystematic mutational analysis of vertebrate APC/C has been reported. Now we have\ndeveloped a method to study Xenopus APC/C by reconstituted apo-APC/C together\nwith a series of unique biochemical assays. In this system, we can remove or mutate\nessential APC/C subunits, which cannot be deleted from living cells. In this project,\nwe will focus on Apc3 and Cdc20 and aim to conduct an in-depth investigation of\ntheir regulation. This programme provides a robust platform for new APC/C research,\nby facilitating the detailed study of co-activator binding, activation and ubiquitylation\ncatalysis, while also assisting possible extension of translational and clinical\napplications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M010899/1","grantId":"MR/M010899/1","fundValue":"475228","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Hiro  Yamano","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
