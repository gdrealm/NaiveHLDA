It will cover the period from the invention of the medium to the present day, and will examine Scottish photographers working at home and abroad. Equally, it will explore the contribution of international photographers who were engaged special 'Scottish' projects. The study looks to extend the notion of the photograph into vernacular images and hence examine the ways in which photography was used to visualise the developing sense of Scotland as a modern nation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112627/1","grantId":"112627/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Normand","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
