Seminar series.","abstractText":"This seminar series proposes that 'practice theory', an innovative social science approach which studies 'what we do' in situ and in the everyday, offers a basis and a language for conducting conversations about civil society. It will focus on how civil society is enacted in contexts where care, peer support and learning are recognised as important. Although these are arguably ubiquitous areas of 'lived experience', health and education are treated as separate institutionally and through academic conventions of subjects and disciplines. Civil society organisations [CSOs] are not bound to these conventions, operating in spaces connected to, but also 'outside' or 'other than', public institutions. These afford them new and different capabilities for bringing continuity and recognition to citizens' lived experiences. The seminars aim to articulate, with/through the expertise of CSOs, 'new publics': those collectives that emerge when care, peer support and learning are understood from the point of view of CSOs instead of public institutions.\n\nPractice theory challenges conventional individualistic or over-rationalistic explanations, exploring how what people and organisations do is shaped by routines and tools as well as by conscious choices. As a result it has been seen as relevant for trying to change ordinary practices, particularly (to date) in relation to climate change and, increasingly, public health. It also offers a way for organisations to think about their own work at a time when the boundaries of CSOs and statutory public services are being renegotiated. \n\nThe seminar series will specifically aim to articulate the 'practices' that CSOs support communities and citizens to enact. These could be (eg) practices that: enable volunteers to support parents of children with additional needs; involve rights-based advocacy and campaigning; support individual wellbeing via a telephone helpline and 1-to-1 service. The seminars aim to work with local user communities to understand how 'knowing' is produced in practice across within and across organisational contexts, evaluate strength- or asset-based approaches like resilience, social capital, capabilities or capacity-building in health, youth work and social care, parental engagement practices in education, the place for community in the design and development of new technologies and data practices. \n \nThe series is specifically rooted in local contexts. The University of Brighton has links with CSOs through its Community University Partnership Programme [CUPP], often noted as a model of excellent practice. All applicant HEIs research with and for CSOs and connect them with students for placements. However, involving them in other aspects of academic life, including theoretical reflection and development, is often more fraught or under-developed, as is making connections across different fields. This seminar series would build on these links, but extend partnerships to discuss the value of theories of practice for CSOs, inviting CSOs to think beyond their own domains, and to consider what/if they might learn from connecting with other CSOs and HEIs. It is open-ended and even tentative about what might emerge here.\n\nTo enable genuine engagement by CSOs, we will offer small bursaries and innovate the structure of the series. We begin with a two-day face to face event bringing all participants (approx 40) together, co-delivered by CSO collaborators. Subsequent one-day seminars allow for virtual participation using webinar technologies. Each seminar will identify key ideas to be explored, exemplars, and relevant methods to promote. The series culminates in an intensive writing workshop (a 'book sprint') where a small, diverse group will collectively generate an e-book that explains the relevance of practice theory approaches to questions of civil society and its organisation, so that the learning from the series can be quickly disseminated, developed and contested.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N009398/1","grantId":"ES/N009398/1","fundValue":"30184","fundStart":"2015-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sara  Bragg","coPersons":["Mary  Darking","Kay  Aranda","Kate  Weiner","Nadia  Edmond","Catherine Marijke Will"],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
