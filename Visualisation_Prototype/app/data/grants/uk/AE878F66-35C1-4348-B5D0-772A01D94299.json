A cross-national longitudinal analysis.","abstractText":"<p>Households can be seen as sites of cooperative conflict within which household members cooperate to increase total household resources but are inherently in conflict over the division of the fruits of that cooperation. These distributional processes affect and are affected by gendered opportunities of men and women in consumption, time-use, health and social contacts. This project aims to uncover the ways in which an unequal distribution of power within households, resulting in unequal entitlements to household resources, interacts with the more recognised inequality between households.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Knowing the factors that influence entitlements within households should enable policy to be designed to protect those with less power and enhance equal opportunities. Further, many policies, including those designed to reduce social exclusion, eliminate child poverty and improve family stability, should be able to be improved by understanding effects on intrahousehold allocation processes that can enhance or undermine the policies' effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Longitudinal household data for the UK, Australia, Germany and the EU-15 will be examined to explore cross-country differences in the effect of household-specific factors on men's and women's entitlements and whether particular socio-economic or institutional factors can explain these differences. This will provide a benchmark for developing policy in the UK and elsewhere.&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G008825/1","grantId":"ES/G008825/1","fundValue":"261693","fundStart":"2008-11-17","fundEnd":"2012-12-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Felicity Himmelweit","coPersons":["Cristina  Santos","Jerome  De Henau"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":" This project aimed to investigate cross-nationally the gendered factors that influence the benefits that men and women in couples receive from their joint household income.
