{"id":"46AB0AE1-1CCA-44D8-AD59-9B77DA5E7E96","title":"Investigating Natural Sciences in Wild Ennerdale: building an Education Hub at Low Gillerthwaite Field Centre","abstractText":"The Low Gillerthwaite Field Centre Association (LGFC) is seeking an STFC Public Engagement Small Grant to recruit and train a core group of 10-12 volunteers from the LGFC membership and the wider community in West Cumbria to deliver a series of events that will showcase the excitement of natural science in core STFC subject areas. The approach will be to inform, entertain and inspire the audience by providing the opportunity to do hands-on experimental and observational science during both residential and open access (public) events. Under the banner of the STFC-LGFC Education Hub, this project will build and sustain a team of volunteers who will deliver residential workshops and public access events in STFC key subject areas of astronomy, particle physics, solar system and space science and sustainable energy to facilitate public awareness of STFC science projects.\n\nTo support the LGFC volunteer team we will establish a network of external experts in the key STFC subjects who will contribute at workshops and experimental/observational events held the STFC-LGFC Education Hub. We will draw on expertise from the academic community in northern England, particularly those engaged in STFC projects, and from industry. We will also draw on the wealth of expertise in our local communities, particularly in amateur associations and societies, where we already have strong links. \n\nWe will aim to provide opportunities for &quot;hands-on&quot; activities in STFC core subjects through provision of equipment and materials to support the classroom presentations. Our participants will learn to describe and understand the nature of astronomical objects visible in the Gillerthwaite dark skies and we will provide familiarity with simple equipment used to study and gather data about them. This will include information about techniques of astrophotography at a level sufficient to enable participants to start taking their own images. We will emphasise how this work at an introductory level relates to the cutting-edge science and facilities available at STFC-funded laboratories. In the sustainable energy theme we will aim to foster awareness of the issues involved in implementing strategies in sustainable energy at a micro- (LGFC operates its own micro-hydroelectric scheme) and macro-scale and focus on the opportunities and threats that exist for the UK, and the world, in the transition to a low-carbon economy. We will emphasise how STFC technologies in this field are enabling this transition. \n\nLGFC has an integrated approach to public engagement with the natural sciences. In addition to core themes of astronomy and sustainable energy the Centre will also offer workshops and public access events in planetary geoscience and geology. We intend also to develop a theme in ecology and biology reflecting our Ennerdale location at the focus of the Forestry Commission Wild Ennerdale wild land restoration project (www.wildennerdale.co.uk). While we do not seek support for these initiatives here, they are mentioned to show the potential for future cross-research council, multi-disiplinary funding applications in response to calls for greater integration and outreach activity by individual research councils and RCUK.\n\nThe mission of the LGFC (www.lgfc.org.uk) is to inform and enthuse young people about natural science and conservation in the beautiful setting of Ennerdale in the Lake District National Park. The Centre focuses on bringing an appreciation and understanding of the natural world to young people from urban backgrounds particularly those from cities and large towns of northern England and those from underprivileged backgrounds. The impact on the individual within the target groups is potentially profound. Many of our visitors may never have ventured out of a city before experiencing the wild environment and dark skies of Ennerdale. By introducing young people from such backgrounds to natural science in this environment we can change lives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N001850/1","grantId":"ST/N001850/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2015-10-21","fundEnd":"2018-10-20","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"John  Grocott","coPersons":["Brian  Burscough","John  Shaddock"],"organisation":"Low Gillerthwaite Field Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
