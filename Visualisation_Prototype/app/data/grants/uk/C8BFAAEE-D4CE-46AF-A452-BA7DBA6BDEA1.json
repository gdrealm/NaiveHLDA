{"id":"C8BFAAEE-D4CE-46AF-A452-BA7DBA6BDEA1","title":"Staying Safe: A sociology of how injecting drug users avoid viral infection in the long-term","abstractText":"<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality linked to injecting drug use (IDU). Over 60 per cent&nbsp;of IDUs in London are HCV antibody positive, rising to over 75 per cent&nbsp;prevalence among those injecting for at least eight years. </p>\n\n<p>This qualitative study explores the long-term viral avoidance in an environment of high risk. Qualitative life history interviews will be undertaken with 30 long-term IDUs who have not been exposed to hepatitis C alongside interviews with 30 who have been exposed to hepatitis C. In addition, a sub-sample will be followed-up twice over 9-12 months. This study is akin to a 'positive deviance' 'control-case' design which reverses a traditional focus on risk associated with incident cases of infection to concentrate on long-term avoidance of infection in a setting of high transmission risk.</p>\n\n<p>The aim is to understand the social practices of long-term viral avoidance, and how these are shaped through the trajectories of IDUs and their social contexts over time. The findings will inform a new generation of HCV prevention interventions in the UK. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1766","grantId":"RES-062-23-1766","fundValue":"305443","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tim  Rhodes","coPersons":["Christopher Philip Bonell","Lisa  Maher","Samuel Robert Friedman","Carla  Treloar","Vivian David Hope"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
