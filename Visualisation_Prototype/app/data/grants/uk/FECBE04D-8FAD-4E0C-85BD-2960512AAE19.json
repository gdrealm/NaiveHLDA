{"id":"FECBE04D-8FAD-4E0C-85BD-2960512AAE19","title":"Leukotriene E4 receptors in asthma pathogenesis","abstractText":"The incidence of bronchial asthma has increased during last two decades in the UK, affecting more than 5 million people and putting the UK in the first place among European countries with the highest prevalence of the disease. In spite of great efforts we still do not fully understand the primary mechanisms leading to development of asthmatic symptoms. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) appear to be one of the major substances causing asthma and asthmatic lungs are very sensitive to the effects of these substances, especially to leukotriene E4 (LTE4). This disproportionate sensitivity to LTE4 is even more increased in a subpopulation of patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. We propose to characterise new receptors for cysLTs and define the way that cysLTs exert their action on lung cells. Our research will allow an understanding of the role of the cysLTs in the mechanism of bronchial asthma and may lead to new treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900536","grantId":"G0900536","fundValue":"497294","fundStart":"2010-01-25","fundEnd":"2013-07-24","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Grzegorz  Woszczek","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
