These large data sets are used to build computational models of the organism and enable predications to be made of how cells, organs and whole organisms develop and react to the environment including diseases. Such studies will lead to greater opportunities in many fields including clinical diagnosis, drug design, and, in agriculture, predictions of how crops will react to stresses such as drought and climate change. The 'omics' sciences are a generic term for the generation and study of these large datasets. Metabolomics (the study of all of the metabolites in a biological system) represents one of the most technically challenging of the large-scale analytical sciences that are providing the data for systems biology. There are many thousands of different metabolites present in an organism at any one time. These are measured by application of spectroscopic techniques such as NMR and mass spectroscopy to biofluids such as blood and urine or to solvent extracts of tissue such as plant leaves and fruits. Metabolite fingerprints generated by these techniques can only be partially interpreted. One of the reasons for this is that authentic standards of each of the thousands of metabolites need to used for spectroscopic comparison to allow positive identification of an unknown compound within a metabolite fingerprint. Many key metabolite standards are not readily available or are very expensive. This proposal aims to create a repository (Met-Ex) where researchers can submit and exchange samples of metabolites that will help fellow researchers annotate metabolite fingerprints. The project will produce a curated collection of authentic samples of natural products, under the auspices of MeT-RO, a leading centre for metabolomic screening in plant and microbial sciences. These compounds will be sourced from existing collections, commercial companies and other research laboratories. They will be made available to other researchers via an online resource which will be run in a shop front style using a credits system, where participating laboratories can donate or request analytical standards of compounds of interest.
