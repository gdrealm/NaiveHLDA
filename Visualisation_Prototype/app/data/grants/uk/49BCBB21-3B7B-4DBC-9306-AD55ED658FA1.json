Stem cells are central to this process. Human embryonic stem (hES) cells are derived from the blastocyst, a hollow ball of cells formed about a week after fertilisation in the human. hES cells have the potential to turn into all cells of the body and present a potentially unlimited source of cells to treat degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer?s disease, Parkinson?s disease, multiple sclerosis and type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes. However, before hES cells can be used to treat human diseases, we need to understand how to maintain these cells efficiently in culture as well as to control their specialisation into clinically useful cell types, such as insulin-producing pancreas cells in the case of patients with diabetes. Nitric oxide is an important signalling molecule involved in the regulation of cellular function. This proposal aims to understand the role of nitric oxide in hES cells. It is proposed that nitric oxide is a critical factor in the maintenance of hES cells and increased levels control differentiation to specialised cell types. Ultimately, this research will provide important information on how to direct hES cells into clinically useful cells and enhance the provision of new therapies for patients suffering from currently incurable diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701153","grantId":"G0701153","fundValue":"332559","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Franchesca  Houghton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
