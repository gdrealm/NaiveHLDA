Against this backdrop, the recent Munro Review of Child Protection calls for local authorities to 'review and redesign the ways in which child and family social work is delivered, drawing on evidence of effectiveness of helping methods where appropriate and supporting practice that can implement evidence based ways of working with children and families' (2011, p.13).</p>\n\n<p>This project involves social work academics at the University of Edinburgh working alongside two neighbouring local authorities, the City of Edinburgh and East Lothian to, in Munroâ€™s words, 'help professionals move from a compliance culture to a learning culture' (2011, p.6).</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the project aims to help effect a shift from procedurally-based to strengths and relationship-based ways of working.

In utilising different layers of KE activity we are working towards Nutley et al's (2007) organizational excellence model of knowledge exchange whereby organizations, working in partnership with universities, become the locus for local experimentation, evaluation and practice development..\n\nThis particular project had three strands:\n\n1) Supporting practitioner research projects\n\n2) Facilitating Critical Reflection Groups\n\n3) Training managers to support their staff in the preceding strands of KE activity.\n\nI will report on findings under these three headings:\n\n1) Five training sessions around key stages of the research process were arranged for practitioner researchers. Seven projects were supported to conclusion. Each project was presented by means of a report and a poster. \n\nPractitioners were generally very positive about involvement in the research. At an individual level they learnt more about the topic of their research, about the research process through discussing each other's projects, about research techniques and ICT skills. They also felt that through engaging and involving their colleagues in various aspects of the research process they had helped foster a culture of learning within their teams. Most are keen to pursue further research and to write for publication. On a more negative note, capacity and time-constraints proved a significant challenge for the successful completion of research projects. The practitioners had mixed feelings about the amount of work they had to do in their own time. They felt the project overall was too condensed and that if it had run over a longer period it would have allowed them to better space and pace the work within the context of pressing practice contexts and possibly enabled them to produce higher quality outputs. \n\n2) We organised a series of five critical reflection workshops over a period of three months between April and June 2013, led by two social work academics (VC and MS). Each workshop lasted for four hours. We began with coffee and a general review and catch-up, as well as a discussion of research literature provided in advance. We then moved onto the critical incident or incidents, before leaving time for individual reflection and review. Twelve social workers took part: four participants returned to meet us in October 2013 for a follow-up session to look back on the workshops and discuss plans for dissemination.The critical reflection workshops demonstrated that practice with children and families' social work in Scotland is highly procedural, risk-averse and remains focused more on the assessment of problems than on prevention or support. Nevertheless, social workers continue to practise as best they can in difficult circumstances, often able to acknowledge strong emotional bonds to clients and to the profession. Many participants observed changes in their own practice and even in their lives.The advantages were expressed 'Being part of that process gave me a bit of a breathing space, a chance to take stock of my own values as a practitioner and an opportunity to fill up, not as a technician (as someone who follows the rules, though they are important too) but to fill up as a professional' (13th November 2013).\n\n3) Around 15 managers attended two training sessions. The sessions themselves were well received. However, the intention of the sessions to ensure that managers could then support practitioners in either the practitioner researcher or critical reflection groups met with mixed success. While some practitioners did acknowledge the support of their manager(s) this was not universal - 'I know that my own manager never mentioned KE once when I was on the course unless I brought it up... There was very little interest when we tried to feed back. I think what I`m trying to say is that it seemed to me that the participants in the critical reflection workshops seemed, in the main, to take a great deal from them. Also, to be able to see how much of an enhancement critical reflection incorporated into weekly working would be for the confidence of the profession and a way to build it up furthering the Munro report etc. It seems to me that unless the culture of the profession is changed at organisational level then useful 'add-ons' like critical reflection will always only be a luxury.' Several social work practice teams have instituted critical reflection groups.\n\nThe experience of knowledge exchange from this and our previous project is allowing us to build a solid understanding of 'what works' in knowledge exchange, which has resonance across a broad swathe of public sector reform. Specifically, the PI and Co-I on this project are involved in a bid from the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow for an ESRC 'What Works, Scotland' project The project concluded with an event held in the University's Playfair Library, for those involved, their managers, colleagues, senior managers in the Councils and representatives from e.g Scottish Government. Around 60 people attended. Table top discussions focused on how the lessons and the momentum of the project could be continued. \n\nDuring the project, the PI and managers from the two local authorities presented to the child protection sub-committee of the Association of Directors of Social Work. Since then:\n\nMark Smith and one of the Critical Reflectors have presented on the project to the Scottish Organisation for Practice Teaching (Scopt) Conference (3rd Dec, 2013)\n\nOne of the regular social work seminars organised by the University will be devoted to disseminating findings\n\nA session of the City of Edinburgh Practice Panel (24th March, 2014) will present findings and consider 'what next?'\n\nAn abstract has been submitted for the PI and local authority partners to present a paper at BASPCAN, a major international child protection conference to be held in Edinburgh, April 2015.\n\nPractitioner researchers have agreed to teach social work students at the University on theory to practice links.\n\nOne of the East Lothian practitioner researchers has been awarded a Practitioner in Residence Post at the Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services (IRISS).\n\nWe plan a minimum of five articles for academic journals; one has been submitted to Child and Family Social Work, two others are in preparation and two, based on individual practitioner research projects are being supported towards publication by academic mentors. All of the articles will be jointly authored by academics and practitioners.\n\nMark Smith and Andy Jeffries (City of Edinburgh manager) have met with the Scottish Social Services Council to discuss becoming 'champions' in national projects working towards asset based leadership in line with current policy directions in the public services.
