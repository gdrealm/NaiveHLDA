These including cleaning the blood of toxins and microbes and processing food into proteins to build tissues. The liver is made up of cells the most of important of which are hepatocytes and these are the engines of liver function. The access of hepatocytes to factors in the blood is controlled by another cell type, the endothelial cell, which lies above the hepatocyte in contact with the blood. The endothelial cells from channels called sinusoids which penetrate throughout the liver. This increased the amount of blood the liver cells are exposed to allowing them to efficiently remove drugs and waste products. The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids form a barrier between the hepatocytes and are specifically designed for this specialised function within the liver. For example they contain small pores or fenestrations which allow them to filter particles from blood and they have molecules on their surface which allow them to remove factors from the blood. During liver disease the endothelial cells change and increase their ability to remove bacteria and to attract white blood cells to fight infection. It is important to be able to study liver cells in the laboratory to help us understand human liver biology and what goes wrong in disease. If we can do this in the test tube using cells from human beings this will reduce the requirement for animal experimentation. However if the cells do not behave normally once they are grown in culture our models will not be useful. We have developed ways of getting liver cells out of liver tissue which is removed from a patient when they have a liver transplant. We can grow the different liver cell types in the test tube and have developed a way to grow the different cell types together called coculture. This allows us to grow an artificial 3D structure which resembles the liver sinusoid. Our early results show us that this system allows the cells to behave in a manner similar to how they behave in the body. However we need to do more experiments to determine exactly how similar these cells are to those found in humans. We want to find out (a) whether cocultured cells are more like normal cells in the body than cells grown in isolation and whether they function as normal cells would be expected to do; (b) whether the coculture method stops the liver cells becoming like diseased cells in culture; (c) whether the success of the coculture depends on the type of cells we use (e.g. if we take them from a diseased liver or if they are extracted from a normal donor liver which wasn&iquest;t suitable for transplantation; (d) finally we want to understand the molecules and interactions which cause our endothelial cells to stay like normal cells when they are cocultured with hepatocytes? These studies are important because we will learn new information about how the human liver develops and functions both in health and disease. Our culture system could also be used to test new drugs for toxic effects on the liver, thereby reducing the need for animal experiments and perhaps as a basis for the development of an artificial liver to help treat people with liver failure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D523151/1","grantId":"BB/D523151/1","fundValue":"164673","fundStart":"2006-01-03","fundEnd":"2009-01-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Patricia F Lalor","coPersons":["George Edward Rainger","David Harvey Adams"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" We have used our coculture systems to investigate the regulation of the specialised phenotype of sinusoidal endothelial cells. By using techniques including flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, ELISA, multiplex and analysis of gene\n\nexpression (RT-PCR/gene arrays/ SAGE) we have confirmed that\n\ni) HSEC express a unique profile of phenotypic markers which underlie their specialized functions in vivo. These include but are not restricted to DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, L-sectin, stabilin-1, LYVE-1, Mannose receptor, FcRs (CD16, CD32),\n\nCD36, SSAO. They also express low levels (or lack) other markers which are more abundant upon vascular EC including CD99, CD31, Lysyl oxidase, vWF, Collagen 1a, Vimentin, Laminin a1 and b4.\n\nii) HSEC secrete a number of soluble mediators which influence the local inflammatory environment including (IL-1b, IL-1RA, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-6, I:-7, IL-8, IL-12, bFGF, GCSF, CXCL9-11, HGF, CCL3, CCL4 and VEGF)\n\niii) As HSEC dedifferentiate in culture they produce a more mature basal lamina by increasing production of Collagen 1A, Collagen IV and Laminin. They also loose expression of FcRs, VAP-1, DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, CD36, SR-B1\n\nand elevate expression of CD31 and CD34.\n\nCoculture with hepatocytes dramatically alters the phenotype of overlying endothelial cells and restores or maintains sinusoidal phenotype. Thus expression of markers such as CD36, ICAM-1, DC-SIGN, L-SIGN and SR-B1 is elevated in\n\ncoculture and the expression of soluble factors such as IL-6, Il-8, GCSF, HGF, CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL2 and VEGF is modulated. We have also demonstrated that the phenotype of hepatocytes is modified in coculture (with particularly\n\npronounced changes in albumin production and expression of CYP2E1, ADH1a and ADH5)\n\nInterestingly we have demonstrated that hepatocytes cell lines are almost as potent as primary hepatocytes at modulating the phenotype of overlying HSEC. However if they were cultured with vascular endothelium (HUVEC, Dermal EC or\n\nSapphenous vein EC) we did not observe expression of characteristic HSEC markers such as L-SIGN and DC-SIGN and soluble production of IL-8, IL-15, IFNg, GMCSF, CCL3 and CCL5 was significantly different than cocultures using HSEC Our model systems are of interest to the pharmaceutical industry and have potential for use in toxicity testing and other applications We have devised model systems which can be used by other scientists interested in understanding the biology of the liver. We have published data which will be useful to scientists in biomedical disciplines and we have generated libraries of gene expression data which are available via public databases.
