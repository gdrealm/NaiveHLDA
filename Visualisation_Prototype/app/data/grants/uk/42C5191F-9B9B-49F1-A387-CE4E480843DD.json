When the cortex malfunctions in psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and autism, or degenerates in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, those uniquely human qualities are lost or degraded. Ideas about how we might tackle these debilitating conditions have changed over the years. As pointed out by the head of the US National Institute for Mental Health, the way we used to understand mental health disorders as &quot;chemical imbalances&quot; or as &quot;social constructs&quot; seem strangely outdated and have given way amidst a flurry of discoveries to the newer ideas of mental health conditions as disorders of &quot;brain circuits&quot; arising from a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental effects(1). Perhaps it is not entirely surprising that we still only understand the operation of the cortical &quot;brain circuit&quot; at a very rudimentary level at present, after all it is extremely complex. However, a number of powerful molecular and optogenetic tools are now available for unpicking this complicated knot (2) . \n\nOur approach is to look at a relatively simple part of the cortex known as the barrel cortex, where the basic architecture of the cortex can be seen using simple histochemical stains or physiological imaging methods, and to try to understand the cortical circuits involved. The elementary modules that make up the cortex are known as cortical columns and consist of groups of interconnected neurones arranged in six layers. Higher order animals with more complicated cortex have more columns than lower order animals, but the basic architecture of the columns are similar in both cases. We can therefore understand a great deal about the human cortical circuitry by analysing the mouse barrel cortex circuitry. We want to know how information is processed within these circuits and to understand the molecular mechanisms that allow the circuits to change in response to altered experience via their synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Our present work on the circuitry and plasticity of this system has already yielded insights into schizophrenia and AIDS-related dementia. In the present work we combine the new technologies of optogenetic pathway stimulation, dendritic spine imaging and optical manipulation of synapses with our substantial knowledge and experience of the operation of the barrel cortex to understand the cortical circuit. Our immediate plan includes provision to test whether our findings generalise to visual cortex.\n\nWe recently made a ground breaking discovery in finding that two major subdivisions of the layer 5 cells, the regular spiking (RS) and intrinsic bursting (IB) cells show fundamentally different plasticity. These cells are the major output cells in the cortex. To a first order analysis, RS cells show depression but not potentiation while IB cells show potentiation but not depression. To a second order analysis, RS cells showed potentiation to subcortical but not intracortical input. We have now discovered a further difference at the molecular level: RS cells exhibit homeostatic (TNFalpha-dependent) plasticity in response to depression, while IB cells show Hebbian CaMKII dependent potentiation. We need to know how these plasticity differences arise, whether they are general to other cortical areas and how they fit into the general response of the cortical circuit to changes in sensory input. \n\n1.
