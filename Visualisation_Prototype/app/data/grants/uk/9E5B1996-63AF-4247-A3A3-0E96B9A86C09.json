Our main focus is on the GAP system and the more recent SymGridPar middleware, which provide flexible and effective computation on single processors and small clusters. We will adapt the software to efficiently use large clusters of multi-core processors to perform larger computations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptations we will apply our new software to problems from a number of important areas of pure mathematics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G055181/1","grantId":"EP/G055181/1","fundValue":"874305","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  No impact outside the research community has yet materialised  ","person":"Stephen  Linton","coPersons":["Kevin  Hammond","Ian Philip Gent"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":" This was a project about developing research software. We have developed new versions of the GAP system and related tools which are now being beta-tested and prepared for wider release. They supports parallelism on a range of systems. A variety of other approaches were explored along the way. We have learnt many lessons about how to parallelise legacy software of this kind. This is being exploited now, for example, but the Singular group in Kaiserslautern. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
