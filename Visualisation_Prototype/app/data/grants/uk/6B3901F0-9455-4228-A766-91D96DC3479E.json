The new National Risk Register, published in January 2012, provides formal recognition of this and notes more work is needed to understand and plan for the impacts of severe events. This message was echoed in the February 2012 report of the House of Commons Defence Committee on Developing Threats: Electro-Magnetic Pulses. This noted the need for more research to understand and mitigate the space weather impacts, especially on the National Grid.\n\nThe UK has a wide range of world-class expertise to understand and deal with the problems caused by space weather. However, this is spread over the universities, research institutes, industry and government labs. There are many informal links between people at working level in these groups, but no structure that can coordinate their efforts to maximise the benefit to the UK and to mutual benefit of the groups involved. This proposal seeks to do that. We will hold a series of events that bring together experts from the research and applications communities - first to discuss how to coordinate UK efforts in particular areas and then to build up a virtual UK Space Weather Centre. The particular areas of space weather interest will include impacts on power grids, aviation, satellite navigation, communications and the tracking and operation of spacecraft.\n\nA key aim will be better links between the UK space weather research and applications communities, so that researchers are ever more aware of the many potential routes through which their research can have impact on real-world issues - and the applications community appreciates the scientific capabilities that exist in the UK and the links that the scientific community has with other experts around the world. Such links will help the UK to develop a strong research programme that helps to mitigate the problems caused by space weather and that enables researchers to seek funding for their work. The results of that programme will also enable the UK to work with international partners, especially the US and in Europe, to develop international measures that recognise and deal with the global threat from space weather. The UK can then contribute to international efforts at a level appropriate to its technical and financial capabilities whilst deriving benefit from the whole of those efforts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K00168X/1","grantId":"ST/K00168X/1","fundValue":"33936","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2015-12-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mervyn  Freeman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"NERC British Antarctic Survey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
