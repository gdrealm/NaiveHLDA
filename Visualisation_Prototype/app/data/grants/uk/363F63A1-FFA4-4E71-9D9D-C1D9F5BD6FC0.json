The overall aim of this programme of research is to understand how nutritional factors and the ageing process influence functions involved in the regulation of body weight and vascular function. \nThe research will include two independent projects which will have in common the study of a small molecule called Nitric Oxide (NO). This molecule is continuously produced by the body in small amounts and it has several and important effects including regulation of blood pressure, inflammation, exercise performance and memory. Since its official discovery in 1987, research in this area has made important advancements but, for example, we are still far from a full understanding of the nutritional and lifestyle factors that can affect the concentrations of NO in the body.\nOur research will try to advance this knowledge by studying how the ageing process and nutritional, dietary and lifestyle factors can influence NO activity. This research will use one of the best methods currently available to measure NO concentrations and some of these methods have been developed by Dr Siervo. \nThe first project will essentially recruit 72 subjects with an age range between 18 and 75 years and they will be asked to attend the research unit for one visit. During the visit we will perform a series of detailed measurements and collect blood, urine and saliva samples which we will utilise to measure a series of molecules involved in the regulation of blood pressure, blood glucose and inflammation. We will also try to understand how certain genes influence NO concentrations.\nThe second project will involve the recruitment of 16 healthy older subjects. They will be asked to take a dose every day of a small molecule, called inorganic nitrate, for 14 days. Inorganic nitrate seems to have beneficial effects on the concentrations of NO in the body. Inorganic nitrate is commonly present in difference concentrations in water and food; example of foods with high nitrate content are beetroot, spinach, lettuce. During the study participants will return to the research centre in Newcastle on a few occasions. During these visits we will perform detailed measurements of vascular and metabolic health and we will collect biological (blood, urine, saliva) and tissue samples (muscle, adipose tissue) to understand the precise mechanisms that may explain the effects of inorganic nitrate on bodily functions.\nUltimately, these studies will provide novel and important information on the role of NO in the regulation of vascular and metabolic functions. We will understand better how the ageing process determine changes in physiological function and we will test whether inorganic nitrate could be a potential nutritional intervention that may protect the arteries and increase the efficiency of energy metabolism in older people. This will not only have implications for the research and advance knowledge but it can open potentially a new window for nutritional interventions that may be effective in reducing the risk of metabolic and vascular diseases such as type 2 diabetes, angina or stroke.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/N007921/1","grantId":"MR/N007921/1","fundValue":"557197","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mario  Siervo","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
