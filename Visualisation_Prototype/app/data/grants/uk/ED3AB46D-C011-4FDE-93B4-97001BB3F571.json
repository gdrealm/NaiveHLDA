{"id":"ED3AB46D-C011-4FDE-93B4-97001BB3F571","title":"Photographing Everyday Life: An Exploration of Ageing, Lived Experiences, Space and Time","abstractText":"<p>As people grow older, daily norms and practices can become increasingly problematic as everyday routines become more frequently and, at times, unpredictably, disrupted. The integrity and logic of the ageing body and everyday practices may become questioned, the taken-for-granted nature of embodiment challenged, and people in mid to later life may increasingly be required to make sense of biographical and bodily changes in order to maintain and/or re-negotiate a sense of &nbsp;'ontological security'. Previous research into ageing has however often inadvertently dislocated the experiences of ageing and personal meanings away from the everyday worlds and communities in which people live. The aim of this project is instead to reassert the significance of the ordinary and day-to-day by focusing on everyday meanings, lived experiences and spatio-temporal contexts. </p>\n\n<p>The project involves a diverse sample of 60 men and women aged between 50 and 70 years with different daily routines (work, non-work and voluntary). Data collection methods include participants taking photographs of aspects of their daily lives followed by in-depth interviews. The photographs become a form of a 'visual diary' as a means to explore the photographs, meanings, practices and spatio-temporal contexts of daily life. In particular, the research aims to be much closer to lived experiences in order to explore how people give meaning and engage with their everyday worlds.&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H011064/1","grantId":"ES/H011064/1","fundValue":"255809","fundStart":"2010-01-11","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Wendy  Martin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
