Much of the pathology associated with infection is also due to over-activation of the host's own immune system. Inflammation-associated pathology is also a common cause of ill health and loss of productivity in companion animal and livestock species, with implications for animal welfare and food security. Organ and tissue damage caused by the body's own immune system is called immunopathology and is, in general, due to accumulation and activation of immune cells (leukocytes) within the inflamed organ. It is clear that before we can develop better therapies to ameliorate immunopathology, we need a much better understanding of how 'healthy' inflammatory responses are regulated and why these protective regulatory responses sometimes fail. Inflammation of the liver can lead to acute liver failure or, if chronic, to cirrhosis and eventually, liver failure. Common causes of liver failure include infection (e.g. hepatitis virus infections) and alcohol abuse, as well as automimune diseases and cancer. We aim to examine the development of protective (regulatory) immune responses in a mouse model of acute liver immunopathology. We will focus on a specific population of leukocytes (called CD4+ T cells) that produce the soluble mediator, interleukin-10 (IL-10). It is becoming clear that IL-10 producing CD4+ T cells are important for controlling inflammation in many different organs, including the liver but, at present, we do not know where these cells develop, which cells they develop from, what the signals are that cause them to differentiate or how they accumulate in inflamed organs. To answer these questions we will generate a colony of mice in which the cells that cause the inflammation (effector cells) produce a yellow fluorescent protein and the IL-10-secreting cells produce a green fluorescent protein, so that we can identify the different cell types as they differentiate and migrate to different organs during the development of liver disease and so that we can observe the changes in the cell populations when we use various experimental approaches to either induce or block their development. The results of this work will reveal how we can induce, or inhibit, the development of IL-10 producing cells and how we can enhance or reduce their accumulation in particular organs in order to prevent pathology. This should assist in the development of new drugs to ameliorate immunopathology in the liver and in other organs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I020950/1","grantId":"BB/I020950/1","fundValue":"485704","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  A number of findings have been published in scientific peer reviewed journals and some data are in the process of being written up for publication.

We have found that the body uses similar but not identical pathways to control IL-10 production by CD4+ T cells systemically during inflammatory events, suggesting that CD4+ T cells can be controlled to a degree by organ-specific pathways.\nFinally, we have found that during repeated rounds of inflammation, IL-10 is produced in higher levels and more rapidly by CD4+ T cells, and that this is important for reducing damaging immune responses. Our findings are of interest to investigators in the medical and health fields who wish to understand how to spatially target IL-10 immune responses within the liver and other organs during inflammation.
