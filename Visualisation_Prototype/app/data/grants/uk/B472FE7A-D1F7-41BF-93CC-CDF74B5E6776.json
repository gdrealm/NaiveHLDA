This is an important objective in organic chemistry because it provides the tools for the preparation of new molecular entities and consequently novel fine chemicals. The specific process proposed involves a skeletal rearrangement of a readily available substrate to a cyclic ketone - a common motif in bioactive compounds and natural products. A key element of this rearrangement is the presence of a cation stabilising group. Traditionally, this has been achieved by the incorporation of a proximal oxygen atom. The proposed work aims to use metal-hydrocarbon complexes to significantly expand the range of products available from this general strategy. We wish to study this process, establish its scope and limitations and explore the opportunity to generate new compounds with control of their three-dimensional shape.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H005854/1","grantId":"EP/H005854/1","fundValue":"126126","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Joseph Patrick Anthony Harrity","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
