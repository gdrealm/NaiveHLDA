{"id":"4F6C618E-18DA-4210-B6C8-33D9CEF0F7C4","title":"Un-ravelling the network of regulation of multidrug resistance in Salmonella enterica","abstractText":"Every year people are exposed to non-typhoidal salmonella bacteria, typically from contaminated foodstuffs. Some people succumb to infection and get ill. This is particularly dangerous for the very old and young, and these people often need treatment with antibiotics. Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance in salmonella is not uncommon. In this project we will perform experiments that will allow us to understand how multiple antibiotic (drug) resistance (MDR) is caused. We will identify genes and/or the proteins that control the production of the AcrAB-TolC system, which exports antibiotics from the bacterial cell and so allows it to continue to grow and cause infection. If this system is inactivated the bacterium becomes very susceptible to antibiotics, finds it difficult to colonise the host (e.g. poultry) and antibiotic resistant salmonella are hard to select. We anticipate that we will find proteins that confer MDR and that can also be used as targets for drugs that will inhibit production of AcrAB-TolC. Such new drugs would make it difficult for the salmonella to cause infection and be antibiotic resistant.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801977","grantId":"G0801977","fundValue":"1367540","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Laura Jane Piddock","coPersons":["Steve  Busby"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
