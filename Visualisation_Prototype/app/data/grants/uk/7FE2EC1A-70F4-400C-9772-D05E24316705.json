The application of emerging technologies to advanced health monitoring of existing critical infrastructure assets can help to better quantify and define the extent of ageing and the consequent remaining design life of infrastructure, thereby reducing the risk of failure. Emerging technologies also have the potential to transform the industry through a whole-life approach to achieving sustainability in construction and infrastructure in an integrated way - design and commissioning, the construction process, exploitation and use, and eventual de-commissioning. Crucial elements of these emerging technologies include the application of the latest sensor technologies, data management tools and manufacturing processes to the construction industry, both during infrastructure construction and throughout its life. There is a substantial market for exploitation of these technologies by the construction industry, particularly contractors, specialist instrumentation companies and owners of infrastructure.\nIn this proposal, we seek to build on the creation of the Innovation and Knowledge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction which brings together leading research groups in the University of Cambridge Departments of Engineering and Architecture, Computer Laboratory and Judge Business School. The Collaborative Programme will see these groups working with industrialists and other critical stakeholders on challenging research projects which deliver practical solutions to the problems that industry faces and which promote the dissemination and adoption of valuable emerging technologies.\nThe development and commercialisation of emerging technologies can provide radical changes in the construction and management of infrastructure, leading to considerably enhanced efficiencies, economies and adaptability. The objective is to create 'Smart Infrastructure' with the following attributes: (a) minimal disturbance and maximum efficiency during construction, (b) minimal maintenance for new infrastructure and optimum management of existing infrastructure, (c) minimal failures even during extreme events (fire, natural hazards, climate change), and (d) minimal waste materials at the end of the life cycle. The Centre focuses on the innovative use of emerging technologies in sensor and data management (e.g. fibre optics, MEMS, computer vision, power harvesting, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Wireless Sensor Networks). These are coupled with emerging best practice in the form of the latest manufacturing and supply chain management approaches applied to construction and infrastructure (e.g. smart building components for life-cycle adaptive design, innovative manufacturing processes, integrated supply chain management, and smart management processes from building to city scales). It aims to develop completely new markets and to achieve breakthroughs in performance.\nConsiderable business opportunities will be created for construction companies, and for other industries such as IT, electronics and materials. The Centre is able to respond directly and systematically to the input received from industry partners on what is required to address critical issues. Through the close involvement of industry in technical development as well as in demonstrations in real construction projects, the commercialisation activities of emerging technologies can be progressed to a point where they can be licensed to industry.\nThe outputs of the Centre can provide the construction industry, infrastructure owners and operators with the means to ensure that very challenging new performance targets can be met. Furthermore breakthroughs will make the industry more efficient and hence more profitable. They can also give UK companies a competitive advantage in the increasingly global construction market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K000314/1","grantId":"EP/K000314/1","fundValue":"2311580","fundStart":"2012-09-28","fundEnd":"2016-09-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  NOTE - DUE TO CHALLENGES IN USING RESEARCHFISH AND THE LIMITED TIME AVAILABLE, CSIC CONTENT ENTERED REPRESENTS A SMALL FRACTION OF ACTUAL OUTPUTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS. A FULL 4TH YEAR REPORT IS CURRENTLY BEING PREPARED FOR EPSRC - THIS WILL GIVE A MUCH MORE RELIABLE INDICATION OF ACHIEVEMENT.\nThe engineering, management, maintenance and upgrading of infrastructure requires fresh thinking to minimise use of materials, energy and labour whilst still ensuring resilience. This can only be achieved by a full understanding of the performance of the infrastructure, both during its construction and throughout its design life, through the application of innovative sensor technologies and other emerging technologies.\n\nThe key aim of CSIC is that emerging technologies from world-leading research at Cambridge will transform the construction industry through a whole-life approach to achieving sustainability in construction and infrastructure in an integrated way. \n\nThis covers:\no design and commissioning\no the construction process\no exploitation and use\no eventual de-commissioning\n\nCrucial elements of these emerging technologies are the innovative application of the latest sensor technologies, data management tools, manufacturing processes and supply chain management processes to the construction industry, both during infrastructure construction and throughout its design life.\n\nThe major objective of CSIC is to integrate these innovations for exploitation and knowledge transfer - something which is new to the UK construction and infrastructure industry. We believe that the outcome will be major transformations in the approaches to the design, construction and use of complex infrastructure leading to step changes in improved health and productivity; a low carbon society; sustainable urban planning and management.\n\nThere will be a very substantial market for exploitation of these technologies by the construction industry - particularly contractors, specialist instrumentation companies and owners of infrastructure for both domestic and international markets.\n\nWith our industry partners CSIC is pushing forward new frontiers of technology and innovative management in a sector of the economy which has traditionally had very little investment in research, particularly when compared to sectors such as computing or electronics. \n\nCSIC draws on recent research in new techniques, new models of construction and new management approaches. Through this innovation in technology and management, supported by extensive training and development, deep-rooted attitudes and assumptions are being challenged by CSIC with the aim of revolutionizing construction and the public perception of it.
