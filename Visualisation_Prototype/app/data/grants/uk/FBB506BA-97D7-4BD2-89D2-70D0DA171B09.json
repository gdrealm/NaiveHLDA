{"id":"FBB506BA-97D7-4BD2-89D2-70D0DA171B09","title":"MAG and DATA Assessment Studies for Cross-Scale","abstractText":"Cross-Scale is an M-class Cosmic Vision mission to study multi-scale coupling in space plasmas. Its objectives are the quantification of fundamental plasma processes (shocks, reconnection, and turbulence) that operate universally in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas but are only accessible to direct sampling of particles and fields in near-Earth space. Cross-Scale is the international space plasma community's top priority for the future, and has been selected as a contender for the first M-class mission in ESA's Cosmic Vision programme. The mission is UK-led and has had strong UK involvement during the mission definition and proposal stages. The present proposal will support activities during the Cosmic Vision Assessment Phase of the mission.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H00114X/1","grantId":"ST/H00114X/1","fundValue":"17708","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Steven J Schwartz","coPersons":["Elizabeth  Lucek","Christopher Michael Carr"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
