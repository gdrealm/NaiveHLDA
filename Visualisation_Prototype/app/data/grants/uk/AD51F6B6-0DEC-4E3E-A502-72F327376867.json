Fibrosis or tissue scarring caused by chronic injury can occur in many organs including; liver, lung, kidney and skin. Specifically for liver disease over 12,000 people die every year in the UK and these figures will continue to rise due to increased obesity related liver disease, excess alcohol consumption and hepatitis infection. Currently there are no proven effective anti-fibrotic drugs therefore transplantation is the only alternative for patients where the underlying cause of disease can not be treated. Therefore liver fibrosis is and will continue to be a major financial and healthcare burden on the NHS. This project aims to inhibit a specific modification of a protein in the scar promoting cells that promotes their survival. Once scar producing cells are removed from the liver the scar can be degraded and disease progression will be prevented. I aim to understand is the signalling events regulating this modification and to test if inhibiting it will reverse fibrosis. Finally I will establish whether this is a critical signalling event that promotes survival of scar forming cells in organs which are susceptible to fibrosis i.e. lung, kidney and skin.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900535","grantId":"G0900535","fundValue":"403895","fundStart":"2010-04-30","fundEnd":"2013-04-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Fiona  Oakley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
