In simple terms PKSs are like beads on a string where each bead or 'domain' of the PKS represents an individual enzyme function or biological catalyst. The PKS uses simple carbon-carbon bond forming (condensation) reactions followed by a variety of 'tailoring' reactions in which the initial condensation product may be modified by all or some of a series of reactions - reduction (addition of two atoms of hydrogen), dehydration (loss of water) and C-methylation (addition of a single carbon branch), each of which is controlled by specific domains on the PKS. Discovering the molecular factors which control this programming is arguably the greatest remaining problem in our understanding of how nature makes complex natural products, and also represents a great fundamental problem in enzyme catalysis. Understanding of how the programming works, how the number iterative condensation cycle that determines the overall chain length, degree of reduction, and methylation is essentially absent. In this project the individual beads/domains will be isolated so that their individual properties and structures can be studied. Individual beads will then be brought together to study how one influences another, and this process will be repeated to try to build up an overall picture of how the intact PKS works. The project is highly interdisciplinary and will bring together the skills and expertise of natural products chemistry, chemical synthesis, molecular biology, biochemistry, structural biology and bioinformatics. The ultimate aim is to use the understanding gained of how the programming actually works, to manipulate the PKSs to make new products with altered or improved properties of benefit to human and animal health and to provide the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries with new methods to produce new useful products.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I003355/1","grantId":"BB/I003355/1","fundValue":"684600","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  they have been use to design further experiments allowing the genetic manipulation of the systems to make new natural products Chemicals,Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Societal","person":"Thomas James Simpson","coPersons":["Christine  Willis","Matthew  Crump","Paul Raymond Race","Russell  Cox"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" Fugal polyketides are produced by very large complex proteins. A key question involves how the information which dictates the exact structures they produce is &quot;programmed&quot; into the system.
