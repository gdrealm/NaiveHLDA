{"id":"00DAC98C-1616-4390-852D-4A3361660131","title":"The Online Froissart : a searchable electronic edition","abstractText":"The Online Froissart is a joint project based in the French Departments of the Universities of Sheffield and Liverpool. Arising from a colaborative programme of research completed in December 2003, it will deliver a facsimile edition of Books I-III of Jean Froissart's Chronicles, the most important prose history in French of the Hundred Years War, covering the years 1325-1390 and penned by the chronicler in 1390-91.\\n\\nBased on five of the earliest, most reliable and most beautifully decorated manuscript witnesses (Besan&ccedil;on Public Library MSS 864-865, Stonyhurst College MS 1, Toulouse Public Library MS 511, Brussels, Royal Library MSS II 88 and IV 251), it will incorporate fully manipulable high-resolution images, complete transcriptions and edited texts for Books I-III, a search engine to support sophisticated queries, detailed annotation of text and image content, a glossary, index, and hypertext commentaries. Word-for-word collation across witnesses, to compare different manuscript versions of the same text, will also be supplied, as will an entirely new translation into modern English of substantial sections of Books I-III, which readers will be able to compare both to the edited transcription and the original manuscript versions.\\n\\nThe Online Froissart will incorporate new viewing software developed between June and December 2006 under the joint AHeSSC/EPSRC e-Science demonstrator initiative. The edition itself will be delivered over the web by HriOnline and be freely accessible worldwide.\\n\\nThe resource will offer researchers, students and other interested persons, both in the UK and abroad, a rich source of material for the study of the Hundred Years' War and its conduct. Froissart was intent upon producing as accurate an account as he could manage of the dynastic and feudal wars between France and England and their respective allies, from 1325 to the late 1380s. He therefore travelled widely in Europe, reaching Aberdeen as well as Avignon, Chepstow as wel as Rome, interviewing informants wherever he could. These included combatants on either side, heralds and other royal officers, and companions met with on the road as he journeyed south or north. Book III includes the celebrated 'Journey to B&eacute;arn', a mixture of narration and travelogue which tell us a great deal about the chronicler's interviewing techniques and professional approach to chronicle production.\\n\\nThe Chronicles remain a major resource for historians of medieval, political and cultural history, but also for students of narrative and early modern historical literature in prose. They are a key resource for the study of Middle French language and syntax. They are, however, prodigiously long. The availability of a rapidly searchable and perusable electronic edition will allow scholars to scan the hundreds of thousands of words of text, and to swiftly locate information about persons and places referred to by the chronicler.\\n\\nThe Online Froissart also offers students of medieval manuscript production and painting an unrivalled source of primary material. It features a series of early 15th-century illuminated manuscripts, all of which were produced in Paris at around the same time (ca. 1408-1418), and almost certainly under the direction of an 'entrepreneur' by the name of Pierre de Liffol. Across the two Besan&ccedil;on volumes, the Stonyhurst Library manuscript, the Toulouse manuscript and the two Brussels copies, one can trace the activity of the same small group of scribes and artists responsible for the production of these books. Pierre de Liffol seems to have spotted an opportunity, producing copies of the same text decorated for either French or English consumption. Two artist masters contributed to their decoration: the Boethius and Giac Masters, together with their associates and apprentices. We can examine their respective methods and techniques acrossthis fascinating group of manuscripts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E009549/1","grantId":"AH/E009549/1","fundValue":"420993","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Two free international exhibitions attracting visitors of all ages and nationalities: Royal Armouries (2007-08; 50 000 visitors), and Mus?e national de l'Arm?e, Invalides, Paris (2010; 80 000 visitors) were inspired by our research on illuminated manuscripts of Jehan Froissart's Chronicles of the Hundred Years' War (covering the years 1325-1404). Miniatures from the manuscripts depicting key events were displayed alongside items selected from each country's national collection of arms and armour; interactive displays showed how the manuscripts were copied and illustrated. The research enabled an SME to be launched and opened up access to major aspects of French cultural heritage whilst enabling the preservation of the originals' integrity, part of the intellectual and artistic patrimony of Western Europe.

Some 113 manuscripts were transcribed, completely or partially; 200,000 place and personal names were glossed; 7 million words of Middle French were recorded. Around 4 million of these words have since been lemmatised and converted into a searchable electronic lexicon linked to the website thanks to a subsequent project joint-funded by the British Academy and CNRS which links the Universities of Edinburgh, Liverpool, Sheffield, St Andrews and Plymouth to the University of Lorraine, Nancy 2, and its world-famous online Dictionnaire du Moyen Fran&ccedil;ais;. The Online Froissart has thus enriched the DMF with a vast lexicon fully available to all users via 'Attestations dans les bases' (under 'OFP'), contributing to the Dictionary, in addition, no less than two dozen hitherto unattested Middle French words. Lemmatised glossaries are also available on the Online Froissart website, as are our searchable transcriptions, background essays and iconographical commentaries. Thanks to the number and sheer extent of the transcriptions we have been able to deliver, together with our application to these of sophisticated collation tools and search engines, new knowledge has emerged concerning the relationships between key manuscript witnesses of the major recensions of Froissart's 'Chronicles'. A better understanding of the overall manuscript tradition and textual evolution of this great work has emerged during the funded period of the project and even more recently (work continues apace). Close attention to the language of the 'Chronicles' has informed a new translation into modern idiomatic English of key chapters from all three Books: this is proving popular with students and with medievalist scholars having only limited or no Middle French; it is in use, along with the website's other resources, in universities across the UK, USA, South America and Australia. Through the use of e-Tools such as VIRTUAL VELLUM, and thanks to a subsequent JISC/NEH/NSF 'Digging into Data' joint-funded project with Illinois and Michigan Universities, we have gained a more precise understanding of a range of palaeographical issues (e.g. palimpsests and scribal 'fingerprints'). Collaborations with historians of the book and with specialists in the study of medieval manuscript illumination and connoisseurship have led to fresh discoveries about the identities and practices of several of the artists and workshops behind the books, and in particular about bookseller Pierre de Liffol (active in Paris during the first two decades of the fifteenth century) and his methods and clients. The Online Froissart was and continues to be a resolutely academic enterprise, but the project has so far fed successfully into no fewer than three national and international exhibitions described elsewhere on this system. In the course of gathering evaluation feedback from visitors to the Mus&eacute;e de l'Arm&eacute;e (Paris) and Royal Armouries (Leeds) exhibitions, Keira Borrill uncovered a vibrant interest in the Middle Ages and the Hundred Years' War on the part of interviewees as young as 7 and as old as 90 kindled by the exhibits, interactive software and narratives (evidenced in the survey questionnaires, interviews and Visitors Book comments). Part of the appeal of the exhibitions for us was finding ways to attract broader, non-academic publics and engage with them in approaches calculated to draw them in (rather than patronise them). Working alongside world-class curators from the Royal Armouries, Mus&eacute;e de l'Arm&eacute;e, Scriptorial d'Avranches and Mus&eacute;e national du Moyen Age, and seeing how they reacted to our more academic content and materials, was a revelation; it helped us in turn to articulate our scholarship more efficiently and eloquently (we believe) to these much broader audiences. Providing gallery labels, texts and software commentaries written and narrated in both French and English, for each of the Leeds and Paris exhibitions, was an especially rewarding challenge: one has to grab the visitor's attention very quickly with information that is both accurate and appealing. The KIOSQUE software specially developed for the Leeds and Paris exhibitions is freely available for wider use and has since been deployed (with additional refinements) in regional schools and displays in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire. Photo galleries from each exhibition are provided on the Online Froissart website (under 'About The Project', Related Projects).
