{"id":"C9EA65A6-B7D0-436D-BF88-67315792AFAE","title":"SUPERGEN BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND ENERGY CROPS II CORE","abstractText":"Bioenergy is now becoming a commercial reality, ranging from cofiring in power stations, small units for power and/or heat, as well as transport fuels such as biodiesel. This SUPERGEN bioenergy project will continue to deliver the scientific background to the provision and utilisation of bioenergy, as well as innovative concepts for new applications. The research brings together growers, biologists, agronomists, economists, scientists and engineers in a unique multi-disciplinary team that will tackle the challenges associated with the further development of this renewable resource in a sustainable manner. The extended programme examines production and utilisation related factors that affect quality and suitability of a biomass fuel for different end uses, with a particular emphasis on the energy crops, willow and miscanthus, as well as more diverse fuel streams including residues and co-products. The work programme ranges from practical issues associated with fuel handling and preparation, to fundamental studies of genetics, agronomy and chemistry that affect both desirable and undesirable fuel characteristics. In addition, key engineering solutions for the successful development of biomass thermal conversion technologies are sought through (a) an understanding of the basic science in thermal conversion and (b) component and plant engineering issues. These topics are developed further in this renewal proposal through advanced engineering models complemented by experimental studies in a range of combustion, gasification and pyrolysis units.In addition, the scope of the project has been widened in this continuation to consider challenges in fuels and chemicals production from biomass, integrated with energy production in a bio-refinery approach.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E039995/1","grantId":"EP/E039995/1","fundValue":"6313560","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jenny Marie Jones","coPersons":["William Ian David","Jim  Swithenbank","John  Oakey","V Nasserzadeh - Sharifi Sharifi","Ian  Tubby","Paul  Ekins","Stephen Graham Davies","Malcolm  Hawkesford","Gareth  Griffiths","Phillip  Morris","John Graham Brammer","Valerie  Dupont","Philip Charles  Brookes","Iain Simon Donnison","Elizabeth Patricia Thornley","Kevin  Anderson","Ausilio Walter Bauen","Nigel John Simms","Ian  Shield","Anthony Victor Bridgwater","Peter  Edwards","Martin Owen Jones","M  Pourkashanian","Paul  Williams","Alan  Williams","Paul  Upham"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
