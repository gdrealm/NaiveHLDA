One of the greatest challenges in brain sciences is to determine how and why these structures work together to support memory. One such brain structure is an area called the retrosplenial cortex, which is thought have important roles in both memory and navigation. In addition, there is growing evidence that damage to the retrosplenial cortex is found in the earliest stages of some of the commonest brain diseases that disrupt memory, e.g. Alzheimer's disease. It is, therefore, presumed that retrosplenial impairments contribute to the cognitive changes seen in these diseases. However, our understanding of retrosplenial cortex function remains very incomplete as: 1) research with humans is held back by the difficulty of isolating this particular brain region in experimental studies; and 2) research with other animals has, so far, been very limited and it has been hampered by the lack of clear theoretical frameworks. We now know that the main structural and anatomical features of the retrosplenial cortex are retained in both the rat and primate brain, and that its connections with other brain areas strongly support the notion that it is important for memory and navigation. Using the rat brain, we plan to test the predictions of two different classes of hypothesis that attempt to explain the properties of this area. Remarkably, although the retrosplenial cortex is one of the largest cortical areas in the rat brain it remains very poorly understood. The most established model is that the retrosplenial cortex is required for changing the mental viewpoint used to encode and store information. It is assumed that initial information about external events is represented by reference to the viewpoint of the recipient, e.g. in front, behind, to the right, to the left. This perspective can be called 'egocentric' or 'view-centred'. It is then supposed that over time this same information is often transformed into a viewpoint that is independent of one's own orientation, this perspective can be called 'allocentric' or 'world-centred'. Then at recollection the information may revert back to an egocentric framework. The model supposes that the retrosplenial cortex is required for these transformations. This specific model will be tested by examining the impact of retrosplenial pathology on the ability switch back and forth between these classes of information. We will also test the more general hypothesis that the retrosplenial cortex enables the switching back and forth between other different spatial codes. An alternative model of retrosplenial cortex function is that it is crucial for bringing together different forms of spatial learning to create unique, complex scenes. The research will test this 'integrator' model of retrosplenial cortex function. Two particular forms of spatial scene learning will be examined in detail. 'Structural learning' refers to learning how the individual features within a scene are spatially arranged and how they relate to each other, i.e. the organisation or 'structure' of a scene. Geometric learning refers to the use of shape information to create distinctive location or context information, e.g. defining a room by the fact that it has a long wall to the right and short wall to the left. This geometric information can then be integrated with object information placed within that context.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H020187/1","grantId":"BB/H020187/1","fundValue":"379641","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Aggleton","coPersons":["John Martindale  Pearce","Seralynne Denise Vann"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
