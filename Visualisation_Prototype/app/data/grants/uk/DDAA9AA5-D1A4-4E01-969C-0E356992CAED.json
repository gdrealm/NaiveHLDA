{"id":"DDAA9AA5-D1A4-4E01-969C-0E356992CAED","title":"In situ X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy for Deep Sea Mining Applications","abstractText":"Traditionally the exploitation of ocean mineral resources has been mainly limited to oil, gas and coal extraction. It is only recently that the economics of mining other minerals has weighed in favour of substantial deep ocean exploration. Due to the challenging environments, extensive surveying of the seabed to inform mining choices is difficult. This increases financial risk as well as the potential for needless damage to surrounding ecosystems. \n\nWe propose to develop X-ray fluorescence spectrometer technology based on wide bandgap semiconductors that would enable surveying and characterisation of deep ocean geology in situ. This would eliminate the current problems associated with deep ocean geological surveying and revolutionise deep sea mineral prospecting.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M004635/1","grantId":"ST/M004635/1","fundValue":"86782","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Anna Megan Barnett","coPersons":["Robert  Prance"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
