Its main aim is to develop a strong and sustainable collaborative network of teacher educators to build research capacity across the seven regional universities involved in teacher education. The participating institutions are the Universities of Chester, Cumbria, Edge Hill, Liverpool Hope, Liverpool John Moores, Manchester Metropolitan and Manchester. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The project methodology involves six researchers from each university, collaborating in small cross-institutional teams, supported by a senior research mentor, to develop research bids with high relevance to the field of teacher education. The teams will be supported in this activity by a blended learning programme, consisting of workshops, Virtual Research Environments (VRE) and an associated programme of regional seminars, conferences and colloquia . The project will culminate in the development of at least seven research bids for submission to relevant funding agencies. The methodology builds on the Meeting of Minds Fellowships (TLRP) and seeks to test the potential of the model for building a coherent research infrastructure on a larger scale across England.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G009813/1","grantId":"ES/G009813/1","fundValue":"88634","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jean Mary Murray","coPersons":["Pat  Mahony","Marion  Jones","Ian  Menter","Olwen  McNamara"],"organisation":"University of East London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
