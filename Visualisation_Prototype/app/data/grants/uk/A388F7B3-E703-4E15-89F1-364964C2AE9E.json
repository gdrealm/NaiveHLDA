At the Earth, intense electromagnetic waves at frequencies of a few kiloHertz are very effective in accelerating electrons up to relativistic energies via resonant wave-particle interactions. These acceleration mechanisms have only recently been recognised as major processes for forming the Earth's outer Van Allen radiation belt and have spurred new satellite missions such as NASA's Radiation Belt Storms Probes (RBSP), and proposed missions by Canada (ORBITALS) and Japan (ERG) to test these ideas. Intense electromagnetic waves are also observed inside the magnetic fields of Jupiter and Saturn and are strong enough to cause electron acceleration on a timescale comparable to that for transport. This suggests that resonant electron acceleration could be important for all planetary radiation belts. The aim of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that resonant wave-particle interactions are a major electron acceleration process at Earth, Jupiter and Saturn, and play a major role in the formation of radiation belts at these planets. The research will leave a legacy of understanding that will last long after the completion of the project, develop computer models that will be of direct use to the space insurance, satellite construction, and satellite service industries, and provide training for a young scientist.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I001727/1","grantId":"ST/I001727/1","fundValue":"403240","fundStart":"2012-01-16","fundEnd":"2016-01-15","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  They have been referenced in other research papers.
