The Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Ethnic Diversity and Social Cohesion","abstractText":"This FRL project is concerned with how rising immigration and increasing ethnic diversity affect social cohesion. The UK is currently undergoing a significant demographic shift in the ethnic composition of its populace, with the proportion of non-White British rising from 13% to 20% between 2001 and 2011. Across academic, governmental and public spheres, concerns are being articulated that this growing diversity poses a threat to: residential community cohesion (undermining trust and connectivity between neighbours); wider, societal cohesion (leading to civic disengagement, declining trust in strangers and lower support for welfare policies); and inter-group cohesion (cultivating inter-ethnic tensions, and driving support for far-right organisations). When even conservative estimates predict this trend will only increase, understanding if, how and why ethnic diversity affects social cohesion, and what can be done to ameliorate any pejorative effects, is of paramount importance to the maintenance of a cohesive, harmonious society.\n\nYet, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how of ethnic diversity affects social cohesion. Firstly, much of the current research focuses on how being exposed to diversity within one's residential community affects social cohesion. However, the community is just one site at which individuals come into contact with other ethnic groups. In places like schools, universities, workplaces, volunteering groups, individuals are being exposed to diverse environments everyday. However, how levels of diversity in these places affect social cohesion is largely unknown. This is an important omission given that individuals are actually more likely to encounter diversity in these places than in their neighbourhoods. Secondly, most research assumes that as diversity within an adult's neighbourhood increases, their social cohesion will shift accordingly. However, how adults respond to ethnically diverse environments is likely influenced by all kinds of experiences throughout their lives, such as the attitudes of their parents, the diversity of their schools, and how diverse the neighbourhoods were they grew up in. To understand how diversity affects social cohesion we therefore also need to know what individuals' experiences of ethnic diversity have been over their entire lives. \n\nThe primary aim of this research is therefore to try and create a much fuller picture of how ethnic diversity affects social cohesion by: firstly, looking at how coming into contact with other groups in schools, workplaces, or civic groups, along with neighbourhoods, affects cohesion; and secondly, how experiences of diversity over one's whole life affects cohesion. Only with this more complete picture of the complex social worlds of individuals can we hope to understand the effect of diversity on social cohesion. However, if we do find that increasing diversity, in certain places, at certain points over an individual's life, can harm social cohesion, then we need to know 'what works' to ameliorate such frictions. This research will therefore investigate how interventions, such as intercultural education, workplace diversity training, national multiculturalism policies, and ethnic mixing programs for adolescents can help alleviate any pressures of increasing diversity. Key to this endeavour will be an analysis of one of the current government's key integration policies: the National Citizen Service.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L011255/1","grantId":"ES/L011255/1","fundValue":"233024","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Laurence","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
