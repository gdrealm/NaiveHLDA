These include cell growth and division, and are implicated in the maintenance of healthy organisms and several disease processes including new blood vessel growth in tumours, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and prion diseases among others. Obtaining a better insight into the structure and biological activities of these molecules is key to understanding and intervening more effectively in these processes.\n\nGAGs bind to many different categories of proteins, including those responsible for cell communications. They have subtly different sequences when expressed by different cell types and there is currently much debate as to how sequence determines activity. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to isolate sufficient quantities of many GAGs (particularly the most complex member, heparan sulfate - HS) from individual tissues for useful experimentation. Preparations of GAGs from natural sources are inevitably mixtures. Furthermore, having isolated crude GAG material, it was until recently, difficult to separate the individual components (esp. HS) using previously available techniques. This now presents a serious obstacle to research in this area. \n\nHistorically, GAG separation techniques relied on two physical characteristics of GAGs; the first is their hydrodynamic volume (approximating to length) is exploited by gel filtration chromatography (GFC), although this is relatively crude. The second property is their negative charge, which varies. This strategy separates crude GAG mixtures, or fragments thereof, into pools with similar structures. However, many GAGs, or their fragments, have both similar size and charge and these techniques therefore represented the previous limit of separation.\n\nRecently, the applicant and collaborator demonstrated successfully a method that exploited an additional feature that has, until now, been overlooked. GAGs contain other chemical groups (amines), most of which are covered by one of two other (N-sulfate or N-acetyl) groups. Uncovering these groups confers the molecules with both positive (from the resultant amine) and negative charges (from carboxylic acid and O-sulfate groups). This has enabled a powerful technique called isoelectric focusing (IEF) to be used for their separation (Holman &amp; Skidmore et al. (2010) 2:1550).\n\nThe dual positive and negative charges (ampholytes) allow the molecules to be focussed on an electrophoresis gel in which a pH gradient has been established; each subtly different sugar arriving at a different point on the gel. Following (routine) recovery of GAG from the gel and replacement of the covering groups (there are two types of groups covering the amine, both can be selectively removed or replaced by well-established methods). Hence, purified samples of the GAGs, or their fragments many now be produced. IEF is widely used in the protein field, where it has revolutionised separations although this has mainly been due to the development of commercially available immobilised pH gradient gels which have the added benefit of a stable, reproducible pH gradient.\n\nThe properties of the GAGs are distinct from those of most proteins and commercially available IEF gels are unsuitable. The development of suitable immobilised pH gradient (IPG) gels and the establishment of optimal run conditions for the isoelectric separation of GAGs is the main aim of this proposal. The potential to transfer GAG based IEF methodologies to current protein based IEF systems will also be investigated, which will undoubtedly facilitate widespread use. This will enable the high resolution IEF of GAGs from tissue and other biological samples. This will ultimately allow biological activities to be better understood and bring effective intervention in a host of medical situations nearer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M019209/1","grantId":"BB/M019209/1","fundValue":"93825","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Andrew Skidmore","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
