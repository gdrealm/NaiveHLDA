In patients that have existent liver disease, a relatively minor event such as intercurrent infection or bleeding can lead to catastrophic liver failure. This condition is referred to as acute on chronic liver failure. Our studies over the past 5 years have revealed that the current conventional tests that are performed to determine whether a patient with cirrhosis, who develop intercurrent problems, will progress to full blown liver failure are inadequate. A good test that could accurately identify patients at high risk of progressing to liver failure and mortality would allow early aggressive approach to treatment, transfer to specialist centres and listing for liver transplantation. Such a test is urgently needed. During studies determining why several organs fail to function during liver failure, we discovered two blood tests that may predict which ?at risk? patients would proceed to develop advanced liver failure and die. When these two tests were combined into a single scoring system, they were shown to correctly predict the outcome of about 90% of the 52 patients that were studied. We propose to perform a large study involving several important specialist centres in the UK to validate whether the test that we have developed is indeed useful. UCL has patented the test and a company developing an extracorporeal liver support device will co-fund the project. If the data are in keeping with those of the pilot experiments, it is possible that this test could reach the patients quickly and start to make a difference to their outcome.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601448","grantId":"G0601448","fundValue":"383029","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rajiv  Jalan","coPersons":["Nathan Alun Davies","Rajeshwar Prosad Mookerjee","Stephen Aubrey Baigent"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
