However, the current regulatory drive for employee voice may fundamentally alter the voluntarist nature of industrial relations in both Ireland and the UK. This research aims to examine the impact and transposition of employee I&amp;C regulations in two jurisdictions, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This research examines this through case studies in 16 cross-border multi-site organisations in four different economic sectors, representing a total of 24 workplaces. The results will inform academic knowledge in the areas of employment relations and labour market growth models. It will examine the nature and impact of European labour market regulation for employee voice in a unique comparative context on each side of the Irish border. The findings will provide data on the unexplored phenomenon of cross-border responses to employment regulations, and in so doing make an important contribution to the effectiveness, convergence and/or divergence of European level regulations in the new economy across the EU.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1139","grantId":"RES-062-23-1139","fundValue":"147899","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James Michael Donaghey","coPersons":["Paul  Teague","Michael Philip Marchington"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
