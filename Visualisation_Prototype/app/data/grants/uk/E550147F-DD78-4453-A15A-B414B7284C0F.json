Under such circumstances, the emissive states in such microcavities are termed 'polaritons', and can be described as an admixture between an exciton and a confined cavity photon. The optical properties of polaritons can be very different from their constituent parts (excitons and cavity photons), and thus there is a significant opportunity to explore new fundamental processes, and develop new types of devices that may find applications as low-threshold lasers, optical-amplifiers and high-speed optical switches. At present, the majority of work done on the strong-coupling regime in microcavities has centred on structures that contain inorganic semiconductors (either III-V, II-VI or GaN based materials). We have however pioneered the study of strong-coupled microcavities containing organic (carbon-based) semiconductors, which are anticipated permit new effects to be engineered. Despite the importance of organic-semiconductors in a range of optoelectronic devices (LEDs, photovoltaics, FETs, lasers etc) relatively little is understood regarding the microscopic processes that occur in strongly-coupled organic microcavities.Development of a basic understanding of non-linear processes and properties of organic-semiconductors in strongly-coupled microcavities will thus be a key area that we will address in this project. Key components of the research include studies the interactions between organic-polaritons and vibrational modes of the molecular semiconductor and the generation of organic exciton-polaritons at high density following electrical injection of carriers. We will also explore the fabrication and optical properties of 'hybrid-semiconductor' microcavities and devices (containing organic and inorganic semiconductors), and will study optically-driven energy-transfer between the different types of excitation using both linear and ultra-fast measurements. We are confident that our work will provide new fundamental insights into the optical properties of organic-polaritons (including relaxation and condensation), the transfer of excitations between different semiconductor materials via a cavity photon over large distances (&gt; 100 nm) and the generation of new electrically-driven polariton devices. We believe that we are in an excellent position to undertake such an ambitious programme of research due to our world-leading expertise in strongly coupled organic semiconductor microcavities (Sheffield), and two-colour ultra-fast spectroscopy of microcavities (Southampton).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G062404/1","grantId":"EP/G062404/1","fundValue":"310062","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The results have provided a new understanding of the properties of organic semiconductor materials when placed into micro cavity structures.
