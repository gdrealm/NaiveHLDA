People must take treatment for the rest of their lives, and they are usually recovering after a period of serious illness and disruption to their social and economic lives. </p>\n\n<p>Three ART delivery sites with different modes of delivery and support will be compared. A quasi-experimental research design will be used to compare people affected and unaffected by HIV and ART, and uses complementary qualitative and quantitative methods.</p>\n\n<p>The research will involve collaboration between four partners: The School of International Development at UEA, and in Uganda the Medical Research Council, The AIDS Support Organisation and a Ministry of Health hospital.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2663","grantId":"RES-062-23-2663","fundValue":"142594","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  Russell","coPersons":["Janet Anne Seeley"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" Numerous findings are emerging from the analysis of the qualitative and quantitative data. \n\n\n\nThe the first set of findings to be written up will be in a paper that presents quality of life (QoL) and depression score data for people living with HIV (PLWH) in Uganda (n=260), and compares them to scores from a community control sample (n=160). The data reveal a counter-intuitive finding: PLWH reported significantly higher QoL scores and lower depressions cores than the community control group. \n\n\n\nThe paper will present the quantitave QoL and depression measures, and then explain these differences using qualitative illness narrative data and theoretical insights from health psychology literature to explore why PLWH report higher QoL scores.\n\n\n\nA system of service provision dedicated to PLWH partly explained the high QoL scores. The narratives also reveal cognitive processes that explain the higher scores. The concept of 'response shift' from QoL research is applied to the data. This concept refers to how people adjust and find additional or new meaning and benefit to life, following a diagnosis of serious illness and treatment, and despite adversity.\n\n\n\nThe paper will be one of the first to use insights from health psychology to understand cognitive self-management processes and adjustment to living with HIV on ART in resource-limited settings. It combines these with more widely used sociological approaches to illness self-management. The findings have relevance to the practices of service providers and patients on ART programmes.
