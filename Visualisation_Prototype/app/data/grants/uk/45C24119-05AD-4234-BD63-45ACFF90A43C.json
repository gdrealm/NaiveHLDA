Two case study areas (Gwent and Devon) will be used to examine in depth the implementation of biosecurity policies using participant observation and interviews with farmers and local authority officers. The research seeks to contribute to academic knowledge of multi-level governance, environmental regulation, public understandings of science and nature-society relations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1738","grantId":"RES-000-22-1738","fundValue":"80294","fundStart":"2006-05-08","fundEnd":"2007-11-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Activities were to were inform policy on an ongoing basis Other Policy & public services","person":"Gareth Paul Enticott","coPersons":["Alexandra  Franklin"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" The secondment dealt with a range of ongoing issues rather than a specific project Policy makers used advice on an ongoing basis Other","dataset":"gtr"}
