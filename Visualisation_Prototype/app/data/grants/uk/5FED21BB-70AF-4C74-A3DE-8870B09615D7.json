{"id":"5FED21BB-70AF-4C74-A3DE-8870B09615D7","title":"Accretion, Structure and Evolution in Gravitating Systems","abstractText":"We propose to undertake a broad programme of research in theoretical astrophysics. This research will be centered around accretion, structure and evolution in many astrophysical systems. Accretion is the process whereby a massive, gravitating body accumulates mass from its surroundings. As the mass falls towards the body it can give up energy in the form of heat and light. Accretion onto a black hole is the most efficient way of extracting energy from normal matter. Astrophysical systems powered by accretion are among the luminous in the universe. Gravity not only powers these systems but determines their large-scale structure and long term evolution. The systems we aim to study cover many length scales, from compact binary star systems which would happily fit inside the Sun to colliding galaxies which consist of many billions of Sun-like stars. We will investigate the nature of the non-luminous, dark matter which constitutes about 90 per cent of the mass of our Galaxy, the Milky Way. Our work will also improve our understanding of how the Milky Way was formed and how it has slowly changed over the past 10 billion years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H002235/1","grantId":"ST/H002235/1","fundValue":"1475160","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  King","coPersons":["Mark Ivor Wilkinson","Sergei  Nayakshin","Walter  Dehnen","Graham  Wynn"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
