UK industry and government agencies have recently invested heavily in applying a number of remote sensing techniques to transport environments. The proposed research seeks to develop methods in which remotely sensed data can be utilised to perform intelligent analysis in transport corridor environments, namely by integrating high resolution airborne LiDAR, NIR digital imagery and terrestrial laser scanning.The research will consist of four complementary work packages. Firstly it is necessary to identify robust and multi-compatible workflows that will allow the core research to take place. Remote sensing techniques will then be employed to undertake quantitative assessment using established geotechnical and hydrological modelling. Remotely sensed data will also be used to provide qualitative assessment and identification of the symptoms of slope instability using automated/semi-automated methodologies. The combination of datasets will be addressed using a technique to consider the inherent uncertainties of data integration. Based on these results the research will focus on the process of assessing risk.The research will use both a dedicated embankment research facility currently in construction at the University of Newcastle and an industry identified test site near Ben Rhydding, near Ilkely. This will ensure both academic rigour and industrial relevance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D023726/1","grantId":"EP/D023726/1","fundValue":"291719","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jon Philip Mills","coPersons":["Stephanie  Glendinning","Jim William Hall","Stuart  Barr","Barry Goldsmith Clarke","Geoff  Parkin"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
