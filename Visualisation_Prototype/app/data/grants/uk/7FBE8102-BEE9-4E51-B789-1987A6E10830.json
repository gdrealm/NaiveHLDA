Research suggests that at present in the UK it typically takes 17 years for new discoveries to be put into practice. But this estimate is not clearly defined and the difference in the time taken to translate research between different types of intervention (e.g. a new drug compared to a new surgical procedure) is not well established. The sources of these delays in translation, or 'time lags', are also unclear, as is whether they are always undesirable. It is, for example, important that new drugs are tested for safety before being put into general use.\n\nAs the number of models of translation gaps multiplies (and the definitions of such gaps increases), it becomes increasingly difficult to make comparisons between different studies and advance the field of study. Our project would provide a way to facilitate such comparisons.\n\nThe aim of our project is to develop a new approach to thinking about these time lags, incorporating a process marker model, which is a method that tracks the time taken between different milestones in the translation of research into practice. Our new case study approach should allow us to understand more clearly the sources of time lags, whether they are undesirable or not, and whether they differ between types of medical intervention. Our analysis of timelines in examples of research being translated into practice will also explore the perspectives of a range of stakeholders including the private sector, which is often inadequately incorporated into such academic studies, and a full range of issues in the complex pathways from early research to successful implementation in healthcare.\n\nWe will trial the method with a small number of examples in cardiovascular and mental health research. If the method proves effective, we hope to then extend the study and conduct a fuller analysis of time lags across the health research system. \n\nThe issue of attempting to reduce time lags and speed up the translational process is receiving considerable attention and investment from policymakers in countries such as the UK and the USA. It is our premise that we need improved methods to analyse the problems, and measure the extent of the time lags, before the most effective policies can be found. To help understand the processes more fully and inform any policy recommendations that seem appropriate we also propose to conduct a documentary analysis of the existing policy initiatives. \n\nUltimately, if we can clearly identify the sources of time lags, and where they could be influenced by policy, we hope our study will allow the translation of research to become quicker, meaning patients benefit more quickly from new research developments, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of patient care. Furthermore, it could eventually be of considerable benefit to pharmaceutical and medical device companies who are keen to explore ways in which research could safely be translated more rapidly into products purchased and used by healthcare systems. Specifically in relation to the economic competitiveness of the UK it is of considerable advantage to the UK to be seen as a country in which the academic research community can collaborate efficiently with pharmaceutical and medical device companies.\n\nFinally, attempts to measure the return on investment in medical research need to incorporate an analysis of the time it takes for the research to be translated. If we can develop an improved way of analysing time gaps, and develop a more reliable figure for the length of the time lags, then that would make a major contribution to measuring the links between research and economic impacts and strengthening the estimates made of the value of UK medical research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K014773/1","grantId":"MR/K014773/1","fundValue":"143771","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve Robert Hanney","coPersons":["Martin John Buxton"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
