{"id":"BD0F5D49-1772-430C-B5D1-B54F7A34A52E","title":"The Saxophone: the history and development of a Musical Icon","abstractText":"This research will provide an authoritative account of all aspects of the saxophone's invention, development and history. Beginning with a brief biography of the instrument's inventor, Adolphe Sax, it will review patents and early technical developments before considering its use in a variety of social and musical contexts: popular and light music, jazz, classical, rock and pop, film music and non-western genres. The monograph which will ensue will be of interest not only to saxophonists but also other students, scholars or general readers who may wish to know more of the social and musical history surrounding this iconic instrument.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112806/1","grantId":"112806/1","fundValue":"11476","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Cottrell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
