{"id":"4F05A692-5755-42DF-ABE2-354937DF4179","title":"Unitary forms of Kac-Moody algebras and Kac-Moody groups","abstractText":"Existing cosmological theories suggest that, close to a cosmological singularity like a big-bang or a big-crunch, the description of the universe in terms of spatial continuum and space-time based quantum field theory breaks down and the information encoded in the spatial variation of the geometryof the universe gets transferred into spatially independent but time-dependent Lie-algebraic variables encoded in the infinite-dimensional symmetric space of a real split Kac-Moody algebra over its unitary form. In this context the understanding of representations of the unitary form of the real split Kac-Moody algebra of so-called type E10 is of particular interest. One such representation can be constructed as an extension to the whole unitary form of the 32-dimensional spin representation of its regular subalgebra of type A9, using a presentation by generators and relations of unitary forms given by Berman.This project is set in pure mathematics within the areas of infinite-dimensional Lie theory and geometric group theory. It will combine classical techniques from the theory of Kac-Moody algebras and Kac-Moody groups in characteristic 0 and their unitary forms with the quickly developing theory of unitary forms of Kac-Moody groups over arbitrary fields based on the theory of twin buildings. Its goal is to contribute to a uniform structure theory of unitary forms of Kac-Moody algebras and of Kac-Moody groups of indefinite type. The main emphasis of this project will be on finite-dimensional representations and on ideals and normal subgroups, respectively, of these unitary forms, starting with the above-mentioned finite-dimensional representation discovered in cosmology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H02283X/1","grantId":"EP/H02283X/1","fundValue":"312191","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ralf  Koehl","coPersons":["Sergey  Shpectorov"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" See description for EP/H02283X/2.
