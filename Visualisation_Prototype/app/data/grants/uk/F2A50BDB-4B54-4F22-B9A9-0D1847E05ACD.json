{"id":"F2A50BDB-4B54-4F22-B9A9-0D1847E05ACD","title":"The quantum dynamics of Josephson junctions with controlled current-phase relationships","abstractText":"There is rapidly expanding international activity on the development of electronic circuits which can be used as artificial atoms in that they possess a set of well defined quantum states. Such circuits are known as quantum bits (qubits) with applications ranging from quantum computing to measurement standards. These quantum states are extremely fragile (decohere readily), are most easily established at very low temperatures (&lt;1K) and can be destroyed by sources of electronic noise in the environment or associated with the materials themselves. Superconducting materials have proved to be very sucessful for qubit fabrication and progress has been rapid with a number of approaches being demonstrated in recent years based upon Josephson junctions in superconducting loops.Qubit designs with significantly improved immunity to decoherence would extremely important to this field. There have been a number of designs for environmentally decoupled qubits based upon unconventional Josephson devices known as pi junctions. There are two main types of these: superconducting tunnel junctions which contain a ferromagnetic layer between the tunnel barrier and one electrode (SFIS structures) and junctions with a conventional superconductor as one electrode and a d-wave superconductor as the other (SND structures). The aim of this proposal is to carry out the key experiments which test their suitability for qubit applications. The two systems share many features common and so by investigating both in parallel, we will be able employ common experimental approaches, evaluate their relative merits and differences and to determine the overall feasibility of qubit designs which rely on ? junctions. The experiments will involve optimising both technologies for qubit applications, determining what junction designs give the most suitable pi junction behaviour, investigating potential intrinsic noise sources associated with the devices, investigating whether the junctions themselves develop well defined quantum states at low temperature and finally, using the results of the previous experiments to select a suitable qubit design and investigate its properties.The applicants are researchers at the Universities of Cambridge and Birmingham with a strong track record of the fabrication of superconducting devices from metallic and oxide heterostructures and measurements at temperatures below 1K, who are thus well placed to make a major impact in this area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E026494/1","grantId":"EP/E026494/1","fundValue":"401492","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Not to my knowledge at this time, although the research on Superconductor Ferromagnet devices has led to a number of important scientific papers Other Cultural","person":"Edward John Tarte","coPersons":["M  Colclough","Christopher Michael  Muirhead"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" In this project, which was a collaboration between the Universities of Birmingham and Cambridge, we investigated the suitability of Josephson junctions with unconventional current-phase relationships (pi junctions) for the fabrication of superconducting quantum bits (qubits). Quantum bits are the fundamental unit of computation in quantum computers, which are being intensively investigated internationally. Quantum computers have the potential to allow us to solve large computational problems extremely rapidly. Superconducting electronic devices provide one of the most promising methods of achiving a quantum computer, but conventional designs require a biasing magnetic field to be applied in order to maintain the quantum bit at its working point. Pi junctions provide a way of eliminating this biasing field. Two pi junction technologies were investigated, conventional Superconductor-Ferromagnet-Insulator-Superconductor (SFIS) junctions fabicated in Cambridge and junctions fabricated using both a conventional and an oxide superconductor separated by a normal metal in Birmingham. Very low temperature measurements were made using SFIS devices and interesting features observed in their characteristics, which have the potential to affect their suitability as quantum bits. Unfortunately, the difficulty of processing oxide superconducting materials made it impossible to fabricate pi junctions using this technique.\n\n\n\nDuring the development work for the oxide devices, it was noted that the very high solubility of the oxide superconductor relative to epitaxial insulators would make it possible to fabricate free-standing structures using these materials. It was decided to redirect the oxide materials effort in Birmingham to investigate whether it would be possible to exploit this property of the superconductor. BaTiO3 was selected as an oxide layer which could be grown epitaxially (and therefore with high crystalline quality) on top of the superconductor. This was because this material has strong ferroelectric and hence piezoelectric properties. If free standing cantilever structures were fabricated using this material, then bending such structures would cause voltages to appear on electrodes deposited on the surfaces. Fabrication routes for BaTiO3 cantilevers were developed and the ferroelectric properties of the BaTiO3 layers produced investigated. These showed that high quality material could be produced in the form of cantilevers, although the window of appropriate processing conditions was very narrow. In addition, a new technique for evaluating residual stresses in released centilevers was developed and evaluated. Quantum computers (which are the ultimate application of quantum bits) have potential applications in computer and security issues and the solution of complex computational problems.\n\n\n\nVibration and Infrared sensors have applications in devices such as air bags for cars and imaging systems. Energy harvesting devices could be used to minimise the size of and recharge batteries needed to run portable electrical equipment such a mobile telephones. Quantum computers are being intensively researched world wide and the results obtained on the low temperatures properties of Josephson Junctions containing ferromagnetic barriers could have an important impact on their development.\n\n\n\nPiezoelectric cantilevers have applications in vibration sensors, infrared sensors and electromechanical actuators. However, a key potential application of this work is in the harvesting of the energy of mechanical vibrations, to produce electrical power.
