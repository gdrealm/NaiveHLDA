In the typical population, the development of environmental learning begins with knowledge of landmarks (eg a park bench) along a route, followed by knowledge of the sequential order of the turns and landmarks along the route, and finally to an understanding of the spatial structure of an environment (a cognitive map).</p>\n\n<p>Individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) and Williams syndrome (WS) find it difficult to learn routes. This has consequences on their confidence, independence and quality of life. It is therefore important to identify the specific difficulties experienced, and find ways to overcome them. People with DS and WS (8- 25 years) and typically developing children (6-12 years) and adults will participate. </p>\n\n<p>Studies will take place in virtual environments (virtual towns viewed on a computer screen). Studies 1-4 investigate developmental aspects of environmental learning:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>study 1: landmark use; </li>\n\n <li>study 2: knowledge of the sequential order of turns and landmarks; </li>\n\n <li>studies 3, 4: knowledge of the spatial relationship between two or more places in a learnt environment). </li>\n\n <li>Study 5, and a PhD project will develop and evaluate environmental learning training strategies. <br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H043683/1","grantId":"ES/H043683/1","fundValue":"406714","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emily Kate Farran","coPersons":["Mark  Blades"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
