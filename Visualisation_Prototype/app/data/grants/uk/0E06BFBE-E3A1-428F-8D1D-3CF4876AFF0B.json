{"id":"0E06BFBE-E3A1-428F-8D1D-3CF4876AFF0B","title":"ULTRACAM operations","abstractText":"ULTRACAM is a digital camera capable of taking (and storing) up to 500 red, green and blue images every second. The instrument was built in just under 3 years by a consortium from the Universities of Sheffield, Warwick and the UK Astronomy Technology Centre in Edinburgh, using a &pound;300,000 grant awarded by STFC. ULTRACAM saw 'first light' in May 2002 on the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) on La Palma, and first light on the 8.2-m Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile in May 2005. To date, ULTRACAM has been awarded a total of 147 nights of time on these telescopes to study white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, pulsars, black-hole/neutron-star X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, cataclysmic variables, eclipsing binary stars, extrasolar planets, flare stars, ultra-compact binaries, active galactic nuclei, asteroseismology and occultations by Solar System objects (Titan, Pluto, the moons of Uranus and Kuiper Belt Objects). This grant proposal requests funding for the proper maintenance and operation of ULTRACAM, as well as a modest programme of minor upgrades, thereby ensuring that ULTRACAM maintains its status as the world's premier instrument for high-speed optical astrophysics. As well as maximising the return on STFC's original investment, this money will also allow us to continue to offer ULTRACAM to others in the astronomical community who wish to use it.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G003092/1","grantId":"ST/G003092/1","fundValue":"141984","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Vikram Singh  Dhillon","coPersons":["Thomas  Marsh"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
