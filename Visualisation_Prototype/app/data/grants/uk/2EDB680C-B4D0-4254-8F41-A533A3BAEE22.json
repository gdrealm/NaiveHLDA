The interconnections of disabled childhoods","abstractText":"<p>How have disabled children, between the ages of 4 and 16 years old and their families, faired under the Blair government?&nbsp; This project will answer this, and other questions, by exploring the extent to which, over the last 10 years, policies, legislation and practices have tackled matters of exclusion and regeneration for disabled children. We will engage with parents, children and professionals to help us to explore the impact of the Every Child Matters agenda; the adequacy of existing theories about disabled children, parents and professionals; how the concepts of 'good parent', 'enabling professional' and 'disabled children' are promoted; the ways in which forms of 'enabling healthcare', 'inclusive education' and 'accessible leisure' can work together. Our study employs a critical review of policy, interviews with 10 disabled children and 10 parents, focus groups with a mix of professionals and 18 months observation of families as they participate in the arenas of health, education and leisure. Our work is informed by critical disability studies, critical and community psychologies and sociologies of childhood and families. It will be of interest to parent organisations, practitioners, policy makers and organisations of disabled people. This project builds, in part, on a previous ESRC funded project (RES-000-23-0129).<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F035942/1","grantId":"ES/F035942/1","fundValue":"208726","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Research findings about the experiences of disabled children in fostering and adoption led to the research team being invited to carry out an evaluation of Adoption Activity Days for the British Association of Adoption &amp; Fostering (Goodley, Sheffield, Runswick-Cole, MMU). This research was part of the process of change in family finding approaches adopted in the Children &amp; Families Act, 2014 (http://www.baaf.org.uk/ourwork/activitydays). \nThe DfE a used findings from another Does Every Child Matter, post-Blair? The interconnections of disabled childhoods, as part of an on-line training package for teachers of pupils with profound and multiple learning disabilities (Runswick-Cole, 2010). \nhttp://www.education.gov.uk/complexneeds/modules/Module-2.1-Planning-to-meet-needs/All/m05p040d.html] . \nAs part of the research project, the team were invited by the Derbyshire Parent Forum to evaluate short break provision for disabled children in Derbyshire and present their findings at the Parent Forum conference in 2011. \nAnother part of the same project involved evaluating the performance Something in the Air? for the Oily Cart Theatre Company - a play using multi-sensory approaches to engage even children whose disabilities normally prevent such engagement. Oily Cart used the MMU evaluation to secure a Children In Need grant in 2013 to enable them to deliver further such work. The evaluation also helped Oily Cart secure funding from other charities and the Arts Council of England. \nThe College of Social Work, a professional body that exists to ensure the highest possible standards in social work, quoted the post Blair findings on disabled children and identity in its 2013 Curriculum Guide: Disability, which provides guidance on the content of social work degree programmes. As a result of the post-Blair project, Runswick Cole and Goodley were invited to speak at the first Office for Disability Issues Evidence Gathering Day in 2011, attended by around 100 delegates from different government departments. The research team's work (Goodley and Runswick-Cole, 2011) was also used by the Leeds Educational Psychology Team (part of Leeds City Council) in 2012 as part of their work supporting the professional development of practitioners. \nAs a result of the research, Runswick-Cole was interviewed on BBC Radio London (27th October, 2014) about end of life issues for disabled children.
