Two wings in six prisons in England and Scotland will be screened using a questionnaire that includes the Problem Gambling Severity Index, a resilience measure and questions relating to offending and co-morbidity. </p>\n\n<p>The full sample of 400 women, 200 young offenders and 600 men will be tracked on the Police National Computer collecting data on offending history and re-offending over 12 months. Statistical analysis will identify crimes most frequently associated with problem gambling offenders, recidivism, resilience and co-morbidity. </p>\n\n<p>A longitudinal cohort of 9 problem gamblers, 9 non-problem gamblers and 9 abstainers from each prison (N=162) will be interviewed pre and post release to collect in-depth data on personal histories, crime, gambling and points of potential intervention through career narratives. Findings will be disseminated to academic, policy and practice audiences including a work shop for criminal justice and related professionals.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-191-25-0004","grantId":"RES-191-25-0004","fundValue":"376990","fundStart":"2009-12-13","fundEnd":"2013-03-12","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  A New Approach to Targeted Interventions for Problem Gambling in Prisons was presented to approximately 100 people from academic, treatment and industry backgrounds. Gambling and Health presented to 25 academics at the University of Manchester, specialising in mental health and addictions with little prior knowledge of problem gambling.\nPromoting an Evidence-Informed Approach to Addressing Problem Gambling in UK Prison Populations has received 4 abstract views and 21 downloads on the Te Pataka New Zealand (Rethinking Crime and Punishment Digital Observatory). Also cited in Turner et al. A qualitative study of programs for problem gambling in the correctional population using interviews with key informants. Final Report to the Ontario Problem Gambling Research Centre. URL: http://www.gamblingresearch.org/content/research.php?appid=3290. \nData analysis to inform intervention and treatment needs within prisons suggests that, in order to reduce both offending and gambling harm, the majority of prisoners who gamble would be helped by gambling awareness programmes/media that respond to their lived experience of gambling harm and that approximately 6,000 men and women (6.8% of all UK prisoners) could require more intensive therapeutic interventions directed specifically at their gambling behaviour. These findings were presented in the conference paper A New Approach to Targetted Interventions for Problem Gambling in Prisons to a practitioner audience. Findings have also been positively received by probation officers attending workshops in the North West of England who agreed they consider gambling harm when working with offenders in the future.\n\nA story about a spin off project measuring the impact of new gambling opportunities in Newham, associated with the opening of a large casino, has appeared on the ESRC website.

They have also been used to support calls for 'drug courts' similar to those established in the US. Can be used to inform targeted interventions in prison settings for gambling problems, particularly awareness raising materials containing messages that more accurately respond to prisoner perceptions. Also may be taken forward to provide evidence for earlier intervention at the arrest and court stage based on valid prevalence data, possibly informing development of 'drug courts' as in US.
