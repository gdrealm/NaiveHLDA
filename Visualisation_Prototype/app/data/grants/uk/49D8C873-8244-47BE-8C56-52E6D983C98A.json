The landmark five-volume Place-Names of Fife, by Simon Taylor with Gilbert M&aacute;rkus (2006-11) brings new momentum to the survey of Scotland's place-names, which the present project aims to perpetuate. Moreover, it provides new paradigms and methodologies for the investigation and presentation of place-names. Moving from Fife to other counties, this project tests these methods, and provides a template for a full-scale, long-term county survey of Scotland. \\n\\nThe project will complete and publish two full county surveys within the funded period, Kinross-shire (KNR) and Clackmannanshire (CLA). Both these counties are manageable, the pre-1975 counties having 5 parishes each (c.200 names per county). Each has had a substantial amount of research on its place-names already, chiefly by members of the project team. Investigating these two counties is not simply a matter of survey. Although both neighbour Fife to the west, each contains particular toponymic registers that do not precisely correspond with Fife. In investigating these counties, key questions must be posed, regarding the nature of toponymic localism, the border(s) of 'Pictish' and 'British', and the varied levels and chronology of Gaelicisation experienced in each region. As illustration, a notable series of place-names containing the habitative element gart 'enclosed field; clearing' exists in CLA, but these names stop more or less abruptly at the border of Fife. Conversely, although Fife contains an abundance of place-names employing the important element pett 'portion of an estate', these are not to be found in the historical core of KNR and only three minor names of this sort survive in CLA. These examples suggest that different factors are at play in the toponymy of central Scotland as one heads west from Fife, and this project will address these diffeences. \\n\\nThe production of these two county surveys will be conducted alongside work on other counties, in distinct regions: Menteith in historical Perthshire, Cunninghame in Ayrshire and Berwickshire in the Borders. The project team brings key expertise to each of these, making them natural areas to progress to. Menteith in particular is well advanced, allowing preparation of 1 volume of a projected 2. Although the outputs from these areas will not include full survey publication, work will be informed and advanced significantly by progressing in tandem with the completion of two new counties. This process will allow methodological issues to be addressed so as to ensure applicability across a greater range of linguistic, political, and data-source contexts. Key research questions within this methodological portion of the project relate to historical and linguistic approaches in both analysis and presentation; and the effect of varied sources and date-horizons on the presentation of survey data.\\n\\nThe project also aims to provide a new paradigm of public engagement with place-names. A series of exchanges in talks and library exhibitions, organised in collaboration with local history societies and local councils, will enhance the researchers' understanding of and access to place-names, and enrich the public's awareness of and relation to their local environment and its linguistic landscape. \\n\\nBy the project-end, survey of Scotland's rich and complex place-name legacy will have been significantly advanced. Two full counties will have been surveyed, and three new counties set on the road to completion, the templates and infrastructure for further surveys will have been developed, key issues of methodology and approach established, and new insights into the complexities of the toponyms gained. It will have cemented and built on the insights gained over the past two decades in Scottish onomastics, and consolidated the research base of place-name studies in Scotland.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I002014/1","grantId":"AH/I002014/1","fundValue":"725800","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our work has played a part in the ongoing development of a number of Heritage Lottery-funded HLPs in working with local communities and local landscapes.

It has done this both through revisiting and revising where appropriate some of the protocols used previously, and primarily through producing new place-name surveys (3 separate volumes of over 500 pages each), the first of which will appear in print in mid-2015.\n\nWe also began work on two very different areas, in Ayrshire and Berwickshire, and the contrasts of the underlying source material, and the name stock in each area are very striking, signalling in some cases rather different approaches needing to be taken in future surveys. \n\nOne key development has been the use as a source of the mid-19th century Ordnance Survey Name Books, which were being digitised concurrently with the project, and partly spurred on by it, by the National records of Scotland. Our work has been one of the first detailed explorations across a major area of the nature of this source, and the first attempt to fully exploit them in a systematic way. At the most simple level of the research, we have shown how to do county surveys, and many more are needed before Scotland has even close to the near full coverage that England has. But we have also inflected the place-name survey, and produced something that is also partly a work of much needed detailed local history. There is a great deal of research that can be built on here by both historians and linguistics (of Gaelic as well as of Old English and Scots). \n\nLocal communities will be able to incorporate a great deal of local linguistic and historical material from the Fife volumes into their heritage material. Indeed, some of this has already taken place in exhibitions, talks, and heritage walks.\n\nWe have started to work with schools to enable teachers to use the linguistic and historical resources that are embedded in place-names. There is more work that could be done here.\n\nA pressing need is the development of an online resource which would enable wider dissemination of the resources than has been practical to date. There is currently some action on this front. Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
