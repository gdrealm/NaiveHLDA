{"id":"BA588318-EE28-45FC-A3A7-EC3F19A1E84C","title":"New photo-detection technology for possible use in sensors for Homeland Security","abstractText":"This project builds on past experience in the fields of gamma-ray detection for astronomy, detector technology and imaging algorithms for a new application of technologies in the Homeland Security area. The project brings together teams from the university sector and industry in order to ensure the most effective transfer of techniques, algorithms and technologies into these new applications. This project will explore the possibility of applying newly emerging silicon photo-multiplier devices in a new range of very compact scintillation counter systems. These novel detectors will be designed to be self-contained, complete with their precision bias supply, and front-end electronics. They will improve on existing designs in terms of their compactness and ruggedness, both important considerations for use 'in the field' These powerful new detectors have the potential to find application in Homeland Security and Border Protection situations. They may then later become increasingly available to First-Responder Teams for use in emergency situations. During this programme of research, we will also explore the potential for a new compact directional gamma-ray spectrometer that will be able to guide the user towards the source of radiation whilst simultaneously providing an identification of the nature of that source. A new, compact neutron sensor will also be explored to detect hidden fissile material mmaterialmaterial.idden in cargo cargo.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F003080/1","grantId":"DT/F003080/1","fundValue":"25939","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Antony  Bird","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
