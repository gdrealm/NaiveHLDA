The current goal is to understand the cognitive processes involved in tool-innovation, by studying a group whose cognitive processes are still in development and who find it remarkably difficult to innovate tools: human children. In the first study of childrenâ€™s tool innovation participants faced a simple physical problem: a bucket containing a sticker needed to be retrieved from a tall, transparent, vertical tube. Crows have solved variants of this task by bending wire in to a hook. Remarkably, three to five year-olds rarely innovated a hook, and only at eight years did the majority of children succeed. Two strands of research address why children find tool-innovation so difficult:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Children may lack competence in the domain of physical cognition. Perhaps they lack understanding of causation, material properties, or transformation.</li>\n\n <li>Children who possess the requisite causal knowledge may be prevented from using it by performance demands, either immature executive function or an adaptation to learn from others.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>There will be one large individual differences study with many participants tested on a range of measures, and nine experimental studies with task manipulations to understand the cognitive processes more precisely.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J023485/1","grantId":"ES/J023485/1","fundValue":"298931","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used to inform research on children's problem solving and innovation.

These difficulties are not easily described in terms of executive function, but tool making may represent an ill-structured problem. We have shown that tool-making difficulties extend to a variety of tool types. Our research is likely to inform our ideas of how to support children's problem solving in everyday life.
