Neuroscience research is particularly dependent on freshly isolated cultures of neurons prepared from. This is because neurons do not divide and thus cannot be continuously propagated in culture. Thus scientists continuously need to sacrifice rodent to provide neurons for their experiments. do not exist as cell lines. Pain is an important warning system to guard against tissue damage. Pathological pain, however, has no warning value and has huge economical, social and personal costs on society. !?Pain!? scientists study sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in order to discover new analgesic drug targets. Available DRG-derived cell lines do not represent a particular type of DRG neurons but rather provide a !?generic!? sensory neuron environment. They do not replace the need to sacrifice rodents for cultures to study other sensory neuron types. \nThe aim of this proposal is to generate immortalised neuronal cell lines from adult mouse DRG neurons. We aim to isolate enough clones to reflect the functional diversity of DRG neurons. We plan to use the established Immorto mouse which has been used by many groups to derive conditionally immortalised cell lines from various tissues. This genetically modified mouse strainis engineered to make a protein that forces all cells to divide including neurons. However, one drawback of the Immorto mouse is that all cells express the foreign protein and therefore a DRG culture from it will contain immortalised cells from neuronal and non-neuronal origins. we have devised a novel strategy in order to select against the survival and propagation of non-neuronal cell types from Immorto DRG cultures. The strategy is based on introducing the antibiotic resistance enzyme neomycin in DRG neurons only. In this way, only DRG neurons can survive growth conditions that include the antibiotic G418. The neomycin resistance enzyme will protect DRG neurons from by degrading G418. All other cells that do not contain the neomycin resistance protein will die leaving behind DRG neurons. \n We believe that the impact of our proposal on reduction of animals use in research will be considerable and easy to realise. The generated DRG cell line can be deposited and be made available for academic researchers to validate and use in their research. We will also make them available for drug companies to replace acute cultures for screening and testing experiments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000000/1","grantId":"G1000000/1","fundValue":"387378","fundStart":"2010-11-15","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Mohammed A  Nassar","coPersons":["David  Grundy","Matthew  Holley"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
