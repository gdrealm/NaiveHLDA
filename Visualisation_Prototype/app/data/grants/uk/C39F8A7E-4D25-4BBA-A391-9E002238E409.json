{"id":"C39F8A7E-4D25-4BBA-A391-9E002238E409","title":"Novel Adjuvant Pathfinder Application","abstractText":"Previously, NERC funded research carried out by Prof Donaldson et al., has shown that novel metal oxides can stimulate the immune system. Furthermore, initial proof of concept studies indicate that the identified oxides could form part of an innovative adjuvant/vaccine strategy. The invention has recently been subject to a UK priority application. \n\nNERC pathfinder funding is sought to carry out a technical, commercial and regulatory appraisal. The outputs of the consultants report will form the basis of an application to the NERC follow-on fund in June.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K001248/1","grantId":"NE/K001248/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Kenneth  Donaldson","coPersons":["Sarah E M Howie"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
