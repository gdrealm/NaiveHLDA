Individual epithelial cells interact with each other via molecular complexes that mediate adhesion but also function as sensors that transmit information about the environment, such as the presence or absence of neighbouring cells, to the cell interior. Integrity of epithelia is important for our organs to function normally and to protect us from our environment. For example, breaches in epithelial layers such as the skin or in the lining of the intestine can lead to serious infections. Epithelial cells thus need molecular mechanisms that ensure proper responses to environmental and cellular factors that would otherwise lead to cell death and tissue damage. This proposal focuses on such a mechanism that is based on a protein that regulates expression of genes. Genes are part of the genome in the nucleus of cells, and encode the proteins that make up our cells and tissues. Genes are first transcribed into an mRNA, a messenger molecule that carries the information to the cellular machinery that synthesizes the proteins. Expression of genes can thus be regulated at different levels: transcription to mRNA, transport and stability of mRNA, and protein synthesis. Our experiments focus on a new mechanism by which epithelial cells respond to stress conditions to regulate the stability of mRNA and/or protein synthesis. This mechanism is important for cell survival as inactivation results in cell death in response to stress. The main component of this mechanism is a molecule that is regulated by adhesion complexes between cells as well as regulatory pathways known to be important for cellular responses. Our aims are to identity the molecular mechanisms by which this central component binds to mRNA and how this is stimulated by different stress conditions. We also want to determine which cellular components are directly affected as well as the importance of such components for cell survival. Understanding how cells respond to stress and how they ensure survival is important for our understanding of how tissues and organs form and maintain themselves. Many diseases such as infections and cancer as well as environmental toxins cause cellular stress and understanding how cells respond will help us to design new therapies. In some cases, cell death is the goal of a therapy, as it is in the case of chemotherapy to fight cancer. Hence, identifying mechanisms that keep cells alive will also aid the development of approaches to increase the efficiencies of existing therapies by targeting such mechanisms in combination with chemotherapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H002294/1","grantId":"BB/H002294/1","fundValue":"408300","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings are currently employed to design ways to exploit the identified mechanism in deseases affecting epithelial degeneration Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology ","person":"Karl  Matter","coPersons":["Maria Susana Balda"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" We have discovered a new stress-activated molecular mechanism based on the Y-box factor ZONAB/DbpA that regulates posttranscriptional gene expression and promotes cell survival during stress and proinflammatory signalling in epithelial cells. \n\n\n\n1) We discovered a new type of stress-activated molecular mechanism that promotes cell survival by direct binding of its effector molecule, ZONAB, to specific mRNAs, stimulating mRNA stabilisation and increased translational efficiency.\n\n\n\n2) We demonstrated that ZONAB activation by stress is mediated by Ras signalling, stimulating activation of the RhoA exchange factor GEF-H1, which in turn stimulates ZONAB. These data indicate that ZONAB represents a new type of Rho effector pathway that mediates posttranscriptonal gene expression.\n\n\n\n3) We identified ZONAB mRNA targets that encode proteins crucial for cell survival and behaviour in response to stress. This is exemplified by p21WAF-1/CIP-1, which is upregulated by ZONAB and its depletion has a similar effect on cell survival as ZONAB depletion. Cancer treatement to enchance existing drugs As our reseasrch shows that ZONAB is activated by oncogenic Ras and regulates cell survival in response to drugs such as taxol, ZONAB is a potential therapeutic target to potentiate tumour therapy Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
