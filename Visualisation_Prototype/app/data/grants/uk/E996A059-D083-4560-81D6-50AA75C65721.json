This makes it difficult for them to moderate or stop drinking even when harms are caused to their health, livelihood and their family life. This impaired ability to choose may mean that people who are dependent on alcohol lie beyond the reach of contemporary alcohol policies. This is because such policies are increasingly based on information campaigns that aim to influence consumers to choose to drink 'sensibly'. Relying on choice and personal responsibility is appealing because it calms concerns that our freedoms will be restricted by the 'nanny state'. The proposed research will investigate the particular difficulties that are created by utilising this choice-based ethic to respond to the needs of the alcohol dependent. The project will also focus on the problems choice-based policies may create for the close contacts of people who are dependent. More specifically, the research will assess the social difficulties the close relations of people with dependency problems may encounter when their relations become increasingly stigmatised as a result of their failure to 'choose' to stop drinking. Responding to these issues will involve the completion of a number of tasks: an interdisciplinary examination of the nature of dependency (addiction) and competency, an assessment of different types of alcohol control policy and a consideration of how contemporary thinking in medical law and ethics might influence the treatment of the dependent and the development of public alcohol policies. In addition, efforts to address the particular needs of the alcohol dependent and protect the interests of their close contacts requires a detailed assessment of the social justice issues that are raised by the increasing social marginalisation of this minority group.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E008739/1","grantId":"AH/E008739/1","fundValue":"152219","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sheila Ann McLean","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
