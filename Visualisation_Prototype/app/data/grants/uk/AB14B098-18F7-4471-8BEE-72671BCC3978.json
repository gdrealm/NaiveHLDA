{"id":"AB14B098-18F7-4471-8BEE-72671BCC3978","title":"Free-viewpoint Video for Interactive Entertainment Production","abstractText":"The goal of this proposal is to achieve broadcast quality free viewpoint video of outdoor sports events such as football or athletics. This research is a collaboration project lead by BBC R&amp;D, under the DTI Technology Programme, which brings together extensive experience in broadcast production, visual reconstruction, videoanalysis and rendering. The project will deliver and evaluate free-viewpoint video technology for broadcast production of action replays for live sports and demonstrate the potential of this technology for interactive visualisation of sports events on a home platform. The principal scientific and technological objectives for the University of Surrey, to be supported by EPSRC and DTI respectively, are: - To develop algorithms for free-viewpoint video of live sports events with broadcast video quality (EPSRC). - To demonstrate interactive free-viewpoint rendering on a consumer games platform (DTI).Recent research by the investigators has demonstrated for the first time studio-based production of freeviewpoint video of moving people with a visual quality comparable to captured video using multiple widebaseline static cameras. The challenge of the proposed research is to develop robust computer vision and image-based rendering algorithms to enable free-viewpoint rendering in uncontrolled outdoor environments with changing illumination.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D033926/1","grantId":"EP/D033926/1","fundValue":"134237","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Adrian  Hilton","coPersons":["Jonathan  Starck"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
