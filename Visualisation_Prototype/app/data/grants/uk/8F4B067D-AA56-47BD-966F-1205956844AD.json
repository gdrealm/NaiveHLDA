{"id":"8F4B067D-AA56-47BD-966F-1205956844AD","title":"Towards Sinter-free Printing of Photovoltaic Cell Interconnects","abstractText":"Metal thin films are used in a wide variety of technologies, such as solar cells and printed circuit boards for electronics. Inkjet printing has emerged as a practical and low-cost route for manufacturing electrical contacts in these applications. However existing manufacturing technologies use inks that often require a final heat treatment to consolidate or 'sinter' the film. If this last step can be eliminated, by depositing fully dense films, then the inkjet manufacturing process could be applied to temperature sensitive substrates like plastics or vulnerable semiconductor materials.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to develop 'sinter-free' inkjet manufacturing processes, by taking ink precursors developed for other thin film processes, and exploiting them to use the significant benefits of inkjet process technology e.g. the direct writing of interconnects or wires. If successful, the project will represent a step-change in the manufacturing methods for this type of film.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K008633/1","grantId":"EP/K008633/1","fundValue":"364495","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We are currently exploiting the research in several areas Chemicals,Energy,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Economic","person":"Christopher John Sutcliffe","coPersons":["Paul Raymond Chalker","Volfango  Bertola"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" Developed methods for the inkjet printing of ROMS We are currently seeking IP protection for our work Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Chemicals,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
