However, their two critical drawbacks, poor oxidation resistance and poor mechanical properties (low mechanical strength and poor erosion resistance), significantly reduce their service life in many applications. Whilst the poor oxidation resistance can now be improved via additions of antioxidants and/or formation of refractory coatings on graphite, the issue of poor mechanical properties has yet to be solved. In this programme, based upon the applicants' extensive experience in R &amp; D of refractories and expertise on nanofibre/tube fabrication, the design and development of a novel and commercially-viable catalytic-growth technique is proposed that can create large quantities of in-situ carbon nanotubes in CCRBs, aiming to improve substantially their mechanical strength and erosion resistance (by &gt;50%) and service durability (by &gt;25%). This programme, in addition to its academic significance for in-situ nanostructure design, will undoubtbly benefit the refractory and steel industries by providing high quality refractory materials at low-cost.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F059159/1","grantId":"EP/F059159/1","fundValue":"300291","fundStart":"2009-03-02","fundEnd":"2012-09-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Shaowei  Zhang","coPersons":["Russell John  Hand"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
