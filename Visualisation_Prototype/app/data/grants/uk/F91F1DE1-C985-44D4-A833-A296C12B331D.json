Organised around the themes of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; photography</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; film and video</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; art</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; design</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new visual technologies.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The aim of the series is to generate an intellectually rigorous, policy focused visual research agenda while also stimulating wider public conversations about inequalities and the role of the visual in sustaining and/or ameliorating these. Additionally, the project supports communities to create their own visual data in order to explore the possibilities of the visual for providing insights into peoplesâ€™ lives from their own perspectives and its potential for dialogue with policy (<a href=\"http://www.visualdialogues.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.visualdialogues.co.uk/</a>).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H001530/1","grantId":"ES/H001530/1","fundValue":"4457","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen Jayne Lomax","coPersons":["Gillian Cathryn Rose","Janet  Fink","Lisa Suzanne Whiting","Richenda Kay Gambles"],"organisation":"University of Hertfordshire","findingsText":" Six seminars examined theoretical, methodological and conceptual developments in visual research methods and practice, exploring their value and insights for inequalities research and their potential to inform policy and practice:\n\n\n\nSeminar 1: Here's looking at you: Photographic practices and methods \n\nSeminar 2: Visual narratives in video and film \n\nSeminar 3: Creative arts: Methods and practices for engaging with social inequalities \n\nSeminar 4: The politics of space and place \n\nSeminar. 5: New visual technologies: Challenges &amp;amp;amp;amp; opportunities for inequalities research \n\nSeminar 6: A new visual agenda? \n\n\n\nIn addition, the series hosted a programme of public events, exhibitions and workshops at which creative practitioners and arts and community organisations presented their work, providing an important space for interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaboration and development. Seminars and public events provided a focus for the generation of new insights for policy and practice and the potential of participatory visual research. The award holders worked closely with arts, community and health organisations in order to explore and develop effective community engagement, dissemination and outputs, enabling:\n\n- Artists and arts organisations to develop and share the ways in which they engage with communities, health and social care policy and practice and to explore synergies with academic practice. \n\n- Public and third sector organisations to explore methods of engaging with residents and to communicate the the value of urban spaces, parks and neighbourhood resources for well-being. \n\n- Development of new visual methods and tools to enable academics, third sector and wider publics to collect and communication high quality visual data for effective dialogue with policy, practice and society. Academic seminars and public events enabled the series to critically explore the capacity of visual methods to capture the ways in which people live unequal lives; how inequalities are expressed and understood through visual media; and how visual resources might productively inform policy making and welfare practices. Methodologically themed seminars (photography, video and film, creative arts, space and place and new visual technologies) provided a timely opportunity for cross-disciplinary intellectual focus on the theoretical and methodological contribution of visual research and its implications for social science theory and research practice.\n\n\n\nThe seminar series generated over twenty journal articles including a special issue in Critical Social Policy with contributions spanning sociology, social policy, history, education, and health. Additional papers from the series are published in methodological, policy, community nursing and education journals and include contributions to themed issues on childhood, creative methods and video analysis.
