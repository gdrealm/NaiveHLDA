Direct injections of drug into the bloodstream are not very nice, so the most popular method - for the doctor and the patient alike - is, if it is possible, to take a drug through the mouth or place it in the nasal cavity: the drug will then hopefully get absorbed though pores that line your intestine and the inside of your nose, pores which are covered by a sticky substance called mucus. Both routes can be very wasteful because of the body's natural clearance mechanisms, but we can use special large molecules or 'polymers' which adhere to the mucus layer and help stop the drug from being washed away too quickly. Formulations involving these sticky polymers have to be both non-poisonous and be stable (not to go-off too quickly). They need to be able to hold and then release the drug when required. Chitosans - which come from the shells of crabs, lobsters and related sea-creatures - and pectins, which come from the cell walls of fruit, are very attractive in this regard, and much important research has already been done. And there are a wide variety of them, varying in their size and the amount if positive charge (chitosan) or negative charge (pectin) on them. However, before they can successfully lead to products on the shelves of Pharmacy shops their stability (resistance to being broken down) needs to be thoroughly explored, not only for the polymers but also the complicated structures of the polymer used to carry the drug. If we can find a stable system that still delivers the drug into the bloodstream then the chances of getting a product into the Dispensaries for use by patients will be good.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D01364X/1","grantId":"BB/D01364X/1","fundValue":"255363","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Ernest Harding","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
