In addition, the evidence base on UK firms is less developed compared to evidence from major OECD countries. This project aims to investigate how incentive schemes such as Research and Development (R&amp;D) tax credits affect the level of R&amp;D expenditures; and how the latter impacts on firm performance in terms of survival, growth and job creation.</p>\n\n<p>The following research questions will be addressed:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>What is the effect of the R&amp;D tax credits scheme on R&amp;D expenditures of UK firms?</li>\n\n <li>Does firm survival depend on R&amp;D effort, after controlling for firm and industry characteristics?</li>\n\n <li>What is dynamic relationship between R&amp;D expenditures, firm growth, and firm-level employment creation?</li>\n\n <li>How does the UK evidence compare with existing evidence from OECD countries?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The project will utilise secondary data from three Office of National Statistics (ONS) databases: the Annual Respondents Database (ARD); the Business Research and Development Expenditures Database (BERD); and the Business Structure Database (BSD). Multiple data analysis methods will be used, including policy evaluation, survival analysis and dynamic panel estimation. The findings will contribute to existing knowledge and support evidence-based policy and practice.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004824/1","grantId":"ES/K004824/1","fundValue":"128276","fundStart":"2013-06-28","fundEnd":"2014-12-27","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mehmet  Ugur","coPersons":["Edna Maeyen  Solomon","Eshref  Trushin","Francesco  Guidi"],"organisation":"University of Greenwich","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
