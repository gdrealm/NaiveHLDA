Therefore, at the expense of a higher risk, state-of-the-art knowledge in turbulence drag reduction by active control has to be used as is without waiting for further progress, so as to develop programs which can lead to flight tests in 2012. This proposal presents such a program. We propose to develop an advanced fluidic material such that the variations of the wall shear stress will induce the wall suction and blowing such that it will lead to drag reduction.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F004672/1","grantId":"EP/F004672/1","fundValue":"195372","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  In determining further directions of research on turbulent drag reduction.

This project was a high-risk high-potential-output attempt to develop an advanced &quot;fluidic&quot; material such that the variations of the wall shear stress would induce the wall suction and blowing in a way that would lead to drag reduction. It turned out that pressure fluctuations always present in the turbulent flow would have too large detrimental effect. To compensate, one has to introduce additional active elements. Within available time and resources an evaluation of the possibility of adding fluidic amplifies as active elements and an initial study of microfabrication routes was performed. As a by-product of the research performed, a simple microfluidic shear-stress sensor was proposed and its performance investigated both experimentally and computationally. Further ideas for drag reduction can be developed as continuation, with the obtained results used as the step stone. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
