Damage to skin through exposure to ultra violet (UV) radiation is a major societal concern and consequently there is a significant consumer demand for cosmetics formulated to block UV penetration. Materials used to block UV penetration to the skin include inorganic metal oxide particles and organic filters. Currently, organic UV-absorbing compounds are manufactured from non-renewable petrochemicals and, as a result, there is considerable commercial interest in developing organic UV-absorber compounds from renewable materials. Croda wish to develop a sustainable manufacturing process for efficient, high-level production of a natural occurring group of UV-absorbing compounds, namely Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), for use as a sunscreen additive to skin care products. Currently, the commercial production of MAAs for use in sunscreens is not a viable proposition due to the low yield and lack of fermentation technology associated with native MAA-producing organisms. This project will overcome this limitation by expressing genes encoding known MAA biosynthetic pathway enzymes in a bacterium that is widely used in industry to produce house-hold and food products and that has an excellent track record for safety.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L004399/1","grantId":"BB/L004399/1","fundValue":"250979","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Too early in the project to be useful.
