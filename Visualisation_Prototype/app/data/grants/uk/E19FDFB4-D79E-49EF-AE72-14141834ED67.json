However, since the statistics on marital status across ethnic groups were last analysed in the mid 1990s, there have been signs of a trend towards marital breakdown and divorce among British Asians. Community- and faith-based organisations have been struggling to provide marriage counselling and mediation services, and to respond to problems of mental wellbeing and welfare for lone parent families.</p>\n\n<p>This project seeks to provide concrete data on the rise in marital breakdown among British Asians. The focus is two major British Asian populations: Pakistani Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs. Whilst these groups differ in traditional marriage patterns and religious identity, they have high rates of transnational marriage, similar gender dynamics in families, and similar migration histories.</p>\n\n<p>The Principal Investigator will conduct repeated interviews with Pakistani Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs to understand the causes, processes and consequences of marriage breakdown. Intended outputs will inform questions of legal pluralism and diversity in welfare, reorient debates about conservatism in British Asian families, and engage with theory concerning the family.

However, analysis of the Quarterly Labour Force Survey 2010-13 found that this is no longer the case. \n\nThe ethnographic research carried out in this project focused on Pakistani Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs in a predominantly working class part of London. It has been assumed that marital breakdown among British Asians reflects a move towards the individualism that has been described for the wider White British population. In this research, similar forms of marital conflict were found as in the wider population, such as lack of commitment, boredom and infidelity, women wanting intimacy from their husbands and not getting it, male power and control. However, these conflicts played out in marriages that had frequently come about through extensive family involvement, and that were in the majority transnational. This made for distinct relational, cultural and legal contexts to marital breakdown, that cannot be accounted for by the notion of individualism. \n\nAs in the wider White British population, responses to marital breakdown were predominantly privatized. Informal family mediation was claimed actively by men and women, which took culturally-elaborated forms. Religious arbitration was also sought. Family mediation and religious arbitration for both Pakistani Muslim and Punjabi Sikh participants worked on the basis of gendered understandings about husbands’ and wives’ roles within marriage, with attention focused on the spouse who was deemed to be at blame. None of the participants had explored formal marriage counselling, although some had experience of family mediation, particularly at the instigation of the courts. Contact with statutory services happened exclusively in cases of domestic abuse. \n\nThere were major differences in how the Pakistani Muslim and Punjabi Sikh participants approached divorce, due to the law-like nature of the sharia. Islamic divorces were sought in addition to civil divorces, wherever the latter was applicable. Importantly, there was a large number of Islamic practitioners who participants approached to get an Islamic divorce; they did not only turn to sharia councils as authorities on Islamic divorce. Among the Punjabi Sikhs, there were similar disconnections between court and religious marriages in cases of remarriage. As in the wider White British population, the majority of civil divorces were applied for by women. The important negotiations in civil divorces took place mainly outside court. The most protracted court battles took place over applications for child contact.\n\nHalf the participants had remarried, in relationships typically very different from their first marriages. Second marriages were often unstable, and vulnerable to break-down. Half the participants had not remarried. Some found it empowering to be free of their marriage; for most, however, living alone was very difficult. Divorce did not resolve conflict, and conflict continued for a long time afterwards. Children often grew up in poverty and with parents suffering mental ill-health. However, children were active in creating new forms of family life after divorce. Further research is planned on the dynamics of step-families and on children’s experiences. British Asian people who are going through marital difficulties can gain valuable insights from being able to read others’ experiences, as those who are going through marital breakdown usually feel that they are going through it alone. \n\nCommunity-based organizations can gain valuable data to support their work, particularly \n*those concerned with supporting lone parents, who will be able to make stronger claims for financial attention given that the prevalence of lone parenthood among British Asian groups is very similar to the prevalence in the wider White British population; \n*organizations providing support in cases of domestic abuse, who can gain information on the pervasiveness of domestic abuse in British Asian communities; \n*agencies concerned with mediation, who can gain data on the gendered assumptions that are brought to bear in family and religious arbitration for both Pakistani Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs; and\n*marriage counsellors, who can gain important insights into the pervasive mental ill-health entailed in such situations, which rarely reaches the attention of mental health professionals. \n\nStatutory agencies can also take forward the findings: \n*the impoverishment of British Asian lone parents requires attention; \n*the Forced Marriage Unit should consolidate efforts at challenging forced marriage through religious advocates; and \n*recent Home Office family migration policies re: income requirements and extended five-year probationary periods should be reconsidered, as these prejudice citizens who are on low incomes and exacerbate the vulnerabilities of immigrant spouses, particularly women.
