Here, computer-based games will be used to investigate the general rules and exceptions to be learned. The games will track what sort of general rules people form, and when people learn exceptions to those rules for common exceptions vs. rare exceptions.&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G028095/1","grantId":"ES/G028095/1","fundValue":"80518","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Hsu","coPersons":["Nick  Chater"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
