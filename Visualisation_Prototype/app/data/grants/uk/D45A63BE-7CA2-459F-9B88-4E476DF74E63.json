It will also enhance the implementing of trading and hedging strategies in financial markets. The research is based on finding accurate ways of breaking data down into trends and cycles, and assessing the persistence of these patterns. \n<br />\n<br />The project will develop new tools for government economists, central bankers, hedge fund managers and those involved in the international financial markets. \n<br />\n<br />These new tools will be capable of making accurate predictive inferences despite the fact economic and financial series often violate assumptions of standard statistical theory.\n<br />\n<br />Other applications will also be possible, for example, determining whether substantial global warming is happening or whether the temperature increase is mainly part of a long cycle.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0790","grantId":"RES-062-23-0790","fundValue":"388893","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karim  Abadir","coPersons":["Walter  Distaso","Liudas  Giraitis"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
