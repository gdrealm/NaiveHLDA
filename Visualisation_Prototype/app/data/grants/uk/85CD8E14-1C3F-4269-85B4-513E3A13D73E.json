While these two approaches are useful in deriving theoretical insights as to the implications of such social preferences - in reality it is likely that both types of motivation are at play - their relative importance has not been assessed. </p>\n\n<p>The aim of this project is to disentangle the two sources of pro-social motivation conducting a field experiment where subjects provide real effort and are offered a choice between different combinations of pecuniary and non-pecuniary compensation. The issue of whether the use of pecuniary incentives may lead to a reduction of workers' altruistically motivated effort will also be addressed.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0461","grantId":"RES-061-25-0461","fundValue":"242142","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Vlassopoulos","coPersons":["Mirco  Tonin"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
