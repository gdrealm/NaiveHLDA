{"id":"E7264F7E-A301-466F-89C2-94CEF4934466","title":"Bilateral Australia: Crafting Authoritarian Politics","abstractText":"The end of communist rule in Russia has been succeeded by a form of rule that is scarcely Western democracy but at the same time is hardly a simple dictatorship. Researchers initially conceptualised these systems as variants of democracy. But it has been increasingly accepted that these are distinct types of regime that are no longer 'in transition' towards democracy or anywhere else, and which have a number of defining characteristics. These include an electoral system that is formally competitive but in fact closely controlled by the authorities themselves; a party system that is dominated by a regime-sponsored 'party of power'; media that with minor exceptions are under the control of the political executive; and a dominant 'superpresidency'. The project will seek to define the nature and sources of support of this novel regime type using documentary (printed) sources, elite interviews (especially with legislators and election commission officials), focus groups, and a national representative survey to be conducted in the first half of 2008. The primary output is intended to be a monograph on The Russian Voter, drawing on these data and placing Russian developments firmly within the comparative politics literature.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F026269/1","grantId":"ES/F026269/1","fundValue":"82200","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Leonard White","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
