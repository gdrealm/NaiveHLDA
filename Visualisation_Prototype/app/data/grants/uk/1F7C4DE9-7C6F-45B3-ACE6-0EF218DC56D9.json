{"id":"1F7C4DE9-7C6F-45B3-ACE6-0EF218DC56D9","title":"Molecular Mechanisms of Skeletal Muscle Specification and Differentiation","abstractText":"One of the major scientific achievements of the past century has been the completion of the human genome project, which has revealed that the complexity of the human body comes from the activity of a mere 30,000 genes. These are small phrases in a book entitled: How to construct a human body and make it work . All the cells in our bodies have the same genes and if eyes are different from hands it is because those genes that say how to make hands are not active in the eyes and vice versa. Nevertheless, knowing the sequence of all our genes is not enough to understand how a body is made, because we still do not know how it is decided when and where to switch on (or off) a gene or set of genes in order to produce a particular organ or tissue. Answering this question is one of the biggest scientific challenges ahead of us. Our research concentrates on how a group of embryonic cells takes the decision to become muscle rather than bone or skin. The genes that turn those cells into muscle are known, and in our previous research we have located the switches for these genes. The next steps are to find out what operates these switches, why and how a switch only works on a single gene, even if other genes are also close by, and why some muscles need multiple switches.\nAlthough we concentrate on muscle development, the answers to some of these questions are likely to apply to other genes, and thus help us understand how a human body is made. Understanding how to make a muscle will help scientists and doctors to develop, in the future, therapies oriented towards the repair or re-growth of injured or diseased muscles, by using a few cells from the patient or a relative and instructing them to re-create the missing structure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401199","grantId":"G0401199","fundValue":"1551180","fundStart":"2005-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter William Rigby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
