{"id":"FDBC2837-291A-4D63-9F37-20EFEAD0E0F7","title":"Prevention of bacterial infections in the newborn by pre-delivery administration of azithromycin","abstractText":"The last decade has witnessed an important reduction of the mortality in children less than 5 years of age. Nevertheless, such reduction occurred mainly in children older than 1 month; no change was observed in newborns (between birth and one month of age). Mortality in this age group contributes half of all deaths occurring in children below 5 years of age. Sixteen out of the 20 countries with the highest neonatal mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1990, the United Nations established the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) aiming at improving by 2015 living conditions of the poorest populations. The MDG number 4 aims at reducing by two-thirds the under-five mortality, a result attainable only with a substantial reduction in neonatal deaths.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_EX_MR/J010391/1","grantId":"MC_EX_MR/J010391/1","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anna  Roca","coPersons":[],"organisation":"MRC Unit, The Gambia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
