{"id":"A044A5B1-9CB9-4129-BCB6-28748341972B","title":"Preparation of Photovoltaic Silicon","abstractText":"Silicon is the most common material used in solar cells and is, at present, a by-product of the semiconductor industry and it is also in short supply due to the increased demand for the material. Metallurgical silicon is first produced by the carbothermic of quartz at very high temperatures. Consuming 4kg of carbon and 14 kwh of electrical energy for each kg of silicon produced. It is then purified by forming trichlorosilane which is then reduced. This refining step generates 40 kg of carbon dioxide and needs about 130 kwh of electricity for every kg of purified silicon. This proposal addresses an alternative process in which the quartz is reduced to silicon by the process of electro-deoxidation in which the quartz is made the cathodes in a bath of calcium chloride. The anode will be an inert conducting oxide so that the products of process are silicon and oxygen, making this a green process with an energy consumption of 15 kwh/kg. As this unlikely to produce solar grade silicon in one step, the silicon is then electrorefined which will require about 10 kwh/kg of silicon produced. From the evidence in the literature, this should produce solar grade silicon. If this is found not to be the case, the quartz can be purified using hydrometallurgy and the final product zone refined. The innovative steps in this proposal are to combine together steps, already detailed in the literature but not used in combination, to produce solar grade silicon. As well as using well documented electrolytes, it is intended also to investigate ionic liquids, which melt below 100oC to make this a room temperature process. The overall goal is to investigate a process that consumes far less energy, avoids toxic chlorine containing gases and produces oxygen as a by-product.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F015720/1","grantId":"EP/F015720/1","fundValue":"319203","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Derek  Fray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" It was found possible to reduce 99.99% by electro-deoxidation in molten calcium chloride to 99.99% silicon which could then be electrorefined to 99.9999% silicon To enable photovoltaic silicon to be produced in a way that is less energy consuming and produces far less CO2 than existing methods. There are several sources of very high quality silica in Australia which would be particularly amenable to this technique. Existing methods require the silica to be reduced by carbon which introduces about 1.5 wt % of impurities into the resulting silicon. At present, these impurities are removed by the Siemens process which uses far more energy and produces more CO2 than molten salt electrorefining. \n\n\n\nNegotiations are underway with two Australian companies to exploit this technology in Tasmania.
