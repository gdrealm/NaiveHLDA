{"id":"62E5CBC4-ED42-4175-9732-C89C455C6472","title":"The Ambiguities of Nationalism: Bengal/India/Hindustan","abstractText":"The proposed research explores the interactions and overlapping among local, regional, linguistic and religious identities in India, and their negotiations with 'national' identity, from the mid-ninteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries. It brings together a wide range of contemporary and retrospective interpretations, and much new empirical data, to challenge existing assumptions about an overarching 'Indian' nationalism, while further questioning the possiblitiy of any national identity being non-exclusionary and progressive. In raising these questions, it seeks to reassess the history of nationalism(s) in India and the literature on nationalism and national liberation movements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113130/1","grantId":"113130/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Benjamin  Zachariah","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
