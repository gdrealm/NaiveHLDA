If co-witnesses discuss an event, or are exposed to each other’s reports of that event, their memories are likely to converge. The present research investigates this “co-witness influence effect” in young children. Specifically, it examines the developmental mechanisms that regulate the likelihood of being influenced by a co-witness, and separates resultant recall errors based on &quot;social conformity&quot; from those based on &quot;memory failure&quot;. In three experiments, children will view a set of slides with a co-witness (either another child or a confederate on a video). Importantly, children will believe that the co-witness is viewing the same set of slides, but these stimuli will in fact differ. At test, the child and the co-witness will answer questions about the slides together and then individually. Children will also complete a battery of theory of mind tasks (false-belief understanding and the appreciation that perceptions and knowledge are causally linked) and a measure of verbal ability. An analysis of the patterns of association between different aspects of theory of mind understanding and errors resulting from exposure to the co-witness’ responses will reveal whether theory of mind differentially influences socially and cognitively driven errors in recall.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F024398/1","grantId":"ES/F024398/1","fundValue":"84497","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexandra Maria Bright-Paul","coPersons":["Chris  Jarrold","Daniel Brooks Wright"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
