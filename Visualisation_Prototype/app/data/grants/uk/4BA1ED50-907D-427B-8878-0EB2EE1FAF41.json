But, man-made nanoparticles (i.e. engineered nanoparticles or ENPs) are of tremendous technological and economic interest. They have a wide range of potential applications in environmental remediation, medical and consumer products. The small sizes of ENPs give them special chemical properties, making them potentially reactive. These particles are being discharged, voluntary or involuntary, into the environment in common with other pollutants such as those present in diesel exhaust, oil leaks and spills, tobacco smokes. These chemicals are collectively known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and they have known detrimental effects on the health of humans and the natural biota, including induction of cancer. \n\nThe reactive property of ENPs can potentially cause harm to humans and other life forms and in the environment, they can occur in all probable combinations with other pollutants such as PAHs. They can interact and behave in different ways, opposed to when they are present on their own in the environment. Their potential interactive effects are however unknown. Within the cells (the smallest unit of life), they can cause damage to biomolecules (e.g. membranes, proteins and DNA). In addition to direct interaction of ENPs and PAHs with biomolecules (e.g. DNA, cell membrane), the resultant damage could be through the formation of highly reactive molecules called free radicals which are involved in many pathological conditions, which we aim to measure using specific technique, the methodologies for which have not been properly developed. This is particularly so in cases where they are brought into contact with water under different conditions (e.g. salinity, acidity, oxygen level etc.) either alone or in combinations with other pollutants such as PAHs. \n\nWe will be synthesise ENPs in our laboratory and will characterise them for their specific properties in various conditions, track their uptake by the mussels (alone or in combination with PAHs) and localise them in different tissues using analytical techniques where appropriate. Using two chemically different, widely used, environmentally relevant ENPs (i.e. C60 fullerenes and carbon nanotubes), the aim of the present proposal is to determine the potential effects of these ENPs either alone or in combinations with environmentally relevant PAHs. We will be using a range of biological measures, which will include damage to DNA or genes, the blueprint of life, and determine how either the single or group of genes behave in different conditions, which could lead to potential detrimental effects in different organs or tissues of marine mussels. We will vary the extent of damage produced, by altering the exposure conditions (chronically or acute) and will also determine the antioxidants levels to correlate the effects. The damaging effect of generated radicals on cell membranes will also be examined. We will use modelling techniques to incorporate individual biological responses to draw a bigger picture of potential effects. Using analytical techniques, we will determine the levels of ENPs and PAHs in seawater and the tissues of the organism and will correlate these levels with observed effects. Such an approach will help us to determine the potential risk to our health from these chemicals and will inform the regulators and the industries to take appropriate actions to safeguard the health of humans and the environment. \nWe will use the generated information to explain the pathways of exposure to ENPs and PAHs and suggest ways to reduce any potential harm. This may also have application in the treatment of diseases such as cancer. We will share the information with the scientific community, industries, and all other stake holders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L006782/1","grantId":"NE/L006782/1","fundValue":"567041","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-14","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The project started in April 2014 and at the moment we are optimising the methods and protocols and developing the models.
