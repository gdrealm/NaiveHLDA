Photonics is destined for a central role - the photon is an ideal quantum bit, or 'qubit', for encoding, processing, and transmitting quantum information. However, real-world applications require integrated photonic devices, incorporating photon sources, detectors and circuits. Just as the invention of the silicon integrated circuit turned the tremendous potential of the transistor into reality, this project aims to develop all necessary components to the high levels of performance and integration required to realise quantum photonic technologies. This project will be the first to simultaneously address all components and their integration simultaneously. It will thereby overcome the major challenges to realising the tremendous potential of future quantum technologies. \n\nA key challenge in the development and application of our approach is to integrate waveguide circuits with active components: single-photon sources, phase- and amplitude-modulators and high-efficiency single-photon detectors. Our initial benchmarking and characterisation results have identified lithium niobate (LN) as the perfect material system in which to realise all of these components and thereby to create a new paradigm for integrated quantum photonics. The goals of this proposal are to fabricate all of the key devices in the LN material system and to integrate them to realise the first prototype systems. Telecom wavelength operation will enable interfacing with existing telecom systems (existing fibre optic networks for example) and the adoption of powerful telecom technologies (modulators, wavelength division multiplexing, arrayed waveguide gratings, etc.). \n\nThe devices and systems developed in this programme will revolutionise approaches to photonic quantum technologies, paving the way to practical applications. This project brings together all of the essential expertise required to achieve these ambitious goals in world-leading groups in quantum photonic technologies and LN device fabrication (Bristol), superconducting single-photon detectors (Heriot-Watt), and superconducting thin film growth and nanofabrication (Cambridge). This proposal builds on successful work within and between these groups and has substantial support from our exisiting industrial partners (The UK National Physical Laboratory, Nokia and Quantum Technology Research Ltd.). Over the last several years the applicants have already made great strides towards integrated quantum photonic technologies, developing waveguide-on-chip quantum photonic circuits, combined with practical superconducting single photon detectors, and non-linear photon sources. \n\nThis research proposal is extremely timely in addressing a critical bottleneck in the development of optical quantum information technologies: a single material system that can support all of the required components and their integration. Our research programme will provide a launching pad to a new generation of compact, high performance quantum photonic devices operating at telecom wavelengths. We adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach in migrating from silica-on-silicon waveguide circuits to LN waveguide circuits. This will enable us to integrate periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) photon sources, rapidly reconfigurable waveguide circuits and high performance superconducting single-photon detectors together for the first time, and to achieve high performance operation at telecom wavelengths. This approach promises a new technology platform for realising secure communication networks, precision measurement systems, simulation of important physical, chemical and biological systems, including new materials and pharmaceuticals, and ultimately ultra-powerful computers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I036273/1","grantId":"EP/I036273/1","fundValue":"466965","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This EPSRC grant enabled a UK effort towards the development of components for quantum waveguide circuits.
