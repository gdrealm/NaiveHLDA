{"id":"EB349942-F18E-4C37-B86F-3D40FE01EDA9","title":"International Trade Integration: New Methods and New Data","abstractText":"<p>Rapid global integration in goods markets is becoming a hallmark of the early 21st century. How can one explain this phenomenal increase in international trade that the world has experienced over the past few decades? </p>\n\n<p>The aim of research by Dennis Novy, David Jacks and Christopher Meissner is to develop a theoretical framework for studying international trade integration and to empirically investigate why some countries and some industries trade so much more than others.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers examine a host of trade cost components that impede international trade. Those include transportation costs and tariffs, but also other informal and institutional barriers such as language barriers and exchange rate volatility. </p>\n\n<p>The research takes a long-run comparative perspective stretching from 1870 to 2000, using trade data between the US, the UK, France and over a dozen of their trading partners. The aim is to study how important trade cost reductions were in driving the growth of trade, for example in the form of technological breakthroughs such as steamship and container shipping.</p>\n\n<p>The project will provide both a new methodology and new data sets that are useful to other researchers interested in studying international economic integration or the trade history of particular countries.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G017816/1","grantId":"ES/G017816/1","fundValue":"82153","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Dennis  Novy","coPersons":["Christopher Michael Meissner","David  Jacks"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" Please see my previous submission.
