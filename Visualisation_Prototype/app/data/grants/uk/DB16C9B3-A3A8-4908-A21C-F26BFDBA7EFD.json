The specific objectives are to - </p> \n<ul> \n <li>Analyse the effects of new technologies of border security on non-governmental public activity around questions of civil liberties, surveillance and privacy, biometrics and immigration<br /></li> \n <li>Advance theoretical understanding of the politics of dissent and resistance, particularly knowledge of the relationships between ‘governmental’ regimes of security and apparently ‘non-governmental’ domains of public action; <br /></li> \n <li>Generate new empirical material detailing the diverse strategies and tactics of a range of groups organising to contest new border governance; <br /></li> \n <li>Identify the emerging themes and issues that cut across different modes of NGPA, in order that actors may more effectively influence agendas and outcomes.&nbsp; </li>\n</ul> \n<p>The research contributes to the programme objective of building theory in relation to NGPA. Specifically, Contested Borders will advance social science knowledge of what non-governmental action means in the context of wider global processes of governing within the war on terror.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E005853/1","grantId":"ES/E005853/1","fundValue":"180521","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Louise  Amoore","coPersons":["Stephen Douglas Graham"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
