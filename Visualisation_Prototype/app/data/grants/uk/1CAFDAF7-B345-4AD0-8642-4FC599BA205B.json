{"id":"1CAFDAF7-B345-4AD0-8642-4FC599BA205B","title":"Consolidated EPSRC support for Durham Symposia","abstractText":"The LMS-EPSRC Durham Symposia have a long and glorious history and are among the most important regular international mathematical events, reflecting and initiating developments in cutting edge modern mathematics. These 10-day meetings have run since 1974 and have quickly developed their highest international reputation. They are widely associated with the excellence of British mathematics. The programme activity of the Durham Symposia is fully controlled by the London Mathematical Society, and takes place during the summer period, fitting well into the academic diary of mathematicians worldwide.\n\nThis proposal seeks support for a continuation of the programme of Symposia for a further four years.\n\nThe Symposia bring together the top UK and international researchers, with the aim of finding common ground and discussing exciting recent developments. Nearly all participants reside in the same accommodation block, giving the meetings a closed and informal atmosphere under which the exchange of ideas and cross-fertilization of research expertise can flourish.\n\nInformation on each symposium can be found through the actively-managed and easily accessible website (http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/events/Meetings/LMS/), which contains links to all previous Durham Symposia. The main talks of each symposium are recorded (with permission of the speakers) and made available through this website within days after the end of the meeting. Similarly, lecture notes and presentation slides are also made available.\n\nThe outcomes from the symposia impart a large impetus to already dynamic research areas. The UK and international symposium participants are the immediate beneficiaries, but the timely appearance of videos and lecture notes on the Durham Symposium website also informs the research of many other mathematical scientists working in the area. This in turn adds considerably to our understanding of the various research topics studied.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K040154/1","grantId":"EP/K040154/1","fundValue":"629652","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dirk  Schuetz","coPersons":["Djoko  Wirosoetisno","Norbert  Peyerimhoff","John Robert  Parker"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
