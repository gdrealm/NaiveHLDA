An article on our research by Sarah Boseley for The Guardian prompted significant debate online as did a feature and phone-in on BBC Radio 5 Live's Victoria Derbyshire Programme and related discussion with Australian team members on ABC's Body Sphere and Life Matters. For further media outputs see http://www.ssss.leeds.ac.uk/publications. \nWe expect that our forthcoming paper in The Lancet Global Health will substantially enhance impact among medical professionals. \n\nTwo significant presentations have been made to UK policymakers. Findings related specifically to PIP implants were presented to Ministers and MPs from the Health Select Committee in Portcullis House on 2 July 2012. This presentation was subsequently raised by Stephen Dorrell in the Commons Debate on 5 July 2012 (documented in Hansard) which called for the Keogh Report into CS practice in the UK. After Keogh was published, a number of subcommittees were established to deal with issues arising. Ruth Holliday is on the Patient Information Subcommittee, which will produce guides for patients considering CS at home or abroad. She was also invited to present on CST to this group at the Royal College of Surgeons (2.07.14) and is a co-opted member of the BAPRAS Research Committee. Jacqueline Sanchez Taylor is consultant to the Department of Health's Breast Implant Registry and was invited to the 2013 BAPRAS conference. \n\nOur Report Summary and Final Report have also been widely circulated on social media and industry forums (such as the International Medical Tourism Journal), and shared with the above committees as well as other interested parties.\n\nCST is poorly understood and under-researched, with much current discussion anecdotal. Our study provides a large qualitative data set (and some quantitative data) on experiences of CST, including choice of destination and procedure, outcomes and complications, and impacts on domestic healthcare. Contrary to existing conceptions of CST as a high risk undertaking by impulsive decision-makers seduced by celebrity culture, we show risks are relatively low, patients consider their surgical journeys for years in advance and undertake detailed research on surgeons and destinations. They select destinations largely based on cost - though quality is also important - and people's tangible bodies are more important in considerations of surgery than media images. Our qualitative data debunks myths of CST as burden on domestic healthcare showing most complications are minor. Our research countered conceptions of medical tourism (MT) as wealthy westerners going South or East. We saw East-East flows and found many patients were inexperienced travellers on low incomes. Medical staff can also be 'tourists' travelling abroad to perform procedures, and much of the assembling of CST is carried out by agents/facilitators.\n\nWe have theorized the role of social networks (family and friends) and social media in facilitating CST, showing how relationships - caring and financial - operate throughout the journey. Our approach builds on post-essentialist understandings of cosmetic surgery, seeing it as a practice formed through interknit actors including technologies, media, patients, discourses, surgeons and narratives. Our analysis does not seek to explain cosmetic surgery, but rather to examine the medical, cultural and economic networks in which it unfolds. We draw on theories of global flows and assemblages to advance their development, and are developing beautyscapes as a new theoretical concept for mapping the global flows that impact on the body and its value.\n\nThese findings are already beginning to be discussed in the academic literature.

They were ‘ordinary people’ – administrators, nurses, care workers – who wanted to change one part of their body they didn’t like. They travelled abroad for surgery because they couldn’t afford it at home.\n\n\n\n‘Quality of Surgeon’ was given as the main reason for choosing a destination; place was relatively unimportant (except Chinese patients who travel for high quality Korean surgery). Patients lack knowledge of the places they travel to. They are mostly not well-travelled and have limited foreign language skills.\n\n\n\nChinese patients paid for their surgeries from savings. UK and Australian patients were more likely to use credit. Patients said they might otherwise have spent the money on home improvements or holidays.\n\n\n\nDifferent patients have surgery for different reasons. Most patients considered their surgery for 5-10 years before they decided to have it. Once they have made the decision, they want surgery quickly, to minimise time spent dwelling on the risks.\n\n\n\nMost patients in our study reported positive surgical outcomes.\n\n\n\n1 in 6 of our patients experienced complications from their surgeries. Fewer than 1 in 10 needed treatment in the NHS or Medicare upon returning home -- mostly stitches removing, antibiotics for infections, or seromas draining.\n\n\n\nIndustry\n\nCST pathways often follow cheap flights, and clinics are often located at tourist resorts.\n\n\n\nFacilities vary from large international hospitals to small clinics occupying one storey of a tower block with two recovery beds.\n\n\n\nSome hospitals were permanent with their own staff on contract. Others rented space to medical teams who leased them just for a few days. Surgeons and other staff were also sometimes ‘medical tourists’ travelling abroad to conduct surgeries and consultations.\n\n\n\nOver half of patients used a facilitator/agent to arrange their trip. These are often former patients now running small businesses.5,6, 8 Agents network with a variety of other workers – patient co-ordinators, drivers, translators, hotel managers, airlines – to provide a package.5, 6, 8, 9Agents filter prospective patients, and keep the more ‘commercial’ aspects of the industry remote from surgeons.\n\n\n\nThe internet is key to this industry. Websites often provide direct price comparison and emphasise quality of care and hygiene. Social networking sites were used extensively to facilitate mutual support and group travel for patients. These sites are also used by agents for marketing, confusing their purpose.\n\n\n\nKey Issues:\n\n• The industry is unevenly regulated and poorly documented.\n\n• CST combines healthcare and consumerism.\n\n• Patients with complications find legal redress difficult.\n\n• Responsibility for risk transfers from doctor to patient – it becomes ‘patient choice’.\n\n• Complications are difficult to deal with because of distance from the surgeon.\n\n• Patients may have undiagnosed underlying health problems that emerge through the process of having surgery. Medical records are not routinely available to doctors abroad. This was the first international multi-site study of cosmetic surgery tourism. The findings from this research make a significant contribution to the growing study of medical tourism and can be used by policy makers and healthcare professionals forecasting changes in global healthcare use and medical travel. More in depth studies of particular specialisms and/ or destinations would compliment this study and develop its initial findings to identify medical tourism patterns of travel and treatment. The study has begun to explore the implications that the privatisation of healthcare has on patient choices when cost of surgery becomes a significant factor. It has also raised the issue of the quality of online information available to patients and the use of the internet in consultations, patient groups, marketing and facilitation.
