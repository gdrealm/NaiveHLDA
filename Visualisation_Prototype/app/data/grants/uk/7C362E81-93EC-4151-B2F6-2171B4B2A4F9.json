Young people's knowledge remains largely untapped or actively devalued, fostering a growing sense of alienation and disengagement among young adults, with damaging consequences for society as a whole. \n\nThis project puts the perspectives of young people at the heart of the Connected Communities Programme (CCP). By building a close collaboration between researchers at RefugeeYouth and academic researchers in the arts and humanities from three universities, we will reveal the potential of participatory action research (PAR) to cross the current frontiers between academic disciplines and everyday practice.\n\nOrganised groups of young people, university-based researchers, and youth-arts practitioners will join forces to employ a specific form of PAR known as Youth PAR towards the following aims: \n\n\n1. University-based researchers, youth workers and arts practitioners learn to appreciate and support young people's research.\n2. Young people's knowledge, understanding and practice of Youth PAR becomes deepened. \n3. Modifying and implementing Youth PAR processes by using creative arts methodologies. \n4. Providing a basis for different groups of young people to engage with both research and political processes. \n5. Demonstrating how the arts, humanities and social science can contribute to, and benefit from, this new approach. \n\nTo avoid a lost generation of young people, and future occurrences of the kind of urban strife English cities experienced in the summer of 2011, policy-makers need to see the world through the perspectives of young people, as well as those filtered through an academic lens. Our project addresses an urgent need for practical approaches to improving direct dialogue with young people through promoting greater awareness of PAR by policy-makers. \n\nAs an illustration of their pioneering approach, members of RefugeeYouth - co-authors of this proposal - were prompted by the events of summer 2011 to spontaneously research and record a music video (bit.ly/VTwQ6n), providing powerful insights into the views of an informed group of young people from diverse urban backgrounds. \n\nWorking together with RefugeeYouth, we will develop critical research that contributes to some of the UK's most pressing social policy agendas, recently highlighted by organisations as diverse as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Centre for Social Justice and Demos.\n\nSeen and Heard's use of Youth PAR begins with a structured set of workshops that will allow at least fifty young people involved in four community organisations to help shape the project - in particular the research questions. Though these questions cannot be predicted, they are likely to include themes of social justice and democracy, such as the one suggested as key by Ginwright (2008): how do we understand the meaning of hope among groups of people without resources and access to power? \n\nAt a practical level, the project will provide skills training to both the fifty young people involved and one hundred university researchers, through St Aidan's and Ustinov College. This will encompass the core ingredients of empirical PAR: the nature of research, framing a research question, common data collection techniques, simple qualitative and quantitative analysis, dissemination and presentation skills. \n\nThe project will lead to the harnessing of the skills of young people to tackle social problems and influence policies. It will also promote the development of new curricula and training materials for training courses on PAR and Youth PAR for university and community-based groups. Finally, it will make a seminal contribution to a long-term culture-shift in research towards PAR both in universities (via the Comm-uni-ty network) and among policy-makers (through the effective use of PAR).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K006584/1","grantId":"AH/K006584/1","fundValue":"100571","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Following an 8 month delay in receiving guidelines from the AHRC, we are still working on the final report for this project so it would be inappropriate to answer this question at this point.
