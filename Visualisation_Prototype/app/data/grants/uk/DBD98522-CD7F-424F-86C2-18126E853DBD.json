In the future there will be immense pressure\nto produce economically valuable materials with much reduced environmental impact. This means the Industrial\nBiotechnology sector (which is related to, but distinct from the Pharmaceutical Industry) in the UK has a golden opportunity\nto harness world class science. This proposal links first class academic science with unique expertise available in an\ninnovative small company, Ingenza. The main aim of the project is to develop a bacterial system (cell factory) for the\nproduction of novel customizable and highly modified cyclic peptides in significant quantities. Cyclic peptides are found as\nantibiotics, anticancer agents, in hormone therapy and in immune system modifying agents. In addition to their direct\nmedicinal role, they are also very useful tools in studying biological processes, this second role, as tools, is\nunderdeveloped simply because natural products are hard to make in sufficient amounts. The proposed work will solve\nthese problems by providing a plug 'n' play system in which changes can be made simply and quickly to the 'cell factory' to\nproduce a vast array of cyclic peptides at a useful scale.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L004429/1","grantId":"BB/L004429/1","fundValue":"141116","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Marcel  Jaspars","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
