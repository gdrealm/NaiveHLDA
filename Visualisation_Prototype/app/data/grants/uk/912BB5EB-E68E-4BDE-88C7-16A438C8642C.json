It is a growing field in importance and popularity and over the last few years has gained a large amount of attention due to the role played by organelles in carrying out defined cellular processes. \n\nThe most information-rich datasets are generated using high accuracy mass-spectrometry (MS), a technique that allows to identify and quantify the proteome content in complex biological samples. These datasets are high quality rich sources of data that have been mined using a variety of robust supervised statistical machine learning (ML) methods which have shown to yield valuable protein-organelle predictions (BBSRC: BB/G024618/1 and BB/H024247/1). These classification methods require as set of tenth expert-curated ground-truth marker proteins of know localisation and then match proteins of unknown localisation to organelles based on their MS data resemblance with those of marker proteins. However, there are still inherent issues that limit the optimal application of such contemporary classification methods: (1) the limited number of organelle markers and the reliance on time-consuming manual curation and (2) the limited number of organelle classes that systematically underestimates the sub-cellular diversity recorded in the datasets. \n\nIn this proposal we aim to improve protein-organelle association via the application of different state-of-the-art methods to remove the need to ground-truth marker proteins to accurately assign proteins to a broader set of sub-cellular compartments. These unsupervised approaches will be looking specifically for patterns in the organelle proteomics data. We will also make use vast amounts of freely available protein annotation data like the Gene Ontology. These annotations, while prone to erroneous or misleading information, are available for tens of thousands proteins, describing all organelles identified so far. The amount of anntation data allows to overcome its uncertainty and investigate the sub-cellular environment at a much more meaningful diversity. In addition, the proposed methods will allow complete automation of the data analysis, thus permitting the treatment of more and bigger datasets.\n\nThe development of a framework that will support this annotation to guide the extrapolation and elucidation of patterns in the MS data will lead to the creation of optimal organelle proteomics datasets which will be deposited in a public access proteomics data repository through the main ProteomeXchange submission portal. These tools will be made freely available as open-source software for the use of the whole proteomics community.\n\nThe work proposed in this grant will be implemented by a multidisciplinary team bringing together expertise in state-of-the-art mass-spectrometry based proteomics approaches (KSL), database annotation (CD), contemporary pattern recognition methods (AP, TB, SBH and LG), computational bioinformatics and code development (LG) and applied mathematics (LMS). LG, KSL and LMS have worked together previously on organelle proteomics grants that resulted in the release of the current state-of-the-art toolkits for organelle proteomics data analysis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L018241/1","grantId":"BB/L018241/1","fundValue":"10175","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christophe  Dessimoz","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
