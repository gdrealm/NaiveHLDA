It is widely assumed that all these mutations activate this pathway. We are interested in the development of Wilms' tumours, kidney cancers found in young children that are the result of normal kidney development before birth going wrong. A subset of these tumours has mutations in beta-catenin. Interestingly, whereas there are four different mutations possible, almost all patients have exactly the same mutation, suggesting this mutation is specifically important for this type of cancer. In the work leading up to this proposal we have made mouse models that carry different mutant copies of beta-catenin, including the mutation found in Wilms' tumours. We found that this mutation resulted in kidney abnormalities that would fit with a role in Wilms' tumours but, surprisingly, this mutation did not seem to activate the protein. Unfortunately, these models were made in a way that differs from the way the gene is mutated in patients, and it is therefore not possible to conclude this mutation will have the same effect in tumours.\n\nIn this project we will therefore first make the mutation in exactly the same way as found in human tumours. We will repeat the analyses we have done before on the other model to see if the surprising findings we did are confirmed. We will study the effect of this mutation in mice, with an emphasis on the kidney and neuron / brain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M010341/1","grantId":"MR/M010341/1","fundValue":"656978","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Hohenstein","coPersons":["Derya Deniz  Ozdemir","Thomas M Wishart"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
