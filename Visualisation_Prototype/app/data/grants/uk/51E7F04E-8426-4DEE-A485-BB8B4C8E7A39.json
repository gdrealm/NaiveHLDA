The workshop will focus on outstanding issues in Harmonic analysis,High contrast problems, Dynamical systems and non-linear problems and on questions at the interface of these topics.It will provide a forum for new interdisciplinary work and also provide a supportive environment for young scientists and research students to become involved in the activities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H032274/1","grantId":"EP/H032274/1","fundValue":"37311","fundStart":"2011-05-18","fundEnd":"2012-05-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  workers in inverse problems for maxwell systems have used some of th ideas from harmonic analysis disused at the workshop Education,Electronics Cultural","person":"B Malcolm Brown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" the importance of harmonies analysis in inverse problems some of the questions that were discussed could form the basis for further grant applications Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
