{"id":"EAD2E4BD-E653-4F23-A57D-F89844120A62","title":"Functional bionanomaterials and novel processing for targeted catalytic applications","abstractText":"Commercial catalysts are often based on metallic nanoparticles which have unusual and highly reactive properties due to their high proportion of surface atoms as compared to buried ones. Catalytic reactions occur at or just below surfaces and are helped by the crystal surface having defect sites and kinks. The exact architecture of the kinks can help in molecular recognition between the catalyst and its substrate, and help to make a particular form of the product molecule (called an enantiomer) over its mirror image 'twin'. Industry needs enantiomeric selectivity, and also better ways to make C-C bonds; both would become possible using a new type of nanoparticle based on bacteria. It is difficult to make nanoparticles chemically as they want to aggregate. When this happens the special properties are lost. Usually 'helper' chemicals ('passivant ligands') are needed. Bacteria can overcome this need. They can biomanufacture nanoparticles using enzymes and also support the nanoparticles by providing their own passivants. The catalytic bionanoparticles can be employed as catalysts by using the metallised bacteria as small (~2 microns) bodies in suspension (they can be recovered using a magnet), or by growing them first as a biofilm on (e.g) beads or monoliths and then metallising to form a catalytic nano-coating. Nothing is known yet about the surface structures of the bionanocrystals but they are excellent catalysts. It is known elsewhere that the application of dielectric fields (such as microwaves) can alter crystal surfaces (to make new, or different defects and kinks) or align crystals so that their most active faces point outwards. Nobody has applied dielectric fields to manipulate catalytic nanoparticles, especially not BIOnanoparticles, and we hope to make a completely new class of materials(superbionanocatalysts). We will test these in 4 important reactions where there are strong industrial needs: (a) enrich for a particular product in a mixture; (b) do a reaction which specifically needs NANOparticles; (c) do a reaction where we want an enantiomeric selection; (d) do a reaction which underpins commercial fertiliser production worldwide but usually needs very high temperatures and pressures. (a-c)usually use precious metal catalysts and (d) uses a catalyst based on iron; in the nanoworld these can often be used interchangeably (or together) because the same atomic-scale processes are involved. Effects of this are seen in magnetic (as well as catalytic) properties (a very useful diagnostic probe), while another facet is unravelled via an electrochemical 'dialogue' between the nanocrystal and the experimenter. These become even more interesting when the bacteria make 'bimetallics' (combining 2 metals); these often have greatly enhanced properties. We will look at bio-bimetallics for catalysis and also as fuel cell catalysts to make clean energy. Reactions involving Fe catalysts are special. They depend on the exact type of Fe used (the mineral phase); bacteria can make specific mineral phases to order. The catalytic reaction uses an activated form of hydrogen which normally only happens at high temperatures; small particles of ferric oxide are partially reduced by the active H to give some Fe metal (the catalyst; detected magnetically). Dielectric processing can also activate H, but at a much lower temperature, saving energy. Commercially, H is made from 'cracking' natural gas but this H contains traces of catalyst poisons. Biologically-made H is poison-free and the use of Bio-H will also help to extend catalyst life. We will make new, robust, superior, catalytic materials but, importantly, we will also relate the new crystal and nano structures to improved functions, applying a full range of solid state analytical methods to complement the magnetic and electrochemical ones. By understanding pivotal molecular processes in the nanoworld we can then design better catalysts for other commercial applications too.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D058767/1","grantId":"EP/D058767/1","fundValue":"228640","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Materials from this grant are being assessed for use in remediation applications for metals, organics and radionuclides with commercial partners.

In this project we developed\nnovel biosynthesis routes for Fe and precious metal (PM) nanoparticles, and tested them in a range of industrially\nimportant catalytic processes and also in fuel cells. Additional work on Fe/PM bi-metallics generated patented novel\nheterostructures with advantages over existing materials including novel catalytic activities, green synthesis routes and\neasy recovery e.g. by magnetic separation. The molecular structure of these materials, and the catalytic mechanisms of\nthe transformations they perform where identified using state of the art electrochemical, spectroscopic and mineralogical\ntechniques.\nAt the time of final report submission by the Manchester team, our Birmingham partners are still 6 months from project\ncompletion. During the project the Daresbury grant was transferred to Diamond. A brief synopsis of the work completed\nby Manchester (and Cardiff/Daresbury/Diamond) is provided below (covered in 18 peer reviewed publications, one patent\nand 22 conference abstracts):\n\n1. Mechanisms and end products of Fe(III) reduction\nFocusing on the microbial reduction of Fe(III) minerals to the magnetic Fe(II)-bearing mineral magnetite, the valence\nstates, site symmetries and occupancies of the end products (with and without TM dopants such as Co, Ni, Mn) and their magnetic/catalytic properties were identified using XAS and XMCD (at Diamond and Advanced Light Source, Berkeley)\nwith the Diamond team developing anaerobic sample handing, electrochemical and Raman spectroscopy techniques with\nCardiff and XPS, Mossbauer, TEM and XRD in Manchester. Studies on the mechanism of Fe(III) reduction were also\npublished using x-ray diffraction techniques (at Swiss Light Source), with STXM used more recently (at Canadian Light\nSource and Swiss Light Source) to characterise the microbe-mineral interface at the nanoscale. A biosynthetic route for\nhigh coercivity Co-doped nanomagnetite was also published, opening the way for new materials for medical applications\nincluding hyperthermic treatment of cancer tumours.\n2. Optimization of Fe(III) reduction for catalysis\nThe role of Fe(III) mineralogy in controlling Fe(III) reduction rates and end-product reactivity was studied and published,\nand bionanomagnetites with optimized reactivities tested against organic and inorganic substrates. For Fe(II)-mediated\nbioremediation they were superior to synthetic analogues due to an excess of surface Fe(II) on the nanoparticles. Work\nwith Birmingham highlighted additional applications for the materials for chemical synthesis, offering an inexpensive,\nscalable green route for the production of industrial catalysts. C-Tech innovation developed two microwave reactors with\nthe potential to enhance nanoparticle reactivity, but due to commercial pressures these were not available for this work.\nExperiments by Birmingham are planned to address the objectives for the project in this area.\n3. Novel magnetically recoverable bionanocatalysts\nBionanomagnetite was further functionalised with a range of precious metals coatings including Pd and Au, facilitated by\na thin organic coating on the nanoparticles, resulting in the formation of highly active patented magnetically recoverable\ncatalysts. The materials were tested for synthesis reactions (Heck coupling) and the remediation of recalcitrant organics\ne.g. TCE. The bionanomaterials were found to be superior to conventional catalysts for these applications, offering\nexcellent catalyst recovery and very high activity. Follow-on work was supported by (1) a BBSRC CASE studentship, (2) EPSRC KT grant focuses on the scale-up of production of bionanomagnetite optimised for in situ and ex situ remediation applications with Parsons Brinkerhoff and the Centre for Process Innovation and (3) a major EU grant, Nanorem and (4) an EPSRC grant on oil upgrading (with Birmingham) using microbial catalysts.
