However, it is important that F&amp;V intake is measured accurately when trying to work out whether increasing consumption of these foods will reduce the risk of disease. It is currently very difficult to measure F&amp;V intake accurately, as standard methods used are imprecise. The introduction of a blood test to measure F&amp;V consumption would be a significant development in nutrition research as it would allow researchers to make better estimates of F&amp;V intake in the general population, and also lead to a better understanding of whether and how F&amp;V reduce disease risk. We propose that, because F&amp;V are diverse and complex foods with many biologically active compounds, that a single blood test is never likely to accurately reflect F&amp;V consumption. As an alternative, we propose that the results of measuring a panel of compounds from a single blood test could be combined using statistical methods, and that this approach would lead to a more accurate estimate of F&amp;V consumption. We will carry out a study where we feed healthy volunteers a known number of portions of F&amp;V per day and will carry out these blood tests, to allow the testing of the statistical methods. We will then test the results of these statistical analyses in a series of F&amp;V studies that have already been carried out where we know how many portions of F&amp;V the participants were consuming in order to compare reported intake with the more objective blood results.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901793","grantId":"G0901793","fundValue":"340667","fundStart":"2010-11-15","fundEnd":"2013-08-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"J  Woodside","coPersons":["Michael Robert Stevenson","Jane  McEneny","Iain Stuart Young","Katherine Marie Appleton","Michelle  McKinley"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
