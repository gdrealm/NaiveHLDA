Exploring Language-Specific Articulatory Settings in English-German Bilinguals","abstractText":"There are various reasons for why languages sound different. Languages differ, for example, in their vowel and consonant inventories, their realisation of individual sounds, and their prosody. However, there is growing evidence that distinctions are made on an even more basic level, namely in the way speakers of a language set up their articulators, ie their tongue, their lip and their jaw - in speech, and in the preparation for speech.

Languages differ, for example, in the sets of sounds they are composed of, and in how intonation is used throughout utterances. However, languages may make a distinction on an even more basic level, namely in the characteristic way speakers of a language set up their articulators, i.e. their tongue, their lip and their jaw - during speech, and in the preparation for speech. This phenomenon is often referred to as language-specific articulatory settings.\n\nThe aim of our project was to develop a methodology suitable to empirically determine whether bilingual speakers keep their two languages apart by setting up their articulators in a different manner for each language. To this end we have employed articulatory instrumentation to explore the speech production of German-English bilinguals. Specifically, we used Ultrasound Tongue Imaging to record the overall shape of the tongue, the motion-capture system Vicon to record the position of the jaw and the lips as they change over time, and Electropalatography to record contact patterns of the tongue with the roof of the mouth.\n \nThe results of our project show that the bilinguals we tested do indeed produce their two languages differently, and that these differences can be quantified. Moreover, we have developed a naturalistic and generalisable methodology that can be utilised in future research on articulatory settings, and that can be expanded to a range of language dyads. Crucially, we have also gained important insights into speech preparation, more generally, as well as further refined our articulatory measurements. We had a lot of interest from researchers working on bilingualism as well as researcher working on principles of speech production and speech preparation more generally.
