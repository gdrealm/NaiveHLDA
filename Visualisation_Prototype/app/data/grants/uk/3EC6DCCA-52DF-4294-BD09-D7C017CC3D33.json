This concentration on global extremes has produced work unable to make sense of processes within many countries that fall between these extremes, countries where both CAM and TM are an established feature of healthcare. We will conduct the first such study in Brazil (an excellent example of such a country) focusing on people with diabetes. This research will:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>add an extra level of sophistication to our understanding of themes within existing CAM sociology; and,<br /></li>\n\n <li>address concerns of local users, by providing evidence that can contribute to more informed decision making on CAM/TM in Brazil.</li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2565","grantId":"RES-000-22-2565","fundValue":"63351","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Andrew Tovey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
