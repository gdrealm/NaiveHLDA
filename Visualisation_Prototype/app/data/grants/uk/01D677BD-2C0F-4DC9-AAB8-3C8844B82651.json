{"id":"01D677BD-2C0F-4DC9-AAB8-3C8844B82651","title":"DISSECTING THE FUNCTION OF INDIVIDUAL NF-kappaB SUBUNITS IN INFLAMMATION","abstractText":"Inflammation is a normal physiological response to infection and injury, but can lead to extensive tissue damage and disability when elicited in excess. Pathological consequences of sustained inflammatory response include variety of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn?s disease, ankylosing spondylitis and multiple sclerosis. A sustained inflammatory response is often linked to the break down in regulation of production of inflammatory molecules. In a normal self-resolving body response to infection or injury inflammatory molecules are produced for a defined period of time, while in chronic autoimmune conditions their production is prolonged. \nThe production of many inflammatory molecules is controlled by a key family of regulatory proteins called NF-kappaB. All five NF-kappaB proteins are present at the site of inflammation and are active, but at different times. Why there are five similar but not identical NF-kappaB proteins, why they come to and leave the site of inflammation at different times and how they control the level and the length of production of inflammatory molecules is a subject of this investigation. \nUnderstanding how each NF-kappaB protein functions and what molecules it regulates is important for the development of a new generation of therapeutic approaches. These would only target specific cellular events without interfering with the global host defence mechanisms. It will also help scientists to better understand why we have so many families of ostensibly similar proteins and what specific functions they hold.\nThe research will be carried out by Dr Irina Udalova at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, Imperial College, and will be laboratory based using novel genomic techniques and computational methods. The proposed novel techniques will replace the use of animals in research. Results generated in this study will be communicated through peer-reviewed scientific journals and through annual reports from the Kennedy Institute and presented at scientific meetings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501087","grantId":"G0501087","fundValue":"323060","fundStart":"2006-10-25","fundEnd":"2009-10-24","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Irina  Udalova","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
