The realisation of three key works.","abstractText":"\\nDespite the experiments of the last 50 years, mainstream contemporary new music is still predominantly score-based, with a clear separation of the roles of composer, conductor and performer.\\n\\nPeter Wiegold is evolving a particular creative practice, working with mainstream musicians, that still includes a through-composed score, but then submits that to a process of realisation and improvisation, under his direction. This leads to a final result that, ideally, makes the best of the three key elements: pre-scored, set in rehearsal, improvised in performance.\\n\\nAs leader of the process, Wiegold synthesises his roles of composer, creative director and conductor.\\n\\nThis proposal involves the final realisation of three key works from Wiegold's last ten years, to be followed by a recording by NMC recordings. \\n\\nThe works are 'Earth, receive an honoured guest' (2000 for cor anglais and string orchestra), 'Kalachakra' (2001, for 19 players) and 'Earth and Stars' (2006, for 12 players). \\n\\nThe realisation process will be closely documented and analysed, including structured listening and interviews with key players. The results will be presented at a conference, and written up as part of a book Wiegold is preparing on 'creative leadership.'\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G013152/1","grantId":"AH/G013152/1","fundValue":"16326","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Wiegold","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
