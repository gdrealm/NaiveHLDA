They provide both domestic and emotional support, and often also need to provide intimate and medical care. However, the impact of being a young carer on children's wellbeing has not been widely investigated. </p>\n\n<p>The 'Young Carers Project' is a collaboration between the University of Oxford, NGOs, and the South African Government, which aims to examine the impact of being a young carer on children's well-being. Face to face interviews (using measures validated in South African samples) will be conducted with approximately 3000 children (aged between10 and 18 years) in two South African provinces (the Western Cape and Mpumalanga). Children will be sampled from both rural and urban areas and data will be used to explore the mental health, physical health, educational, and social outcomes associated with being a young carer. Longitudinal follow up will investigate potential mechanisms through which caring for an unwell parent or guardian may impact upon child wellbeing. </p>\n\n<p>The research will be conducted in close collaboration with the South African Government and NGOs, and findings from the study will be used to inform social policy decisions. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H001743/1","grantId":"ES/H001743/1","fundValue":"516938","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The finding of the Young Carers study has led to two new major research initiatives by the Young Carers team. Building on the findings of the Young Carers study, further research has also been developed on HIV-positive adolescents. This includes a new, longitudinal study to identify risk and protective factors for their adherence to antiretroviral medication, awarded &pound;700,000 by the Nuffield Foundation and the International AIDS Society and starting in 2014. Furthermore, findings showing increased child abuse in AIDS-affected families have led to a set of randomised controlled trials of child abuse prevention programmes for high HIV-context areas (2013-18), and which were awarded &pound;2 million by the European Research Council, the World Health Organisation and Ilifa Labantwana. If these prove to be effective, the WHO and UNICEF intend to adapt and scale them throughout low and middle income countries. \n\nThe study has also resulted in a number of scientific awards: The Philip Leverhulme Prize (2014), The International AIDS Society Young Investigator Award for best Social Science paper (2014); two Discovery Clinical Excellence Awards for best paper at the South African AIDS Conference (2013 and 2011), and the James Walegumbe Memorial Award for mental health in Africa (2013).

It has interviewed 6002 children and followed them up after a one year period (96 per cent retention rate). Data was collected between 2009-2012 in six urban and rural sites across three South African provinces (Western Cape, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal) using a stratified random sampling methodology. In one province (KwaZulu-Natal) information was also collected from the child's primary caregiver. The large quantitative study is accompanied by linked qualitative studies.\n\nFindings have shown that parental HIV/AIDS-illness leads to negative child educational outcomes, as well as poor sexual, mental, and physical health outcomes.\n\nFindings to date: \n\nModels show important interactive 'risk pathways' from familial HIV/AIDS to child vulnerabilities; including internalising problems (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and suicidality), educational risks (non-enrolment, missing school, grade failure, and concentration problems), and sexual risk behaviours (early sexual debut, engaging in transactional sex, having a partner more than five years older, having three or more partners, and inconsistent condom use). Findings show that the impact of familial HIV/AIDS on these outcomes is indirect, and operates via intervening factors including parental disability, stigma, poverty, and abuse (Cluver, Orkin, Boyes, Sherr, and Nikelo, in press).\n\nChildren's risk of contracting tuberculosis rises from 2% to 18%, through providing medical care to sick adults (Cluver, Orkin, Kuo, Moshabela, and Boyes, in press).\n\nThe impact of familial HIV/AIDS on child outcomes is independent of poverty, but does also interact with poverty to exacerbate negative outcomes (Cluver, Boyes, Orkin, and Sherr, under review).\n\nAdults caring for orphaned children are more likely to report depressive symptoms in the clinical range (Kuo, Operario, and Cluver, 2012). Additionally, qualitative findings amongst primary caregivers suggest that social support is associated with better physical health outcomes, potentially due to processes such as mastery and hope, coping strategies, and positive health behaviours (Casale, Wild, and Kuo, 2013).\n \nNew longitudinal analyses show positive impacts of social interventions such as social grants, free schooling and psychosocial care on reducing sexual risk behaviours (Cluver et al 2013, Cluver et al 2014, Cluver et al, in press). These have been included into UNICEF reports, a recent UNDP report on impacts of cash transfers on HIV, the UNAIDS Planning Coordination Board, and the US Government's President's Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief new Special initiative on preventing HIV in adolescent girls. This summary of project findings will continue to be updated as analyses are completed. \n\nFurther analyses are underway, and this summary of project findings will continue to be updated as analyses are completed. This study has already directly impacted government policies and NGO programming for AIDS-affected children in sub-Saharan Africa. Key impacts include policies on psychosocial support, a new focus on 'young carers' of HIV/AIDS-sick parents as well as orphans, and policy demands for child abuse prevention for HIV/AIDS-affected families. Research team members make regular presentations and attend strategic planning meetings with senior South African government officials, USAID, the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and Save the Children. \n\nThe South African government has cited our research findings in a number of major policy documents. These include the 'SA National Action Plan for children affected by HIV/AIDS 2012-2016' (5 citations of our papers), the 'SA National AIDS Council's National Strategic Plan for HIV and AIDS Information Resource' (2012-2016) (7 citations), and the Department of Social Development's programming guidance 'Psychosocial Support for Orphans and other Children made Vulnerable by HIV/AIDS' (2010) (7 citations).\n\nThe largest funder of programming for AIDS-affected children is USAIDs President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The 'USAID-PEPFAR Guidance for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Programming' (2012) contains 7 citations of our papers (more than any other research group), with six recommended in the 'Evidence Matrix'. The studies have been used for the 'USAID Southern Africa's SA Government Capacity Development and Support Activity' (2012) (1 citation) and the USAID 'Technical Brief 'Transitioning of care for adolescents living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa' (2012)' (4 citations). \n\nThe studies have also been used to develop programming by international and regional NGOs. These include Save the Children's 2012 'A Matter of Urgency: Improving Child Protection in the Context of HIV and AIDS' (6 citations); UNICEF's 2012 report on HIV-sensitive social protection (8 citations) and the Regional Psychosocial Support Initiative 2011 'Programme guidelines for households in which young people are caring for other household members' (2 citations). Additionally, smaller NGOs in Southern Africa have used our research to inform the development of interventions for AIDS-affected children, such as the 'Stepping Stones' program, and the Children's Rights Centre 'Living Positively' handbook.\n\nThe research has also had public reach through articles in print and online media such as The Guardian (UK), the Mail and Guardian, the Saturday Star and the Cape Argus (SA), Science Daily, the New York Review of Books and through radio features on BBC World Service and SA Women's Hour. A number of podcasts have featured the research, with one Voice of America report receiving over 12,000 hits.\n\nThis research has had a major impact on the response to HIV/AIDS-affected children. It has provided policy-makers and programmers with a robust evidence-base to design interventions. By combining collaboration with scientific rigor, it has ensured that governments, funders and NGOs perceive these studies as their own, and that the research answers the questions that are most needed in improving the chances of HIV/AIDS-affected children.
