{"id":"D88C5989-BBE4-4473-8FF4-43939F0BD6F4","title":"Atlantic Sounds: Ships and Sailortowns","abstractText":"The 'Atlantic Sounds' project aims to investigate, from a UK perspective, the role that music has played in cross-cultural encounters around the Atlantic rim (which includes the Americas, Africa and the Caribbean) from around 1740 to the present. Although there has been research into the presence of music from these countries in Europe, the processes and mechanisms that established such connections are less clear. The transmission and development of musical cultures across oceans by seafarers, travellers, and free and forced migrants is clearly an area ripe for further study. This project will focus specifically on the circumstances of the ship - which literally transports music and musicians across the Atlantic - and the sailortown - the diverse and ever-changing port communities where sailors from all over the world interact, including through music-making.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious subjects of study are the sea-songs devised to aid the hard physical labour of work on sailing ships but which also often emerged from experiences on shore, with many recalling the dangers and pleasures of life in port. Beyond these work songs, music has played various roles both on board ship and in port and has also been vital in disseminating ideas about seafaring to the wider publics, particularly in popular song. Musical traditions and musical instruments have been transported across the Atlantic and have subsequently impacted on music-making in ports and beyond. In modern times, music has provided entertainment for leisure travellers and has contributed to the regeneration of sailortowns as contemporary tourist destinations. We believe that the study of music on ships and in sailortowns informs not only our understanding of historical seafaring practices; but also provides a lens through which the nature of cross-cultural encounters and fusions, many of which pre-date mass immigration into Britain and our resultant multicultural society, can be examined.\n\nThe overall aim of the project is to develop a better understanding of music in Atlantic World encounters. This will be accomplished primarily through a series of networking events involving academics, particularly those with interests in music and history but also those involved in the study of museums, heritage and tourism, and other interested parties including stakeholders in museums and tourism as well as musicians, film-makers and journalists and the wider public. International keynote speakers will be invited to address each event and the attendance of new researchers and research students will be supported by bursaries. Events will be held in different locations which are relevant to the project (London, Cardiff, Falmouth and Liverpool) and each will include a public lecture and performance. In addition to the events, the project website will include a blog, audio/audio-visual recordings of papers and specially made podcasts, and invite interaction and discussion. The website will provide links to existing relevant online resources for research and education in a variety of contexts and levels. \n\nThe intention of the project is to build relationships which will lead to further collaborations, both within the academic community, especially between disciplines, and between scholars and those from outside academia. We are aiming to create a network which will be equally beneficial to all these groups, particularly to provide opportunities for the public dissemination of academic research. The project will provide opportunities for people to learn about the transatlantic impact on their local heritage and for them to make valuable contributions to the network's discussions. Local musicians will present musical performances and contribute to academic debate. The project will encourage research that can be put to practical use, for example working in collaboration with historic venues to inform their use of music as living heritage.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J012505/1","grantId":"AH/J012505/1","fundValue":"29611","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project has provided opportunities for people to learn about the transatlantic impact on their local heritage and for them to make valuable contributions to the network's discussions.

The project has built relationships both within the academic community, especially between disciplines, and between scholars and those from outside academia. Specifically, through a series of four events in 2013-2014 the project has\n\n- facilitated interdisciplinary networking between academics, particularly musicologists and historians but also those from museum studies, heritage and tourism\n\n- facilitated international networking, particularly through inviting international keynote speakers to each event\n\n- encouraged new researchers and research students to disseminate their work within a supportive atmosphere, particularly through panel discussions on research methods and bursaries for attendance at the project's International conference\n\n- connected academic research with the public through the involvement of stakeholders in museums and tourism as well as musicians, film-makers and journalists, and, of course, the wider public themselves, through lectures and performances. The project has built relationships which have led to further research and creative collaborations. In particular, the project has fostered relationships between academics and professionals working in areas such as museums, tourism, education and heritage preservation. To support this into the future, our website documents participants and the network's events, which are also made accessible through podcasts. The website also provides a database of online resources for anyone interested in the topic.
