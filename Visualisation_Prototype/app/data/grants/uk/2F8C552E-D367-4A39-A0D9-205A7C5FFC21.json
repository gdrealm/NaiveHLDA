{"id":"2F8C552E-D367-4A39-A0D9-205A7C5FFC21","title":"Pathways to History: researching footpaths and 'green lanes' in Norfolk","abstractText":"Considering the amount of use and attention they receive from the general public, minor rights of way, public footpaths and 'green lanes' remain remarkably under-researched by academics. Recent initiatives by Natural England have emphasized the importance of green lanes as habitats, which has led to some surveying and recording by local naturalist groups, including the Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists Society. But the history of these features has received little attention, and that of public footpaths virtually none. \n\nPathways to History aims to encourage local communities to research and record the public rights of way (PROW) within their own particular area. Communities would be supported by training sessions delivered by landscape historians from the School of History and our partner organisations. Training in the use of oral history will also be offered, so that participants can effectively record reminiscences about the use of particular routes in the past, lost names for lanes, and local stories and traditions attached to them. In addition, communities will be strongly encouraged to undertake fieldwork to record the physical features of PROW. Participating groups would then be encouraged to upload the results of their research directly onto the project website, which would be designed and maintained by the University, and publicised with the assistance of our project partners. We would also organise a number of guided public walks, each hosted by one of the local groups involved, where they would be able to communicate their findings directly to a wider audience. In addition, the research team will produce three articles presenting the overall results of the project to an academic audience.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007742/1","grantId":"AH/K007742/1","fundValue":"45280","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  A key part of the Pathways project has been the training of volunteers in both fieldwork and archival research - 300 people across Norfolk have attended training sessions run by the project team. The dataset created by the volunteers, in collaboration with the project team, has been used for a variety of purposes, including evidence in footpath disputes and exhibitions, events and guided walks organised by local communities. Throughout the project has encouraged people to explore the countryside on foot by using public rights of ways, enhancing quality of life by promoting countryside access and the benefits of walking for health. The dataset produced during the project will become freely accessible online in 2014, enabling local parish councils to use the findings of the project to support their own research and work into maintaining and managing the modern public rights of way network.

This includes new evidence about their physical character and their historical ecology, as well as an analysis of their legal status and history on historic maps and other archival sources. This dataset, linked to GIS mapping, has led to new conclusions on the history and distribution of public rights of way in Norfolk. The dataset was created through the involvement of volunteers who received training from the project team in carrying out both fieldwork and archival research, based on a clear methodology developed as part of the project which could be used elsewhere in the future. In effect, this has created an enthusiastic volunteer network across Norfolk which could be further developed in the future. The dataset will be made available freely online during 2014, representing a significant new resource for researchers, policymakers and members of the public who are interested in managing the modern public rights of ways network. The findings of the project can be taken forward in a number of ways. Within academia, the dataset produced has opened up a range of research questions about the archaeology and history of public rights of way, particularly the history of their legal status. Outside academia, it could be developed by local authorities and local parish councils investigating the history and distribution of the modern public rights of way network, including evidence for disputes over public rights of way. Members of the public and local community groups (including parish councils) can utilise the data already generated, and can also make use of the methodology for surveying public rights of way in their own parish (a methodology which could be applied anywhere in the UK).
