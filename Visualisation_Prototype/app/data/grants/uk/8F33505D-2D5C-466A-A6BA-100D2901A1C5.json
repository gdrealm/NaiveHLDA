In a typical learning task an event is followed by an outcome, and the animal comes to learn that the event predicts the outcome. Associative theory explains this by saying that the mental representations of the two events become linked, so that presentation of the first can elicit the thought of the second - and this theory can explain how animals selectively encode the predictive relationships between events that are causally related, rather than those that co-occur by chance. But despite its explanatory power, associative theory cannot explain how, at the same time, the animal also learns when the outcome will occur (timing), and theories of timing have developed independently. It would clearly be simpler to have one theory to account for both forms of learning, and attempts to develop a unified model have been made by timing theorists. However, the resultant models are seriously flawed, because they are unable explain how animals can track causality. For this reason it would be better if associative models could be adapted to explain timing. This is the aim of the current proposal. One reason associative theories cannot explain timing is because they do not specify how to represent the temporal properties of an event, such as its duration. In associative terms, a stimulus is viewed as consisting of different mental elements, corresponding to its various physical characteristics (such as brightness, pitch or volume), and each stimulus element can enter into associations. The overall aim of this proposal is to test a new hypothesis, that time can also be conceptualised as a stimulus element. It will do so by asking three, more specific questions. First, can these postulated temporal stimulus elements gain associative strength, just like more orthodox stimulus elements? Second, do they show evidence of changes in associability - another property of a stimulus which, according to associative theory, mediates the effect of experience on the ease with which the stimulus can condition? Third, l will examine a process known as perceptual learning, in which exposure to two stimulus enhances the ease with which they can be told apart, and depends on the number of elements the two stimuli share. If my hypothesis is correct, then the temporal features of the stimuli can also produce these perceptual learning effects. These experiments should allow us to evaluate whether associative theory can conceptualise time as another stimulus element, in the way I have suggested. If it can, then this could form the basis of a modified associative theory that can also explain timing effects. This work has implications at a number of levels. The outcome will allow us to assess the extent to which an associative account of timing effects is feasible, and so be of direct relevance to all those interested in learning. It will also have implications for the many aspects of psychology that rely on learning theories, and as well as for areas outside psychology - for example, the study of learning in artificial agents uses models very similar to those used in psychology. Data generated by the experiments proposed should thus be of use to those developing theories of machine learning. The work also has significant clinical implications, as timing abnormalities are heavily implicated in several conditions, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. As the work described in this proposal aims at a more complete understanding of the nature of timing, this will aid interpretation of the symptoms of such diseases, and so increase the sophistication of the animal models used to model the cognitive deficits they produce. This will directly inform attempts to identify their neural basis, and to develop treatments, as well as suggesting potential cognitive tests for earlier diagnosis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H008160/1","grantId":"BB/H008160/1","fundValue":"356307","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Domhnall John Jennings","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
