The centre's primary role is to organise research workshops in mathematics and related areas of science and to involve users from other sciences and industry in these activities.\n\nIn the 20 years since it was founded the centre has established a superb reputation for hosting well-organised meetings at the highest scientific level on the most important and innovative topics in the mathematical sciences. Proposed meetings are subjected to a rigorous reviewing process by referees of international standing and selected only if they are of very high quality. In any 2 or 3 year period, ICMS workshops cover an unusually broad and exciting range of topics.\n\nThe centre monitors quality through participant questionnaires, workshop reports that are assessed by the programme committee and is introducing follow up questionnaires asking participants to list collaborations and other research outcomes generated by meetings.\n\nThe centre has a dedicated knowledge transfer officer whose job is to identify potential users of new mathematical ideas from outside the academic community and to stage events (either in connection with research workshops or independently) to involve those users. Some 50 of the world's largest companies have sent representatives to ICMS meetings in the last 3 years, covering healthcare, the oil industry, the financial industry, defence, engine manufacture and computing.\n\nICMS also runs a research-in-groups programme to enable small groups of researchers to work together for a short period of intensive collaboration. It provides a particularly cost effective way of promoting international collaborations by UK scientists.\n\nResearch workshops play a particularly crucial role in the development of mathematics. Important research collaborations often begin at such meetings and early career researchers gain a significant part of their training at workshops and conferences. ICMS events have attracted many of the world's leading mathematicians to Britain and have involved many of the world leaders who work here. Younger prticipants, many of whom will later move into industry, also have a chance to make industrial contacts at these meetings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J018074/1","grantId":"EP/J018074/1","fundValue":"1629560","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Knowledge transfer activities at ICMS have engaged many scientists, engineers and industrialists from a variety of sectors.

Since 1990 the centre has established a superb reputation for hosting efficiently managed workshops at the highest scientific level covering a very broad range of mathematical topics. In recent years ICMS has seen a steady increase in the number of interdisciplinary proposals aimed at applications of mathematics in other fields; workshops have been hosted which combine mathematics with biology, physics, computer science, environmental science, geology and medicine.\n\nMany - but not all - these workshops have been supported to some extent by grants from EPSRC. Initially these were individual grants to workshop organisers, but since 2004 ICMS has held grants in its own right, and carried out peer-review of workshop proposals through an international Programme Committee made up of leading mathematicians. This is the final report on the second of these grants, which ran from 2008 to 2012. The grant was supplemented by infrastructure support from the Scottish Funding Council and from the two host universities, Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt.\n\nThe principal objectives of ICMS include: the promotion of research in the mathematical sciences in the UK and worldwide; the organisation of workshops of high scientific quality, especially in exciting new areas of mathematics and its applications; and the engagement of the public with scientific activity through public lectures, films and visits to schools. These objectives have been decisively furthered during the grant period. Led by two very active Scientific Directors (Professor John Toland was succeeded in 2010 by Professor Keith Ball), the centre has built on its existing strengths and expanded its activities. This was helped by a move to larger premises, with more useable lecture space, early in 2010, and enhanced facilities enabled by an additional equipment grant from EPSRC. The established infrastructure of the centre now also enables it to provide national expertise for arranging possible bilateral and other research meetings.\n\nThe centre hosted a total of 43 (against its commitment to 42) EPSRC workshops during the grant period, with a total of 2481 delegates. The centre was able to surpass its commitment largely thanks to visitors' use of their own funds for travel. Owing to the broad range of topics, there is little overlap between attendees at different workshops, so the 4 year grant will have benefited some 2000 scientists. Of these, 34% were based in the UK; and another 30% in the rest of Europe. Research workshops play a crucial role in the academic development of young mathematical scientists: 35% of delegates were under 35 years of age. 14% of delegates were female: higher than the proportion of women among UK mathematicians.\n\nDelegate feed-back is very positive: follow-up questionnaire responses from the 2011 workshops indicate that over half the UK delegates started new collaborations as a result of the workshops.\n\nIn addition to the workshop programme, the EPSRC grant is used in support of the ICMS Research in Groups (RiGs) programme, initiated in 2008 at the start of the grant period. This enables small groups of researchers to get together in Edinburgh for extended periods of collaboration. RiGs funding is supplemented by additional support from the Edinburgh Mathematical Society and by the Glasgow Mathematical Journal Trust. It has proved extremely popular and successful. \n\nThe centre's dedicated part-time knowledge transfer officer has been very successful in securing the involvement of commercial and industrial participants at interdisciplinary workshops, and in enhancing the centre's public engagement activity via public lectures and school activities by workshop speakers. ICMS workshops cover a diverse range of mathematical topics, including applications to multiple branches of science and technology. Delegate feedback indicates that many new research connections are made, and new collaborations started, at ICMS workshops.
