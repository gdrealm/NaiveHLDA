These patterns are imprinted on the observed radiation by events that occurred very early in the Universe's history and by the structure of our own Milky Way galaxy. So the mathematical properties of the maps can tell us a lot about the evolution of the Universe and our local neighbourhood: but first we have to separate the foreground of the Milky Way from the cosmic background. The randomness in the Milky Way emission arises from turbulence in the interstellar gas and associated tangling of the magnetic fields which pervade the space between stars. Cosmic rays (electrons travelling at close to the speed of light) spiral around the magnetic field lines and produce radio waves that are detected by satellite and ground based telescopes: in order to understand the data we need to relate the two-dimensional observations to the three-dimensional properties of the region from which they come. Part of our research plan is to develop new methods of analysing the observed maps in order to learn about the gas, magnetic field and cosmic rays in our Galaxy, particularly how these components fit together, and what we can learn about the ubiquitous turbulence that is characteristic of most astrophysical flows. From the cosmological perspective, the random patterns can be used to study the theory of inflation: the process that caused the Universe to rapidly expand shortly after the big bang. Two satellites, WMAP and the forthcoming PLANCK mission, provide data that will open a new window on the story of how our Universe evolved and on some of the most interesting problems of fundamental physics. We will be comparing the new observations with the predictions of different theoretical models of inflation. The astrophysical and cosmological aspects of our research are closely linked and we will be inviting international experts, both astronomers and theorists, to Newcastle to help us to make progress. Magnetic fields are present in nearly all astronomical objects, from stars and planets to the furthest reaches of intergalactic space. As well as the turbulent, tangled magnetic field already mentioned interstellar magnetic fields have a component that is arranged in enormous spiral patterns, on scales comparable to a whole galaxy. Our work leads us to ask where these fields come from and how they came to be organised on such large scales: the theory of astrophysical dynamos provides the most promising explanation. As part of this research project we will be developing models of galactic dynamo action, identifying signatures of a dynamo at work that can be observed and comparing the results with maps obtained by radio astronomers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F003080/1","grantId":"ST/F003080/1","fundValue":"8439","fundStart":"2008-06-08","fundEnd":"2011-06-07","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Results have been used in public lectures and outreach events.

Work initiated by these visits has to date resulted in a total of 15 publications.\nA major achievement is the first application of a new technique, called Rotation measure (RM) synthesis, to the radio emission of the Milky Way. RM-synthesis takes advantage of the large bandwidth and narrow spectral channels that can be achieved in modern radio telescope receivers to make very precise measurements of Faraday rotation and is widely expected to lead to significant improvements in our knowledge of Galactic and extra-galactic magnetic fields, but much remains to be done to refine the technique. Our results, the first scientific output of the international Galactic Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey, show that much of the large-scale structure in the Faraday rotation sky, which was previously thought to reflect the global pattern of the Milky Way magnetic field, is actually due to local magnetic structures swept up by stellar winds and supernovae.\nA detailed analysis of multi-frequency radio observations of the Whirlpool galaxy, M51, showed that most of the polarised emission is related to anisotropic turbulent magnetic fields, rather than large-scale mean fields as previously thought. The anisotropy of the small-scale magnetic field is the result of shear due to differential rotation and the compression and subsequent expansion of random fields in the spiral arms. This result has significant implications for the interpretation of observations of other galaxies and is the most detailed, observationally based, study of the effect of galactic spiral arms on magnetic fields to-date.\nWe have developed a new dynamo model for the Andromeda galaxy, allowing for the non-linear evolution of the alpha- effect (a property of the interstellar turbulence that allows one of the components of the magnetic field to be generated) due to a systematic outflow from the disc, that uses the observed galactic rotation, gas density distribution and star formation rate as input parameters. Not only does this model provide the best match yet between the observed and predicted regular magnetic field pattern for a galaxy, it also shows that the non-linear saturation of the dynamo is more complicated than previously thought.\nWe have begun a new research programme exploring how galactic magnetic fields have evolved since the epoch of galaxy formation. Using velocity fields derived from numerical simulations of evolving galaxies we can study whether dynamo action was likely at different stages in a galaxy's lifetime and also to make predictions about the observational signatures of these fields. This approach is a significant improvement on other studies of galactic magnetic field evolution, which are essentially based on order of magnitude estimates.\nNew numerical simulations of compressible convective MHD flows have successfully reproduced many of the observed features of the small-scale magnetic fields and convective motions that are observed in the Sun. These simulations do not result in any large-scale dynamo action, suggesting that rotating convection in an astrophysical body will not generate a large-scale magnetic field unless additional physical effects are also present. These results help to resolve a long-standing controversy among dynamo theoreticians and modellers.\nThe amplitude of density fluctuations in the CMB is sensitive to their origin: thermal or vacuum fluctuations linked to inflation. Results obtained at Newcastle have an amplitude many times that obtained by other groups and we have begun work on a full numerical treatment to resolve some of the controversy surrounding the consistency of models of 'warm' inflation.
