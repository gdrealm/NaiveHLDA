However, radiosondes and their aircraft-launched equivalents called &quot;dropsondes&quot; are limited to providing three or four basic measurements, including temperature, pressure, humidity and sometimes ozone concentration. Missing through lack of technical capability is any information on atmospheric particulates, such as aerosol or cloud particles. \n This project aims to develop, test and commercialize a modular, low-cost, atmospheric sonde for the characterization of cloud and aerosol particles, including volcanic ash. The module will be compatible with several widely used commercial sounding systems giving standard meteorological quantities, but will be complementary to them, as it will provide variables not yet routinely measurable. Initially, we will focus on the most basic property, that is particle size, but this can be extended in the future to particle shape. The sonde system will be deployable using meteorological balloons, manned aircraft or unmanned aerial vehicles. Therefore, it will allow accessing environments where direct measurements are not currently possible. Applications extend from weather prediction, through air quality monitoring, to civil contingencies, such as volcanic eruptions, as well as numerous uses in atmospheric research, including climate change, extreme weather events or the validation of satellite remote-sensing measurements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L002809/1","grantId":"NE/L002809/1","fundValue":"99024","fundStart":"2014-03-28","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The sondes developed during the project have not yet been used widely, but we anticipate that they will be in the future.

The sonde will also be capable of being launched on a meteorological balloon. We expect that the sondes will be used by atmospheric scientists and meteorological services worldwide.
