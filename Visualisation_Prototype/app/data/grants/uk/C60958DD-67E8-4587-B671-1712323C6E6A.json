Specifically, the interest is in contracts that insure that a treatment is provided only if needed, and only by the right expert.</p>\n\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, the only paper that studies this type of problem is Fong (2007). Indeed, the approach here is very much like the one suggested in Fong (2007), but differs in one important aspect: here the designer is allowed to use money to help create the right incentives for health care providers. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the recent call from the Institute of Medicine for government payers to increase payments to health care providers who deliver high-quality care is one of several signs that practicing doctors can expect some fundamental changes in the way they are compensated. With this in mind, it is surprising that so little has been done and so little is known about the nature of optimal contracts for providers of credence services like medical treatment. This proposal is an attempt to make some progress in this direction.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G045704/1","grantId":"ES/G045704/1","fundValue":"80639","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Motty Motty Perry","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
