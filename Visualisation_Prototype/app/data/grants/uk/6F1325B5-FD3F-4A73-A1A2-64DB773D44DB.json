{"id":"6F1325B5-FD3F-4A73-A1A2-64DB773D44DB","title":"DYVERSE: A New Kind of Control for Hybrid Systems","abstractText":"It might be as simple as jumping on a trampoline, or as sophisticated as the docking of vehicles in outer space; as trivial as playing billiards, or as crucial as maintaining the stability of an airplane during landing; as random as the flow of information in a communication network, or as synchronised as a school of fish swimming in the sea. These are examples of systems that combine continuous and discrete, smooth and abrupt dynamics. In dynamical systems theory, this is called discontinuity or switching behaviour. The systems exhibiting it are called discontinuous, switched, non-smooth or discrete-event systems. Their combined dynamics can be seen as a hybrid dynamical system.What makes the behaviour of hybrid systems so complex? Where does the unpredictable behaviour of these systems come from: from the system itself, or from its environment? Every mathematical model is an approximation of the real world, and is full of limitations. However, some models are better than others at describing the evolution of certain physical and engineering systems. DYVERSE proposes a fresh perspective within the hybrid systems framework, and will provide new insights into the modelling, analysis and control of systems with switching dynamics. Due to the discontinuous changes in states, hybrid systems entail complex behaviours not present in systems that are purely discrete or continuous. These 'complex behaviours' usually lead to faults or dynamics degrading performance. Chaos or mechanical vibrations are examples of these kinds of negative dynamics. Complex behaviours usually have their origin in what in mathematical terms is known as a bifurcation. That is, the point which marks a change. The challenge is to ensure through design that devices behave correctly, eliminating all negative behaviour. The process of checking in an automated way that a system behaves correctly is called 'formal verification' in the theory of computer science; the elimination of negative behaviours falls into the field of control engineering. DYVERSE brings together computer science formal methods, dynamical systems analysis and control engineering methodologies. The research mixes theory and practice and crosses different application domains, which is why the project is quite literally diverse.There has been great success in applying formal verification methods to validate dynamical properties in particular classes of discontinuous systems. However, it is still a challenge to give satisfactory solutions for the verification of complex dynamical behaviours of discontinuous systems, as DYVERSE proposes. One of the main obstacles has been the difficulty of obtaining a computational representation of these complex dynamical properties. Consideration of the changes of the energy of the system is the answer to this problem. But DYVERSE is not only about formal verification: DYVERSE will use the verification results to modify and improve the system behaviour. Furthermore, it will bring new theory into practice.An integral part of the project is that the theoretical results will be experimentally validated in a prototype: a system with impacts and friction. A system with impacts and friction is a discontinuous system because it evolves smoothly until an event (impact/friction) triggers changes in the velocities or position.DYVERSE goes beyond this immediate proposal. It is a long-term research to extend the theoretical results on analysis and control of hybrid systems to complex networks and distributed systems, covering multiple emerging applications from electromechanical systems to transportation and electrical power distribution networks, and from high-confidence healthcare to national security.

Our results have been in 4 main directions: 1) computational reinterpretation of complex dynamical behaviours, 2) formal verification, 3) control synthesis and dynamical analysis, and 4) expansion of DYVERSE findings to complex network systems. Details are given below.\n\n1. Discrete abstraction and computational reinterpretation of complex dynamical behaviours of hybrid systems: we have rewritten in discrete computer science terms - logics, automata - dynamical behaviours like stability patterns and oscillatory dynamical behaviours. In particular:\n\n 1.1 Dynamical behaviours and stability patterns have been specified by means of formal languages plus the evolution of the stored and supplied energies of the system. Specifically, systems are modelled by hybrid automata, and omega-languages - that is, infinite word languages - have been used.\n\n 1.2 We have proposed a framework to define liveness properties - something good will eventually happen - for hybrid dynamical systems, something that has never been attempted before.\n\n 1.3 We have designed algorithms to produce discrete abstractions of continuous-time dynamical systems and a class of hybrid dynamical systems by using timed automata. \n\n 1.4 Since liveness properties are complex to verify, we have defined a framework to disprove them. For this purpose, we have proposed a dynamically-aware property which can disprove such liveness properties. We call this property deadness: a concept related to dead states in automata theory. We have shown how important this property can be for proving inevitability properties. An inevitability property says that a region of the state space will eventually be reached: this is a type of liveness property from the computer science viewpoint, and is related to attractivity of sets in dynamical systems.\n\n 1.5 We have developed a tool (Dyverse Rigid Body Toolbox, DyverseRBT) to generate automatically a general-purpose transition system for the description of mechanical systems subject to multiple impacts with friction. For this, we have proposed a new class of hybrid automata - which include non-dynamical discrete locations and computation nodes - to abstract and simulate mechanical systems with multiple impacts and friction.\n\n2. Formal verification. That is, to check in a automated way that the system is free of undesirable oscillations and instabilities, and meets the design specifications. We have 3 groups of results:\n\n\n 2.1 To check in an automated way that liveness properties are held in dynamical systems and hybrid systems. This is related to the automated proof of some types of stability patterns in dynamical systems. We have developed two main methods:\n\n - We have designed a model checking-based methodology which uses a discrete abstraction of the system based on timed automata. We have developed two software tools for this purpose: the proveByTA Toolbox and the PWproveByTA package. They have been designed for some classes of continuous-time systems and piecewise linear systems (with no resets), and they are available at http://staff.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~navarroe/research/dyverse/liveness/\n\n - We have implemented a dynamically-aware verification algorithm to prove inevitability properties in general hybrid dynamical systems modelled as nonlinear hybrid automata. A distinctive characteristic is that we do not require a discrete abstraction of either the system dynamics or the state space - hence, we can treat hybrid automata with any type of continuous dynamics within the discrete locations. The novel idea of our methodology is that the verification procedure is guided by stability-like properties of the equilibria present in the system. This approach uses the idea of deadness. We have developed a toolbox called DeadRegions that creates a dead region on a hybrid automaton for a given inevitability property of reaching some desired live region. It is available at \nhttp://staff.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~navarroe/research/dyverse/liveness/\n\n 2.2 Application-oriented. To check in an automated way that safety properties are held in complex real-world hybrid dynamical systems. Particularly, mechanical systems subject to multiple impacts and friction. For this purpose, we have developed novel bounded-model-checking verification techniques which are based on a lazy SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) approach and optimisation techniques. These techniques are integrated in a software tool called DyverseBMC (Bounded Model Checker).\n\n 2.3 In collaboration with the Computer Lab in Cambridge. We have attempted to use the automated theorem prover MetiTarski as a dynamical analyser. We are integrating the use of this powerful theorem prover to analyse some dynamical properties of dynamical systems. Our ambition is to extend MetiTarski to be used with hybrid systems; currently, it can be only used to analyse some types of smooth dynamical systems, with no discontinuities.\n\n3. Control synthesis and dynamical analysis. A key finding of DYVERSE is that for controlling and analysing complex systems, formal verification tools are not enough. It is necessary to combine formal verification techniques with control engineering techniques and dynamical-analysis tools to analyse complex hybrid systems. Our key contribution is the use of stability and energy properties of the system (dissipativity theory) to guide the validity of the process. The powerful, energy-related properties of dissipativity and passivity have been overlooked in the analysis and control of hybrid systems, and have been especially underused in the computational-oriented modelling framework of hybrid automata. One of our key results is that we have redefined dissipativity-related properties in hybrid automata, and have also given new stability definitions for hybrid automata containing multiple isolated equilibrium points.\n\n\n4. Expansion of DYVERSE findings to complex network systems, especially to systems biology and other applications of life sciences. This is one of the most remarkable outcomes of DYVERSE with great potential for future applications. I highlight the strong branch of DYVERSE in computational neuroscience, called Neuro-DYVERSE. The results related to DyverseRBT can be used in automation systems - for example, robotic manipulators subject to impacts and friction - with potential impact in the manufacturing industry.\n\nWith our work related to DyverseRBT, we may also have an impact in the simulation industry. A potential user of this technology is MathWorks Inc. We will explore collaborating with them.\n\nThe new direction of DYVERSE related to complex network systems has the potential to impact healthcare.\n\nThe Naval Engineering School of Madrid has expressed an interest in applying the results of DYVERSE to one of its flagship projects related to marine renewable energy and involving several strong energy European companies.\n\nThe results of DYVERSE have potential to be applied in the verification and control of power management of multi-core real-time embedded devices. A potential user would be ARM Ltd.\n\nThe new applications of DYVERSE in biodiversity and ecology might have an impact in climate change in the future. \n\nThe types of systems that we have been studying in DYVERSE are extremely complex, full of discontinuities and complex unexpected behaviours and transitions. In order to ensure the accessibility of our results for the scientific community and industry, our research has been guided and motivated by real-world systems. Our ambition of delivering novel and applicable theory in several domains has been achieved.\n\n\nDYVERSE has been the first funded project in the UK dedicated explicitly to the control and formal verification of complex and real-world hybrid dynamical systems. As an EPSRC 2-year First Grant, the research produced within the framework of this project has been put to use through many different manners and has facilitated a perfect platform to strengthened Navarro-Lopez's international standing in hybrid systems, and in the control and verification of complex systems in general. The most outstanding exploitation of DYVERSE ideas is that Navarro is generating a new branch of computational neuroscience (hybrid systems neuroscience) by means of her new framework Neuro-DYVERSE (EPSRC proposal submitted in 2012). Moreover, in collaboration with biologists and ecologists, the results produced in DYVERSE are being applied to study the evolution of sexual imprinting behaviour in animals. Currently, Navarro is writing another research proposal related to the power management of multi-core real-time embedded devices, which will use the DYVERSE modelling, verification and control framework.\n\nBelow, a list of some of the most remarkable achievements of DYVERSE is given. We also give more examples of how the results of DYVERSE have been exploited, and how thanks to this grant, the profile and international standing of its PI have been boosted.\n\n\n1.
