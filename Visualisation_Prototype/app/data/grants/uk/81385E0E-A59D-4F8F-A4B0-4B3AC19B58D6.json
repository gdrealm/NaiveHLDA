This focus on online entrepreneurship accords well with the unique strengths of the Open University in providing its teaching and learning online. It also allows colleagues from outside the field of entrepreneurship, such as those with a background in information systems and e-business, to work collaboratively with those with expertise in entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p>BIS (UK Government Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) (2012) - <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/enterprise-and-business-support/entrepreneurial-culture/make-business-your-business\" rel=\"nofollow\">Make Business Your Business: A Report on Small Business Start Ups</a></p>\n&nbsp;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002701/1","grantId":"ES/L002701/1","fundValue":"50609","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings will be of interest and value to those teaching entrepreneurship and new business formation. Such modules are often very popular across all levels of study (undergraduate, postgraduate and executive education). The findings of this study provide new understanding and insights that are being incorporated into such modules. On the other hand, some of the organisations that represent and advise ethnic entrepreneurs find our research interesting and that some of our findings are either new or different to their experiences.

We found that home based businesses have certain challenging demands, such as engendering feelings of isolation. Online home based businesses can provide entrepreneurial opportunities to groups and individuals who may be otherwise excluded. Online home based businesses could offer additional opportunities to extant home based entrepreneurs in developing countries or allow others to benefit from such opportunities. \n\nOnline home based businesses offer opportunities for ethnic entrepreneurs to leverage existing skills or experience. These businesses of course provide opportunity for entrepreneurs with IT skills but they also offer opportunity to individuals without IT skill to leverage other skills such as accountancy, dress and jewellery design. We also discussed about entrepreneur visas which attract individuals from outside Europe, who can contribute to social and economic development of UK. Our study shows that the unique characteristics of online home based businesses can allow individuals with drive and creativity, but without formal qualification, to operate entrepreneurial businesses, suggesting policy should find ways of moving beyond the emphasis on formal qualification for the allocation of visa. \n\nWe also explored the role of space and place in the operation of online home based businesses which suggested that each entrepreneur would find their own balance on the type of their business and personal and family circumstances, and this may vary over time. We also suggested that many online home-based entrepreneurs operate in a middle-state between the dichotomous extremes of location dependent or independent, which we refer to as ‘tethered’. In such a mode the business has a primary location, but the entrepreneur can operate from other locations for appropriate periods. This research provides evidence of online home based entrepreneurs founding and operating new and innovative digital businesses which will be of direct value to the formulation of evidence based policy.\n\nThis research can also be used by online home based business entrepreneurs or the ones who are thinking of developing such businesses to know about the experiences of other online home based business entrepreneurs and their businesses. \n\nThis research can be extended and used to further develop online adult learning programmes such as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) which are very popular these days.
