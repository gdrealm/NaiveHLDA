{"id":"4127659A-B775-4762-9380-CEC28A9BA0F8","title":"Risk Based Performance Forecast of Flood Defences Affected by Changing Environments","abstractText":"Flooding is a growing problem in the UK and causes extensive damage to infrastructure, homes and business. Recently, the problem was highlighted again due to severe flooding in 2013/14 winter, causing total economic losses of over &pound;1 billion. Earth dykes, used as major flood defence structures in the UK, can fail in extreme events, as evidenced by the numerous breaches along earth embankments during the December 2013 East Coast surge event. Earth dykes even become more vulnerable due to changing operation conditions caused by climate change.\n\nThe project addresses strategic issues associated with changing environments and deteriorating flood defence systems at a UK national level, which have been identified by HR Wallingford and the Environment Agency. The outcomes of the project will contribute towards developing next generation risk based performance evaluation and prediction methodology for reducing flood risk, improving resilience of flood defences to changing environments, and determining optimum maintenance strategies. The methods developed in this research will be implemented into flood risk management framework through HR Wallingford who currently lead the technical development of the flood risk assessment methodology used by the Environment Agency.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M008487/1","grantId":"NE/M008487/1","fundValue":"43942","fundStart":"2014-10-31","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Hua-Peng  Chen","coPersons":["Jonathan David Simm"],"organisation":"University of Greenwich","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
