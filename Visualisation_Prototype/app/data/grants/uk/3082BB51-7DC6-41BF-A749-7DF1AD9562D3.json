{"id":"3082BB51-7DC6-41BF-A749-7DF1AD9562D3","title":"Scale-free olfactory-driven foraging","abstractText":"Scent plumes form when the wind disperses scent molecules from their source. Many species of insects can follow scent plumes to their sources to find mates or distant resources. The pheromones of many important pest species and semiochemicals that mediate such insect behaviour have now been identified, synthesized, and formulated for use in pest-management schemes and are used widely in traps for population monitoring. However, despite considerable research semiochemicals have not been universally successful in these applications. This is, in part, because the detailed understanding of scent dispersal which underlies the inter-play between sources and distributions of scent, atmospheric conditions and pest behaviour responses remains largely unknown. This proposal will address this shortcoming by formulating and validate new mathematical models for the scent concentration experienced by insects flying within scent plumes. This is a considerable challenege because scent concentrations exhibit a complex, chaotically evolving structure over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. Indeed, fluctuations in scent concentrations are amongst the most extreme form of flcutuations found in Nature. These new mathematical models of scent concentration will be combined with models of insect response and used to predict insect movement patterns. It is hypothesised that the observed complexity of insect foraging patterns arises from naive insect responses to the complex patterns in scent concentrations. This constrasts with the widely held notion that the complex behaviour of insects has, through the process of evolution, resulted in optimal or advantageous searching strategies. The model will then be used in parallel with future experimentation to provide a better understanding of other aspects of chemical ecology and pest-management. The model could, for example, be used to assess the extent to which the individual components of attractive pheromones and other semiochemicals can mediate the earliest behaviours in source location, such as locking onto a plume, and later behaviours, such as landing or courtship. The model could also be used to determine the effective extent of traps and relate trap counts to densities of airborne population--a problem of considerable practical importance for population monitoring because trap counts often do not corelate well densities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D007453/1","grantId":"BB/D007453/1","fundValue":"114715","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used and cited by researchers across the world.
