During the 1990s, the collapse of several ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula region were witnessed. While the much colder ice shelves of East Antarctica are thought to be presently safe from such dramatic destruction, little is known about their present rate of change. This study focusses on the largest ice shelf in East Antarctica, the Amery Ice Shelf (AIS), which drains 16% of the grounded Antarctic continent. How has it changed during the past few decades? What is driving these changes? To answer this, we will compare surface elevation measurements on the northern AIS made during the 1960s with more recent elevation measurements using satellite technology, such as Global Positioning System (GPS). Together with an understanding of the ice shelf density, we will be able to determine the amount of ice mass gained/lost during this period and it will provide important indicators to the driving mechanisms behind any changes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/C000862/1","grantId":"NE/C000862/1","fundValue":"30849","fundStart":"2006-02-13","fundEnd":"2006-11-12","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"P  Moore","coPersons":["Matt  King"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
