It has long been suggested that patients with a history of viral infection together with smoking have increased chances of developing severe asthma. Unfortunately, the pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease are not fully understood. More research is needed to shed light on how asthma develops in some people and to provide new targets for the pharmaceutical industry.\nWe propose to investigate whether and to what extent we could use zebrafish as a model to help us understand some of the basic mechanisms and pathway biology of severe asthma in humans. Although zebrafish do not have lungs, their gills serve the same function and have the same overall tissue structure and cell types as human lungs: an epithelial cell layer that facilitates gaseous exchange and a variety of immune cells that defend the tissue from infection. A major advantage is that gills are directly exposed to ambient water, which makes them easily accessible to drugs (addition to the water rather than by injection) or for collection of biopsies. Further, we can easily access the gill tissue under brief anaesthesia to take small biopsies instead of using invasive procedures like bronchoalveolar lavage as performed in mouse studies, where a small tube is inserted through the mouth into the lungs and fluid is injected and retrieved for analysis. In fact, we can take small biopsies a number of times from the same animal in longitudinal studies, reducing the number of animals otherwise used and providing us with higher quality data by avoiding the inherent variability that exists between individuals. In addition, we have a number of fish in which specific immune cells are labeled with fluorescence. Using microscopy we will visualise, in live fish, the behaviour of these cells under different conditions including exposure to smoke and/or virus which will enable study of the same animal over time, again reducing the total number of animals used.\nThis project will be performed in collaboration with our clinical colleagues at St Mary's Hospital who have already developed a platform which allows analysis of nasal samples in human volunteers (smokers and non-smokers) to study the effect of viral infection combined with smoking on lung function. Their experience will be invaluable in helping us develop non-invasive sampling in zebrafish and to allow the comparison of results across the species to work towards the identification of new therapeutic targets for respiratory disease. We will then be in a position to directly test the effects of intervention in these putative pathways and/or molecules on gill function in the fish.\nKnowledge of fish husbandry, biology and behavior are essential for this project. Therefore, the work on zebrafish will be performed by one of our most experienced scientists who has been working in the field of zebrafish immunology for 5 years and who has already developed a number of the experimental procedures required for this proposal. This will minimise the time needed for training.\nDuring this year-long project we aim to first develop methods for non-invasive sampling of gill fluids and tissues. We will apply these methods more than once on the same animal allowing studies over time on the same animal to obtain high quality data using fewer animals. During the second part of the project we will analyse our experimental samples and study many events from when, where and what type of cells are recruited to which genes/pathways play a role in inflammation. The results collected will eventually be compared with those obtained in the parallel study in humans to enable us to identify molecules or cells that play a critical role in the initiation of severe asthma. We hope to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms of severe asthma in order to eventually develop successful treatments for this recalcitrant disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/M001512/1","grantId":"NC/M001512/1","fundValue":"98383","fundStart":"2015-03-31","fundEnd":"2016-03-30","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Margaret J Dallman","coPersons":["Trevor Thomas Hansel","Laurence  Bugeon"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
