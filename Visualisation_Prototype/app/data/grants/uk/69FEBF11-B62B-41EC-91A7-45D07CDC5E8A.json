{"id":"69FEBF11-B62B-41EC-91A7-45D07CDC5E8A","title":"Numerally Quantified NPs in Welsh: Syntax and Semantics","abstractText":"The proposed research explores the syntax and semantics of numeral constructions in Welsh, that is NPs modified by simple and complex numerals. Crosslinguistically, numeral constructions are relatively little explored and our investigation of Welsh numeral constructions will contribute to the wider understanding of numeral constructions. \\nWe will develop a fully explicit analysis of the syntax of the full array of numeral constructions in Welsh. Our analysis will be developed within a particular grammatical framework, that of Lexical Functional Grammar, and we will test the adequacy of our approach by integrating it within our existing computational grammar of Welsh. We will also carry out a detailed, empirically-based study of the semantics of numeral modification, focussing in particular the interpretations available when numerals occur coordinated nominals. Our preliminary work has suggested that there is a crosslinguistically unusual restriction in the interpretations available for such phrases in Welsh, and thus our work will make a contribution to our understanding of the semantics of the Welsh constructions whilst having wider relevance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E006868/1","grantId":"AH/E006868/1","fundValue":"159626","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Louisa  Sadler","coPersons":["Ingo  Mittendorf"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
