How this ‘self prioritisation’ comes about remains poorly understood however.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this project is to use a new procedure we have developed in order to understand how ‘self prioritisation’ affects basic perceptual processes. In our new procedure we can ‘tag’ a geometric shape with self relevance and we can then study how basic perceptual processing for that shape changes when compared with other matched shapes.</p>\n\n<p>In the project we will conduct a series of experiments that examine whether ‘self prioritisation’ affects spatial and temporal attention to stimuli. The research will provide a first-ever analysis of the effects of a ‘social’ variable (the self) on difference stages of perception.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K013424/1","grantId":"ES/K013424/1","fundValue":"306682","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Glyn  HumphreysJie  Sui","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
