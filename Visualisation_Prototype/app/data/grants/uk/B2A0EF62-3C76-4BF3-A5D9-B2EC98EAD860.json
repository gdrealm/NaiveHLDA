Independent of cell types, collective movement usually involves three factors: cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, polarization of cells into &quot;leaders&quot; and &quot;followers&quot;, and chemical and physical signals that allow cells to communicate with each other. There are multiple ways of cell movement, ranging from single cell movement to collective movement (where cells stay connected as they move).\n\nThe movement of single cells has been investigated quite in detail over the past decades, and the key aspects of single cell movement (e.g., molecular control of cell protrusions, interactions between cells and their substrate) have been already identified. However, the collective movement of cells is less understood, and there are many open questions regarding the mechanisms involved in this type of movement. For example, it is less understood how cell movement and cell-cell communication interact to create new tissues, or to allow cells to colonise specific areas. Another aspect less understood is how cells interpret and integrate signals from the environment and from other cells to produce specific types of cell aggregations and collective movement. Finally, it is still unknown whether all cells sense guidance signals, or only the leader cells sense these signals and then instruct other cells to follow them.\n\nTo formulate hypotheses that could help address these questions, we will derive a class of mechanistic mathematical models that describe cell movement and cell-cell interactions via different communication mechanisms. Using various mathematical techniques (e.g. travelling wave analysis, bifurcation analysis), we will investigate the role of different cell-cell communication mechanisms on the movement and structure of cell aggregations. We will also investigate the effect of parameters on the transitions between different types of cell movement behaviours.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K033689/1","grantId":"EP/K033689/1","fundValue":"94452","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  So far, my findings have generated more research questions in regard to understanding the transitions that occur (in some cases spontaneously) between different types of collective behaviours in cells or in animals.

","person":"Raluca  Eftimie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" The mathematical models used to describe collective behaviour of cells or animals, can exhibit complex spatial and spatio-temporal patterns (that result from nonlocal and nonlinear interactions between members of biological aggregations). My research has been used (so far) to classify some of the complex patterns that occur near bifurcation points (i.e., near parameter values for which the dynamics of the biological system changes), and to explain the mechanisms that lead to transitions between different patterns for biological aggregations. Moreover, the research generated new questions regarding the necessity of investigating more complex transitions between similar types of aggregation patterns (mathematical investigation of these transitions will allow us to gain a better understanding of the types of models used to describe cell-cell and animal-animal interactions via different communication mechanisms). These complex transitions will be investigated in the near future via a new collaboration with University of Bath. The fact that transitions between different complex spatial and spatio-temporal patterns in biological aggregations might not be always generated by changes in particular parameter values (that describe, for example, the speed of cells/animals) and might actually be intrinsic to the biological system (resulting from complex bifurcation dynamics), suggests that it might be difficult to control certain types of biological aggregations (e.g., the collective movement of cancer cells, or the collective movement of animals/humans). This further suggests the necessity of collaboration between mathematicians and experimentalists (or people in various sectors that might use mathematical models to predict the outcome of treatments for diseases involving cell migration, or to predict the outcome of human aggregations - e.g., for security purposes) to investigate thoroughly the possible dynamics exhibited by the mathematical models.
