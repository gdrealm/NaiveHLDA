New CATH methods will predict their functions. \n\nWhilst other resources do also predict function, CATH-Gene3D (referred to below as CATH) provides unique information on structurally conserved features linked to function. Structure data reveals how proteins perform their function and why the function changes if the protein is modified by mutations or other genetic variations. Protein function information is key to understanding biological systems and by extension drug design, protein engineering and disease.\n\nCATH is a world leading resource that classifies proteins evolved from the same ancestral protein, into evolutionary families. Currently, CATH classifies 15 million protein domains into 2600 families. Family data is valuable because evolutionary relatives (called homologues) tend to have similar 3D structures and perform similar functions. Thus the benefit of CATH is the ability to infer properties between homologues.\n\nThis is important because of the millions of proteins currently known (&gt;20 million) less than 5% have experimentally determined functions. Even in the organism of greatest interest to us, human, &lt;10% of proteins have known functions. Because it can be slow and very expensive to characterise proteins it will not be possible to experimentally study all these proteins. Therefore, biologists use CATH to predict the function of a protein based on the family to which it belongs.\n\nAnother fact is that proteins are made up of 'domains' - on average two per protein. These are independently folded entities that act together to confer the function of the whole protein. CATH classifies proteins at the level of the domain and currently classifies ~70% of domains found in nature. Domains are the building blocks of proteins - a few thousand of them are combined in different ways to give the 20 million proteins, or more, in nature. Our group develops methods for predicting domain functions. This allows functions of whole proteins to be deduced from the functions of their constitutive domains. Thus functions can be suggested for proteins made from any combination of domains.\n\nCATH uses information on the 3D structure of the domain to give more accurate family classifications, as structure is more highly conserved, during evolution, than the sequence. Even more important - structure can reveal how the protein performs its function and whether the protein loses its function if a mutation occurs at a particular site.\n\nWe will expand CATH by 100%. Since manual validation is very time consuming, we will develop better methods for automatically recognising distant homologues. We will continuously release data (CATH-B), prior to manual curation, so that biologists can benefit from the information much sooner.\n\nWe will collaborate with the other major structure classification SCOP to develop common classification strategies and provide complementary information on families.\n\nWe will improve the accuracy of functional inheritance across a family. We need to do this because in some families, especially those occurring more frequently in nature, the functions can change in some relatives.\n\nWe will improve accuracy by characterising important positions in the domain, conserved across functionally similar relatives. We can build patterns of these positions to recognise other domains sharing such patterns and likely to have similar functions.\n\nWe will make it easy for biologists to use our web search tool to determine if a protein belongs to one of these functional families. We will set this up on the Cloud so that biologists can quickly search CATH with the massive datasets they obtain using new sequencing technologies. These technologies capture proteins expressed under different conditions. Our web pages will report their functions and variations in the protein which could modify function causing disease","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K020013/1","grantId":"BB/K020013/1","fundValue":"612409","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The CATH-Gene3D classification is widely used by biologists and biomedical researchers to understand the structure and functions of query sequences.

In the ten months that the project has been running we have developed a new algorithm for recognising homologous domains based on a machine learning approach that combines information on protein sequences and protein structures. An improved method for functional sub-classification has also been developed which groups together relatives that have similar patterns of residue conservation indicative of common functional sites. This method was independently validated by the CAFA international function prediction assessment and came 2nd out of 101 methods for predicting biological process (4th for predicting molecular function). New CATH-Gene3D web-pages have been developed for showing the relationships between functional families within a superfamily. \n\nWe have also released a new version of CATH (version 4) and a beta version of CATH (CATH-B) which allows users to access a preliminary automatic classification of a newly-determined protein structure pending manual curation. The computational pipeline for automatically classifying relatives in CATH-B has been extended to allow this data to remain almost completely up to date with the deposition of new structures in the protein databank (PDB).\n\nIn collaborations with researchers working on Genome3D, we have progressed the mapping of domain structure families between the CATH and SCOP resources to facilitate more rapid annotation of sequences in InterPro with structural data from these resources. Improved mapping protocols have increased the number of superfamilies deemed to be equivalent in the two resources from 19% to 39%% (732 superfamilies). CATH-Gene3D is a member database in the widely accessed InterPro resource hosted at the EBI, which has more than 5 million webpage accesses per month. It is one of only two resources (out of 8 in InterPro) providing structural annotations and is therefore important for providing consensus information on predicted structural regions in protein sequences. The mapping between CATH and SCOP will therefore be very useful for InterPro researchers integrating the information on structural annotations.\n \nCATH classification data is valuable for a number of general activities undertaken by biologists/biomedical researchers:\n- assigning structures or functions to uncharacterised proteins (as mentioned above)\n- providing information on conserved and variable structural regions in domain families. This data is important information in drug design (ie for designing compounds that bind to proteins in pathogenic organisms but not in human).\n- the multiple alignment data in CATH is valuable for identifying highly conserved positions in a family and likely functional sites. This data is helpful in assessing the likely impacts of genetic variations, nsSNPs etc.\n- the up-to-date and comprehensive structural libraries provided by CATH are valuable for searching against to find structural analogs for a query structure that may represent cross-hits for a drug designed to bind to the query.
