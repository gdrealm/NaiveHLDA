{"id":"0A2B69F4-D153-4AAA-BE26-350E4BBE3D78","title":"Structural studies on the meningococcal Immunoglobulin A protease","abstractText":"Some strains of bacteria can escape our natural antibody response defences and cause serious diseases like meningitis and blood poisoning. We need to understand how the germs that cause these diseases can avoid our immune system and invade the bloodstream. We hope this work will ultimately lead to the creation of new therapies and vaccines for meningitis.\n\nSome of the more aggressive meningitis-causing bacteria fight our antibodies by secreting a substance called IgA1 protease. This substance chops up the antibodies into smaller fragments that are unable to attack the invading bacteria. The IgA1 protease also helps bacteria enter the bloodstream, triggering septicaemia, where it can target other blood components.\n\nThe IgA1 protease is a large, complex molecule able to interact with a number of host targets. We aim to determine its structure to try to understand how it is secreted. We are also studying how various parts of the IgA1 protease interact with blood components. This should help us understand how it contributes to the disease. We hope this work will lead to the development of new strategies to interfere with bacterial invaders producing IgA1 protease such as those causing meningitis and chronic chest infections (meningococci and Haemophilus influenzae) and gonorrhoea.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501730","grantId":"G0501730","fundValue":"299966","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Joseph Artymiuk","coPersons":["Jon Roland Sayers"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
