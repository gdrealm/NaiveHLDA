PathText2 reads SBML models and Celldesigner semantic types and maps reactions to textual bimolecular events. Utilises results of automatic event extraction, EventMine. Best performing system for pathway curation (BioNLP shared task, 2013). \nPathText2 is freely available at http://www.nactem.ac.uk/pathtext2\nIt supports manual curation of pathway models by automatically returning relevant literature. \nTools: EventMine for pathway curation. A domain adaptable event extraction text mining tool.\nAnnotated data for training (pathway curation shared task organised at BioNLP ACL 2013)\nAs part of the Garuda alliance led by Prof. Kitano (http://www.garuda-alliance.org) together with other leading research groups we support researchers with expertise in simulations, pathway visualisation, databases and analysis. The Garuda platform and gadgets have been presented by Prof. Kitano (leader of the Japanese team) in exhibitions and open days internationally.
