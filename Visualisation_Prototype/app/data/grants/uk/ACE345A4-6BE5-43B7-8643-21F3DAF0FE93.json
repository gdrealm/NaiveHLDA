More specifically we wish to pursue our aim through the following objectives:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>To facilitate north-south stakeholder participation in the process of re-framing understandings about the role of science and technology in human development.</li> \n <li>To increase recognition of the role of technology in human development, with an emphasis on improving the choice people have about which technologies are developed and how they are diffused.</li> \n <li>To conceptualise new business models or processes that would support outcomes of science-led new technologies that fulfil human need rather than market demand.</li> \n <li>To develop a means of building an interdisciplinary approach to future research agendas. </li>\n</ul> \n<p>The bringing together of scientists, development specialists, and a variety of stakeholders in southern countries will be a force for change not just an academic talking shop.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4301","grantId":"RES-451-25-4301","fundValue":"5367","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Grimshaw","coPersons":["Philip  Macnaghten","Brian  Wynne","Ian  Scoones","Melissa  Leach"],"organisation":"Practical Action","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
