Image directed healthcare is a key component; the challenge is to develop faster, better, smarter technologies leading to optimised and application-specific information, rapid and reliable decision making and automated operation. X-ray imaging technology is widely used and heavily relied upon in many diagnostic and therapy departments to make major decisions. Yet the commercially available technology is basic and has limited capability; indirect phosphor plates and amorphous silicon imagers form the vast majority of commercial, clinical systems. CMOS technology is starting to come through but again with very basic capability and offer little more than film except digital convenience, often at lower image quality. This proposal aims to exploit the latest advances in smart CMOS imaging technology developed at the STFC Rutherford Appleton lab to make component sensors for next generation imaging directed healthcare. The developed technology is a high resolution, high speed, adaptive, radiation hard, x-ray imaging sensor for the clinic.\nAn x-ray imaging sensor capable of producing high frame rate, high quality images with a radiation hard technology has application in a variety of clinical applications. Such technology could potentially replace digital radiographic panels in radiology (amorphous silicon and phosphor plate), flat plane imagers in radiotherapy and image intensifiers in x-ray fluoroscopy. In each case end-users would benefit from a step change in both image quality (resulting from reduced noise, smaller pixels and higher dynamic range) and dynamic imaging capability (resulting from far superior read out / frame rates) as well as added capability and integration (resulting from Active Pixel Sensor technology and on-line processing). In the field of cancer management these properties lead to superior tumour delineation, increased 4D image quality for managing organ motion and real-time integration between the imager and the linac to enable genuine adaptive therapies.\nUniversity College London and the National Physical Laboratory will evaluate and exploit the benefits of the Rutherford Appleton Lab technology in three important yet diverse areas of medical imaging: cone beat CT imaging in the radiotherapy treatment room, managing organ motion during a radiotherapy lung cancer treatment and dual energy x-ray CT. The latter is in collaboration with National Physical Laboratory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M007863/1","grantId":"ST/M007863/1","fundValue":"143801","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Gary John Royle","coPersons":["Kate Patricia Ricketts"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
