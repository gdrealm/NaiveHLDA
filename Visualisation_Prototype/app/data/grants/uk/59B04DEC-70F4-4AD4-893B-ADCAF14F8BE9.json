An aggregation pheromone for S. lineatus, highly attractive to both sexes, was identified by Rothamsted Research in the early 1980's. A monitoring trap for B. rufimanus, incorporating a floral lure, is under development in TSB project 100871. This project will develop a 'lure and kill' trap combining entomopathogenic fungi with semio-chemicals, formulated electrostatically to enable better delivery to target insects. This will provide an effective and novel pest management tool. There is currently no bio-control system available to UK pulse growers for these pests. Use of insecticide as a killing agent will also be tested. The project will advance sustainable intensification of agriculture and deliver economic impact for the UK Agri-Tech industry by tackling the challenge to quality and production caused by insect pests of pea and bean crops whilst reducing adverse impacts on the environment. Many growers apply 5 to 6 pyrethroid sprays to achieve sufficient control of adult Sitona lineatus to prevent yield loss, and as pest pressure increases, insecticides prove less effective. Alternative approaches for crop protection are needed. The 'lure-and-kill' system developed by the project will provide 'proof of concept' for other pests and crops.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M011542/1","grantId":"BB/M011542/1","fundValue":"270483","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Toby  Bruce","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Rothamsted Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
