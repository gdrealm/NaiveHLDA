{"id":"2674C353-2EE2-425E-BEBA-099931B925B9","title":"The inverse source problem arising in Photoacoustic Tomography","abstractText":"The project addresses fundamental analytical questions on the acoustic wave\nequation. The questions arise in, but are not limited to the context of\nPhotoacoustic Tomography (PAT). \n\nPAT is a medical imaging technique that combines the high contrast in\nelectromagnetic absorption, say between healthy and cancerous tissue, with the\nhigh resolution of ultrasound. The existing PAT image reconstruction methods\nbased on time-reversal arguments do not work when photoacoustic measurements\nare obtained by using an array of detectors that reflects acoustic waves.\nHowever, the use of detector arrays significantly speeds up the data\nacquisition in practice. One of the main objectives of the project is to\ndevelop a comprehensive analytical theory for PAT in a reflecting cavity\nformed by detector arrays. \n\nThe mathematical results to be obtained have applications beyond PAT in the\nfields of Control Theory for Partial Differential Equations and Inverse\nProblems. These applications will be explored. In particular, the results\nallow us to understand better the stability properties of hyperbolic inverse\nboundary value problems. These problems occur in a large number of\napplications including medical ultrasound tomography, seismology, oceanology,\nprocess monitoring and non-destructive testing. In terms of these\napplications, our focus is on seismic imaging.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L026473/1","grantId":"EP/L026473/1","fundValue":"98323","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Lauri  Oksanen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
