{"id":"A45D25CE-53E0-4746-BCFC-066D772BD2FB","title":"ESCO Box: Smart monitoring, billing and control for pro-poor access to energy services","abstractText":"This lack of access to electricity is particularly acute in rural Africa. Despite major advances, connection over large distances from small communities to existing grids is costly due to the cables, substations and additional equipment required. By 2008, 40% of Africans had access to electricity, but in sparsely populated rural areas the average drops to a mere 22.7%, in stark contrast to the 80% global average. Although many individual sites in rural areas, particularly mobile phone masts, have their own generators, there has been a reluctance to extend these to create local electricity networks. The use of small, independent electricity grids, powered by renewable or fossil fuel generators, presents operational and financial challenges. \n\nThe proposed ESCoBox is thus indented to address financial and practical barriers to electricity access by enabling local agents to act as small (but expandable) Energy Service Companies (ESCos), by buying power wholesale from larger off-grid generators (e.g. mobile phone mast operators) and selling it to local customers. The ESCoBox is an enabling technology that will allow cross-sector innovation, from novel financing, to social interventions, entrepreneurial ventures and better designed technologies and services","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L002566/1","grantId":"EP/L002566/1","fundValue":"843943","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  At only one year into the project, the technical development of the ESCoBox concept is still at a relatively early stage. Much of the work so far has been focused on understanding what the users want and need from the system. Having gained considerable insight into this, we are now able to apply that critical knowledge to the technical design of the system.

Much of what we have learnt in the ESCoBox project so far has been in the development of this understanding. So, what we have discovered about the practical, social, economic and cultural aspects of energy supply and usage in low-income, rural, off-grid communities is being fed into our technical development of micro-grids. One of the key findings in this respect is that - even in areas of great poverty - such systems must be founded upon strong commercial models to be viable, sustainable and to achieve ongoing wealth creation. We hope that others will, like us, use these findings to guide their development of micro-grid technology and service delivery models to create systems that have a greater beneficial impact on quality-of-live in poor rural communities.
