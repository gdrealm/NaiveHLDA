{"id":"966684A6-E583-4A5C-9C7C-D0E59D3BE1AA","title":"Government and Freedom: Histories and Prospects","abstractText":"<p>Questions concerning the relations between government and freedom have assumed a renewed importance in the social sciences and history in recent years. Contemporary concerns with security have foregrounded questions regarding the balance of security and freedom. The political ascendancy of neoliberalism has been of major significance, prompting inquiry into the longer-term histories of liberalism. Social scientists have opened up new perspectives on the relations between government and freedom in interpreting the latter as a distinctive set of practical techniques for governing which orders and works through the freedom of those whom it governs. A similarly broadened understanding has been true of the work of social and cultural historians who have been concerned with the history of liberal rationalities and technologies of governance, and the complex forms that these have taken in a variety of national and colonial settings. The <em>Government and Freedom</em> seminar series explores these relations between questions of government and freedom by bringing together leading national and international scholars representing different approaches to these questions, and by engaging in dialogue with a range of publics and user organisations with interests in these questions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0390","grantId":"RES-451-26-0390","fundValue":"17762","fundStart":"2008-01-14","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frederick Anthony Bennett","coPersons":["Francis Martin Dodsworth","Nikolas Simon Rose","Patrick  Joyce"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
