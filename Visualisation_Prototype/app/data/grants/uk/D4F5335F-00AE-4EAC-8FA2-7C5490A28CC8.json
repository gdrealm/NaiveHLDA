{"id":"D4F5335F-00AE-4EAC-8FA2-7C5490A28CC8","title":"Particle Physics Grid Computing at Lancaster","abstractText":"Particle physics is about to receive huge amounts of data from the Large Hadron Collider. In order to process it and do the physics analysis, you need a lot of computing power and disk to store the data on. This can only be done by spreading the job over many sites aorund the world and linking them with cleaver software ('middleware') to make them all seem as if they were almost local. The resulting system is called a Grid. This proposal is to provide the some of the required Grid reosurces at Lancaster, and to fuind people to commission and operate the system, and to complete work on providing interfaces and programmes to use the Grid effectively.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E003087/1","grantId":"PP/E003087/1","fundValue":"269962","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Roger William Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
