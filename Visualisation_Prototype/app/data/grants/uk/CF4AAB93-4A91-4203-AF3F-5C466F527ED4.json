{"id":"CF4AAB93-4A91-4203-AF3F-5C466F527ED4","title":"Government Debt Management","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this research proposal is to build on our past research results, and those of others and provide a theoretically grounded approach to government debt management, that combines concerns over fiscal policy and tax smoothing with capital market concerns such as transaction costs and liquidity issues. At the same time as integrating these macroeconomic and capital market issues the approach will also make an allowance for uncertainty over both the state of the world, the nature of the economy and the ultimate source of likely shocks. </p>\n\n<p>Providing solutions to such a model where the government has to consider a wide range of maturities and different types of assets is a computationally demanding approach. Key to our approach is building on our past computational work. </p>\n\n<p>The result should be a framework that can handle bonds of several maturities simultaneously as well as nominal/indexed bonds and domestic/foreign currency and help evaluate potentially new securities such as GDP contingent bonds. The end product should be both quantitative and qualitative insights into the optimal structure of government debt.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2300","grantId":"RES-062-23-2300","fundValue":"329320","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"A  Scott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London Business School","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
