The trial steering committee (TSC) believed that patients are central to the delivery and development of critical care. A member of CritPal sits on the TSC and they have influenced many aspects of the trial, especially the patient information sheet and consent form. The involvement of a CritPal representative has enabled the perspective of the patient, their relatives, friends and carers to be integrated into the study, and also has informed its design.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500970","grantId":"G0500970","fundValue":"761372","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John Duncan Young","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
