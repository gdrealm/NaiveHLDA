In coordination with U of Leicester application ref: F39130X","abstractText":"The KuaFu mission will be the first ever space mission addressing space weather science from the source of activity on the Sun right to to the Earth's magnetosphere. We will be able to image the large clouds of material, know as coronal mass ejections, leave the Sun, and determine whether they will be able to effect the Earth. If thir physical makeup is such that they will effect the Earth we will be able to observe it through in situ measurements, and auroral imaging. The area of space science is one which is becoming increasingly important due to our dependence on satellites through most importantly navigation and communication.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E006582/1","grantId":"PP/E006582/1","fundValue":"26944","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Louise Kim Harra","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" It was proven that spectral imaging of the Sun can be achieved without the use of a slit spectrograph.
