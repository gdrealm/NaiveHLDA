{"id":"9A60462A-18BC-4700-A06E-0865DE5F9213","title":"Structure in Chemistry: A Preliminary Investigation","abstractText":"The concept of structure is central to chemistry. Chemists appeal to structure to explain why, for instance, carbon dioxide acts as a greenhouse gas, and why diamond is one of the hardest materials. Structure underpins chemical classification and nomenclature. It is also central to chemistry's relationships to other sciences like physics and biology. In spectroscopy, chemical structure and physical principles combine to explain how molecules interact with light and other radiation. Successful quantum-mechanical explanations of molecular structure are the reason why many philosophers see chemistry as in principle reducible to physics. Conversely, the distinction between the structure and function of biological molecules (e.g. 'messenger RNA') is the reason why many philosophers see biological explanation as irreducible.\n\nYet structure is the subject of foundational debate within chemistry. Chemists disagree over whether there is a sound physical understanding of the chemical bond, a central part of structural theory. If not, should the bond then be regarded as a mere figment of chemical theory, rather than an element of physical reality? Or does its success in unifying chemical knowledge mean that it must be taken more seriously?\n\nThis project will bring philosophers and chemists together to investigate the foundations of structure and the chemical bond, examining the explanatory role of structure within chemistry, and the extent to which such explanations can be grounded in physical theory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011487/1","grantId":"AH/J011487/1","fundValue":"21278","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2012-08-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin  Hendry","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" Structure is central to chemistry: it underlies chemical explanation, classification and nomenclature. However, chemists use a variety of different, and mutually irreducible, conceptions of structure. Thus although chemistry is unified around structure, structure itself is plural and interest-dependent.\nOne particular structural notion, the chemical bond, is indispensible for understanding chemical change. Yet its physical basis is still debated by chemists.\nThese findings are of importance to understanding the conceptual foundations of chemistry itself and its relationships to other sciences like physics and biology. These findings might be taken forward by scientists and science educators who wish to understand the complex conceptual foundations of chemistry, and to convey this understanding to science students and the wider public.
