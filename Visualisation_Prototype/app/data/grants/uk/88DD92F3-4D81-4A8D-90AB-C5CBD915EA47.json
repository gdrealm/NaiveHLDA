{"id":"88DD92F3-4D81-4A8D-90AB-C5CBD915EA47","title":"Creating the Energy for Change","abstractText":"This project will investigate innovative ways of dividing up and representing energy use in shared buildings so as to motivate occupants to save energy. Smart meters (energy monitors that feed information back to suppliers) are currently being introduced in Britain and around the world; the government aims to have one in every home and business in Britain by 2019. One reason for this is to provide people with better information about their energy use to help them to save energy. Providing energy feedback can be problematic in shared buildings, and here we focus on workplaces, where many different people interact and share utilities and equipment within that building. It is often difficult to highlight who is responsible for energy used and difficult therefore to divide up related costs and motivate changes in energy usage. We propose to focus on these challenges and consider the opportunities that exist in engaging whole communities of people in reducing energy use.\n\nThis project is multidisciplinary, drawing primarily on computer science skills of joining up data from different sources and in examining user interactions with technology, design skills of developing innovative and fun ways of representing data, and social science skills (sociology and psychology) in ensuring that displays are engaging, can motivate particular actions, and fit appropriately within the building environment and constraints. We will use a variety of methods making use of field deployments, user studies, ethnography, and small-scale surveys so as to evaluate ideas at every step.\n\nWe have divided the project into three key work packages: 'Taking Ownership' which will focus on responsibility for energy usage, 'Putting it Together' where we will put energy usage in context, and 'People Power' where we will focus on creating collective behaviour change. In more detail, 'Taking Ownership' will explore how to identify who is using energy within a building, how best to assign responsibility and how to feed that back to the occupants. We know that simplicity of design is key here, as well as issues of fairness and ethics, and indeed privacy (might people be able to monitor your coffee drinking habits from this data?). 'Putting it Together' will consider different ways of combining energy data, e.g. joining this up across user groups or spaces, and combining energy data with other commonly available information, e.g. weather or diary data, so as to put it in context. We will also spend time considering the particular building context, the routines that currently exist for occupants, and the motivations that people have for using and saving energy within the building, in understanding how best to present energy information to the occupants. \n\nOur third theme, 'People Power' will focus on changing building user's behaviour collectively. We will examine how people interact around different energy goals, considering in particular cooperation and regulation, in finding out what works best in different contexts. The project then brings all aspects of research together in the use of themed challenge days where we promote specific energy actions for everyone in a building (e.g. switching off equipment after use) and demonstrate the impact that collective behaviour change can have. Beyond simply observing what works in this context through objective measures of energy usage, we will analyse when and where behaviour changes occurred and speak to the users themselves to find out what was engaging. \n\nThese activities will combine to inform technical, design and policy recommendations for energy monitoring in workplaces as well as conclusions for other multi-occupancy buildings. Moreover, we will develop a tool kit to pass on to other companies and buildings so that others can use the findings and experience gained here. We will also explore theoretical implications of our results and communicate our academic findings to the range of disciplines involved","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K002589/1","grantId":"EP/K002589/1","fundValue":"1075110","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Project activities are already achieving impact within academic, industry, and wider public domains and are starting to be discussed within policy circles. We have achieved some direct impact on industry in terms of reduced energy usage, following from data monitoring and reflecting back to different building users. An immediate example is reductions implemented in water heating when one of our partners observed that it was being heated at unnecessary times, an insight only achieved from our more in depth visualisations of usage. The increased understanding and detail provided by our data management and analyses in the buildings that we have engaged with is likely to continue to produce process changes as investigations continue and will help with future decision making around energy systems. In addition, we have directly increased our partners understanding of their occupants perceptions of energy use, motivations to save energy and different behaviours. This will facilitate future communications effort in this area and facilitate organizational policy development.\n\nDissemination of findings beyond partner locations have included a business focused workshop in Nottingham which highlighted some of the techniques we have used and discussed the potential for implementing these elsewhere. We have regular meetings with both existing partners and potential future partners, are variously invited to sit on industry and policy advisory panels, and also attend multi-audience conferences (e.g. Behave energy conference), which helps to pass on learnings in a timely manner. We have also started to develop a toolkit (as planned within the project) in order to translate and disseminate our findings to further organisations. \n\nWe have also aimed to pass on our findings to a wider public audience through multi-media engagement, including radio interviews and blogging. We maintain a project specific blog (see www.energyforchange.ac.uk ) and have also provided guest blogs and materials for other peoples blogging.\n\nPolicy impacts have been limited so far though the inclusion of Michael Harrison (DECC smart metering team) has meant that we have engaged in knowledge transfer here in a limited manner already. This is starting to increase, primarily through engagement between DECC and the TEDDInet network. This has led to increased dialogues between DECC and Ctech.

We have developed understanding of the possibilities and pitfalls of monitoring and feeding back energy data at different levels of granularity. Given technical and social considerations we conclude that apportioning energy to spatially organized groups (as opposed to existing communities or individuals) is likely to be the preferable situation for most workplaces. Workplace energy policies must be coherent and integrated with wider organizational policies to be successful and we particularly recommend setting clear specific goals around energy use with accompanying feedback on those goals. \n\nIn developing our energy monitoring, we have developed understanding and design of low cost energy sensors (with potential to be used for a range of sensing applications). A series of design iterations and experimental tests has examined different configurations of sensor design. We have identified two configuration methods with most potential for enabling users to set up their own devices in the home: web configuration – where a user connects to an access point on the wireless node and audio configuration where network details are sent over an audio cable that connects the device to the node. \n\nUsers must be motivated in order to save energy and we have also undertaken the first exploration of motivations to save energy in the workplace, quite a different context from the home where the majority of research in this field has been conducted. Motivations to save energy at work can be classified as self-directed, e.g. for self-image, to achieve feelings of warm-glow from doing something considered socially good, or altruistic, e.g. environmental motivations or motivations to improve the company’s image or finances. Our data indicates that people are mostly motivated to save energy because of environmental reasons, in order to help their company’s spending and image, and in order to gain warm-glow feelings. Interestingly, self-image motivations negatively predicted energy saving behaviours indicating that people may think that energy saving does not fit with a positive work image. \n\nThe project has developed and carried out intensive analysis of energy data available from several workplace monitoring systems. This analysis along with data workshops with building stakeholders (e.g. different managers) and occupants allowed the interrogation of data for designing energy interventions in the workplace. Key interventions proposed include: ambient feedback displays for workplace occupants which incorporate organizational policies alongside energy information, and allow staff input and feedback; need for improved visual analytics tools for management (beyond facilities management) to allow engagement with energy systems; and a need to create sensing systems that assess energy use beyond the workplace, including that of transient workers and the life cycle of buildings.\n\nPlanned further research will bring these strands of research together in applied workplace energy interventions. However analyses has already added significantly to this field, generating new understandings, and pointing to important avenues for new research in this field. Our early findings have been summarised and provided in report form to our advisory panel members in addition to a monthly team blog update. Members have therefore benefited in terms of received early understandings gained from our current research including in particular understanding of optimal strategies for energy monitoring and motivations in the workplace. In addition, we have developed case study reports of the key sites that we have worked with so far and reflected specific findings back to the participating sites. These have provided our partners with in depth understandings of the energy usage and monitoring situations within their own organisations and potential strategies for improving energy efficiencies. In addition, we have also produced a range of papers and presented findings at a range of conferences across disciplines which have disseminated our latest analyses to a broad cross section of academics relevant to energy research.
