Modulation of energetic particles from both the sun and galactic sources determines their abundance and energies in the Sun-earth environment, which, together with wave-particle interaction within the radiation belts establishes the longevity of such particles within the radiation belts. Exposure to energetic particles is an important parameter in the reliability of spacecraft instrument systems. Characterising changes in the Heliospheric Magnetic Field associated with short and rapid variations in the solar wind, such as Coronal Mass Ejections and Co-rotating Interaction Regions, are important in determining the effectiveness with which these large Space Weather disturbance impact the Earth's space environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M000885/1","grantId":"ST/M000885/1","fundValue":"599663","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Clare Emily Jane  Watt","coPersons":["Mathew James Owens","Christopher John Scott","Michael  Lockwood"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
