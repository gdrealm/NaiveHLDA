It will also explore the effect of socio-legal recognition on the lived experience of same sex couples and the impact of such change on attitudes towards state involvement in their lives. </p>\n\n<p>These issues will be investigated using in-depth interviews with 48 members of same sex couples. The sample will include both individuals who had registered their partnership or who intend to do so, and individuals who do not intend to register their partnership or who are undecided about doing so.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1972","grantId":"RES-000-22-1972","fundValue":"80634","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin Richard Mitchell","coPersons":["William  O'Connor"],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
