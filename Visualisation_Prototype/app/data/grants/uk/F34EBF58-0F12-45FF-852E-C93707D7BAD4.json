{"id":"F34EBF58-0F12-45FF-852E-C93707D7BAD4","title":"Flood Risk Management Consortium (FRMRC) Phase 2","abstractText":"This proposal has been drafted in response to an invitation from EPSRC, who in collaboration with the EA/Defra Joint R&amp;D programme on Flood and Coastal Defence, UKWIR, the Scottish Office, the NI Rivers Agency and NERC, agreed in February 2003 to fund an interdisciplinary research consortium investigating the prediction, prevention and mitigation of flooding (FRMRC1). The concept behind this innovative joint funding arrangement was that it allowed a national consortium to combine the strengths of basic and near-market researchers and research philosophies in a truly multi-disciplinary programme. The research portfolio for FRMRC1 was formulated to address key issues in flood risk management by generating new and original under-pinning science, while being consistent within the agreed objectives of the funding agencies. This philosophy is to be carried over into the second phase of funding (FRMRC2).FRMRC2 will build on the results of FRMRC1 to increase understanding of flooding processes, generate new and original science and support improved flood risk management. The consortium consists of eligible academic institutions working alongside appropriate stakeholders and users in both the public and private sectors. The breadth of interests and skills of the consortium, coupled with the originality and utility of the research outcomes, will ensure that the consortium approach significantly adds value to the sum of its various components.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F020511/1","grantId":"EP/F020511/1","fundValue":"7328330","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth  Pender","coPersons":["Gavin  Tabor","Ian David  Cluckie","Enda  Oconnell","Herve  Morvan","Dragan  Savic","Jonathan  Lawry","Alistair George Borthwick","Hazel  Faulkner","Michael  Mawdesley","Martin John Smith","Adrian John  Saul","Roger Alexander Falconer","Paul David Bates","Grant Bertram Wright","Colin Reginald Thorne","Binliang  Lin","Peter Kenneth Stansby","Jim William Hall","Thomas  Varsamidis","Howard Simon Wheater","Thomas James Coulthard","Dawei  Han","Neil  McIntyre","Fergus Lloyd Sinclair","Paul  Sayers","Slobodan  Djordjevic","Keith  Beven","David  Kay","S  Arthur","Dominic  Reeve"],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
