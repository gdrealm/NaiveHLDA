{"id":"A735A348-4437-4426-BF90-CE666E179E9C","title":"All Hands Meeting Network (AHM-Net)","abstractText":"By organising three All Hands Meetings (AHMs) the All Hands Meeting Network (AHM-net) will serve a very broad community of e-Science researchers, computational researchers and researchers in a wide range of disciplines who apply the methods and technologies they invent together. The AHMs will provide a crucial venue for information exchange, community building, best practice dissemination and collaboration formation. They will remain a unique venue for communication between researchers, infrastructure providers and funders. They will continue to foster new researchers, new working groups, existing task forces and the network of centres and projects. The extension of AHMs to more international engagement and collaboration with computational and HPC communities will continue their rise in importance and visibility. They will expand its role as a knowledge transfer event stimulating two-way communication between academia and industry. As a focus for international interaction the AHMs will showcase UK achievements and alert the UK researchers to the latest breakthroughs worldwide. As such AHM-net is crucial for the well being of UK e-Science, which itself is essential as an element of the wider UK research programmes proposed by all of the Research Councils. The term e-Science was coined by Sir John Taylor, DGRC, in 2000 to denote an activity that has been important in research for decades. It drew attention to the need to treat this as a discipline, which should be developed to the benefit of all researchers. It is often conducted by interdisciplinary teams from computing science and any discipline, which requires new methods. They may not call themselves e-Scientists nor have funding with an e-Science label, but they do engage in AHMs. They may be the ICT thought leaders in their discipline.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F063946/1","grantId":"EP/F063946/1","fundValue":"314800","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project was responsible for running the annual meeting of e-Scientists in the UK and for setting up a mechanism for their continuation beyond the end of the project.

These meetings are a unique opportunity for presenting and developing the research activities from e-Infrastructure provision to scientific discovery exploiting new collaborative, distributed and interdisciplinary opportunities. They also encourage cross-fertilisation across the full spectrum of research disciplines, supported by all of the research councils and charities. Typically 15% of the attendees were from overseas and 10% were from industry.  Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Other","dataset":"gtr"}
