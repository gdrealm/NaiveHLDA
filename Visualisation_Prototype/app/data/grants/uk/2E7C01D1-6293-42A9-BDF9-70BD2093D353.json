Their role is to regulate the production of proteins from other genes in the genome - it is predicted that the 2500 known microRNAs in the human genome regulate around two thirds of the 20000-25000 human genes, for example. MicroRNAs have been shown to be important in essentially all functions in the cell and in a large number of diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. \n\nMicroRNAs were only discovered to be so widespread in 2001. The miRBase database was established soon after to catalog microRNAs as they are discovered, and to provide a range of services to the microRNA community. For example, miRBase assigns names to new microRNA discoveries, to ensure that the same microRNA is referred to by the same name in different publications. miRBase also acts as the central resource from which the most up-to-date set of microRNAs can always be retrieved, together with their locations in the genome, the methods by which they were found, the scientific publications that describe them, and links to other databases that contain related information. These functions have helped the microRNA field to grow at a tremendous rate. In 2013 alone, there were 8400 scientific publications about microRNAs. miRBase currently contains entries on 35828 microRNAs in 223 species.\n\nmiRBase is used by essentially every microRNA researcher in the world. These users include those who study the roles of microRNAs in disease and other cellular processes, but also companies who make kits and resources to allow experimental biologists to detect and manipulate microRNAs. The miRBase website is used by around 40000-50000 different users each month, and miRBase has been mentioned in over 8000 scientific publications.\n\nThe work that will be carried out under this proposal will ensure the continued availability of the essential functions of the miRBase database. It will also provide for the next phase of development of the resource. In particular, we will develop web tools that allow microRNA researchers to access and use the huge quantities of microRNA data that are being produced by so-called deep sequencing methods. We will also expand the database to include information about the genes that are regulated by microRNAs, again from deep sequencing data.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M011275/1","grantId":"BB/M011275/1","fundValue":"588374","fundStart":"2015-03-01","fundEnd":"2020-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sam  Griffiths-Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
