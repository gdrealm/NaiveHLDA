An integral part of this challenge is to understand how brain changes, e.g., through development, aging or disease, can affect cognition. The complexity of the problem, both technical and theoretical, has led researchers to study non-human brains. For this reason, research into rodent brains remains a mainstay of brain science. The retrosplenial cortex is emerging as a brain area with potentially important roles in cognition, most especially memory, though recent imaging studies also suggest an involvement in stimulus control. The main structural and anatomical properties of this area are retained across rodent and primate brains, so reinforcing the value of animal research on this area. Interest in this region is heightened by growing evidence that retrosplenial cortex abnormalities are found in the earliest stages of many of the commonest brain diseases that disrupt memory, including Alzheimer's disease, changes that presumably contribute to the loss of cognitive abilities.\n\nOur understanding of retrosplenial cortex function remains very superficial. Research with humans is held back by the difficulty of isolating this particular brain region as it is buried deep within the primate brain. In contrast, the rat retrosplenial cortex is both relatively large and, unlike the primate retrosplenial cortex, is readily accessible as it is located on the dorsal medial surface of the rodent brain. Even so, this area remains poorly researched in rodents and that research has largely focused on spatial learning and navigation. While the retrosplenial cortex is involved in spatial processes, recent evidence points to a much broader role in cognition than hitherto suspected. \n \nThe planned research will examine the novel proposal that the rodent retrosplenial cortex works in close conjunction with frontal brain areas to enable stimulus control, including stimulus translation. This process makes it possible to switch between different representations of the same event. A sequence of clear objectives will test this model. The first objective is to examine non-spatial, as well as spatial, functions of the rodent retrosplenial cortex. The research will involve a combination of novel and established techniques. The resulting findings will open up completely new avenues of research. The second objective is guided by the fact that the retrosplenial cortex has dense, reciprocal connections with the frontal cortex of the brain. The significance of these frontal connections currently remains unknown and so we will ask the simple, but unexplored, question of how much frontal cortex function depends on its retrosplenial interactions and vice versa. By addressing these questions we will test and refine models with the potential to unite what appear to be disparate accounts of retrosplenial cortex function (the third objective).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L021005/1","grantId":"BB/L021005/1","fundValue":"443200","fundStart":"2014-09-30","fundEnd":"2017-09-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Aggleton","coPersons":["Seralynne Denise Vann","Frank  Sengpiel"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
