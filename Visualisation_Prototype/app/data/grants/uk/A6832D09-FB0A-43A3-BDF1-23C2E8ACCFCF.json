In the densest, darkest regions of space where stars are just beginning to form, a wealth of chemical activity occurs, in both the gas and solid phase. Although gas and solid materials have been observed for many years, we are now undertaking an observing programme to 'map' both materials concurrently, on the same scale, to see just how the gas and solids interact during star-formation using various telescopes worldwide.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G004307/1","grantId":"ST/G004307/1","fundValue":"20546","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Helen Jane Fraser","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
