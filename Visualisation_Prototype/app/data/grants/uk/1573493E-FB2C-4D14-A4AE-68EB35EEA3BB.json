QCD forms a major part of the Standard Model and its understanding is crucial in producing an overall theory to describe the properties of matter and the fundamental forces of nature including a grand unification theory to explain how the Universe evolved from the Big Bang. \n\nThe principal purpose of our research is to use ultra-relativistic heavy-ion interactions to study QCD at extreme energy densities. Theoretical models predict that under very extreme conditions of high energy densities the quarks, which are confined in normal nuclear matter, will be freed and nuclear matter will undergo a phase transition into a hot, dense plasma of free quarks and gluons known as a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). It is thought that such a state of matter would have existed until about 10^-5 seconds after the Big Bang, after which time the Universe would have cooled sufficiently for protons and neutrons to form.\n\nThe physics aim of this research is to study the strong force under these extreme conditions and, in particular, explore the properties of this exotic state of matter. By studying the QGP, we hope to address the fundamental questions of quark confinement and how quarks gain a large effective mass in hadrons due to the strong force (accounting for 99% of atomic mass). \n\nThis field of research employs about two thousand physicists around the world and ALICE is the most sophisticated experiment ever built in the field, studying heavy-ion collisions at centre-of-mass energies over an order of magnitude greater than its nearest rival. It hence represents the pinnacle of research in this field. \n\nThe ALICE collaboration is now preparing for the second LHC upgrade scheduled to start in 2018. These upgrades are required to cope with the anticipated increase in lead beam luminosity which will increase beam intensities by an order of magnitude. The main motivation for the luminosity upgrade is to achieve a precise, quantitative understand of the properties of the QGP by focusing on rare probes both at low and high transverse momenta as well as on multi-dimensional analysis of such probes with respect to centrality, event plane, multi-particle correlations, etc. \n\nThe ALICE-Birmingham Group is playing a leading role in the ALICE Upgrade at the LHC (CERN), in particular we are responsible for the upgrade to the Central Trigger Processor (CTP) where we have recognised international leadership. This will enable us to continue to be responsible for the vital CTP and will position us to continue to play a leading role in the future. However, in order to develop the sophisticated trigger electronics and fast optical data transfers, we require a modern 16 GHz Oscilloscope, which we are applying for in this call. This bid will capitalise on the prior investment of STFC in the ALICE experiment by sustaining and enhancing the leadership role the UK plays.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N00261X/1","grantId":"ST/N00261X/1","fundValue":"23947","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David  Evans","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
