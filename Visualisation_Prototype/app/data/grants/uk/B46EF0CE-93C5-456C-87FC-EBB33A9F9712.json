Using this HPC we were able to use a combination of whole genome comparative genomics in combination with the existing dbSNP database to examine SNP densities across the whole conserved human genome . In this way we were able to show demonstrate the following phenomena,(1)The vast majority of conservation in the human genome is non-coding.(2)SNP densities were reduced in the most conserved regions of the human genome (3)SNP densities were lowest in the intronic and exonic components of the conserved human genome (4)By comparison SNP densities were significantly higher in the conserved intergenic genome despite being conserved to an identical degree.In this way we were able to conclude that (1)the majority of conserved and by extrapolation, functional information is contained in the non-coding genome. (2)The exonic and intronic components of the conserved genome are under identical levels of high purifying selective pressure (3)the conserved intergenic component provides the plasticity required for adaptive evolution and may also be the major reservoir of disease causing polymorphisms.These observations have since been validated by GWAS studies showing that 88% of disease causing SNPs occur in non-coding regions of the genome. The results of this study were published in BMC genomics [1].In addition to this study the HPC has been used to host an on line web site called RegSNP (http://viis.abdn.ac.uk/regsnp/Home.aspx) that allows researchers to predict the effects of different alleles of SNPs on transcription factor binding sites. This facility also allows the prediction of SNP in linkage disequilibrium and is currently being updated to allow the detection of LD of GWAS associated SNPs with SNPs in highly conserved regions.In addition, Starkey has used the HPC in work that undertakes data mining of a multi-parameter model landscape through the use of Monte Carlo methods allied to statistical techniques focused on the global Nitrogen model [3,4].

Nitrogen fluxes in a steady-state global nitrogen cycle Many people either gain little therapeutic benefit from currently available drug therapies or suffer serious side effects. Identification of drug response stratification loci will greatly accelerate the delivery of novel drugs to market by allowing more selection of drug test patient cohorts during their development and by providing an avenue to more focussed prescribing to patients who would benefit after their market delivery thus delivering on many of the promises of personalised medicine. This ability will prove hugely profitable to the drugs industry whilst greatly improving patient care.. We are currently exploring methods of using the techniques developed using our high performance computer array to identify the polymorphisms that contribute to drug response stratification in the human genome Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
