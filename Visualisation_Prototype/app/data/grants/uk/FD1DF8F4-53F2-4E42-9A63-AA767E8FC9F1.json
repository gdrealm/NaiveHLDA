The Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) in Beijing is an internationally leading organisation in this area and will substantially benefit from this additional investment. The Applied Modelling and Computational Group at Imperial College London (AMCG-ICL) is an environmental modelling group developing next generation methods. We propose a two year starter project with a combination of training and scientific effort in the UK and China synchronized with a range of supporting activities that will build the foundation for a subsequently self supporting (combination of UK and Chinese funds) 'International Research Centre'. The Centre will combine our world leading technologies and manpower to accelerate research excellence and delivery of numerical modelling insights and solutions to grand challenge environmental problems in the UK and China way beyond the capability of the UK alone. A relatively small investment would leverage China's massive past, current and future investments in IAP and past UK investments in next generation environmental flow models (particularly the multi-scale ocean model Fluidity-ICOM). This collaboration will develop a world leading predictive modelling framework. The starter project funded here will provide the focus for the training and collaboration so as to apply IAP's data assimilation methods to our multi-scale ocean model Fluidity-ICOM.\n\nNext Generation Ocean-Atmosphere Model: \n\nA Grand Challenge in Earth System Science is modelling the global circulation across the full range of relevant spatial and temporal scales. For climate prediction, this means resolving both basin scale and smaller scale features such as boundary currents, mixing; chemical interactions and transport, overflows, and mesoscale eddies. Such simulations will lie well beyond the capability of traditional ocean and atmosphere models. It is now generally recognised that the next generation of ocean models will be based on unstructured mesh technology as currently this is the only feasible way of resolving the important range of scales in coastal regions. As identified by the NERC strategy document 'oceans 2025 WP9', unstructured mesh ocean models are the key ocean modelling technology for the future modelling of multi-scale ocean to estuary and smaller scale modelling. Among existing unstructured mesh models, ICOM-Fluidity is the only model that can be used for simulation of flow on all scales using adaptive mesh resolution and is therefore an ideal platform for the next generation of data assimilation models to be developed on. One result of the training program will be that ICOM-Fluidity will be used to form a forward model of the China Sea. There will be a large amount of data to assimilate into the model e.g. satellite, argo floats and ship tracks. Ensemble Kalman Filter EnKF and gradient or adjoint based data assimilation methods will be used with ICOM-Fluidity to provide forecasts and to interpolate available data.\n\nPlanned activities that will support the IAP - AMCG-ICL research:\n\n1) Training courses, workshops and Summer schools.\n2) PhD students, PDRAs and senior staff time to apply (and help develop) the model e.g. set up the UK and China sea model and develop uncertainty, reduced order and data assimilation methods.\n3) Exchanges of academic staff and PhD students.\n4) Development of a new substantial funding grant in China and the UK to fund the centre.\n5) Strengthened UK link and development of further initiatives with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n6) Formalised visiting status for key Imperial College researchers","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J015938/1","grantId":"NE/J015938/1","fundValue":"232175","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The main activity in this project was training with a series of &amp;quot;apprentice-piece&amp;quot; projects aimed at delivering new methods for data-assimilation for application to computer modelling of environmental flows and real-wrold case studies. \n\nThe training events resulted in researchers being funded by Chinese organisations to use our model in their work either working in China or studying at Imperial College.\n\nThe data-assimilation methods have been implemented in the model and can now be used by anyone who wishes to use it in the future.\n\nThe development of the data-assimilation methods also has some surprising industrial applications and influenced the development of computer software being used by geophysical equipment used to identify the oil-water contact in oil wells.

This focussed on training Chinese academics in the use of a computer model that can be used to model fluid flow in the ocean and atmosphere. Part of the training involved several &amp;quot;apprentice-piece&amp;quot; projects, some of which have led to publications and some which will lead to publications in the future.\n\nThe model itself is open source, which means it is free for anyone to use. It is however, a model in development (although it is already being used in some industrial applications). The benefit of having skilled Chinese developers is that model development will be faster.\n\nA key development so far that has grown from one of these &amp;quot;apprentice-piece&amp;quot; projects is a new approach to the way that models set up. This new approach will lead to greater accuracy and potentially faster run-times. Model development is very much an ongoing process but there are always opportunities to use what has already been developed. The group at Imperial has, for example, been funded by industry to model tides in the ancient past to predict the location of hydrocarbon reservoirs (&pound;400k+) and by companies in the marine renewable business to inform the layout of tidal turbines. \n\nThe use of the data-assimilation methods that have been developed so far has not yet been used commercially but it does have the potential to improve the predictive power of the computational flow model that we use.
