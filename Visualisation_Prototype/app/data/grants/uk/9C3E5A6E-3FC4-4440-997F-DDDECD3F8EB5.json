This is usually performed effortlessly but actually involves complex skills to visually monitor the environment and control body movements. For individuals with coordination difficulties this presents a real challenge and can have a negative impact on safe participation at school or work and in everyday life.</p>\n\n<p>This project will consider several aspects of obstacle avoidance and navigation in children and adults with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). DCD is characterized by everyday motor problems in the absence of sensory, intellectual or neurological impairment. The condition occurs in almost 2% of children and usually continues into adulthood.</p>\n\n<p>Primarily the project will focus on locomotion while negotiating a gap/aperture between obstacles such as that created by a doorway or parked cars. Such a task has both a perceptual element and a motor element. We plan to consider the perceptual element both in isolation and within a movement context. Finally the project will consider navigation of unpredictable or changing environments.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed research will further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying DCD and thereby assist in planning more effective interventions to support motor learning.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J02015X/1","grantId":"ES/J02015X/1","fundValue":"280261","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kate  Wilmut","coPersons":["Anna Louise Barnett"],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":" This grant is ongoing This grant is still ongoing Other","dataset":"gtr"}
