The diseases are associated with abdominal and hepato-biliar symptoms and serious manifestations such as obstructive jaundice and ascending cholangitis. Long-term consequences include the development of a fatal bile-duct cancer. Since there is currently only one drug available for the treatment of O. viverrini and C. sinensis, there is a need to develop novel trematocidal drugs. In a recent proof of concept trial with tribendimidine, a drug used in China for the treatment of roundworm infections, a high efficacy (based on changes in egg output after drug treatment) against infections with O. viverrini was observed. In addition, the drug was well tolerated. There is a need to follow up on these promising results. In the framework of 3 randomized trials the efficacy and safety of tribendimidine will be studied. First, we will study the dose-response of tribendimidine in O. viverrini patients and assess drug disposition. Second, once the ideal dose has been determined a phase 2b clinical trial will be conducted to compare the efficacies and safeties of tribendimidine with praziquantel. Finally, the efficacy and safety of tribendimidine against C. sinensis infections will be studied in a proof-of concept trial. The first two trial will be conducted in Laos, the third trial in China. In case tribendimidine has demonstrated adequate efficacy and safety in these trials we will pursue the registration of tribendimidine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100699","grantId":"G1100699","fundValue":"257960","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Somphou  Sayasone","coPersons":["Xiao-Nong  Zhou","Kongsap  Akkhavong","Jennifer  Keiser","Christoph  Hatz","Peter  Odermatt"],"organisation":"Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
