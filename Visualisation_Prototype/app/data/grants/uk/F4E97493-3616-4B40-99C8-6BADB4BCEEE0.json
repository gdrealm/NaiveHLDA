{"id":"F4E97493-3616-4B40-99C8-6BADB4BCEEE0","title":"St Andrews Astronomy: PATT linked travel and subsistence","abstractText":"We request travel and subsistence support in the form of a PATT-linked grant to enable observers in the Astronomy group at the University of St Andrews to take up telescope time awarded by peer review panels such as PATT, on major international facilities. We also seek approval for travel to other, smaller telescopes. In particular, we seek support for follow-up radial-velocity observations during Semester 2014A and Semester 2015A using the SOPHIE spectrograph on the 1.9-m telescope at Haute-Provence (OHP). This will enable us to measure the masses and spin-orbit misalignments of extra-solar planets found by the SuperWASP Wide-Field Sky Patrol Camera, which is currently beginning its 8h year of operation on La Palma. We are active members of the PLANET and MiNDSTEp consortia, and seek approval for occasional travel to small telescopes in the southern hemisphere to assist in intensive observing campaigns on Galactic Bulge microlensing events.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L00139X/1","grantId":"ST/L00139X/1","fundValue":"40487","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Collier  Cameron","coPersons":["Keith  Horne"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":" Not applicable this year Not applicable this year Education","dataset":"gtr"}
