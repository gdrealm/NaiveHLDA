{"id":"5C4476CF-95F0-445B-AD9A-9DBD6FDD76CC","title":"Cell circuitry for metals: Integrative metabolism for cobalt uptake and cobalamin production","abstractText":"In this era of synthetic biology, where it is possible to redesign and construct novel biological systems to perform new functions for useful purposes, it is often overlooked that such approaches are inherently flawed because of the accumulation of toxic materials. In using cells as factories the procurement of starting materials and the accumulation of intermediates/products can often prove detrimental to the bacterium. Such is the case with engineering the cobalamin (vitamin B12) pathway into E. coli. Here, it is the provision of cobalt, the metal centre of the vitamin, which is difficult for the bacterium to cope with. As the cell does not have a specific cobalt import system, high exogenous levels of the metal have to be added to the growth medium to permit transport of the metal to the site of vitamin synthesis and to allow production of the nutrient. However, the high level of cobalt compromises the viability of the cell as the cobalt interferes with Fe-S centre formation in redox proteins.\nTo overcome this metal toxicity issue we have outlined a research plan to enhance cobalt uptake, increase its internal cellular concentration, and modulate its export. This will be accomplished by developing systems to allow improved uptake of the metal, increased internal binding capacity and enhanced delivery of the metal to where it is required within the metabolic pathway. We will monitor the effectiveness of these procedures by using internal reporters within the cell that will provide readouts on the level of cobalt and how it is being used internally. The research will also allow the characterisation of a number of metal transport and binding proteins. The results of these analyses will inform on how the cell can be engineered further so that cobalamin synthesis can be enhanced at lower metal concentrations. From this information we will develop a self contained, fully wired, metal circuit that will be able to control and regulate cellular cobalt supply.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L010208/1","grantId":"BB/L010208/1","fundValue":"391061","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2017-03-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  There research is currently in its early stages.

The objectives are to understand the engineering principles that will allow maximum uptake of the metal without compromising the cell to its inherent toxicity - allowing the cell to maintain a safe balance between import and efflux. These has been achieved so far by undertaking the following:\n1. Construction of E. coli strains containing a functional recombinant cobalamin pathway into which cobalt transporters and exporters can be engineered. The import and export systems include NikA-E, CorA, NiCoT, CbiMNQO as well as RcnA.\n2. Development of &quot;readout&quot; systems that can report on the pools of cobalt within the cell. These will also record the level of damage caused to Fe-S centres. The reporters include CoaR, RcnR and IscR. The research described in this application is having a major impact on several areas of science, including synthetic biology and the manipulation of metal-requiring pathways. It has permitted the generation of bacterial strains into which metal uptake and utilisation can be tightly controlled through an increased understanding of the relationship between free and buffered metal pools. The research relates to how cells can be engineered to improve the uptake of potentially toxic metals and how the cells can be manipulated to make the metal available for biochemical pathways. This approach is applicable to a broad range of natural products. With an increase in the interest especially of secondary metabolites such an approach is likely to prove popular with chemical biologists and medicinal chemists alike.
