DNA itself is generally organised in highly compacted structures, in particular supercoils in which the helical axis of DNA is coiled about itself. Supercoiling has a dramatic effect on the expression of genes and has been shown to act as a global regulator of gene expression. Our understanding of how supercoiling influences the behaviour of DNA is far from complete, particularly at the molecular level. Therefore we have developed a model system involving small DNA circles that we can analyse both by experimental methods and computer modelling. By combining these experimental and theoretical approaches we aim to understand how DNA recognition is affected by supercoiling, and how we can use supercoiling to influence biological processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I019472/1","grantId":"BB/I019472/1","fundValue":"274696","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Harris","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" The aim of this project is to understand how the packaging of DNA through supercoiling influences its recognition by other molecules, such as proteins, and therefore how it may contribute to gene regulation. We have been using computer simulation combined with experimental studies of tiny DNA minicircles, which behave like &quot;model genomes&quot; to show how the shape of the DNA changes due to supercoiling, and how this changes the binding of a third DNA strand. The combination of theory and experiment powerfully illustrates the central importance of DNA topology in prokaryotic gene control. This grant will continue in Leeds until June 2015 as it was extended due to maternity leave. Our research is one piece in a complex picture that is emerging from structural biology and bioinformatics - that knowledge of the DNA sequence itself is insufficient to understand gene regulation in either prokaryotes or eukaryotes, and that we must also take the spatial and temporal organisation of the genome into account, hence the recent 4D nucleome project launched by the NIH. Supercoiling is an important part of this hierarchical organisation, but remains poorly understood due to the lack of controlled tools for studying it in the laboratory. We have made a significant contribution towards developing these tools and applying them during our minicircle project.
