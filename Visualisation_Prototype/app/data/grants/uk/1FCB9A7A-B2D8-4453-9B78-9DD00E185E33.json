{"id":"1FCB9A7A-B2D8-4453-9B78-9DD00E185E33","title":"Novel Multiple Materials Additive Manufacturing Instrument for New Generation of Optical fibre Fabrication","abstractText":"In this proposal we will design, fabricate and employ a novel multiple materials additive manufacturing (MMAM) equipment\nto enable us to make optical fibre preforms (both in conventional and microstructured fibre geometries) in silica and other\nhost glass materials. In existing low-loss fibre preform fabrication methods, based on either chemical vapour deposition\ntechnique for conventional solid index guiding fibres or 'stack and draw' process for micro-structured fibre, it is very difficult\nto control composition in 3D. Our proposed MMAM can be utilised to produce complex preforms, which is otherwise too\ndifficult or time consuming or currently impossible to achieve by the existing fabrication techniques. This will open up a\nroute to manufacture novel fibre structures in silica and other glasses for a wide range of applications, covering from\ntelecommunications, sensing, lab-in-a-fibre, metamaterial fibre, to high-power laser, and subsequently we are expected to\ngain significant economic growth in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M020916/1","grantId":"EP/M020916/1","fundValue":"700271","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2018-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jayanta Kumar  Sahu","coPersons":["Shoufeng  Yang"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
