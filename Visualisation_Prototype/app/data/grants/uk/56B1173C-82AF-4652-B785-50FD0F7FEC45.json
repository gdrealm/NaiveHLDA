{"id":"56B1173C-82AF-4652-B785-50FD0F7FEC45","title":"Innovative gel aid for administering tablets to stroke and other dysphagic patients","abstractText":"We propose to develop a gel, within which tablets can be inserted, which makes swallowing easier and safer for patients with swallowing difficulties. Current approaches to helping patients with swallowing difficulties to take their tablets involve mixing crushed, dispersed or whole tablets in foodstuffs such as jam and yoghurt. Tampering with tablets not designed to be crushed or dispersed can have undesirable consequences. Similarly mixing with foodstuffs may affect drug absorption or leave carers open to accusations of administering medicines without the patient s consent (covert administration). \nWe have developed a clear gel to be placed around tablets and therefore make them easier to swallow. Our gel consists of products which are both safe for human use and are known not to interact with tablet ingredients or coatings. The gel is designed to become more slippy on contact with saliva which means that tablets can be swallowed without water. This is particularly useful in patients who cannot safely swallow solids and liquids at the same time. We believe that with 2 years additional funding we will be able to both finalise the composition of the gel by the potential addition of stabilising agents, preservatives and possible flavourings (which can increase saliva production) and perform small patient trials to demonstrate that in healthy volunteers there is no effect on drug absorption and that the gel is acceptable to patients who are likely to utilise it.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902184","grantId":"G0902184","fundValue":"348643","fundStart":"2010-09-20","fundEnd":"2014-10-19","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Duncan  CraigDavid  Wright","coPersons":["Tracey Helen Sach","John F Potter"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
