{"id":"A473CB3E-054F-48FC-85E5-0BCF98FDD6DB","title":"Control-based bifurcation analysis for experiments","abstractText":"Many phenomena that are predicted to exist by mathematical theory\nremain invisible in real life. Yet, mathematical theory also predicts\nthat these hidden phenomena determine our fate when real life is &quot;on\nthe edge&quot;. For example, a small increase of wind strength can abruptly\ncause a bridge cable to start swinging violently. Still more puzzling,\nthe bridge cable may continue to swing strongly even if the wind\nstrength decreases again. Mathematical theory reveals that the\nmechanisms behind these striking sudden changes (often catastrophes\nfrom the point of view of engineering) are universal: they apply to a\nbridge cable as well as to an ocean current or a neuron. The observed\nchange is abrupt only because the missing link between the two\ndifferent visible behaviours is typically a phenomenon that is\nunstable or too sensitive to be visible. This insight enables\nengineers and scientists to predict, and avoid or control, sudden\nchanges whenever they can rely on a set of equations describing the\nmotion.\n\nThis research will develop a method, &quot;control-based continuation&quot;,\nthat enables experimenters to observe unstable phenomena directly in\ncontrolled laboratory experiments. Control-based continuation uses\ncontrol to convert the relation between experimental inputs and\noutputs into an equation that can be solved computationally. Every\nphenomenon that is natural in the uncontrolled experiment can be found\nas a solution of this equation. Mechanical prototype experiments\n(using, for example, pendula and beam-magnet arrangements) have shown\nthat the method is indeed feasible. This project aims to make\ncontrol-based continuation applicable to more complex experiments and\nmore complex phenomena.\n\nThe PI will collaborate with experimenters at the Technical University\nof Denmark (Lyngby) who investigate vibrations in fast rotating\nmachinery. \n\nOne specific objective of the project is to develop and test the continuation\nof the exact boundaries between stability and instability (so-called\nbifurcations). Traditional computational methods for determining\nbifurcations are not applicable to equations extracted from\nmeasurements because they rely on the ability to solve the equation\nwith high accuracy (8-16 significant digits), which is not achievable\nin most experiments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J010820/1","grantId":"EP/J010820/1","fundValue":"85002","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jan  Sieber","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
