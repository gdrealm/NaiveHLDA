Current cleaning detergents are a complex chemical and biological components, but in terms of their cleaning composition but can broadly be considered to contain (i) surfactants to solubilise fabric-based stains; (ii) enzymes to digest stains and (iii) bleaches to degrade and increase the hydrophillicity of coloured stains. In this project we use an atomic force microscope to study how individual enzymes digest stains. The atomic force microscope will measure the interaction strength between an enzyme and an oil surface. Once we have an understanding of this process we will use this knowledge to modify the enzymes in order to allow them to work at lower temperatures. These modified enzymes will be studied using the atomic force microscope under the conditions the enzymes would face in a typical washing cycle, this will allow us to further improve the efficiency of the enzyme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H034706/1","grantId":"EP/H034706/1","fundValue":"198781","fundStart":"2011-01-31","fundEnd":"2014-01-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ashley James Cadby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
