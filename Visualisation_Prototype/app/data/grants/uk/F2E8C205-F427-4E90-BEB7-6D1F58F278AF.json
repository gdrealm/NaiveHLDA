The ethic of javanmardi (usually translated as chivalry) encompasses bravery, loyalty, courage, fairness and honesty. It has been adopted by a number of individuals including artisans and tradesmen, revealing the degree to which Sufi ideas penetrated into pre-modern society.\\n\\nJust as notions of identity change in individuals and in societies, so too the understanding of javanmardi and its relationship with Sufism develops through the course of history. Focusing upon javanmardi offers an indication of the distinctive characteristics of Persian Sufism, which aside from its mystical component (that is, striving for unity with God) includes a focus on scrupulous honesty, an abhorance of hypocrisy, and a tendency towards antinomianism and individualism. The impact of this legacy is worthy of some speculation; there are some Iranians who view the Sufi/javanmardi legacy as paramount in the Iranian psyche, but there are others who deny any space to this heritage.\\n\\nHowever, there can be little doubt about the significance of Sufism and javanmardi in Persian history, especially in the pre-modern age (by which I mean the era prior to the Pahlavi dynasty, pre-1925). Given that Sufism has contributed significantly to Persian culture (typified in the poetry of Rumi and Hafez) an assessment of how Persian Sufis utilised the ethical teachings of javanmardi is long overdue. In short, javanmardi contributed to the elaboration of non-mystical codes of courtesy and correct behaviour that should be observed by all individuals. Focusing upon the writings of the great Sufis who wrote on such topics reveals that there were major socio-political implications in their writings, particularly the hierarchical nature of Sufism that also reflected the hierarchies prevalent in society. Although this was an extension of the hegemonic control by those in power (including Sufis), it is also true that javanmardi (and by extension, Sufism) was adopted by artisans of the trade-guilds, and Sufi themes were adapted and developed in their writings on javanmardi. This indicates that Sufi forms of authority and hierarchy were extremely useful and practical in developing forms of activity that stretch beyond the purely religious sphere, and offered a way in which the more marginalised segments of society could find space to articulate their demands. Thus, this research provides an insight into how Sufism penetrated into various dimensions of society; it was advocated by a certain Sufi elite, and it was adopted and promoted from below.\\n\\nThe historical aspect of this research will utilise existing English translations, and some works in Arabic, but the majority of material used will be from Persian texts, many of which have been edited and published in Tehran in recent years. During the past four years I have made two research trips to Iran with this project in mind. Thus I have been able to collect and read the major publications that are necessary for this research, and I have met and discussed this topic with the leading Iranian scholars in this field.\\n\\nThe lack of English materials on this topic is probably the reason that it has been so neglected in English. The only significant contribution has been an English translation of a French work published in 1998 that includes one chapter about javanmardi. While the ethic of javanmardi in its Turkish and Arabic forms have been analysed extensively, my research on the Persian variety and its relationship tp Sufism will be the first of its kind. A chronological approach will be adopted, commencing with javanmardi in Iranian society just over one thousand years ago. Subsequently, the project will be divided into chapters that reflect important shifts in political and cultural emphasis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G004617/1","grantId":"AH/G004617/1","fundValue":"23222","fundStart":"2009-01-14","fundEnd":"2009-05-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lloyd  Ridgeon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
