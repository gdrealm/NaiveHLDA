{"id":"107E167D-93D1-4194-BBC6-C120290DA5C1","title":"Enhancing and Enriching Historic Census Microdata","abstractText":"<p>The ultimate goal of this project is to create Samples of Anonymised Records (SARs) from British censuses 1961 to 1981 using record-level data recovered from archive tapes by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The project will fall into two phases.<br /><br />In Phase 1 record-level data will be recovered from archival data held by the relevant data controllers. This will involve extracting, transforming and re-loading all existing data files and applying variable and value labels. These data will be delivered to the data controllers for permanent preservation.<br /><br />Phase 2 will involve the specification and creation of SARs from these complete datasets. The end result will be a series of datasets which will be harmonised with the existing SARs for 1991 and 2001 available from the UK Data Service. The final data products are expected to be released in the summer of 2014.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005731/1","grantId":"ES/K005731/1","fundValue":"491692","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew  Woollard","coPersons":["Josephine Clare Wathan"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
