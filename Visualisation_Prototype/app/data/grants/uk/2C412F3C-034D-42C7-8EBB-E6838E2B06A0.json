The consumption of SSBs is rapidly increasing among children and adolescents especially in developing countries. This is an important public health issue as majority of the population in developing countries is very young. Governmental bodies around the world are taking increasing action to address the availability of soft drinks in schools through increased taxation on soft drinks or banning their sale in schools. However, the evidence around effects of restricting availability or increasing taxes on SSBs on their consumption and health is still unclear and emerging, it is likely that these actions are being driven by the belief that high-calorie, nutrient-poor drinks no longer have a place in schools, and, moreover, that schools are an appropriate starting point to reduce total consumption of SSBs among youth. In the absence of robust evidence, an intervention cannot be delivered to test the effectiveness of various fiscal policies in reducing SSB consumption among youth. This study will test the acceptability and feasibility of a fiscal intervention delivered through schools to reduce SSB consumption among children and adolescents.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M021467/1","grantId":"MR/M021467/1","fundValue":"121403","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Manu  Mathur","coPersons":["Monika  Arora","Richard Geddie Watt","Nora  Groce","Mathew Sunil  George"],"organisation":"Public Health Foundation of India","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
