Researchers are facing a new age of cancionero studies in which we can pose more penetrating questions about the entire corpus, about the work of individual poets and single cancioneros. Many modern readers find cancionero poetry tediously repetitive and abstract. The aim of the present study is to query whether one of love lyrics' best known commonplaces - the lovers' look - is an empty trope or whether it has implications beyond the lyric situation in which it appears. I shall use the work of a single poet (Juan de Torres) in a single manuscript cancionero, Cancionero de Palacio, as a starting point to address this question. Torres's citational practice and quotations from him locate him (i) within a manuscript community that includes fellow Palacio-poets and (ii) within a wider textual community of court poets of the first half of the fifteenth century. \\n\\nI offer a first critical reading of Torres's poetry which demonstrates his awareness of the visual field as a sphere of power. I contextualize Torres's view of the visual with reference to discussion of sight and seeing by his contemporaries. Although my study will focus on medieval theoretical discussions, I also use an electronic database (the Cancionero virtual) to explore the extent to which his Palacio peers also evince a concern with the visual. In literary historical terms, Palacio has been much (and unduly) neglected, and I offer a first corrective to that situation, which will be complemented by the completion of a project to produce a new critical edition by colleagues in Spain and the UK. Finally, I employ a digitized copy of the manuscript to analyse the role of the formal techniques of manuscript organization in establishing a dynamic of hierarchy within the community of poets whose work appears in Palacio. My concerns converge on the idea that love lyric composed by an elite, non-aristocratic but with a will to power, is a means of making a claim to identity and agency. \\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H006680/1","grantId":"AH/H006680/1","fundValue":"23562","fundStart":"2010-10-05","fundEnd":"2011-01-04","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Louise  Haywood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
