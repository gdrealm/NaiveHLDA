The popularity of digital technologies has changed not only the subject matter for many researchers but the possibilities of communicating and circulating findings. By focusing on inventive methods and modes of transmission, this project recognises the shift from digital technologies as subject matter and method to critical transmission tools and sites of knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It takes two parts:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Transmissions and Entanglements - a series of meetings that bring together interdisciplinary practitioners to discuss and debate the possibilities and consequences of new forms of knowledge transmission.</li>\n\n <li>Freedom of Movement - a new research project that engages in alternate ways of representing findings as they emerge in real time.

It did this in three key ways:\n\n1. Generated an international network outside academia. A series of events were designed to explore, critique and foster knowledge exchange between a range of industry, creative and academic communities engaged in diverse creative practice. We explored questions - What is invention? What is practice? Are we engaging as practitioners in knowledge making or in world making? How do we keep bodies and materiality IN the exchange and circulation of knowledge? Discovered that these questions and challenges are central across disciplines and discussion provided insights into individual practice. One participant said the event made her 'feel at home instead of always having to defend a practice'. Members have begun to collaborate. The network continues to develop in 2015. \n\n2. Put findings into practice. New research project 'Freedom of Movement' (known as Bikes and Bloomers) brought to life insights emerging in the network. Involved collaborations with a weaver, pattern cutter and illustrator and resulted in the production of 5 Victorian cycling garments made from UK patents (total of 29 articles of clothing). All garments hand-made by the research team. We reflexively explored sociology-in-the-making; an explicit engagement in the process of making, curating and circulating ideas across different disciplines and found new ways (as well as parallel ways) of articulating our work. Conversations with the tailor explored ideas around translations of ideas in multi-dimensions from 1D drawings - 3D toiles - 2D patterns and back again. The artist worked with the research team to visualise the research process and emerging findings. Resulting artworks were digitally printed onto silk and sewn into finished garments. The research team perform in the garments to present the research which has been greeted with enthusiasm by audiences in UK, Australia and US (so far). The garments operate as dynamic multi-dimensional sociological arguments and platforms for discussion and debate about different working practices\n\n3. Engaged in expanded collaborative activities. The project gained more exposure than anticipated in non-academic contexts. The research team has given public talks, performed in costume, run conferences, expert panels, run sewing workshops, hosted an exhibition, published a website/blog and videos, curated cycle rides in art, design, museum, cycling policy, transport, sewing, craftivism and activist oriented events as well as a popular BBC TV program. We have been invited to take the project on tour to the US and Australia. The sewing workshops are a particular noteworthy experimental and sensory research method that didn't just study patents but put them to work. People responded very positively to being invited 'into' the research, gaining day-long intensive exposure to the project and the embodied experience of making and wearing garments. The next step, in response to popular demand: 1. To launch Open Source Pattern PDFs and 2. Explore the commercial potential of the project.\nThe project successfully illustrated how far from operating as a point of closure, experimental methods of knowledge exchange mediate new conversations and offer new entry points into social science research for non-academic communities. - Sewing and Cycling intersections: Throughout the project, people have requested copies of the patterns produced in the research project. 'Downloadable Open Source PDF Pattern Packs' enable individuals to make their own versions of the convertible cycling garments. The sewing workshops were very successful and we have had many requests to run more events. We are exploring the potential of doing this with local bicycle communities. A 'Bloomer Making Workshop' information pack enables individuals to host their own events. We have also had requests to purchase finished garments and illustrated silks produced in collaboration with the artist, Alice Angus. We are exploring the commercial aspect of the project \n\n- Media coverage. Invitations to be involved in a radio program, print media and Wikipedia to submit inventive women's stories.\n\n- New experimental research methods. The research team has given many talks about sewing and wearing of research as sociological methods and the use of time-lapse video in ethnographic study. Researchers seem interested in exploring these techniques in their own practice.\n\n- Ongoing network activities: Members of the interdisciplinary Transmissions network are beginning to collaborate on new projects - book proposals, performances, conference panels, journal articles, grant applications. There are plans to run another Transmissions Conference in 2015 that brings the network together to further foster these connections.
