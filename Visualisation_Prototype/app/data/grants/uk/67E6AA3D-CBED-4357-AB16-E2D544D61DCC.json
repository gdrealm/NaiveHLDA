Non-dispersive infra-red (NDIR) spectroscopy is a well-proven and widely used method for low cost gas detection and is now available in a variety of ultra small, low cost configurations. However, while for some species (e.g. CO2) NDIR instruments are capable of high precision measurements in a range of environments, if multiple absorbing species are present, with its restricted spectral resolution (typically 100s of cm-1), NDIR techniques cannot be used quantitatively. We propose to overcome this limitation through the use of a static FTIR with ~ 5 cm-1 spectral resolution, integrated with a compact miniature White cell to produce a prototype ultra compact FTIR spectrometer. The instrument will operate in the mid IR, a spectral region which contains the strong fundamental absorptions of many molecular species. \n\nThe deliverables will be:\n- A functioning prototype gas FTS spectrometer and absorption cell\n- Laboratory validation and sensitivity tests (CO2, H2O, CH4 and N2O)\n- Results from limited field trials\nConceptual design for a fully integrated low cost FTIR based instrument\nThe principal deliverable, an integrated miniaturised low cost FTIR spectrometer, will have wide ranging applicability in low cost gas detection, including industry, environmental monitoring and atmospheric science. The intention would be to seek follow-on funding from TSB and STFC Innovations, and NERC/EPSRC for technical developments and scientific applications. \n\nThe Project itself is expected to last for 6 months from 1-Oct 2012.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K002074/1","grantId":"ST/K002074/1","fundValue":"29247","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  As a result of this project, the technology that was developed from this grant has been developed further to improve the instruments sensitivity and spectral accuracy.
