Exploring doctors' transitions to new levels of medical responsibility","abstractText":"<p>All doctors experience many transitions, both during their training and subsequent careers. These transitions include changes in status and seniority, changes in geographical location, change of speciality and change of clinical team. Little is known about the effects of these transitions on doctors' performance.&nbsp; This study will use a combination of desk-based research, interviews and observations to investigate selected key transitions at four levels: individual, clinical teams, employers and the regulatory and policy context.</p>\n\n<p>A significant feature of many transitions is increased responsibility. This project focuses on two points of transition using two critical aspects of medical performance, specifically: prescribing and patient management. The first transition is the point at which clinical practice begins - the change from medical student to foundation training. The second transition is the point at which doctors change from general to more specialist clinical practice.&nbsp; The project will develop understandings about how transitions can best be structured. It will utilise a new methodology for exploring transitions and develop new conceptual understandings about transitions. It will also identify key issues for the development of tools to map the effects of transitions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-153-25-0084","grantId":"RES-153-25-0084","fundValue":"75042","fundStart":"2007-10-23","fundEnd":"2009-01-22","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Trudie Elizabeth Roberts","coPersons":["Sue  Kilminster","Miriam  Zukas"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
