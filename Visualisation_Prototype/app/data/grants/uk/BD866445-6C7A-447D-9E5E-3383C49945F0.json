The VHP is a significant organisation in Indian political and cultural life. It also has an international profile, projecting itself as a representative of Indian communities, and Indian culture, in diaspora. The project explores the role of the VHP in the construction of British Hindu identity, using this as a case-study to reflect on the category 'religion' and its key position in the construction of minority community and diasporic identities on the context of modern Britain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112888/1","grantId":"112888/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-09-18","fundEnd":"2007-01-17","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Zavos","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
