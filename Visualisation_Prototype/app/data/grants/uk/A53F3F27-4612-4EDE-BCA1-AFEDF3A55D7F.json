I shall examine various manifestations of this search in a detailed survey chapter, and in chapters devoted to two of the best-known, most productive and popular members of this generation, the pro-revolutionary Vancura and the Catholic Durych.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112890/1","grantId":"112890/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-02","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rajendra Anand Chitnis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
