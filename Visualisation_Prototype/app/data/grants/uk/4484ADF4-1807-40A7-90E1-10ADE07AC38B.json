{"id":"4484ADF4-1807-40A7-90E1-10ADE07AC38B","title":"THE BRITISH MACRO POLITY","abstractText":"<p>This research examines the relationship between aggregate election outcomes and the party positions between 1945 and 2005. It will use all available public opinion data to estimate the left-right position of the average voter at each election. It will then use separate analyses of the contents of election manifestos to establish the parties' positions on this dimension at each election. It will then locate both parties and voters on the same scale in order to establish the 'distance' between the two. Finally, it will estimate the relationship between these distances and the parties' vote share at each election taking into account voters' long-term loyalties.</p> \n<p>In order to provide a fuller picture of the relationship between party activity and election outcomes this research will also assess the relationship between government activity (as reflected in the state of the economy and public spending) and public opinion. In particular, it will assess the general proposition that demands for government activity increase under Conservative governments and decrease under Labour governments. This part of the research will, therefore, provide a fuller understanding of the trends and cycles in public opinion that have been noted by many scholars, journalists and politicians.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E012612/1","grantId":"ES/E012612/1","fundValue":"81814","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Bartle","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
