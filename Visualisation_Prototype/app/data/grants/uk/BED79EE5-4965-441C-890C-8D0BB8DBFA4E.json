Our proposal is unique because: (i) it identifies a new class of inherently CMOS-compatible and functional molecules that have not previously been considered (or even patented) for 'beyond-Moore' applications; (ii) it aims to address key practicalities of scalability, interfacing, stability and reproducibility that are often omitted from schemes aiming simply to construct a single demonstrator device; and (iii) it is underpinned by a strongly-collaborative team with complementary expertise in molecular synthesis, modelling and device fabrication. This project is highly creative and adventurous, proposing that inorganic molecules could be reliably used in the fabrication of nano-electronic devices that take advantage of the intrinsic electronic properties of molecules as switchable molecular semiconductors (EPSRC success feature 1). It supports talent at all levels - from senior professors to early career researchers - in a highly supportive and collaborative context (EPSRC success feature 2). Initially, we propose to design hybrid devices combing CMOS embedded with bistable MMOs and to examine the interplay between 'bulk' and nano-molecular semiconducting units. Our approach is both innovative and practical because it embeds molecular electronics within the current the state-of-the-art, allowing us to address practical issues and develop know-how in this new field, before down-scaling to 'beyond-Moore' dimensions down to the molecular limit with collaborations that achieve a two-way flow of knowledge between the research base and industry (Building collaborations that achieve a two-way flow of knowledge between the research base and industry (EPSRC success feature 3) and at the same time this proposal encourages and supports research that crosses the borders between disciplines (EPSRC success feature 4). Theoretical studies of both single clusters and arrays will allow us to predict their behaviour and design new architectures; surface studies and device measurements will enable us to assess the electronic characteristics of devices and drive us towards viable nanoelectronics that can be mass-produced therby developing a shared vision of tomorrow's major challenges and opportunities with stakeholders: society, industry, universities and other partners (EPSRC succes feature 5). We aim to show that MMO-CMOS (herein called M-MOS) can function with 'embedded' molecular units and we plan towards the single molecule limit. This potential will be assessed and exploited within the Glasgow Nano EPSRC KTA (EP/H500138/1) allowing 'real-time' technology transfer allowing us to immediately seize any commercial development opportunities thereby building a better understanding of where we should focus our effort to benefit both UK society and the UK economy and increase its global competitiveness (ESPRC success feature 6).Finally this programme will directly train 7 PDRAs and 4 PhDs and indirectly train 8 further PhDs and 24 undergraduate / erasmus students thereby creating and sustaining research scientists and engineers in the UK so that they are recognised worldwide as leaders in their field (EPSRC success feature 7).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H024107/1","grantId":"EP/H024107/1","fundValue":"3567080","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Leroy  Cronin","coPersons":["David Robert Cumming","Asen Mihailov Asenov","John  McGrady","Mark  Murrie","Donald A MacLaren","Douglas J Paul","Graeme  Cooke"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":" A range of new molecules synthesised (&gt;50), mass spectrometry screening implemented; Heteroatom guest clusters discovered and characterised with unprecedented REDOX chemistry. Substrate assembly work simplified thanks to feedback from modelling results.Molecular simulations for a range of host-guest clusters as a function of heteroatom; Modelling of flash ram as a function of molecule type, density and organisation; experiments interfacing to silicon devices with Gold Standard Theory.Interfacing of molecules to electrode arrays done; Design of new devices to characterise molecules on nanowire devices rather than electrometer. Development of CMOS based ISFET sensors to image POM assembly on surfaces. Using some of the molecules we discovered during the programme grant we discovered a new way of controlling the growth of polyoxometalate based microtubes that could be fabricated in real time to produce microfluidic devices. We constructed an device using a laser system connected to a IPAD which allows us to control the system and 'wire-up' tubular networks on the fly in real time. In the course of our device engineering work we came up with a new approach to integrate CMOS sensors with reactor platforms to explore chemical reactions in real time. Not only can we monitor the reactions but we also devised a platform for the control and processing of chemical reactions using integrated CMOS. The result is a new platform that could allow computations to be done using hybrid electro-chemical systems and substrates. From our construction of reactors to monitor cluster formation in the mass spectrometer we found a new approach for the synthesis of molecules by coupling feedback from the sensor system to the chemical inputs. This allowed us to devised a new route for exploring array / combinatorial chemistry much faster than before by developing new chemistry, engineering, analytics as well as new algorithms for navigating the parameter space.
