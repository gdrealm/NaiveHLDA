While such a device will likely provide ground breaking commercial and national security applications due to the existence of powerful algorithms, its existence will revolutionize modern day science by allowing true quantum simulations of systems that may be modeled classically only insufficiently due to an in-principle limitation of current computer technology. Recent progress in experiments with trapped single atomic ions shows that it should be possible to build a quantum computer using this technology. A major challenge is the scaling of already existing technology beyond a token number of quantum bits. This research will address the manipulation of single atoms in complicated arrays as an architecture for a quantum computer and furthermore, will aim to allow for unprecedented motional control of a large number of single atoms inside such arrays. Single atomic ions will be trapped using electric fields, shuttled inside a complicated array of trap electrodes and manipulated using laser beams. We will develop techniques to retain and control atoms during shuttling operations along complicated paths inside the array. Furthermore, we will investigate ways to engineer such arrays using advanced nanofabrication technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E011136/1","grantId":"EP/E011136/1","fundValue":"227736","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings of this grant form an important ingredient for the realization of practical quantum technologies, such as the realization of a ion trap quantum computer and quantum simulator. \n\nNumerous undergraduate and postgraduate students have been trained as part of this grant learning unique skills that are critical for many industry sectors.

This research will likely motivate school students to undertake a career in science. Numerous popular science appearances, along with a BBC documentary and public lectures helped in demonstrating this to a variety of non-academic contexts. This research helped the development of microchips and nanotechnology. A patent for a novel laser was filed as part of the project. Long term impact may include the production of ultrafast quantum computers and other technologies based on quantum science.
