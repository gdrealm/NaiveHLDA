{"id":"BD3792BB-B9D4-4D94-BDD7-A5BBBA9FE3D5","title":"Acute Vascular Imaging Centre for Oxford (OxAVIC)","abstractText":"This application is for a clinical research centre (CRC) that will allow the close monitoring of\npatients as they receive treatments for acute vascular events, in a safe environment at the heart\nof the John Radcliffe Hospital. Crucially the CRC will focus on investigating patients at the time\nthey are having strokes and heart attacks. It will take advantage of medical advances,\nparticularly in imaging, to improve our understanding of these illnesses and explore new\navenues to improve care and outcomes for patients. The novel aspect of this proposal is to\nplace this state-of-the-art imaging at the core of where acute clinical care is provided, namely,\nthe Accident and Emergency Department. Researchers still have a great many questions to\nanswer about why patients do not recover despite current treatment strategies, such as\nangioplasties and the use of clot-busting drugs. Traditionally, such research facilities are either\nunavailable or do not provide safe environments for patients at the time of the stroke or heart\nattack. The CRC will provide a focus to bring together the research expertise from many\ncomplimentary areas within Oxford University, to understand how we can develop new\ntreatments or improve on existing treatment for these common conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701128","grantId":"G0701128","fundValue":"3987590","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alastair M Buchan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
