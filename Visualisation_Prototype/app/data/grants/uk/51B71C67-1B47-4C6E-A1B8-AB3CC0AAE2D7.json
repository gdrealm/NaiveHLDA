The technology we will use is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is a non-destructive method to take images of superb clarity and detail from within living subjects without using harmful radiation. MRI is widely used for imaging patients in hospitals, and we are proposing to purchase similar equipment for imaging much smaller subjects, such as rats and mice. One of the advantages of MRI is that it is a very versatile technique which can be used in a number of different ways / in this proposal we include three different studies of the brain: one in which we look for regions of the brain which are important in regulating appetite; another in which we are interested in where drugs which alter states of mind act; and a third in which we wish to understand how inflammation (the process by which the body responds to an infection or allergy) affects the brain. We are not restricting our study to the brain / we will also use imaging to find out about detailed structure of the heart, to discover mechanisms which lead to the formation of new blood vessels, and finally by imaging, after death, the heads of a number of specimens of different mammalian species (including some valuable samples stored in museums) we hope to improve our understanding of how mammals move and maintain their balance. The versatility of the technique means that it can be used to help provide answers to a large range of scientific questions in biology, and by this purchase we will be able to provide the opportunity to local researchers to undertake state-of-the-art imaging studies for several years to come.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F011350/1","grantId":"BB/F011350/1","fundValue":"220329","fundStart":"2008-05-30","fundEnd":"2009-05-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Ross Williams","coPersons":["David  Buckley","Stuart McRae Allan","Simon M.
