With the availability of various advanced devices (e.g., smart phones, tablet pc, mobile gaming terminals), the demands of low-cost and large-scale interactive multimedia content delivery will become a key feature of next generation wireless networks. The primary requirement for these services is the sustained transmission of high quality data at high rates across large scale areas, comprising a set of strict criteria in terms of short delays, small delay jitter, and high throughput under changing wireless communication conditions. \n\nWireless mesh networks (WMNs) are a disruptive technology that will be an alternative to existing mobile wireless architectures for low-cost multimedia communications in large scale outdoor environments. However, the fundamental drawbacks (e.g., limited bandwidth, wireless transmission interference and conflict) inherent in the wireless transmission medium make it a challenge to deploy WMNs to carry high-performance multimedia communications in large-scale areas. Integrated communications that combine the Internet and wireless networks were provided to solve the scalability problem. Current studies focus on single-source integrated multimedia communications and will cause a set of problems such as heavy overheads, complicated data distribution processes and complexity in maintaining the architectures for multiple communications if being used for interactive multimedia communications, due to multiple concurrent senders of interactive multimedia content generating a heavier and more complicated traffic load for wireless networks to manage. \n\nThis project, as a part of the initial work on large-scale and low-cost wireless interactive multimedia communications, will study advanced algorithms/protocols and theorems for optimally integrating the Internet and WMNs which will efficiently meet wired and wireless integration requirements for transmissions from multiple interactive sources. To tackle this difficult problem progressively, three major tasks are planned. We will first study the extension of performance-guaranteed wireless transmission environments which will avoid the overuse of the Internet and backhaul access resources via mesh gateways and therefore the scalability of integrated communications. The study will be implemented by exploring the advantages provided by multiple transmission rates and multiple transmission channels. We will then study an integrated architecture for multiple interactive sources. This study will be based on the investigation of multimedia transmission performance in multi-rate multi-channel WMNs and the discussion of the impact of mesh gateways on the performance of integrated communications. Finally, we will study the proposed architecture in theory. We will provide a mathematical model that can reflect the advanced technology arising from this project. We will justify the proposed integrated architecture through solid theoretical performance analysis. \n\nThe research proposed in the project is believed to among the first to consider large-scale affordable interactive multimedia communications any time and anywhere for the general public. It is now commonly accepted by most industry players that multimedia communications act like a gateway to a whole new communication world. This project thus will not only aid the UK in keeping its world-leading position in telecommunications but will also be attractive for commercial exploitation in the near future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J017159/2","grantId":"EP/J017159/2","fundValue":"51596","fundStart":"2013-12-15","fundEnd":"2015-04-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Wanqing  Tu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Robert Gordon University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
