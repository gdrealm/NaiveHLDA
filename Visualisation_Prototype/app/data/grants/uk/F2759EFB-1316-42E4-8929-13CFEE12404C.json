The system is versatile and easy to use. Currently, the Structural Materials and Mechanics Group at the University of Liverpool does not have access to any form of in-house NDT equipment. The ultrasonic inspection would be used in a large number of projects within the Department of Engineering. These projects benefit from the collaboration of a number of major companies and organisations including Airbus (Germany), Airbus (France), Astrium, Propex Fabrics, Gurit, Linpac, The Royal Mail and The Home Office.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E037887/1","grantId":"EP/E037887/1","fundValue":"78459","fundStart":"2007-06-30","fundEnd":"2010-06-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Wesley  Cantwell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" New blast resistant materials have been developed and characterisied. \nLightweight lattice structures have been developed and tested.
