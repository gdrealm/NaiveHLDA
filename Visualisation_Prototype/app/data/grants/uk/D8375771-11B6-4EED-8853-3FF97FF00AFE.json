Using the theme 'space' we will capitalising on the proximity to Jodrell Bank and the scientific &amp; pharmaceutical industry professionals locally to encourage Maxonians to explore, enjoy and engage with both the arts and the sciences. \n\nWe have already been successful in winning grant funding from the Arts Council England to interpret the theme of 'space' through a programme of visual arts commissions (we are in discussion with Jodrell Bank and University of Manchester about an artist in residence) and a participatory performing arts commission (La Lune, an interactive, whole town, narrative event over eight days of the festival about an astronomer's adventure). This application would deliver a scientific strand to complement and enhance our existing programme and create a holistic interpretation of 'space' across the arts and sciences. \n\nBarnaby2016 can support delivery of the following STFC aims: \n\n-To capitalise on the inspirational value of these subject areas for many national audiences, including the general public, schools, young people and other groups \n-To encourage STFC-funded scientists to wider audiences and to discuss issues with non-specialists \n-To encourage partnerships, such as those between scientists and educators, industry and professional communicators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N00213X/1","grantId":"ST/N00213X/1","fundValue":"9500","fundStart":"2016-04-03","fundEnd":"2016-09-02","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Lynne Roose Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Macclesfield Barnaby Festival","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
