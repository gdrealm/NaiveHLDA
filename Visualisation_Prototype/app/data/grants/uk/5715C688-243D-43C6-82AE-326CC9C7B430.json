At the same time, there is evidence of increasing bidialectalism, where speakers have two ways of speaking: a local dialect and a more formal, standard way, as the example below shows: </p>\n\n<p>Shona: I na ken far the quines is.<br /> Jennifer: Sorry?<br /> Shona: I said I don’t know where the girls are. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But what exactly does it mean to be bidialectal? Can speakers really have control over two dialects, just as, for example, a bilingual speaker has over two languages? And what are the implications of bidialectalism for the future of local dialects? To answer these questions, the project will investigate the speech of 10 to 80 year olds in a small Scottish community. The speakers will be recorded once with someone from the local community (an ‘insider’) and once with someone from southern England (an ‘outsider’). This will allow us to test the limits of bidialectalism by investigating who switches where and when. The results will provide a snapshot of bidialectalism in the 21st century and how this might affect the future dialect landscape of the British Isles.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000861/1","grantId":"ES/K000861/1","fundValue":"296735","fundStart":"2013-05-03","fundEnd":"2016-05-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Non-academic: one of the aims of the Curriculum for Excellence in Scotland is to develop the study of the Scots language.

In this research we test the sociolinguistic details of bidialectalism by recording members of a community in north east Scotland 1) with a community insider and 2) with a community outsider. This allows us to test whether indeed speakers can switch fluently between dialect and standard. Our findings to date show that speakers can switch with words and sounds, but not with grammar. We suggest that this is due to salience of particular linguistic forms: a speaker only switches from dialect to standard if s/he knows in the first place that there is a difference. These findings have far reaching implications for the structure of language as revealed through the analysis of the bidialectal speaker.
