There are many ways in which it can get permanently damaged, leading to opacity and potential loss of sight. In spite of intense study by many laboratories, major questions relating to the maintenance of the corneal surface remain. For example, although a large body of evidence exists which implies that stem cells have a major role, the actual location of these stem cells, and to what extent and under what circumstances they are active, remains highly controversial. Similarly, while it is known that cell migration occurs throughout life in the cornea, its importance and even its direction have been disputed. Because maintenance of the corneal surface is fundamental to our eyesight it is essential that we understand the basic biology about how the cornea functions normally and reacts, in the short and long term, to injury.\n\nThis project will address the significant issues about stem cell localisation and activity, cell production, migration and loss, within the corneal surface epithelium. We will build upon a computer model that we have already developed that potentially explains some of the patterns of cell migration and loss that we have previously observed. We will refine that model using new biological data, and then use it to make testable predictions about how the cornea is maintained normally, how it is affected by ageing and genetic defects and how it responds to injury. We have an array of 'reporter' mice which, because they express fluorescent or other chemical markers in subsets of their corneal epithelial cells, can be used to trace patterns of cell production and migration in the cornea throughout life, starting during gestation and continuing into the ageing adult. Using these mice, we will be able to model genetic abnormalities and corneal injuries that test the predictions of the computer model. The mice will be used to show where the stem cells are localised in the cornea - knowledge that is essential to our understanding of how the epithelium is maintained. They will show how normal patterns of cell production and migration in the corneal surface are changed by injury and genetic defects, and also reveal whether these changes are long or short term. Changes in stem cell activity and migration patterns with ageing will also be determined using these mice - it is known for example that ageing human corneas heal less quickly than those from younger people. The refined model will have lasting benefits, as we will be able to use it to predict how different types of abnormalities occur in different corneal diseases. It will also contribute to reducing future animal experiments. \n\nOverall the project will generate key fundamental understanding of the processes that underlie corneal maintenance during normal life. We will be able to determine where the stem cells are, what they do and how replacement cells get to sites of injury. This knowledge will also help us understand why the corneal surface sometimes suffers degeneration and opacification that is difficult to treat. If new insights from our animal studies are applicable to humans this may also improve the management of corneal diseases or complications arising from operations such as laser eye surgery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J015172/1","grantId":"BB/J015172/1","fundValue":"269688","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The section of the report will be completed once the project is finished.

","person":"John Douglas West","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" Rather surprisingly, despite decades of clinical experience with corneal transplants, we have a poor scientific understanding of how the ocular surface is maintained. For example, although a large body of evidence exists, which implies that stem cells are involved, the details are hotly debated. It is accepted that there are stem cells in a region called the limbus at the periphery of the cornea. The limbal epithelial stem cell (LESC) hypothesis maintains that these are the only stem cells involved in corneal epithelial maintenance and that they are involved both in maintaining the corneal epithelium during normal homeostasis and also in repairing corneal epithelial wounds. However, the corneal epithelial stem cell (CESC) hypothesis maintains that these LESCs are only involved in wound healing and that there are other stem cells (CESCs) located throughout the corneal epithelium that maintain the corneal epithelium during normal homeostasis. \n\nWe are using a lineage tracing approach with transgenic mice to investigate where the stem cells that maintain the corneal epithelium during normal homeostasis are located. This enables us to switch on a genetic marker in a proportion of cells in the corneal and limbal epithelium and then determine which ones produce long-lived clones of labelled cells. \n\nWe have obtained the stocks of mice we need, made appropriate crosses and begun to induce lineage labelling. So far the method seems to be working well and preliminary results are very encouraging. These preliminary results indicate that labelled cells in the limbus do generate clones of cells that colonise the corneal epithelium during normal homeostasis, as predicted by the LESC hypothesis. However, work is still incomplete. This will not be known until the work is complete. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
