IMPULSE, whose consortium includes most\nIMPACT members together with new pipe, welding and innovative research partners, will take MARBN from the laboratory\non to full-scale industrial manufacture of ingot castings, pipework, and weldments. This will improve efficiency and reliability\nof current and future steel-based steam power plant, and thus increase security of supply and reduce cost and carbon\nemissions. MARBN 8-tonne ingot casting technology will be developed, and following high temperature (to 1250\ndegreesC+) testing and manufacturing simulation, two full-scale pipe extrusion trials will be undertaken, with product\nvalidation by testing and electron metallography. Matching welding consumables will also be developed, qualified and\ntested. Long term creep and creep-fatigue data generation will feed into performance validation, materials standardisation,\nand pressure vessel design codes. Interaction with the KMM-VIN collaboration will enable constructive interchange with\nparallel European projects.\nThe Birmingham team will characterise the grain structure and pinning particles in billet to be pierced and extruded into\npipe. A Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulator will compress samples representing this range of structures to varying strains\nat temperatures and strain rates suitable for hot extrusion to determine the flow stress behaviour and resulting grain sizes\nwill be measured. Additionally, ring-shaped samples will be compressed (same temperatures and rates) between\ninstrumented tools to determine heat transfer and friction coefficients. These data will be used in an FE-based model to\nsimulate the extrusion process so that process parameters (temperature, strain and strain rate) to develop the correct\nmicrostructure after welding and heat treatment can be determined.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N509978/1","grantId":"EP/N509978/1","fundValue":"85817","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Strangwood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
