Unlike European Facilities such beamtime does not come with money to support travel to the facility. The experiments form part of our ongoing and highly successful joint programme on magnetic scattering between Leeds and ISIS. The grant request is for travel and subsistence funds only to allow a team of three people to travel to Brookhaven for five weeklong periods in order to operate the experiment 24 hours a day. A unique aspect of this proposal is that we intend to make electrical measurements of our samples whilst they are undergoing the scattering studies / this will lead to a deeper understanding of the relationship between the physical and magnetic microstructures of our samples, which will be revealed by the x-ray measurements, and their spin-dependent electronic functional properties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F008783/1","grantId":"EP/F008783/1","fundValue":"29142","fundStart":"2007-05-03","fundEnd":"2009-05-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Hugh Marrows","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" In this project we made use of polarised soft X-rays to study a variety of magnetic phenomena in spintronic heterostructures, such as magnetic tunnel junctions, magnetic nanoparticles, and magnetostructural materials.
