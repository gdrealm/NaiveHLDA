This process requires the copying of vast amounts of DNA so that each daughter receives an accurate copy of all the genetic information required for survival. Because of the importance of generating accurate copies of the DNA, organisms have evolved very complex DNA replication machines that reduce the chances of mistakes being made. Unfortunately, we now know that many obstacles are encountered by these replication machines that, if not overcome, can cause mistakes in the copying process. Such mistakes can lead to errors in the genetic information that can have fatal consequences.\n\nProteins that coat the DNA form frequent obstacles to the DNA copying machinery. These proteins are essential in all organisms for maintaining, reading and packing the genetic information, and so cannot be avoided. Although the DNA replication machinery can successfully push off most of these proteins from the DNA to be copied, the sheer number of proteins bound to the DNA mean that occasionally the copying process is stopped in its tracks. However, a specific class of enzymes can repair and restart broken down DNA replication machines. It is clear that these recombination enzymes can help to copy DNA that is bound by proteins but how they do so remains unclear. One proposal is that if a DNA replication machine becomes blocked by a protein then recombination enzymes can restart DNA replication on the other side of the protein block. This pathway would skip over the block, allowing copying to continue, but would also result in genes near the protein block not being copied. Consequently the involvement of recombination enzymes could be seen as harmful, resulting in failure to copy all the genetic information needed by the two daughter cells to survive. Alternatively, we have proposed that recombination enzymes might simply restart DNA replication near to where it initially came to a halt. This might give the DNA replication machinery a second chance to push the blocking protein off the DNA and continue to copy all of the genetic information. Such a process might therefore provide a mechanism to ensure accurate copying of DNA coated with proteins.\n\nWe will use the model bacterium E. coli to determine the roles of recombination enzymes in copying DNA coated with proteins. We know a great deal about the basic mechanisms of both DNA replication and recombination in E. coli, allowing us to analyse how these two very complicated processes interact. We will determine the mechanisms by which recombination enzymes can help DNA replication machines to move through protein blocks. We will also establish what dictates the balance between accurate and inaccurate recombination mechanisms to understand when such processes might generate potentially very harmful changes to the genetic material.\n\nThe conflict between the need to copy DNA and the need to have proteins bound to the DNA is one that all organisms must somehow resolve. This work will address therefore exactly what drives the accumulation of mutations within genes and what mechanisms help to minimise this accumulation. Acquisition of mutations in the genetic material is the driving force of evolution but such mutations are frequently harmful rather than beneficial and so must be kept in check. This is illustrated by the importance of mutations in the acquisition of human genetic disorders and the development of cancer. Understanding fundamental mechanisms of DNA replication and recombination in E. coli has greatly advanced our knowledge of genetic stability in more complex organisms such as ourselves. We are now in a position to use E. coli to address the interplay between these critical processes, an interplay that is central to understanding how genes are copied in as accurate a manner as possible.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J014826/1","grantId":"BB/J014826/1","fundValue":"319668","fundStart":"2013-01-28","fundEnd":"2016-01-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project has been running for less than two years and so it is too early to have any measurable impact.
