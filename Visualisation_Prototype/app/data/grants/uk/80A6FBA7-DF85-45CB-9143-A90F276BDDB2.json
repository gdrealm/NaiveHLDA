A string of three bases is called a codon. Since\nDNA has four bases, a maximum of 64 (4x4x4) unique codons can be formed. Of the 64 possible codons, 61 are used to\nencode amino acids. There only 20 different amino acids used to construct proteins. Rather than having unused codons,\nlife uses a system in which an average of three different codons encode the same amino acid. Consequently, the same\nprotein sequence can be encoded with many different DNA sequences. Each DNA sequence will vary with respect to\nparameters such as translational efficiency, transcriptional efficiency, protein folding and ease of synthesis. Codon\noptimisation is an algorithmic process that seeks to pick the best possible variant for a given purpose. The research part of\nthis project seeks to develop a way of measuring how well different codon optimisation algorithms perform. This will be\ndone by obtaining different codon optimised genes and measuring how they behave in living systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M005585/1","grantId":"BB/M005585/1","fundValue":"101758","fundStart":"2014-07-30","fundEnd":"2015-07-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Julian Dickinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
