{"id":"F8AA8196-D383-4C66-B823-A34C16CAAC06","title":"Hypoxia/ischaemia in children: Patterns of neuropathology and associated memory impairment","abstractText":"We will work with support groups for children with memory problems and their parents, including the Encephalitis Support Group, Children?s Head Injury Trust, and others, to provide them with information about the syndrome of developmental amnesia and other types of memory disorders, and to provide suggestions for obtaining help to overcome the educational difficulties of memory-impaired children. To reach a wider audience, we will communicate information about this programme and the ways in which the research is helping children with memory problems, through a website, with links to each of the collaborating institutions featured in this application. We will also continue our contacts with the news media and bring to the attention of the public the plight of children with memory impairments, in the hope of raising public awareness. These efforts will feed in due course into the establishment of rehabilitation techniques for treatment of children?s memory problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300117","grantId":"G0300117","fundValue":"792019","fundStart":"2005-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Faraneh  Vargha-Khadem","coPersons":["Torsten  Baldeweg","John Eric  Deanfield","David Geoffrey Gadian","John Stephen Wyatt","Michelle  De Haan"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
