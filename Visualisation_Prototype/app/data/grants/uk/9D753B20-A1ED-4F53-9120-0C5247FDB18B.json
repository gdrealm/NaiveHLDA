This will combine the functionalities of a high-efficiency cooking stove, an electricity generator and a refrigerator (cool box), referred to as SCORE, and may be fuelled by burning a range of biomass products. The partnership brings together four UK universities, a leading US research centre (Los Alamos National Laboratory), a multi-national electrical goods manufacturer (GP Acoustics), an international charitable organisation (Practical Action), and numerous universities in Africa and Asia. It will also collaborate to ensure that the devices are acceptable at a technological, economic and social level and that there is sufficient scope for the communities to develop numerous businesses from the manufacture, repair and innovative applications of SCORE.The operation of the electricity generating and refrigerator parts of the proposed device will be based on a novel application of thermoacoustic processes. Fundamentally, these rely on the interaction between an acoustic field and solid boundaries, leading to a range of fluid- and thermo-dynamic processes, which do not require harmful working fluids or moving parts in the traditional sense; the electrical power extraction is accomplished by a linear alternator.The concept of the device is based on the proven thermoacoustic Stirling engines and refrigerators developed by Los Alamos, NASA and the US military for applications including: cooling of satellite systems and radar arrays, gas liquefaction and cryogenics, use of waste heat for air conditioning, separation of binary gas mixtures and many others. There is a significant level of innovation in the proposed work in three respects: 1) research into the combination of the thermoacoustic engine, linear alternator and cool box in a single device, powered by a biomass stove, which has not been attempted before,2) design of a rugged and inexpensive linear alternator that could be easily mass-produced, 3) the overall system design from the viewpoint of low cost, application of indigenous materials, use of local manufacturing skills and simplicity of assembly, which are major research issues compared to the high-cost and high-tech thermoacoustic systems produced so far. These challenges form the backbone of the proposed scientific and technological work programme.Within the overall 5-year duration, there will be two stages to this project: the first 3 years will mainly focus on conducting the necessary social and scientific research, while the last 2 years will broadly focus on technology hand-over, including representative field trials and a wide dissemination among target communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E044697/1","grantId":"EP/E044697/1","fundValue":"610481","fundStart":"2007-03-19","fundEnd":"2012-09-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research phase was completed in 2012. Score now continues in many places and much has been achieved since its inception.\n\n Score-Stove (TM)1, a clean cooking stove (no electricity) has been successfully trialled in Kenya.\n\n Score-Stove (TM)2 has generated 23 watts of electricity using wood as the fuel and 37 watts under laboratory conditions.\n\n Score-Stove (TM)3 is a compact thermo-electric unit that is being tested at Kathmandu University in Nepal.\n\n There are Score-Centres in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Kenya and Nepal that are testing stoves with local communities. \n\nThe NGO (charity) Practical Action is working with rural people to evaluate the stoves and ensure we get the best design. Universities such as BUET and Kathmandu University are modifying the stoves so that they are acceptable for local cooking needs. The University of Nottingham and its Malaysian campus are advancing research into the low-cost electrically generating technology.

It started as a ?2M research consortium, to significantly improve health, quality of life, economic growth and social and educational opportunities, and thus reduce poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian sub-continent and South America by understanding the energy needs of their rural communities and working with them to develop the capability to manufacture an affordable versatile domestic appliance. \nThere are two major variants of the Score-Stove(TM). Score-Stove(TM)1 is a low-smoke cookstove that does not generate electricity that has been installed in Nepal, Kenya and Zambia. Some installations also have PV cells to generate the electricity. Score-Stove(TM)2 is a low-smoke cookstove that also generates electricity using the thermo-acoustic effect. \n\nScore-Stove(TM)2 combines the functionality of a high-efficiency cooking stove, with an electricity generator that may be fuelled by burning a range of biomass products. The original Score Team was a research partnership that brought together four UK universities, Nottingham, City University London, Leicester, Queen Mary University of London and NGO (the international charitable organisation Practical Action). The results were disseminated at an international conference in April 2012. www.nottingham.ac.uk/lmh. City University London holds a world first of 23W electrical power from a wood burning thermo-acoustic engine, with new versions being developed.\n\n \n\nThe project has now widened to include other interested individuals and organisations in what we call the Score-community. Additionally, a Score-centre comprises a local University and organisation with field experience, normally Practical Action. The purpose of each centre is to adapt the stove for local use, provide training for manufacture and maintenance etc. \n\n \n\nThe ongoing goal of the project is to collaborate to ensure that the Score-Stoves are acceptable at a technological, economic and social level and that there is sufficient scope for the poor communities to develop numerous local businesses from the manufacture repair and innovative applications of Score and that the developed world contributes to the overall Score ethos.\n\n\nThe operation of the electricity generation is based on a novel application of Thermo-Acoustics originally based on a development by Los Alamos, NASA and the US military.

If successful and affordable, we intend to mass-market the design aiming at multi million installations.
