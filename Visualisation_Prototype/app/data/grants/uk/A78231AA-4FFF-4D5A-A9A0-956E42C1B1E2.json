It asks how listening has changed in relation to successive media of communication since sound was first 'captured' with the invention of the phonograph in the late nineteenth century. The phonograph (recording) and the radio (transmission) will be taken as the paradigmatic vehicles of mediated sound, but this project will engage with a broad spectrum of audio and audiovisual media, from the microphone to the telephone, the radio to digital audio, the talkies to television, the phonograph to the iPod. In short, the ambition is to amplify the specifically auditory roots of the word 'audience,' a word that combines the experiential with the public aspect of mediated culture. As such, it is a project that goes to the heart of media studies.\\nThe recording, manipulation and transmission of sound opened up the possibility of new industries, new prospects for the commodification of sound, new artistic practices, new cultures of listening, new subjectivities and, not least, new publics. \\nThe public sphere is a term which is usually associated with the realm of reasoned and active political debate in which the objective of political agency is to find a voice: to be listened to, rather than to listen. In contrast, this project sets out to treat listening as an activity in the public sphere, rather than as a code for the passivity long associated with audiences of mass media. This focus on listening invites an exploration of the experiential quality of the public sphere, since it is experience that mediates individual perception with social meaning. This intersubjective aspect in turn leads to questions about the ethics of listening in public communication.\\nListening is a key activity in the consumption of many media, and yet it has been curiously neglected in the field of media and cultural studies which has long been fascinated with print and visual culture. There has recently been a discernible growth in the number of publications interested in sound or auditory cultures (Sterne, 2003; Bull and Beck, 2004), but few have made a real impact on 'mainstream' media studies. Listening Publics is distinctive in setting out to provide a critical analysis of the public dimensions of auditory culture and to reveal listening as a fundamental critical category in the understanding of modern media and experience. \\nThe project examines detailed case studies from transitional moments in media and political history across the 'long twentieth century' and beyond the confines of a national history. The cases will be based on original archival research, textual and discursive analyses of the media, and critical readings of the secondary literature. Examples will be taken from the UK, Germany and the US. This broad approach allows comparisons to be drawn between different national and political cultures, and between contrasting models of media organisation - be they public service, propaganda or commercial. The research will also be sensitive to gendered and generational ways of listening, examining, for example broadcasting's domestication of the listening audience, or current trends of mobile, privatized listening in public space. \\nThe book's eleven chapters explore the 'modernization' of listening; sound in the age of spectacle; political, technological and aesthetic histories of sound media; listening in the home and in public spaces (with examples as diverse as Nazi loudspeakers to 'muzak'); and more abstract and philosophical questions such as the public sphere as 'auditorium' and the ethics of listening in a mediated world. \\nThe main objective is to make an original contribution to media history and theory by identifying and interrogating the neglected category of the 'listening public'. In linking historical analyses with current media developments, the book should be of interest to media scholars and anyone interested in the public role of media.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F014651/1","grantId":"AH/F014651/1","fundValue":"29969","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Katharine Elizabeth Lacey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
