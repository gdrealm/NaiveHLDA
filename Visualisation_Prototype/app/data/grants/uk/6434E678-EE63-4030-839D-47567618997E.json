Cannabis-like compounds (cannabinoids) act at CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are present in peripheral and brain tissue, and produce analgesic effects in animal models of chronic pain. Activation of CB2 receptors is not associated with side-effects and, as a result, CB2 receptors are a potential novel analgesic target for chronic pain states. This project will evaluate whether levels of cannabinoid receptors, and the endogenous compounds that activate these receptors, are modified in the spinal cord and brain in chronic pain states and if CB2 receptors in the spinal cord and brain are a novel analgesic target for these conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401647","grantId":"G0401647","fundValue":"379118","fundStart":"2005-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Victoria  Chapman","coPersons":["David  Kendall","Gregory J.
