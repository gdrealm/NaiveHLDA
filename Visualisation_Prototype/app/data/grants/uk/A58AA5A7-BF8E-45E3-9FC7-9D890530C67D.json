{"id":"A58AA5A7-BF8E-45E3-9FC7-9D890530C67D","title":"Investigating and optimising the chiral-flexo-electro-optic effect","abstractText":"The work is broken into three key work packages, reflecting the three points outlined in the aims above. The first package will look at the alignment issues associated with first forming and then maintaining a robust ULH structure. It forms the core of the proposal and studies both experimentally and theoretically the alignment and stabilisation of the helix using complex surfaces. This will include experimental work on surface micro-patterning, two and three dimensional surface relief structures, and work on polymer network stabilisation. It will concentrate on theoretical work to analyse the one-dimensional behaviour and looking at the interaction between bulk helical structures and uniform surfaces (in two and three dimensions). The second package will look in detail at the optical and electro-optical behaviour of the chrial-flexo-electro-optic effect. The third package will look at the complete system and device implementation issues. Modelling will allow understanding of how various parameters influence the structure formed and its behaviour under an applied electric field. The work package will integrate multi-dimensional optical modelling with the theory work to predict overall performance and look at the practical exploitation of alignment understanding developed in order to optimise performance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F013787/1","grantId":"EP/F013787/1","fundValue":"550910","fundStart":"2008-02-18","fundEnd":"2011-02-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen John Elston","coPersons":["E Peter Raynes"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
