{"id":"F700E343-FCDD-4AE5-90B6-9ECBFDC220AB","title":"Higgs Boson Decays in the Lancaster Particle Physics Package","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to interest young people in particle physics in general and in the continuation of Higgs physics at the LHC or another Higgs factory. The Lancaster Particle Physics Package allows users to control simulated particle collisions and to carry out various experiments. A new module of this package will be developed that, now that the Higgs boson has been found, focuses on the continuing story of particle physics: measuring branching ratios of Higgs decay modes and the Higgs self coupling (shape of the symmetry breaking potential).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L005476/1","grantId":"ST/L005476/1","fundValue":"8318","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Harald  Fox","coPersons":["Vakhtang  Kartvelishvili"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
