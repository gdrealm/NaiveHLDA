{"id":"9CF61D91-50B3-4E0F-AA4F-1C5C7D05DC57","title":"Relative Phase and Coherence in Bright Matter-Wave Solitons","abstractText":"Bright matter-wave solitons are self-stabilizing waves composed of ultracold atoms, which are robust to collisions, that is they behave in a particle-like way. They are formed from ultracold dilute atomic gases which have undergone a phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate, where the atoms in a sense all behave as one. Bright matter-wave solitons are observed to emerge from such an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate when, through appropriate control of magnetic fields, the atoms change from repelling one another, to feeling an attraction to one another. This process usually results in the formation of several solitons, which are generally thought to have a well-defined phase with respect to one another. In addition to their fundamental interest, bright matter-wave solitons offer advantages in matter-wave-based ideas on precision measurement. Such technologies require a source of reproducible bright matter-wave solitons and an understanding of their properties; it is therefore of crucial importance, as well as fundamental interest, to understand the process of soliton formation and soliton dynamics, particularly with regard to their phase properties and long-term stability.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G056781/1","grantId":"EP/G056781/1","fundValue":"361077","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project was primarily academic in nature, and so the findings have been primarily been further developed within the academic community.

In particular, we have learned about how a number of elements of a matter-wave soliton-based interferometer could be implemented, which could have implications in various kinds of high-precision sensors (of rotation, or short-range surface forces, for example. We have also made clearer the pathway from the quantum-mechanics underlings of the cold atom systems in which these bright matter-wave solitons are manifest, and the simplifying (but very useful) classical field treatment which is generally used. FInally, we made a great deal of progress in developing a formal and numerical approach (to consider self-consistent number conserving condensate and non-condensate dynamics), which in principle accounts for, in a very complete fashion, the possibility of destructive instabilities for which a pure classical treatment is no longer valid. As is typical in an academic, theoretical investigation, the goals of the project moved very substantially during the investigation. The very large number of good outcomes has made this a very successful project. This is primarily academic research, however our findings, with further development, could form the basis of precision atom-interferometric-based sensors (of rotations, or surface forces, for example). This is facilitated in Durham by the presence of Simon Cornish's atomic bright matter-wave soliton experiment (using rubidium 85). Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
