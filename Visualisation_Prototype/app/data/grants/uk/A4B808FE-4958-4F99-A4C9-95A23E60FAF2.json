The photonic biosensors will be developed using UV and femtosecond inscribed microstructures in speciality fibres, sensitised by post-inscription processing and bioactivated using bioactive affinity techniques. It is envisaged that, when developed, the highly bio-sensitive/selective optical sensors will have potential applications in genomics, proteomics and drug discovery research and development, as well as in environmental monitoring.The proposed programme intends making to form a strong interaction between the photonics technology and lifescience applications by carrying out this project collaboratively between the Photonics Research Group and Molecular Bioscience Research Group at Aston University.L.
