{"id":"FCCFC668-D223-497F-B428-DC6BAD0CF045","title":"MATEs - Microbial Applications to Tissue Engineering: An Exemplar of Synthetic Biology","abstractText":"Synthetic biology is a new emerging field of science which applies engineering principles to biology. In essence, the main concept behind synthetic biology is to design and construct new parts and devices, using biological knowledge, to make new biological systems with features not found in nature, as well as re-designing or re-engineering existing biological systems for more useful purposes. Therefore, to be successful in this new area requires cohesion and collaboration from engineers and scientists within an ethical, social and legal framework. This proposal requests funds to set up a network of world-class UK and international researchers from engineering, life sciences, ethics, law, sociology and biosecurity. The aim is to develop and generate ideas to address the key challenges and possibilities surrounding a specific scientific problem, i.e. the production of a cellular 'glue'. This 'glue' allows cells to attach to each other and to surfaces, and is useful, among other things, for making human tissue and skin. This network will explore the possibilities of reproducing and modifying the way nature produces the 'glue' to improve the process by designing an engineering solution using biological tools. Activities planned within this three year period include seminars and workshops where people from within engineering, the life sciences, ethics, legal, social and biosecurity fields come together to share their knowledge and develop new ideas jointly in a group and in a 'speed dating' environment. A conference buddy system (e.g. a biologist shadows an engineer at an engineering conference and vice versa) is also planned to help promote a deeper appreciation of each other's discipline. We will also extend invitations for visitors to come to Sheffield and exchange with members of the network. Scientific as well as social issues beginning explored in this network will also be discussed in an open forum with the general public. Hence, within three years, this network of researchers will have the necessary skills and public engagement/consultation to tackle a challenging project in synthetic biology focussed on human health and medicine. The network of researchers will also be able to contribute to new technologies and materials derived from breakthroughs in the synbio field which are being developed in areas as diverse as cheap anti-malarial drugs for 3rd world countries and non-greenhouse producing biofuels such as hydrogen.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F018681/1","grantId":"BB/F018681/1","fundValue":"135520","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Phillip Craig  Wright","coPersons":["Robert K  Poole"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
