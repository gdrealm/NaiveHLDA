The human visual system operates over a very wide range of light levels from bright sunlight to almost complete darkness. This requires a corresponding wide range of sensitivity and the rod and cone photoreceptors are physiologiclly adapted to fulfill this need. Cones are relatively insensitive to light; they provide therefore vision in daylight the different classes also give colour vision. Rods on the other hand are very sensitive to light and operate at very low light levels. They do not provide for any perception of colour, hence objects appear monochromatic in dim light. The different sensitivities of cones and rods is determined by a range of processes that operate within the cells. We have recently identified the gene which encodes a potassium channel protein Kv8.2 that underlies a blinding disorder that is described as 'cone dystrophy with supernormal rod electroretinogram (ERG)'. As the named implies, the disorder affects the sensitivity of photoreceptors to light which is fundamental to the ability to see under different levels of illumination. Potassium (K+) channel proteins are central to the electrical activity of photoreceptors and are responsible in part for setting the current flow of the photoreceptors in the dark. This is directly related to the subseqent sensitivity of the photoreceptor to light. The objective of the project is to obtain a detailed understanding of the role of Kv8.2 in phototransduction. The approaches that will be used will include the study of an animal model with a knock-out mutation and in vitro studies of channel proteins. In this way, we will be able to define the role of relevant K+ channel in the intact retina from observations on the electrical activity of photoreceptors in mutant and normal mice. In addition, studies on the in vitro activity of the channel will define its pharmacology and interaction with other proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E023142/1","grantId":"BB/E023142/1","fundValue":"427099","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Martin Hunt","coPersons":["Robin Raihan Ali","Martin  Stocker","Thomas  Salt","Andrew Royston Webster"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
