{"id":"4A312203-3AD0-41A8-BD0A-357D766B359C","title":"The Dynamics of Nationalist Evolution in Contemporary Spain","abstractText":"<p>The broad aims of the project are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>to identify the pattern of evolution of nationalist movements in Spain in terms of a series of dynamics (interaction with central government, pressures from the support bases of nationalist parties, competition between parties within the home region, transversal influence across regions and international influences)</li>\n\n <li>to compare and contrast the experience of Basque and Catalan nationalist parties in respect of competing trends towards radicalisation, on the one hand, and territorial accommodation, on the other. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The principal focus is on the period since 1993, which has seen examples both of nationalist parties collaborating at the parliamentary level with Spanish socialist and conservative governments and of mainstream nationalist parties asserting rights to Catalan and Basque sovereignty and self-determination.</p>\n\n<p><br />The project will make extensive use of interviews with practitioners and experts involved in nationalist politics in Spain, in addition to archival and survey material. Apart from fieldwork, two workshops are envisaged with relevant experts and stakeholders, one in Spain and the other (with a comparative focus) in the UK. A linked PhD studentship, in the context of the North-West Doctoral Training College, focuses on the role of nationalist politicians elected to the Spanish Parliament.<br /><br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J007854/1","grantId":"ES/J007854/1","fundValue":"182990","fundStart":"2012-11-30","fundEnd":"2015-11-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Henry Gillespie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
