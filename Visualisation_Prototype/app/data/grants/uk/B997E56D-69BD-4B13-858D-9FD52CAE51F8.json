{"id":"B997E56D-69BD-4B13-858D-9FD52CAE51F8","title":"Sandpit: Airport Energy Technologies Network","abstractText":"From 10-14 November 2008, at Shrigley Hall, Cheshire, SK10 5SB, a Research Councils' Energy Programme Sandpit to generate and develop innovative approaches to airport operations was held, resulting in a number of funded projects. This Network proposal is also an output of the event, reflecting the unanimous view that a Network was indispensible to take advantage of the Sandpit energy and cross-disciplinary synergies. To this end, the Network will be directed by the Principal and co-Investigators, who will be joined on the Organising Committee by the Principal Investigators of the successfully funded projects. Initially, Network membership will be drawn from the Sandpit participants who all expressed an interest in participating (Table 1), however it is desirable that as part of its remit, the Network strive for as wide and as multidisciplinary membership as possible.An example of a network organisation working in the area of Aeronautical Operations is Omega, a publicly funded academic partnership which was set up in January 2007. The partnership, which brings together aviation knowledge from 9 UK Universities, acts as an independent body to share knowledge in a neutral forum to engage with key players in the development of a sustainable aviation industry. The contrasting basic raison d'etre of the network described in this proposal is to develop a research community and its links with the key industrial and commercial players. The Sandpit participants have produced proposals which represent high value to commerce and industry in terms of energy efficiency, reduced emissions, and compliance with future operating practices and legislation. However, the core requirements of Sandpit membership is the generation of different perspectives, innovation, and fresh insights from disciplines and market sectors not traditionally associated with this field. It is this concept which is core to differentiating the proposed network from existing groups. It must also be noted that the associated high risk of the projects proposed at the sandpit would be unlikely candidates for funding through traditional avenues. The proposed network is unique in this way, and will undertake a vital role in bringing its members high risk, high adventure research to general acknowledgement and acceptance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H003150/1","grantId":"EP/H003150/1","fundValue":"201103","fundStart":"2009-07-13","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The outputs of the network have been used to identify and develop new collaborative ventures, which are finding their way into be RCUK and H2020 grant proposals and associated activity.
