The innovative element is based upon an optimised combination of momentum reversal and lift mechanisms using very large blade incidence changes. This unique combination allows the turbine to self start, be fully bi-directional, a robust, modular design with high predicted efficiency. High reliability is expected as is minimal environmental impact. The system will offer low capital investment, low infrastructure costs, high reliability and operability, ease of maintenance and is scaleable and highly competitive in the ocean energy sector. The project will also consider scales, array configurations and operating strategies for this new technology and compare to existing technologies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F003013/1","grantId":"DT/F003013/1","fundValue":"97564","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin  Tabor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
