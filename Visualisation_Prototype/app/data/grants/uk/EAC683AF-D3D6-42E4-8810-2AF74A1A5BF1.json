To take a recent example, the giant magnetoresistance of certain layered materials rapidly moved from experimental discovery to theoretical understanding and then to the scientific underpinning of modern hard drives. As well as its technological importance, the occurrence of such unanticipated behaviour in apparently simple materials provides a vital experimental window upon fundamental physics.A central challenge facing theoretical physicists is to determine the collective quantum behaviour of many interacting electrons. There have been notable successes along the way- the theory of Landau and Fermi (known as Landau-Fermi-liquid theory) showed that in many situations, even if the electrons interact strongly, they behave almost as though they were not interacting, but with modified individual characteristics. However, a large (and increasing) number of materials have been discovered whose electronic behaviour cannot be described by the Landau-Fermi-liquid theory. Physicists have struggled to formulate a unified picture to explain these non-Fermi liquid materials. A great leap forwards was made with the formulation of the theory of quantum criticality. This theory describes the behaviour of systems that are finely balanced between classical and quantum behaviour- usually systems that are near to a zero-temperature magnetic phase transition i.e. systems that show a change from magnetic to non-magnetic behaviour as some parameter such as pressure is varied at close to absolute zero. A large number of materials appear to be described by the theory of quantum criticality.In recent years, problems have been found in this theory. Whenever one tries to perform experiments very close to the point at zero temperature where the transition in magnetic behaviour ought to occur, one finds something very different- often the electrons are organised in a completely different way. At the same time, theoretical physicists have realised that the mathematics which was thought to describe the magnetic quantum phase transition is not self-consistent. This inconsistency is not minor --- it suggests a fundamental breakdown in our understanding of strongly correlated systems. The hope amongst physicists is that in resolving these issues a new broader understanding of the nature of collective quantum behaviour will result. This is a particularly fruitful time for such investigations as a number of theoretical and experimental ingredients are in place and ripe for combining to form the new theory.These ideas apply not only to electron systems, but also to other systems with many interacting quantum particles. The investigation of ultra-cold atoms confined by a combination of lasers and magnetic fields presents perhaps a cleaner forum for the experimental investigation of these ideas. As indicated above, not only is this work important our fundamental understanding of the world, it is also likely to feed directly into technology. As our manipulation of the nano-world leads us further and further into the quantum realm, it is imperative that we understand its nature.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H049797/1","grantId":"EP/H049797/1","fundValue":"283758","fundStart":"2010-10-15","fundEnd":"2014-04-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Although the results are fundamental in character, the main objective to understand quantum matter and quantum phase transitions, have deep societal and economic impacts.\nThe understanding of new materials that can be used in many different forms in new technologies and in the more focus research on quantum computing, has transformative impact and long term consequences in society.\nMore immediate is the impact of the work on graphene and the topological insulators will have, as graphene is a prime candidate for new electronics.\nThe work on ferromagnetic superconductors, surface magetism as well as the Lifshitz Fermi surface transition, can be very instrumental in understanding deeply materials that can have potential technological applications.\nFurthermore one publication that came from the collaboration of the PI, within this award, was about &quot;how to test the quantumness of a quantum computer&quot; where a procedure was put forward with very obvious consequences for the economy and the society.

Interactions lead to different phases of the same material, depending on the external conditions and chemical controlled compositions. Some important phases exhibit magnetism or superconductivity and are very important for technological applications as well as for uncovering fundamental knowledge. \n\nDuring the period of this award, we did several studies, starting mostly from experimental results, where we provided explanations of existing data or predicted future ones. Our work involved materials that show quantum critical behavior at low temperatures with complex phases such as ferromagnetic superconductors and the compound sodium cobaltate. In addition, we worked with new materials such as graphene and topological insulators and cold atoms. \n\nThe results were fundamental and general. In more detail: (i) we provided a microscopic explanation that used very sophisticated theoretical tools, on an 10-year old puzzle, posed by experiments on certain ferromagnetic superconductors that showed unexpected damping rate which was non-zero when it should (non-Landau damping). \n(ii) we put forward a detailed study of the effects of the interaction on the so-called Lifshitz transition in condensed matter. This is a transition where a new part of the Fermi surface, appears as a result of tuning an external parameter, making the Fermi surface to change topology. \n(iii) We explain new data obtained at the surface of the antiferromagnet uranium dioxide, as a Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii transition. \n(iv) Studied the magnetization properties in a magnetic field of graphene and the response to laser fields of graphene and topological insulators. Our theoretical work provides guidance and explanations for experimental colleagues and also conceptual framework for fellow theorists. At this stage, they will be used by the research community for a deeper understanding of the behavior of quantum matter. Electronics,Energy,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
