It is estimated that of every ten drugs that enter clinical trials, only one will reach the marketplace. A dropout rate of this magnitude, with its associated human and financial costs, would not be tolerated in any other industry. This dropout rate is directly attributable to present technology's inability to quickly determine how effectively a drug is working, to accurately predict what will happen in the human body based on results of tests in the laboratory, and to determine variations in drug response from one person to another. All disease processes and all drug effects, leave a fingerprint in the complex pattern of proteins in the blood. If these fingerprints could be accurately interpreted, then a simple and quick blood test would provide clear and precise information about the progression of disease and the effectiveness of drugs. All cells in the body have a switch, which if activated, causes the cell to die. This programmed cell-death is very important in maintaining a proper balance of healthy cells. Anti-cancer drugs often work by triggering one of the cell-death switches. This involves the activation of a family of molecules in the cell called caspases, which in turn, activate irreversible cellular damage and finally cell death. The by-products of this cell death process are released into the blood. The normal levels of these by-products are very low, and increases are seen when tumour cells are being destroyed by drugs. Hence, provided a detailed understanding can be obtained of how the concentration of these bi-products in the blood relates to cell death, then a simple blood test could quickly and easily determine whether a given anti-cancer drug is killing cancer cells in the tested patient. (At present, the patient often has to wait weeks or even months to see if a drug is working. If it is not, it is unfortunately often too late to change the treatment.) The classic approach to testing drugs in humans is based on pharmacokinetics i.e. how widely a drug is distributed in the body, its peak concentration in the blood and how rapidly is it eliminated. What pharmacokinetic measurements do not provide, however, is any indication of how effectively the drug is working: this is what is called pharmacodynamics. In some cases it is possible to infer drug effect from drug concentration. When these conditions are not met, then the relationship is not clear and therefore the usefulness of traditional pharmacokinetic modelling is limited. In these cases pharmacodynamic data and modelling is vital.Cyclacel Ltd. study anti-cancer drugs that act by perturbing the cell cycle (the sequence of events leading to cell division). To fully understand how these drugs work, requires a quantitative model of this complex interactive system, an understanding of how the drug dose (concentration and timing) relates to drug effects and how these effects can be quickly and simply measured in a given patient. Cyclacel believes that by working with a team of mathematicians experienced in modelling complex systems, it should be possible to gain a much better understanding of drug effects in humans, and improve the success rate in clinical trials.In this project, we therefore propose to develop novel mathematical models to obtain a better understanding of the link between anticancer drugs, cell-death and by-product concentration in the blood. This work will assist in the development of a simple and quick diagnostic tool with which to test the effectiveness of anti-cancer drugs. This diagnostic tool could help to devise useful drug combinations, to individualise treatment for a specific patient and in the long term, could be used to predict the efficacy of an experimental treatment without the need to wait many months for a measurable outcome.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D043859/1","grantId":"EP/D043859/1","fundValue":"152908","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Fordyce Alexander Davidson","coPersons":["Mark Andrew Chaplain"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" The cell cycle is carefully regulated by a series of checkpoints that ensue accurate coordination of the many tasks associated with cell replication. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures that duplicate chromosomes are correctly aligned before separation and subsequent cell division. Certain proteins (the Aurora kinases) are required to ensure this process works correctly. If these proteins are inhibited, then cell damage results, possible leading to cell death. Hence, inhibiting these proteins using drugs is being explored as a possible way of killing cancerous cells. Using a combination of mathematical modelling and pharmacological data, in this project, we constructed an integrated mathematical model that allowed for the first time a quantitative link between drug dose and the effect of that drug to be formed. We were able to test different drug scheduling regimes and make predictions regarding the effects on cell damage. The model revealed other novel, potentially useful and unexpected features of using Aurora kinase inhibitors such as its ability to hold or &quot;stack&quot; cells in a certain phase of the cell cycle. The modular modelling approach developed in the project is sufficiently general in structure to be used in a wide variety of situations. Hence, it has potential to be used in the development of a range of drugs therapies by the wider pharmaceutical industry. This project was funded under the Mathematics for Business programme and involved close collaboration with the pharmaceutical company Cyclacel Ltd., This work has contributed to a basic scientific understanding of the Cyclacel Aurora kinase inhibitor CYC116, which is at present in phase 1 trials.
