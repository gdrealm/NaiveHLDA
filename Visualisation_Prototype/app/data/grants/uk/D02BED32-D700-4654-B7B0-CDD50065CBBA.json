However, despite the extensive interest in their use on the basis of both architectural attraction and structural efficiency, a complete absence of fire resistance design guidance is restraining applications. The proposed project aims to overcome this through investigating the performance of elliptical steel sections subjected to severe fire and to develop preliminary simplified fire design guidance and rules. The study is based on reliable high standards fire experiments, theoretical understanding, and sophisticated finite element numerical modelling. Fire testing will be the key instrument for obtaining the fundamental data required, and once calibrated, numerical modelling will be used to conduct a parametric study to investigate the importance of the individual parameters and to extend the range of available data. The study will involve investigating steel hollow and concrete filled elliptical steel sections subjected to severe fire scenarios. Design rules will be developed taking into account the fire engineer, with careful consideration given to finding the right balance between accuracy of result and ease of calculation methods. Dissemination of the findings of this research will be made through an internet website, journal publications and by presentation at international conferences. This novel study will be the first investigation to study the fire resistance of restrained elliptical hollow and concrete filled steel columns.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H048782/1","grantId":"EP/H048782/1","fundValue":"230434","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Faris  Ali","coPersons":["Ali  Nadjai"],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":" The EPSRC project has been successfully completed in 24 months and overachieving its objectives. The work represents the first ever research in the world that investigated the performance of columns with steel elliptical sections in fire. The research work consisted of experimental part where 51 columns were tested under the severe hydrocarbon fire curve. The experimental research was supported by a numerical finite element study where an extensive parametric study was performed. The fire tests involved columns with hollow and concrete filled steel elliptical sections where parameters of loading, axial restraint and slenderness were investigated. The valuable data and conclusions obtained from the research have been disseminated in published Journal papers, conferences, dissertations and keynote lectures. The research has enabled obtaining valuable and important conclusions where some of the main key findings are summarised. \n\nThe research has shown that the EC3 method, for calculating critical steel temperatures for unrestrained columns provides safe predictions of fire resistance. The calculated EC3 critical temperatures are extremely conservative for columns of low slenderness. This margin reduced as the slenderness increased for Class 1-3 members. For Class 4 members, the EC critical temperatures are also extremely conservative. Unlike the Class 1-3 members, these cautious predictions increased as the slenderness increased. However for axially restrained elliptical columns the EC3 method does not provide reliable fire resistance estimation as it overestimates the fire performance of columns. This requires further attention for future development of EC3. It is important to emphasise that additional axial forces generate if axial restraint is imposed against column's thermal expansion. Therefore, careful consideration must be given in fire design of columns with oval sections when subjected to axial restraint as the extra loads generated due to axial restraint can substantially accelerate failure and reduce fire resistance. At 40% loading level the extra generated forces due to axial restraint can reach 20% of the load capacity in columns with hollow sections and 9.5% in columns with concrete filled sections. In the case of elliptical hollow sections, up to 20% reduction in fire resistance can be expected under axial restraint for slenderness higher than 34. For stockier columns of slenderness less than 34 the reduction in fire resistance due to axial restraint can reach 32%. \n\n\n\nA unique thermal behaviour of concrete filled elliptical section columns subjected to fire (from all sides) has been observed. Under fire, points in the concrete core may experience significantly higher temperatures than other points located at the same distances (in the same plane) from the steel shell (being the source of heating) .i.e. temperatures of points located at the same distance and the same plane in the concrete core may not be the same as expected. This is due to a distinctive thermal profile as the temperatures' contour lines (at the concrete core) follow the oval shape of the steel shell. For example in a horizontal section (assuming the column is vertically aligned) the temperature at the mid-points between the steel shell and the centre of the concrete core (along the minor and major axis of the oval shape) can be the same. This is in spite of their different (double) distance from the exposed steel shell (the heating source). Therefore extra care must be taken when designing concrete filled oval columns under fire. \n\nCaution must also be taken particularly when designing for the Ultimate and Serviceability Limit States as oval sections are prone to local buckling including the &quot;elephant-foot&quot; mode which can be damaging to the surrounding structural elements. It was found that elliptical section columns are more prone for the &quot;elephant-foot&quot; buckling mode when subjected to axial restraint. The columns failure can also be a combination of overall buckling resulting in some localised plate buckling. \n\nThe research has also shown that filling elliptical hollow sections with concrete is not expected to make significant increase in columns' fire resistance particularly under high loading levels. This is more evident when the slenderness of the section increases as the failure times under high loadings are approximately the same in hollow and concrete filled sections. In concrete filled sections the area of the contact surface between the concrete core and the steel shell significantly affects the expansion of the column where a decrease in the axial thermal displacement up to 46% for low load ratios and up to 76% under higher load should be expected. Extra care must be given to provide holes in the steel skin of concrete filled columns subjected to fire as significantly high vapour pressure can build up inside the concrete core. This can cause severe explosions and rupture of the steel shell particularly for slender sections. In concrete filled sections, and in spite that the fire resistance of the columns (in the critical temperature domain) is reduced under higher loads and restraint, the time for the column to reach the critical temperature increases. This can be attributed to the effect of the thermal and specific heat capacity of concrete. In addition, filling the elliptical sections with concrete has an effect on the amount of restraint forces generated under fire. If compared with hollow sections the value of the generated restraint forces is less in concrete filled sections. This can be attributed to the concrete core restraining the steel shell from expanding and the fact that the steel skin is heated at lower rates due to the effect of concrete thermal impact.
