Leading researchers and students at the beginning of their careers will be able to meet and benefit from the exchange of scientific ideas, leading to new research developments in areas as diverse as efficient computer network simulation and targeted design of drugs with attendant benefits for human and animal health. Despite addressing different application areas the scientists involved use similar mathematical methods deploying stochastic simulation and differential equations. This event provides a unique opportunity for crossover and cross-fertilisation of research ideas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F013817/1","grantId":"EP/F013817/1","fundValue":"4124","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Muffy  Calder","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
