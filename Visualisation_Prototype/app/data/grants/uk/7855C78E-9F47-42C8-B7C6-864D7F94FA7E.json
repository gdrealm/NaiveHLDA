Individuals with Alzheimer’s suffer from memory loss, disorientation and impairment of judgement and reasoning. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), are relatively rare but have received much attention in recent years because of the potential number of individuals in the UK affected following the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). A major issue of current concern is that blood donors may be subclinically infected with the BSE agent and could potentially transmit variant CJD via blood transfusion to healthy individuals. The primary aim of our work is to provide more information on the two key proteins, Alzheimer’s amyloid precursor protein and prion protein, that are implicated in these diseases. Through a molecular and cell biological approach our work will provide information on the normal cellular roles of these proteins, the way in which they are normally processed, and what goes wrong to these processes in the disease situation. The results from our work may aid in the identification of novel therapeutic targets which could subsequently be exploited as potential treatments for these diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9824728","grantId":"G9824728","fundValue":"2467130","fundStart":"1999-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel Mark Hooper","coPersons":["Anthony John Turner"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
