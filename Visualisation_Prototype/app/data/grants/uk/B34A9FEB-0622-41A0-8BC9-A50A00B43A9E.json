The study compared results within the UK, and between the UK and Ireland. As the EU is a relatively new organisation, it was anticipated that symbolic triggers (like the EU flag) would not provoke the same deep-seated responses as a national flag might. Therefore, central to this project was the effect of daily functional visual reminders of EU membership - for example on car registration plates and driving licences.The experiments also manipulated the context in which the individual was exposed to the triggers (threatening or non-threatening). We found that exposure to EU symbols, and the context in which this exposure takes place, does indeed affect attitudes.The results of this research are also relevant to those interested in measuring the impact of implicit exposure to other images, such as: national flags; party political symbols or corporate logos on the attitudes and behaviour of the public. \n\n\n\nThe approach proved fruitful in relation to all three project objectives:\n\n\n\nObjective 1: We argued that to understand the impact of EU identity on political attitudes both implicit and explicit aspects of identity and the interaction between instrumental and affective elements of identification must be examined. We found that 'functional' rather than 'symbolic' EU triggers had a significant effect on attitudes towards the European Union. The symbolic version of the EU flag had no effect on EU-related opinions. The effect of 'functional' triggers, moreover, was observed only in relation to 'instrumental' rather than 'affective' attitudes. Our findings also highlighted the important interaction between coexisting territorial identities and EU identity in moderating the impact of EU related identity triggers. We found that exposure to the EU 'functional' trigger, moderated by attachment to the EU, led to polarisation of opinion in the two stateless nations of Scotland and Wales. We also found a positive relationship between national identity, EU funding and responses to implicit triggers. Finally, we found that when exposure to the EU symbol is presented in a subtle threat context, pro-EU responses increase.\n\n\n\nObjective 2: We developed a unique template (including visual material) for use in experimental survey research. The study also produced a comparative research design which can be extended to include other nations, whether EU member states or stateless nations. The template has already been adapted for potential use in other countries (in our collaboration with Aarhus, Berlin and Humboldt Universities), in relation to the UK Constitutional debate (in our British Academy study) and for a popular knowledge exchange quiz run in conjunction with the BBC in May 2012. Our methodological contribution is highlighted in Lynngaard et al (2013) 'Research Methods in European Union Studies'. \n\n\n\nObjective 3: In May 2011 YouGov delivered a large dataset (n8599) covering respondents in the UK territories and Ireland. The use of online experiments allowed us to produce a sample much larger than those typically used in experimental research, thus avoiding the small 'n' critique. The Implicit Triggers team collaborated with the BBC on the 'Mood of the Nation' online experiment. This tested the impact of implicit exposure to the various UK flags on public attitudes. The experiment proved popular, with 10405 people participating. Participants disseminated the quiz widely using social networks.The results were reported on BBC1 Sunday Politics Scotland and BBC2 Daily Politics and were made available on the BBC web site. The template developed by the implicit triggers team lends itself easily to adaptation to other questions, cues and audiences. The results of this research are also relevant to those interested in measuring the impact of implicit exposure to other images, such as: national flags; party political symbols or corporate logos on the attitudes and behaviour of the public. \n\n\n\nThe implicit triggers team have subsequently been funded by the British Academy to adapt their research template for application to the UK constitutional question.
