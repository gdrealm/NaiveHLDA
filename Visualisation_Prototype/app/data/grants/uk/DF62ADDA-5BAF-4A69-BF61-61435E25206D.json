{"id":"DF62ADDA-5BAF-4A69-BF61-61435E25206D","title":"Labor Regulation, Employment, Inequality, Social Security, and Informality: Theory and Evidence from Brazil","abstractText":"Given the rigidity of its labour code, it is puzzling that the levels of wage and employment flexibility in Brazil are comparable to those in the US, where labour law is far less strict. Could it be that labour market institutions have minimal effects on flexibility or, alternatively, are they simply weakly enforced? The strength of the enforcement effort conditions how labor regulation affects job flows and other outcomes, such as employment, or income inequality. The effect of regulation on inequality is particularly important in Brazil where, in spite of recent improvements, inequality is still higher than almost anywhere else in the world.\n<br />\n<br />A consequence of Brazilâ€™s size and diversity is that the levels of enforcement vary widely across cities. For example, recent administrative data (collected by the Ministry of Labour) shows that, in 2002, labour inspectors paid no visits to firms in the city of Itapipoca, Ceara, but visited as many as one out of every ten firms in Irituia, Para. This project intends to use variation in the degree of enforcement to analyze the effect of labour regulation on employment, inequality and poverty. More deeply, the aim is to understand in detail the workings of the labour market in a regulated economy with an informal sector.\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2805","grantId":"RES-000-22-2805","fundValue":"83061","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Pedro  Carneiro","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
