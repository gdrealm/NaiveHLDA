Laboratory research is rapidly characterising the key genes, or molecular switches, that regulate cellular behaviour, allowing the identification of the defects in these switches that result in the loss of cell control and cancer growth. A common feature of a large number of human cancers including prostate, ovarian, breast, colorectal, brain and childhood cancers is defective molecular switches of a key cellular pathway called the PI3K pathway. Loss of control of this pathway is very common in prostate cancer. Researchers at the Cancer Research UK Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, at the Institute of Cancer Research, have developed rationally designed drugs specifically targeting PI3K, in collaboration with colleagues at PIramed. These drugs stop tumour growth in the laboratory, and due to their high selectivity have an attractive side-effects profile, unlike cancer chemotherapy, sparing the patient unwanted adverse effects. Since there is overwhelming laboratory evidence supporting the development of anticancer drugs against this pathway, particularly in prostate cancer patients, we now propose the first clinical trials of PDP-101620, a drug developed against this key switch, in consenting patients with advanced cancer who have failed all known anticancer treatments. This clinical trial will first evaluate whether PDP101620 can safely prevent the function of PI3K, the critical molecular switch it was specifically designed to block. Once this is successfully completed, the optimal dose and administration frequency resulting in maximal anticancer effect will be determined utilising sophisticated molecular testing and cancer imaging. This will then lead to the evaluation of PI3K blockade by PDP-101620 in patients with advanced prostate cancer, whose cancer has spread outside the prostate and failed standard treatment. The effect that this target modulation has on advanced prostate cancer growth will be determined. It is envisioned that treatment with PDP-101620 will inhibit prostate cancer growth in many but not all patients with this disease, resulting in patient benefit by prolonging survival and improving quality of life with a favourable side-effect profile. These studies will support the prospective identification of patients likely to benefit from PDP101620.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0502133","grantId":"G0502133","fundValue":"460809","fundStart":"2007-02-26","fundEnd":"2010-08-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Johann Sebastian De Bono","coPersons":["Gary  Cook","David Paul  Dearnaley","Christopher  Parker","Debashis  Sarker","Ian  Judson","Martin  Leach","Colin Stephen  Cooper","Geoffrey  Payne","Florence  Raynaud","Stanley  Kaye","Nandita  DeSouza"],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
