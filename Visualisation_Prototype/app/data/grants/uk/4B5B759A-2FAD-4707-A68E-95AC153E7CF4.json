Problems associated with the development of eggs are a major cause of infertility and early embryo loss (miscarriage). One of the reasons why eggs are so vulnerable is that they go through a specialised process known as meiosis. This process starts during foetal life and does not finish until after the egg is fertilized; more than 40 years later in some cases. Furthermore, women are born with all the eggs that will be available for her reproductive lifespan; no new eggs can be made. In meiosis the egg stops and starts at different stages but spends most of its life in a so-called ?dormant? state in the ovary. At some point the egg starts to grow increasing in diameter by 5 fold and in volume by about 300 fold to become one of the largest cells in the body (one-tenth of a millimetre across). Through all of this process the egg remains arrested in development and it is not until just before ovulation that the egg continues meiosis and halves the number of chromosomes. This meiotic division is prone to errors and is the single main reason why there is such a dramatic decrease in fertility as women get older, particularly over the age of 40. We are using mouse eggs to try to understand how meiosis works so that we can understand more about how to keep eggs arrested and healthy in the ovary and how they can go through the meiotic division without errors that cause poor quality embryos. Advances in our research are communicated in scientific journals, specialist websites and by press releases to the mainstream media. This way we aim to keep scientists, those with special interest and the public aware of our MRC funded research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001705","grantId":"G1001705","fundValue":"1817000","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Carroll","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
