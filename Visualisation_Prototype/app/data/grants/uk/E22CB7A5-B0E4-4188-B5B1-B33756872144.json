It will also provide a forum for the development of international links through the participation of invited overseas speakers who are leading researchers in the field.</p> \n<p>The series consists of five half-day seminars spread over two years plus one mini-conference. The seminar topics comprise:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>branding and marketing,</li> \n <li>child and youth consumption,</li> \n <li>representation and consumption,</li> \n <li>marginalized consumers,</li> \n <li>citizenship and new forms of social and political participation.</li>\n</ul> \n<p>The final two-day mini-conference will focus on health, identities and consumption.</p> \n<p>Each seminar will involve one international speaker and one postgraduate speaker, along with one UK-based academic speaker. The final conference will include international keynote speakers, panels on specified topics involving a combination of researchers, policymakers and practitioners.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4062","grantId":"RES-451-25-4062","fundValue":"14162","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Griffin","coPersons":["Isabelle  Szmigin","Ann Alison Phoenix","Beverley Elizabeth Skeggs","Robert  MacDonald"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
