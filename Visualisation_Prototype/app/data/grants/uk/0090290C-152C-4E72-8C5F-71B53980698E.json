Early deficits that impact attention, learning, social interaction are not only disabling in themselves, but may also preclude normal environmental experiences, thus further perturbing experience-dependent brain development. Therefore, there is growing interest in addressing not only the symptoms of these disorders but also their underlying neurobiological causes.\n\nOur proposal is based on the observations that two well-studied signalling pathways may be involved in FXS pathogenesis: the ERK pathway and the mTOR pathway. Both of these pathways are potential drug targets and may be modulated by some commonly used drugs. Our goal is to test the potential efficacy and safety of modulating these pathways using pharmacological or genetic means in a FXS mouse model. If successful, these studies will provide fast and direct applications to clinical trials in patients and will also help select patients with neurodevelopmental disabilities that may benefit from these and related treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M006336/1","grantId":"MR/M006336/1","fundValue":"456455","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Emily  Osterweil","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
