Key findings are on\nLearning design practice \n1. Learning design is a complex practice of solving ill-structured cognitive problems. Therefore design guidance had to make the problem space more tractable for the teacher without overly constraining choices.\n2. Teachers in HE use many theories (sometimes none) to inform their learning design, although pragmatic considerations take priority.\n3. Teachers' concepts of learning design tend to match those of the Learning Design research community. This is an encouraging indication that a digital tool underpinned by this approach might be well received by HE teachers in general.\n4. Teachers can see the value to their own practice of capturing, representing, and manipulating their learning designs in a computing system.\n\nConcepts and activity representation \n1. It is feasible to migrate good pedagogical designs across discipline areas by modifying a formal description. From generic and specific instances of a design, teachers can select a generic design and test their own content in it before adopting and elaborating it for their own context.\n2. Being able to estimate the costs of teacher time, and the effect on the learning experience of class size, TEL activities, and contrasting types of teaching-learning activity, was seen as having considerable value for institutions and departments. \n\nModelling learning design \n1. It is feasible to create learning designs that can be computationally analysed to provide useful visual feedback to teachers, with meaningful verbal and graphical representations.\n2. Teachers vary in their ability to map their practice to the concept terminology. Further empirical work continues, for different sectors, to find better terms.\n3. The knowledge engineering process for the Learning Designer modelled the learning design concepts and user interactions sufficiently well to achieve a tool that succeeds in supporting teachers-as-designers.\n4. We have been able to leverage computer-supported learning design and semantic technologies to support the creation of knowledge products. Moreover, as learning designs are continually modified, knowledge is constructed by automatically annotating user designs with knowledge already embedded into the tool. \n5. Intelligent inferencing techniques are able to produce suggestions for optimal ways of combining conventional teaching-learning methods with a variety of TEL methods. \n6. By adopting, adapting, trialling, and sharing their learning designs it may now be feasible for the teaching community to develop a collective intelligence of what makes effective learning designs.\n\nEvaluation \n1. As a proof-of-concept prototype, the Learning Designer was well received by representatives of the target user group. In particular, the graphical analysis of learning experience was seen to open a new window into a learning design, providing a valued opportunity for pre-lesson reflection and redesign.\n2. Seasoned lecturers value the Learning Designer for training new lecturers; however trainees feel the tool requires users to have more knowledge of teaching.\nAs a research prototype it lacks the robustness for use over an extended period that would be a true field-test of its viability. This is a challenge for design research projects, but with an appropriate analytical framework it is possible to make realistic claims from limited amounts of data. The findings have been taken forward in two further funded projects, one funded by ESRC, the Building Community Knowledge project, and one by HEIF, which is developing an interactive modelling tool for modelling the costs and benefits of blended and online learning.\nAll these tools have been widely used, as reported in the BCK project and under Research Tools, and Software Tools in this project.
