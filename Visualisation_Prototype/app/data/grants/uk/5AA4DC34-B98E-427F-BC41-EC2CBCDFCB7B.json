{"id":"5AA4DC34-B98E-427F-BC41-EC2CBCDFCB7B","title":"Public Perceptions of Threat in Britain: Security in an Age of Austerity","abstractText":"<p>No longer are British interests at home and abroad considered to be under threat from one particular state, but rather from a complex web of threats. Yet, despite a tripling of the security budget since 2001, little is known about public attitudes towards security threats, what sorts of issues ordinary people find threatening, whether they agree with, or are aware of, governments' attempts to make them feel more &quot;secure&quot;, and whether these attempts have any impact.</p>\n\n<p>Stevens and Vaughan-Williams’ project is to investigate:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>how members of the public understand the concepts of &quot;threat&quot; and &quot;security&quot;</li>\n\n <li>what they consider to be the most pressing threats to their security</li>\n\n <li>how and whether perceived threats to security influence other political attitudes</li>\n\n <li>whether their views coincide with notions of threat and how to respond to and mitigate them in the government's National Security Strategy.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research is based on 20 mini-groups of three respondents from the main regions of Britain, as well as a large-scale survey of 2000 respondents. The results will be compared and contrasted with elite representations of threat, as found in, inter alia, the National Security Strategies.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J004596/1","grantId":"ES/J004596/1","fundValue":"81881","fundStart":"2012-03-31","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Policy debates on EU border security:\nWe presented the implications of the research for understanding contemporary attitudes towards airport border controls at the 2nd Global Automated Border Control Conference, hosted by Frontex and the EU Commission in Warsaw. Conventionally key stakeholders in EU border security have paid little attention to the differential effects of new security technologies on different groups - particularly minorities - within the travelling public. Our proposal went through a rigorous and competitive peer-review process before being accepted. A summary of our evidence was published in the final conference programme report.\n\nMedia and civil society groups:\nAn initial press release summarising our key findings attracted attention from several civil society groups representing Muslim communities. In particular, they were interested in our finding that terrorism is not considered to be one of the main security threats facing the British public at the community or personal levels, because the communities they represent often feel victimised as a result of latent forms of Islamaphobia being connected with the contemporary terrorist threat.\n\nPublic engagement:\nFocus groups allow participants to express views that might not be otherwise heard and in this context they are recognised as a mechanism not only for empowering individuals, but also for new possibilities in democratising research and public engagement in policy-making. Engaging with our programme of research offered an alternative forum for members of minority groups who often feel that they are unfairly targeted by a culture of suspicion and surveillance in public spaces yet unable to voice their concerns.

This has implications for government initiatives designed to shape perceptions of security threats.\n• Individuals are much more concerned with online banking and cyber-bullying than the National Security Strategy's (NSS)Tier One issue of ‘hostile attacks on UK cyber space by other states and large scale cyber crime.’ Other priority issues not mentioned in the NSS are financial insecurity and Islamaphobia among Muslims, which illustrates the gulf between ‘official’ and ‘lay’ knowledge of threat.\n• Perceptions of more security threats tend to increase hostility towards immigrants and minorities, but perceptions of more global threats do not.\n• Awareness of government messages about security threats is low and does not lessen perceptions of threats.\n• Despite the 2010 NSS’ commitment to building a ‘much closer relationship with the public’ minority groups feel powerless in the formulation of national security policy. This is potentially significant ahead of the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review.\n\nMethods\n• The mixed methods research design we used provides a new paradigm for future projects on security threats and other related issues.\n• This is the first project that has examined perceptions of the breadth of security threats as well as of perceptions of specific threats such as terrorism and immigration.\n\nTheory\n• The theories developed in our articles and forthcoming book are likely to influence future theoretical progress in the field.\n• The qualitative work we conducted explores what is at stake in attempting to understand the contemporary politics of threat and insecurity from the perspective of ordinary citizens rather than elites.\n• The quantitative work we conducted theorizes a range of different threats, their origins and effects. Non academic: Our findings could be used by policy makers as they consider the next National Security Strategy and how to work and communicate with the public as it is developed. They might also influence the ways in which politicians frame threats because framing a threat as 'global' often has different effects from framing the same threat at 'national.'\nAcademic: Other researchers may well replicate and extend our work using the data we have deposited with UKDS. But the findings might also be taken forward with additional multi-country research on these themes and/or additional research in the UK to examine whether they hold up three years on.
