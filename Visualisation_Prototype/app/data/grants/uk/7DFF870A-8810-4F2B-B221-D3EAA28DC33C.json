The highly instrumented reactor for atmospheric chemistry (HIRAC) constructed in the School of Chemistry under grant NE/C513493/1 is a 2 m3 stainless steel chamber capable of making measurements over a wide range of conditions. Uniquely for such a chamber it can measure OH and HO2 radical concentrations using a laser based technique. The principal behind HIRAC is to measure as many reactants, intermediates and products as possible in order to constrain the chemical models used to interpret and understand the results. All measurements are subject to potential systematic errors and therefore we consider it important to initially measure using two or more complimentary techniques (e.g. FTIR and GC). This is especially true for radical species, where the short lifetimes make measurements particularly taxing. We have demonstrated an ability to detect and monitor OH and HO2 (ACPD 2007, 7, 10687) and now seek to extend our measurement capability to the NO3 radical, an important nighttime oxidant. It is proposed to measure NO3 using cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS). This is an extremely sensitive technique, that unlike laser induced fluorescence (LIF), yields absolute concentrations. With CRDS we should have a detection limit of ~1 pptv, well below typical nighttime NO3 concentrations. Once constructed the CRDS system will be compared with a broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectrometer (BB-CEAS) via a collaboration with Dr Steve Ball and LIF (adapting our current system from OH detection). We will also test the technique by determining rate coefficients for the reaction of NO3 with ethanal, a reaction that is well characterised. Finally, we will apply the technique to the determination of the rate coefficients and product distributions to the reaction of NO3 with alkenes under atmospheric conditions. The rates of reaction are relatively fast and determination of the rate coefficient requires knowledge of the absolute NO3 concentrations (an advantage of CRDS over BB-CEAS and LIF). Products will be examined by GC and FTIR; knowledge of the temporal dependence of NO3 will be vital in constraining the chemical model used to extract quantitative branching ratios.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F011326/1","grantId":"NE/F011326/1","fundValue":"29864","fundStart":"2008-02-15","fundEnd":"2009-02-14","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy system developed under this grant has been deployed in the HIRAC chamber and the results obtained contributed to the PhD thesis of Tamsin Malkin.\nThe experience gained in cavity work will allow the deployment of other cavity based methods in the HIRAC chamber.\nIn a wider perspective this work contributes to our understanding of atmospheric chemistry and hence links to policy associated with air quality (and hence health) and climate change.

Many NO3 reactions have been studied by the relative rate technique, where NO3 is not directly observed. Direct observation allows application of a range of complementary methodologies to be deployed to study the kinetics of the reaction. When studying reactive species, it is important to use a variety of different techniques to help identify systematic errors.\n\nFor this project the cavity ring-down system was successfully constructed and tested in the Leeds HIRAC chamber. Sensitivity was good with a detection limit of 1.5 E8 molecule cm-3 (16 s averaging).
