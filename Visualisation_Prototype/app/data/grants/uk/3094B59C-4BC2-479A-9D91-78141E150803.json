The number of cases continues to increase in young adults. Laboratory diagnoses in Scotland for Jan-Jun 2007 show that two thirds were female with an overall 6% increase between the first and second quarters. Control measures rely on a combination of increased public awareness, diagnosis, antibiotic treatment and partner notification but are clearly failing to prevent spread of infection. C. trachomatis infection is often asymptomatic and goes untreated but can have serious implications for subsequent female reproductive health. Primary infection can resolve without intervention, presumably due to protective immunity. In some individuals C. trachomatis infection can be episodic although it is unclear whether this is due to failure of antibiotic control, bacterial persistence or to reinfection due to inadequate protective immunity in the reproductive tract. The National Chlamydia Screening Programme in England reports that 10-30% of women infected by C. trachomatis develop pelvic inflammatory disease [PID]. The risk of developing PID and other reproductive sequelae increases with each recurrence of C. trachomatis infection and infection is associated with increased risk of tubal infertility, reproductive failure and ectopic pregnancy. There is controversy as to whether some strains of C. trachomatis are more virulent than others and whether persistent infection is responsible for reproductive disease. Hitherto studies have been conducted in isolation by different groups. This disconnection has contributed to lack of clear understanding how natural history of infection and the host response translate into risk of gynaecological problems. We propose to integrate an internationally competitive, UK group of clinicians and basic scientists to investigate outcomes of C. trachomatis infection on female reproductive health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800682","grantId":"G0800682","fundValue":"49282","fundStart":"2008-02-19","fundEnd":"2008-11-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah E M Howie","coPersons":["Gary  Entrican","Hilary Octavia Critchley","Sharon  Cameron","John  Iredale","Helen  Palmer","Anna  Glasier","G  Scott","David  Longbottom","Ian  Clarke","Heather A.
