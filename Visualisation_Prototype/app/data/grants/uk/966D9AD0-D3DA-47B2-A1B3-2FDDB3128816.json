{"id":"966D9AD0-D3DA-47B2-A1B3-2FDDB3128816","title":"DeTOX - Productive whole cell biocatalysis by engineering resistance to toxic products and substrates","abstractText":"Product toxicity is a major problem for many IBBE processes involving production of small molecules by living cells. Toxicity causes yield restrictions &amp; cell lysis, &amp; frequently affects the commercial viability of biomanufacturing. Likewise, small molecules in lignocellulosic feedstocks inhibit bacterial fermentations &amp; ultimately depress product yields. In this CBMNet NIBB-led bid, a team of scientists from four Universities apply their fundamental expertise in systems &amp; synthetic biology &amp; membrane function, to engineer increased resistance to small molecules in the industrially relevant bacteria, E. coli &amp; solventogenic Clostridia. Our innovation is to translate BBSRC-funded research in microbial stress responses, membrane structure &amp; membrane transporters, into the development &amp; commercialisation of innovative applications in IBBE by our 5 commercial partners. A key project output will be a commercial chassis strain, DeTox, with generally increased chemical resistance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N01037X/1","grantId":"BB/N01037X/1","fundValue":"691225","fundStart":"2016-05-01","fundEnd":"2021-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"J  Green","coPersons":["Susan  Molyneux-Hodgson","David  Kelly"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
