Recent research in social capital has shown that a mixture of strong, bonding ties alongside weak, bridging ties is an optimal network structure for individuals and groups in maximizing performance and well-being. This mixture of bridging and bonding ties bears close resemblance to the descriptions of small worlds. <br />Thus, this project focuses on these structural similarities to bring these two bodies of research together. Research on what gives rise to small worlds structures could bring insight into how social capital comes about. In exchange, small worlds research could benefit from research on how social capital, eg bridging/bonding network structures, benefit individuals and groups. The proposed study will thus address, explore, theorize and test the conceptual links between social capital and small worlds. This will be accomplished in two phases. First, an agent-based model will be developed to explore the mechanisms linking local interactions to global network structures. Second, a secondary analysis of empirical data will be conducted to further test and clarify the theoretical framework developed and explored in phase 1, and also explore how network structure impacts group performance. <b></b></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0109","grantId":"RES-061-25-0109","fundValue":"93165","fundStart":"2008-06-18","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christina  Prell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
