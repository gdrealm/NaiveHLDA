This project studied the age-related alterations that occur in the cardiovascular system - the heart, lungs and network of arteries and veins that carry oxygenated blood and nutrients to every cell of the body and remove the waste products of metabolism. It was already known that the phase of breathing affects the rate at which the heart beats, but that this effect decreases as we age. The research has associated this reduction in heart-lung interaction with changes in the endothelium, the inner lining of all the blood vessels. It involved making non-invasive measurements of blood flow in the skin of 200 healthy subjects of all ages. The analysis focused on very low frequency oscillations in blood flow that can give a measure of the state of the endothelium. The main conclusions are, first, that, to age healthily, you should look after your endothelium and, secondly, that it should be feasible to design an instrument for assessing endothelial health - an endotheliometer.\n\nOur method of measuring the response of the endothelium to an external stimulus enables us to quantify its state of health. We have found -\n\no A decrease with age in the influence of the lungs on the heart, consistent with earlier work. It means that the cardiovascular system is gradually becoming less well able to function coherently as a single entity.\n\no That this change can be well-characterised and illustrated by computation of the cardio-respiratory &quot;coupling function&quot; (Figure 1).\n\no That there is a corresponding decrease with age in the extent to which the endothelium of blood vessels in the skin can react to a chemical stimulus. This reactivity can be taken as a useful measure of the health of the endothelium, and we were able to measure it in-vivo, directly and non-invasively. \n\no That one can thus define an individual's &quot;endothelial age&quot;, which can be either less or more than their chronological age.\n\no No evidence of coherence between the slow oscillations underlying the heart rate and skin blood flow for frequencies below about 0.1 Hz. This suggests that the lower frequency oscillations, associated with endothelial function, are local in character rather than being under central control for the body as a whole.\n\no That the endothelium can also be stimulated by a rise in skin temperature, resulting in greatly enhanced low frequency oscillations. Correspondingly, a decrease in skin temperature reduces endothelial activity.\n\no It will be feasible to create a new medical diagnostic instrument based on a measurement of the endothelial response to temperature changes (patent application submitted). The intention is to design a device that will be the size of a large wrist watch. It will be strapped to the subject's arm for about ten minutes, and will make a series of measurements as the skin is first cooled and then warmed. Its output will be analysed automatically to give a measure of endothelial health. It will thus be easily useable by non-physicists. \n\nAs an indicator of general health this endotheliometer has the potential to become almost as widespread in application as the clinical thermometer. We envisage their use by nurses, GPs, and other health professionals, as well as by hospital consultants. Conceivably, in the longer term given the price-reduction associated with mass-production, the endotheliometer could also be purchased by health-conscious members of the public. The endotheliometer has the potential become widespread in the health arena but, for this to happen, we will have to take the project to the next stage by construction of a prototype that can be used to attract the interest of medical instrument manufacturers.
