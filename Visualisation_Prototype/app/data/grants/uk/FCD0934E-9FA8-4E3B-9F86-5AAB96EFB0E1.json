This study will look at how challenges arising from evidence of poor performance are met and what can be learned from different strategies for coping with failure.</p> \n<p>While numerous individual cases of public service failure have been documented in official reports and academic studies, and various inspectorates and agencies have been set up to deal with failure&nbsp;in particular domains, there has been to date no systematic study in the UK of how failure is dealt with, and so policy makers and practitioners lack theoretically informed and empirically grounded advice on which to act.&nbsp;The study will look specifically at performance failure in health care and in local government in England, and will then use case studies to compare findings in those areas with experiences in other public sector settings. It will provide a systematic analysis of how public organisations respond to evidence of poor performance which can inform policy and practice.</p> \n<p>The study will be of use to organisations with responsibility for identifying and managing failure, such as inspection agencies and regulatory bodies, to managers and leaders in public organisations, and to everyone concerned with better public services.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-166-25-0020","grantId":"RES-166-25-0020","fundValue":"268540","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kieran  Walshe","coPersons":["Pauline  Jas","Chris  Skelcher","Gill  Harvey"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
