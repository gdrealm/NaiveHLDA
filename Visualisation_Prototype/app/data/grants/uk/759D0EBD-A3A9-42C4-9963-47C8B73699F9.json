These elegant animals are one of natural history's puzzles because, despite their name, they are not of European origin: they are native to Turkey from where people have gradually transported them around the globe. The distribution of fallow deer is thus a direct record of human population movements, trade and ideology with the potential to provide cultural evidence of the highest quality and relevance for a range of disciplines and audiences.\\n\\nThere are many publications devoted to fallow deer but these largely recycle 'received wisdom'. In fact, astonishingly little is known about fallow deer; their history is obfuscated by ambiguous linguistic, textual, iconographic and archaeological evidence. To rectify this situation we carried out a pilot study, The Fallow Deer Project, whose results have challenged established theories about the species' history and provided new insights into Roman, Anglo-Saxon and Norman society. It also highlighted the scarcity of scientific work on fallow deer and demonstrated how a new dataset will enable us to explore some of the highest-profile issues in European archaeology: e.g. the nature and spread of the Neolithic in the eastern Mediterranean and the structure and worldview of societies in the Bronze Age Aegean, Iron Age Greece and Gaul, and the Roman, Byzantine, Islamic and Norman Empires.\\n\\nTo realise this potential, our transdisciplinary team will employ methods proven by our pilot study - e.g. the integration of archaeology, history, geography and anthropology with genetics, stable isotope analysis and osteological research - to answer the following questions:\\n\\n1) Were fallow deer domesticated? \\nDomestication is a high-profile topic but it has been overlooked in relation to D. d. dama. Interestingly, unlike cattle, sheep or horses, fallow deer provide no milk, wool or traction to warrant their maintenance, yet most archaeological Dama lived into old age - what prompted different human groups to form close, long-term relationships with this species?\\n\\n2) Under what circumstances were fallow deer established across Europe? \\nFallow deer translocation seemingly began in the Neolithic and by the Bronze Age they were established throughout the Aegean. They appear to have held a magico-religious status that endured into the Iron Age and Roman period, when their bones were traded as holy relics. This trade has confused understanding of Dama biogeography but our research indicates that the Romans established the species across Europe. We now need to clarify how, from where and why these animals/body parts were transported.\\n \\n3) Did the collapse of the Roman Empire cause extirpation of fallow deer? \\nEvidence for fallow deer is scarce in early medieval Europe; however, they may have been present but simply not exploited by people. The results of this question will be considered further in questions 4 and 5. \\n\\n4) Did the Normans reintroduce fallow deer via Islamic influence?\\nThe idea that fallow deer, the Arabic concept of parks and new hunting rituals were exported from the Norman Kingdom of Sicily is based on circumstantial evidence. We will examine all available data from the Islamic and Christian medieval world either to confirm existing beliefs and provide insights into the culture-contact of this period, or to indicate that Roman Dama populations endured in pre-Norman Europe, necessitating a re-assessment of the Norman Conquest's impact. \\n\\n5) How do human-Dama relationships reveal worldview?\\nIt has been shown repeatedly that the relationship between humans and wild animals reflects a society's structure and beliefs. Certainly wherever fallow deer were translocated, they were incorporated into expressions of socio-cultural identity and ideology. We will explore how different human groups negotiated status, gender, religious and cultural beliefs through interactions with fallow deer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I026456/1","grantId":"AH/I026456/1","fundValue":"651630","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  From the project's inception we highlighted three main non-academic groups with whom we planned to engage: 1) general public, 2) primary school children, 3) those involved with deer management, conservation and legislation. Over the last few years we have become aware that the most effective impact occurs when all three are merged, which has led to the establishment of 4) the 'Fair Game Initiative'.\n\n1. General public. Fallow deer are as much a part of Europe's cultural heritage as the more visible monuments of Stonehenge or Fountains Abbey but, because they are abundant and widespread, their cultural significance is overlooked. Yet it is their very familiarity that makes fallow deer engaging cultural and educational resources - they can be accessed by anyone. Our contributions to the British Deer Society's magazine have been very well received by the BDS's membership, with one article requested for re-publication in another general interest magazine 'Saxon'. We have now made these articles available for download on the project's website. We are working with properties owned by the National Trust (n=4), and independent museums to install property-specific exhibitions that will, together, form 'The Fallow Deer Trail' telling the story of the species natural and cultural history. Two exhibitions have already been opened: Fishbourne Roman Palace in Sussex and Dudley Castle, West Midlands. \n\nOur research has been showcased by Channel 4's Time Team (April 2012), BBC's Great British Food Revival (October 2012) and featured in The Independent (Nov 2012).\n\n2. Primary school children. Our project fits with Key Stage 2 (Roman Impact) and Key Stage 3 (Norman Conquest and the Crusades) of the English history curriculum and we are working with the education officers from the historic properties mentioned above to providing teaching packs/educational resources to complement their existing activities. In addition, we have run activities at the Nottingham University Samworth Academy, which was filmed for the BBC program detailed above. \n\n3. Deer management, conservation and legislation. Deer managers are playing an important role in our research, many of the engaging directly in data collection by providing us with DNA samples from modern populations. In return, we have been briefing them on the significance of fallow deer: we have given talks to deer management groups across the country, providing them with information about the origin and diversity of their regional populations - issues key to the development of effective management strategy. Today deer are a serious economic, environmental and political issue with debate surrounding their impact, management and conservation - contentious issues that can all be addressed through studies of the past. We have working with the British Deer Society, the Deer Initiative, the Ministry of Defence, the Small Woods Association and the National Trust's deer managers to show how the long term perspective provided by our research, and our arts and humanities approach, can be used to make the issue of deer management understandable to the public - recent government papers highlights lack of public understanding to be the main hurdle to sustainable deer management. \n\nImportantly, we are addressing deer conservation; for although domestic Dama have a worldwide distribution, they are almost extinct in the wild. There is just one surviving 'native' population, living free at Termessos National Park in Turkey: the IUCN Red List of threatened species classifies this herd as 'under serious threat' and requiring 'strong anti-poaching measures, recovery management and re-introductions'. \n\n4) Fair Game Initiative. This educational outreach project brings together all the above strands. We use our arts and humanities research to engage the public in the history of fallow deer, their environmental impact and the need for sustainable management. Our approach is hands-on: we take complete fallow deer carcasses to schools, pubs and heritage institutions and, after an introductory lecture, follow medieval texts to butcher and cook the venison. We are working with the National Trust to establish this as part of both their deer management and educational programme. This part of our project is attracting considerable media interest, especially as a result of the BBC's Great British Food Revival.

By bringing together evidence from the Arts, Humanities and Sciences, our project can now reject this hypothesis with confidence. \n\nThe story of the fallow deer's diffusion is far more complex. It involves deer populations that are now extinct due to over-hunting, and it involves culture-contact that was hitherto unknown on the basis of material culture studies.\n\nWe have been able to demonstrate that, across time and space, fallow deer have held important, but varied, social and cultural positions. In the Near East and the Balkans they were initially quarry, hunted alongside other wild mammals by the hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic period. In the Neolithic, it would appear that attempts were made to domesticate fallow deer, with closer relationship being evident between deer and people. As part of this, populations were moved to off-shore Mediterranean islands, which later became the settings for Bronze Age hunting.\n\nIt was during the Bronze Age that fallow deer appear to have become religious symbols, being closely aligned with the goddess Artemis, evidenced by the iconography, material culture and the contexts in which fallow deer remains are recovered. \n\nWe now believe that it was the association between fallow deer and Artemis (as well as her later incarnation as Roman Diana) that was responsible for the spread of fallow deer across Roman Europe. \n\nThis Roman diffusion of fallow deer took the species to Italy, across to western Europe and up through northern Europe to Britain. Whilst the Roman-introduced populations endured in southern and western Europe, we now know that the populations established in Roman Britain went completely extinct when the Empire withdrew. \n\nOur evidence points to a reintroduction in the 11th century AD, most probably from south-east Europe. Previously it was believed that the reintroduction was linked to the Norman Conquest; however, our results would suggest that this may not be the case. The introduction is feasibly pre-Conquest, with implications for our understanding of early medieval culture contact, ideology and landscape. Our findings are significant not only for understanding the ideology and environmental impact of past cultures but also for the present and future. The results of our study are of direct relevance for modern deer management and conservation (neither of these can be considered in isolation from human culture - see Sykes and Putman 2014) but also for issues of food security. \n\nOur results are already being showcased in two museum exhibitions (Fishbourne Roman Palace and Dudley Castle Museum) and have been converted into four short films for National Trust properties, with more to follow. The National Trust's deer managers have been trained in our research and approach to outreach. Several properties are now using the resources we have provided them with to deliver their own educational programmes, concerning the cultural heritage represented by their deer herds but also the benefits of eating their venison.
