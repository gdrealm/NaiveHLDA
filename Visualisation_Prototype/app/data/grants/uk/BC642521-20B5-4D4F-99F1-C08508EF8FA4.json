{"id":"BC642521-20B5-4D4F-99F1-C08508EF8FA4","title":"Nova - research at the edge of space","abstractText":"<p>Cambridge University Spaceflight (CUS) is a student-run society founded in 2006 comprising undergraduates and postgraduates from many disciplines. The society aims to develop the technology needed to reduce the cost of sub-orbital access to space for scientific research, in the form of high altitude balloon launches, designing rockets, and other related experiments. CUS are keen to encourage young people to learn more about space and the possibilities for space exploration and run an active and successful outreach programme.<br /><br />This activity, which took place on Saturday 24 March as part of the Cambridge Science Festival (CSF) 2007, aimed to show young people the excitement and relevance of engineering in general, and aerospace engineering in particular, by showcasing one of CU Spaceflight’s projects: Nova. Nova is a project to develop high altitude lighter-than-air craft that can reach the edge of space. Vehicles at high altitude (25-40km) have a wide range of applications including education, atmospheric research, surveillance and a platform for launching a rocket into space.<br /><br />In this CSF event, members of the public were invited to view the ‘Nova 5’ vehicle prior to launch, watch the launch itself and then help to track the vehicle’s flight. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0101","grantId":"RES-168-26-0101","fundValue":"1496","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey Thomas Parks","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
