It uses data from an international study of the IT industry to compare how SMEs in this sector capitalise on the know-how and experience of staff over their working careers.</p>\n\n<p>The IT sector has traditionally relied on a younger workforce. But as the industry itself grows older, so are its staff. Demographic change will also make it more difficult for firms constantly to replenish its workforce with young recruits. This research examines how the sector can respond to this challenge so as to value and harness the experience, wisdom and legacy knowledge of their older, longer-serving staff. Using international, comparative data collected for the ‘Workforce Ageing in New Economy’ study (WANE), it compares the way firms and professionals of different ages, generations and roles approach the need for continuous, lifelong learning in rapidly-changing, knowledge-intensive jobs in the United Kingdom – and asks how these practices compare with those in similar enterprises in Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2430","grantId":"RES-000-22-2430","fundValue":"76598","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kerry Ann Platman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
