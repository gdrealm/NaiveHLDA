{"id":"718D829F-A5CD-4B6E-86CB-929A542B5FB7","title":"Development of a universal HIV-1 vaccine","abstractText":"HIV infection and AIDS continues to spread in a virtually uncontrolled manner. The best and possibly only hope to change this alarming situation is a safe, effective, accessible protective vaccine. Arguably the biggest challenge in developing such a vaccine is the enormous HIV variability, which dwarfs almost any other infection. However, all parts of the virus cannot easily change. To remain alive, HIV has to keep some smaller regions of its proteins more or less constant. We have taken an advantage of this and constructed a simple candidate vaccine designed specifically to overcome the HIV variability by focusing the body defences on the conserved viral parts. Here, we are proposing to test this approach for the first time in a small pilot study in healthy individuals in Oxford. Successful outcome of this study would strongly support further evaluation of this vaccination strategy in larger and more expensive clinical studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701669","grantId":"G0701669","fundValue":"1300520","fundStart":"2008-10-28","fundEnd":"2012-10-27","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tomas  Hanke","coPersons":["Lucy  Dorrell"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
