{"id":"255433F6-0DEB-4E51-BCD4-F44155FE3FD2","title":"New Town Heritage: Exploring the Boundaries","abstractText":"The New Town Heritage project is a partnership project between the University of Hertfordshire, community researchers and heritage organisations. It focuses on tracing the growth and development of new towns from the garden city movement to the 'model' new town of Milton Keynes, through a programme of co-designed research activities and events. From E.M Forster's home in Stevenage to the uncatalogued papers of Milton Keynes Development Corporation, the project seeks to uncover hidden stories and sources with community researchers and then publicise the research findings through a range of channels for the benefit of a broad audience. As reflected in the costs, the project will result in a series of outputs including a New Town Heritage Festival, conference papers and publications, research workshops and events and a co-produced New Town Heritage book.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007947/1","grantId":"AH/K007947/1","fundValue":"69164","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Garwood","coPersons":["Susan  Parham"],"organisation":"University of Hertfordshire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
