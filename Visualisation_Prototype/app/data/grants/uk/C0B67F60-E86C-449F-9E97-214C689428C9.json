We are combining some of our own ideas, such as adapting existing models to include spin polarisation effects with ideas (frozen electron density models for water molecules) that have been developed and tested by others.We are choosing an Open Source quantum chemistry program, NWChem as the basis for the new features because it has been designed from scratch for use on high-performance computers, and is modular in design which will help support the changes we need to make. The MM code (GULP) is already used in our existing work, and works well on parallel machines. Parallel efficiency is a key driver for the design of the interfaced code and will inform the way we implement the new methods.In the long run, it is intended the code developed here will form the nucleus of a modelling framework for a wider range of systems (including biological ones) building on experience we have had in past software projects (www.chemshell.org).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I030662/1","grantId":"EP/I030662/1","fundValue":"432666","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Sherwood","coPersons":["Stephen Charles Parker","Richard  Catlow","David  Willock","Alexey A Sokol"],"organisation":"STFC - Laboratories","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
