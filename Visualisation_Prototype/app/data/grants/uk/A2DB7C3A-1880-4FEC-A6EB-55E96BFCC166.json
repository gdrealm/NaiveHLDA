{"id":"A2DB7C3A-1880-4FEC-A6EB-55E96BFCC166","title":"LogMap: Logic-based Methods for Ontology Mapping","abstractText":"In computer science, an ontology is a formal description of some aspect ofthe world in a format that a computer can process. For example, a bio-medical ontologymay contain information such as polyarticular arthritis is a kind of arthritis that affects at least five joints'', juvenile arthritis is a kind of arthritis that affects children up to the age of 13'', and polyarticular juvenile arthritis is the kind of arthritis that is both polyarticular and juvenile''.Ontologies are extensively used in biology and medicine. Aprominent example of a bio-medical ontology is SNOMED CT, which is a core component of the NHS patient recordservice. Other examples include the Foundational Model of Anatomy(FMA) and the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCI).Ontologies such as SNOMED CT, FMA, and NCI are gradually superseding the existing medical classificationsand are becoming core platforms for accessing, gathering, and sharing medical knowledge and data.For example, ontologies can be used to process data (e.g., electronic patient records in the case of a medical application) in a more intelligent way: if JohnSmith's medical record states that he is a 10 years old patient suffering from arthritis, and who has damage in hisknee, ankle, wrist, elbow, and hip joints, then an ontology can be used to conclude that hesuffers from a kind of polyarticular juvenile arthritis.To exchange or migrate data between ontology-based applications,it is crucial to establish correspondences (or mappings) between their ontologies.For example, a mapping between NCI and FMA should establish that the FMA term Cardiac Muscle Tissue'' and the NCI term Myocardium'' are synonyms. Usingthis mapping, a computer program would then be able, for example, to migrate the datastatement Paul Williams has suffered from an infarction affecting the Myocardium'' from an NCI-based application to an FMA-based application.Creating such mappings manually is often unfeasible due to the size and complexity of modern ontologies.Therefore, the problem of automatically generating mappings between ontologies (often referred to as the ontology matching, ontology alignment, or ontology mappingproblem) has been investigated extensively in recent years.Despite the already mature state of the art, bio-medical ontologies still poseserious challenges to existing techniques.Our ultimate goal in this project is to meet these challenges and lay thefoundations for the development of new generation bio-medical informationsystems.Our main research hypothesis is based on the observation that existing techniques for ontology mapping oftendisregard the logic-based semantics of the input ontologies. As a result, they fail to take advantage ofthe available semantics, and of the highly effective reasoning services for modernontology languages. We are proposing to rethink the foundations underlying the current state-of-the art in the field by incorporating logical reasoning in each of the steps of the ontology mapping process. We also intend to go even further and make our techniquespractical and ready to be used in applications.The research is based on our preliminary empirical evidence which suggests the potential benefitsof logic-based reasoning when analysing existing mappings between real-world ontologies.We expect that our results will be directly relevant to the users of ontology-based systems inthe bio-medical domain, where knowledge and data integration is a matter of major concern.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I005706/1","grantId":"EP/I005706/1","fundValue":"101657","fundStart":"2011-01-10","fundEnd":"2012-11-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our techniques have already had a significant impact within the ontology matching community, where many tools currently implement algorithms we have developed in the project.

A domain where ontologies are playing a key role is biomedicine. A prominent example of an ontology in the biomedical domain is SNOMED CT, which is a core component of the NHS patient record service.

Creating such mappings manually is often unfeasible due to the size and complexity of modern ontologies. Therefore, the problem of automatically generating mappings between ontologies (often referred to as the ontology matching, ontology alignment, or ontology mapping problem) has been investigated extensively in recent years. Despite the already mature state of the art, bio-medical ontologies still pose serious challenges to existing techniques.\n\nFirst, carefully-curated mapping sets used in bio-medical information integration, such as UMLS Meta-thesaurus, often contain errors and lack important information. Second, existing mapping generation tools do not scale to the size of modern bio-medical ontologies. Finally, the developers of bio-medical information integration and migration systems based on ontologies lack the necessary tool support.\n\nIn the LogMap project we have achieved the following objectives:\n\n1) We have developed general principles and specific techniques to efficiently detect and repair potential errors and discover missing information in large sets of mappings. These techniques have been implemented and made available to the academic community.\n2) We have developed computationally efficient algorithms for generating mappings between large-scale ontologies, while minimising the number of errors and the amount of missing information. The developed techniques have been implemented in the LogMap ontology matching system, which has been made available to the community both in the form of downloadable software, and as a Web service.\n3) Our system LogMap has participated successfully in the latest editions of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (since 2011), obtaining very competitive results.\n4) We have organised a new track within the ontology alignment initiative ---the large BioMed track--- the goal of which is to match large bio-medical ontologies. The track has been quite successful and many ontology matching systems have participated. As already mentioned, our findings have already had a significant impact within the ontology matching research community. Furthermore, the system we developed is currently being used as an integral component of the Optique EU-funded project and has contributed to address the application needs of our industry partners Statoil and Siemens.\n\nWe believe that LogMap could also be successfully exploited in a similar way in other application domains and thus contribute significantly to the design of ontology-based information systems, where integrating different ontologies (either independently developed or automatically bootstrapped) is an important requirement.
