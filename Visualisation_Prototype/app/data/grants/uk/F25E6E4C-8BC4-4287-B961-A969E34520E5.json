With the proposed instrument, velocity field in a plane can be measured as a function of time, providing unique information about turbulence, flow dynamics, and spectral characteristics. It is proposed to use this instrument for velocity measurements of unsteady vortical flows over a flexible delta wing which exhibits spectacular lift enhancement compared to a rigid one.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C015258/1","grantId":"EP/C015258/1","fundValue":"70643","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ismet  Gursul","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
