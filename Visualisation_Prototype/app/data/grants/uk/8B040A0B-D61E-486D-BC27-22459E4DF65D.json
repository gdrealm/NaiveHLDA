Regional, national and international strategies have identified aerospace as a key sector for the UK and Europe and this has resulted in the provision of substantial funding for the sector. The University of Nottingham aims to strengthen and consolidate its position as a leading institution for research into aerospace technologies by building on its existing broad research base and current portfolio of aerospace research and investing in infrastructure and business engagement activity to further grow its portfolio in line with industrial demands for knowledge, skills and technologies. This proposal presents a case for a 1.38M EPSRC investment into equipment to support the University's large and growing aerospace research portfolio. Building upon our substantial EPSRC portfolio related to aerospace research, the capital equipment will underpin fundamental research into aerospace technologies, leading to applied research, demonstration and exploitation. The equipment contributes to three research themes where UoN has world-leading research activities; - Power Conversion, Power Systems and Future Actuation Technologies for the More Electric Aircraft, led by Prof Pat Wheeler, Prof Jon Clare, Prof Mark Johnson - Non-Destructive Evaluation for Next Generation Aerospace Materials and Structures, led by Dr Matt Clark, Prof Andy Long, Prof Mike Somekh, Prof Richard Challis. - Advanced Manufacturing for the Aerospace Sector, led by Prof Svetan Ratchev, Prof Nabil Gindy, Dr Atanas Popov, Dr Neils Lohse, Dr Dragos Axinte.Researchers within each of these themes are addressing key research challenges for the sector and through their current and future applied research programmes will contribute to the sector's ability to meet the targets set by the Advisory Council on Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE). For manufacturers and suppliers, this means demonstrating continual improvements in the performance of new aircraft entering into service in 2020, compared with their 2000 equivalents, by committing to challenging targets on fuel efficiency, NOx emissions and noise. Fundamental research, leading to applied research and demonstration, is essential if the UK is retain its position as one of the world's leaders in aerospace innovation and continue to enjoy the commercial advantages provided by our air transport sector.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H049746/1","grantId":"EP/H049746/1","fundValue":"1373950","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This equipment grant has supported the work of the Institute for Aerospace Technology, underpinning further awards and partnerships with industry including GE, Rolls-Royce and Airbus.
