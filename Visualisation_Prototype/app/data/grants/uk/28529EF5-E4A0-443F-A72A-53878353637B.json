Aiming to advance and exemplify creative and imaginative work in current geographical thought and practice, it will inquire as to how theoretically-rich notions of haunting might produce new understandings of how places and selves intertwine, and it will examine the spectral geographies of four differing mediums: a) material objects, b) lived bodies, c) imaginative texts and d) visual images. Particular emphasis will be placed upon manifestations of the spectral, for instance in senses of unease, uncanniness, watching, dislocation and doubling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119219/2","grantId":"119219/2","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"JOHN WILLIAM WYLIE","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
