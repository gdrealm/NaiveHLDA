{"id":"D15C1D6B-7526-46F9-A455-2A8CA7CF4A8C","title":"Development of a therapeutic antibody for a novel angiogenic target","abstractText":"In several common diseases of the eye, including age-related macular disease and diabetic retinopathy, the network of tiny blood vessels in the light-sensitive part of the eye may undergo major structural changes and grow uncontrollably in a manner severe enough to cause loss of vision. Although some advances have been made in the treatment of these conditions the most effective therapies generally benefit fewer than 50% of patients, and often only delay vision loss. There is therefore an urgent need to develop new therapies, especially of a type that may be useful during the early stages of disease. Our group has discovered a new protein, of previously unknown function, that we have shown to be produced at high levels by abnormal retinal blood vessels and to cause blood vessel cell proliferation. In this project we will generate an antibody that will block the function of this protein, and then create derivatives of the antibody that are safe and effective for use in humans. At the end of the project, if we achieve our objectives, we will be ready to take our new therapy into patients in a Phase I clinical trial.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902206","grantId":"G0902206","fundValue":"1030770","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Edward Moss","coPersons":["James W.B.
