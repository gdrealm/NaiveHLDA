This microscope allows materials to be characterised by imaging and spectroscopic methods with a combined energy and spatial resolution that is world-leading. Access to such an instrument will allow researchers working in the field of nanotechnology to better understand the factors that influence the performance and characteristics of their new materials and devices. While the instrument is heavily used for research projects in the LCN we feel it would be worthwhile to make some time available on this state-of-the-art facility for researchers in other academic institutions to investigate their materials using this facility. In addition to providing access we will support these external users through technical support, training and data interpretation. We are seeking funds to allow us to provide this external access.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F05677X/1","grantId":"EP/F05677X/1","fundValue":"240168","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  At Imperial College London and the London Centre for Nanotechnology we installed an electron microscope in 2006 which is unique in the UK and is one of only a few in the world.
