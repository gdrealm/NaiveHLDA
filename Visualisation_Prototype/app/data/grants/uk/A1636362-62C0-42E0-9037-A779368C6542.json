Building collaborations between academics (London South Bank University/University of Kent) and the third sector (Mix-d), the project raises general questions about the visibility and accessibility of minority ethnic history in Britain and asks how knowledge in this field can be better viewed and shared. These questions will be addressed specifically and explored practically and creatively through a small research project: 'Creating the 'Mix-d Museum'. This will involve the development of an interactive online archive for young people and schools based on research findings from a British Academy funded project on racial mixing and mixedness in 20th century Britain.\n\nThe proposed research collaboration and the activities emerging from it examines communication of academic knowledge in a digital age, the sharing and ownership of cultural memory and identity and the development of new ways of working to enhance access and creativity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J012718/1","grantId":"AH/J012718/1","fundValue":"23941","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  During 2012, Mix-d incorporated findings from the project in their presentations to and work with over 350 school children and 40-50 teachers, influencing curricula such as history and citizenship. Educators and students have made extensive use of the Museum. For example, one school in Manchester has incorporated the resource into their curriculum, while students at another Manchester school have produced a highly visible wall mural based on the Mix-d Museum model to communicate their own understandings of mixedness and family heritages to other students, teachers, parents and visitors.In 2013, Mix-d also drew on the project in their engagement with 250 foster carers to help them raise awareness of history and the potential issues facing mixed race families and equip them with appropriate understanding and resources. A number of bloggers have also written about how the Museum has helped shape and change understandings of the history of racial and ethnic mixing in Britain.

The collaboration has not only allowed the academic partners to reach a wider audience for their findings, but it has also encouraged them to think more innovatively and creatively about their dissemination processes generally. Under and through the guidance and contacts of Mix-d, the academic partners have been able to access established pathways to young people and schools and receive insightful feedback on their subject knowledge and interests, thus helping shape the content and direction of future research. Secondly, the collaboration has allowed Mix-d - who host the archive - access to rigorous and substantive academic knowledge that has informed the organisation's working and dissemination practices as well as providing access to a new audience of academics and practitioners. Thirdly, much of the ease of use and impact generated by the digital content is a result of the excellent web design which was outsourced to Ivy Park Media. The private sector partner has benefited from becoming a key member of a partnership at the forefront of using digital technologies to disseminate research to wider audiences. Overall, this partnership has resulted in a new and creative resource that will act as a model to others seeking to share 'hidden histories' with a wider audience, as well as a working relationship that continues to seek funding to develop knowledge transfer activities. In addition to enhancing awareness about the history of racial mixing and mixedness in Britain, the proposed activities also create an innovate model illustrating the 'potential of digitisation' for the process of 'opening up' of archives. We therefore expect that the project will have some impact on current dialogue and understandings of best practice in terms of sharing information on minority ethnic histories and engaging audiences who may not typically visit archives or museums, whether online or offline. As such, we expect our findings to continue to appeal to a range of audiences who also work to record and share information on minority ethnic history in Britain, not only the academic sector but also those within education and archive and museum development, as well as those with a specialist interest in minority ethnic and the experiences of mixed race people, couples and families in particular, including agencies working in the field of mixed race families and social care/support.
