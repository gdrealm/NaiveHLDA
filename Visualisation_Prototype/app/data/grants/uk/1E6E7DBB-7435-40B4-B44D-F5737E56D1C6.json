Services of these features are termed as pervasive services. Obviously creating such services of high adaptability is challenging. PANDA project is inspired by this challenge and proposes a novel methodology that will enable to create pervasive services in a user-friendly and automated way and to execute services in an adaptive manner. PANDA advocates the shift of the pervasive service engineering attention from the effort of building a service supporting environment to the emphasis on the pervasive service internal logic itself. To this end, PANDA will investigate the idea of utilizing policy-based management (PBM) method to describe and control the internal logic of pervasive services in a flexible way and the idea of utilizing layered models to describe the implementing code of pervasive services. In particular, a specific service description language utilizing PBM will be investigated so as to grant intelligence into pervasive services while keeping it adaptable to any contextual change. All these thoughts encourage the further decoupling of services from their underlying networks. The above methodology will be implemented into an open software platform and be evaluated by a real-life service scenario on the project testbed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D061881/1","grantId":"EP/D061881/1","fundValue":"213298","fundStart":"2006-12-15","fundEnd":"2009-12-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A few publications were generated out of this project.
