In the brain this need for communication between cells is highly specialised and regulated. Without this high degree of specialisation complex tasks such as learning and memory, facial recognition and the perception of emotions would not exist. In the brain, individual cells are called neurones and the specialised structures that mediate communication between them, are synapses. The synaptic contacts between neuronal cells are not generally hard wired but constantly adapt to inputs from the environment. This adaptation is known as synaptic plasticity. Plastic changes in synapses occur on several levels ranging from molecular changes (the individual proteins found in cells) to morphological changes (those that alter cell shape). In order for morphological changes to persist there needs to be a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton which provides physical structure to cells. At a molecular level, some of the signals which act as transducers of changes in the cell?s environment are secreted from one cell and are internalised (or endocytosed) by a neighbouring cell. In this manner cell to cell signalling is achieved. Morphological changes in neurons and initial stages of endocytosis involve a deformation of lipid membranes. Thus proteins that can both deform lipids and interact with the actin cytoskeleton are likely to have key roles in regulating both synaptic architecture and function. Proteins having these attributes are the focus of this application. One goal of the application is to determine how proteins form a bridge between the lipid membranes that surround cells and the actin cytoskeleton that maintains the shape of cells and to define how these proteins regulate synaptic transmission through morphological changes. A second goal of the application is to define the molecular pathway that is needed for signal transduction to maintain synaptic contacts in the brain. In neurodegenerative diseases the strength of contact between nerve cells (the synapses) is often affected and understanding which molecules are needed to establish and maintain these contacts in normal cells is important to be able to interpret the alterations in signalling that occur in diseased cells. Loss of these connections leads to deficiencies in learning and memory, facial recognition and the ability to perceive and convey emotions; these symptoms accompany many neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are becoming more prevalent in aging populations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802208","grantId":"G0802208","fundValue":"514964","fundStart":"2009-08-03","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Iain Martin Robinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
