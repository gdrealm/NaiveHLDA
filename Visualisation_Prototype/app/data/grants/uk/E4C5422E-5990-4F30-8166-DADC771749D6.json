{"id":"E4C5422E-5990-4F30-8166-DADC771749D6","title":"The identities of slaveholders in the British Atlantic world: a case study of Simon Taylor","abstractText":"The project considers aspects of the British diaspora that accompanied the expansion of British colonial power and explores the various ties that linked white colonists in the Caribbean to the metro pole. It considers the ways in which settlers combined involvement in distinctively local practices with a sense of being British subjects and examines the importance of the idea of cultural legitimacy and of fears about cultural and moral degeneracy. These themes are explored via a case study of a wealthy British emigrant who lived most of his life as a plantation owner and slaveholder in Jamaica.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119503/1","grantId":"119503/1","fundValue":"6598","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-04","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Christer  Petley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Leeds Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
