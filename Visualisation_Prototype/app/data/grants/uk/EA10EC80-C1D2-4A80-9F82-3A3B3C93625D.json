Within the germinal zones the type of pyramidal neuron generated is controlled by differential regulation of gene expression, some of which have been identified. We do not yet know how expression of particular genes leads to particular patterns of axon outgrowth, target selection, or physiological properties. Er81 is expressed at early stages of cortical development in the ventricular zone in dividing cells and then later in post-mitotic L5 neurons in the cortical plate. In both Pax6 mutants and Ngn2 mutants the expression of Er81 is disrupted, implying Er81 is regulated by both of these genes. This suggests an early role for Er81 in neuronal differentiation and cortical lamination/migration, similar to its role in olfactory bulb development. At later stages, most L5 Er81 expressing neurons also express Ctip2 but not Otx1. Ctip2 controls the formation of corticospinal axon outgrowth, whilst Otx1 controls outgrowth of collicular/pontine projections. Whilst some studies have shown ER81 to be down-stream of Ctip2, our preliminary microarray and qPCR data show that Er81 controls Ctip2, which is confirmed by the up-regulation of Ctip2 seen in the Er81 KO. Loss of Ctip2 results in a loss of CST axons, whilst reduced expression results in mis-specification of cortical pyramidal neurons, suggesting that Ctip2 and Er81 control the processes of axonal specification and collateral withdrawal of L5 projections. Outside the cortex, Er81 is expressed specifically in target nuclei of L5 neurons, such as the superior colliculus and inferior olive, offering an exciting avenue for investigation of specification of cortical connectivity. A similar role has been shown for Er81 in formation of circuitry in the spinal cord where ER81 is expressed by specific motor and sensory neurons and there are defects in the formation of these interconnections in mutants. Er81 and Ctip2 are both regulated by Fezf2. In Fezf2 mutants there is a mis-specification of the L5 Ctip2 expressing cells, which instead express Tbr1 and Satb2, migrate to L6 and send axons through the anterior commissure/corpus callosum. Satb2 is expressed in L5 callosal projection neurons and represses the expression of Ctip2. In the Er81 KO mouse we showed an increase in the number of Ctip2-expressing neurons with callosal projections suggesting that Er81 controls Ctip2 by suppressing Satb2. Er81 can be seen to play a central role in the establishment of cortical connectivity. In the last few years our understanding of the molecular control of cortical neuronal specification has improved and we have produced some very exciting preliminary data underpinning the proposed experiments. Whilst this complex network of genes regulates the development of particular pyramidal cells, we have very little idea about how changes in these networks allow for specific regional connectivity which is a fundamental process of brain wiring. As clinically related studies of brain development identify new gene associations with developmental disorders that result in altered brain function, it is essential to understand the details of the normal transcriptional networks. Whist it is perhaps premature to suggest that knowledge of how specific genes influence cortical wiring could enable future therapies, this will be essential if we are ever to use cell based therapies in brain repair. Current research has focused almost exclusively on the generation of identifiable neuronal cell classes from both innate and experimentally induced stem cells, no understanding of how such cells might be controlled in terms of their connectivity has yet been made.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I021833/1","grantId":"BB/I021833/1","fundValue":"642626","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Pathways to impact - Moln?r and Taylor\n\nCommunication and engagement with the wider community \nThis research addresses fundamental questions about normal brain development. There is a widely held fascination in understanding how the brain develops, in particular how the myriad of different neurons classes are generated in specific places and ratios and then link in a highly specific fashion to form the amazing network of connections which underpins brain function. There is now almost a daily item in the national press relating to work that forms the focus of this research. This highlights the importance society attaches to work in the field of brain science and in particular developmental disorders affecting human behaviour and function. \n\nTransfer of Knowledge to Future Generations \nGiven the strong underlying relevance of this work to clinical science, it is essential that future clinicians are both aware and understand the research and its implications. Oxford is one of the highest ranked medical schools internationally and we are privileged to teach highly motivated medical students and to attract undergraduate researchers to help with project work related to this proposal. This exposure seeds the imagination of future generations of clinicians, many of whom will continue in clinical research fields with a high level and essential understanding of the complexities of CNS development. Further, both JT and ZM are deeply involved in the Internationally rated Graduate Training Programme in Neuroscience at Oxford, which has generated a world class group of alumni, many of whom are now leading Neuroscience researchers. It is this initial educational impact, which ensures the future exploitation and maximization of the impact of this research.\n\nAcademic and Commercial Impact\nOur work will be published in leading open access scientific journals and present our findings at National and International meetings which is the conventional and established means of communication of the major findings of the research outlined in this programme. We will always seek to publish in highest impact journals thus ensuring the widest audience of researcher within the wider fields of Development and Neuroscience. Although we have no current plans for direct commercial exploitation of this work, public presentation and publication is the essential mechanism for generating interest in our work from Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical industries. We have requested the funding to ensure that this function of our scientific work is efficiently and optimally achieved. It is through such links that collaborations with clinicians, biotechnology companies and other researchers are fostered. If commercially exploitable finding are made, we will use the University ISIS innovations to ensure that this is maximised. \n\nCommunication to Policy Makers and the Wider Public \nBoth PIs are involved in communication of science to the wider community, through access and outreach programmes for Schools and through continuing education programmes. Significant findings will be publicised both in scientific journals and via Departmental and University WebPages and through these links, to the wider audience through the press. We will continue our work with the outreach programmes and seek to enhance our general public engagement. Both PIs also play important roles in the Development of Research strategy for the Medical Sciences Division in Oxford, and through this to the University and directly linking to both Government and charitable funding bodies.\n\nCollaboration and coproduction \nOur impressive and enthusiastic collaborators attest to the wide interest and potential of this research project. We will endeavour to continue to build on these international collaborations through meetings and laboratory exchanges in which we will promote the training and transfer of knowledge. Indeed Dr Cheung has just returned from an extensive visit to a collaborator in Japan to learn the technique of intrauterine electroporation. In terms of active collaborations with clinical science ZM has a long standing link to clinical neurology and neuropathology and regularly presents his findings to a clinical audience. \n\nExploitation and Application \nOxford now has a Stem Cell research initiative and we intend to link to this programme and with the laboratories involved in neuronal stem cell work. A fundamental part of attempts to use cell based therapies to repair the CNS is to ensure that the connections formed by transplanted cells are appropriate and effectively restore function. Our deep understanding of this field and the knowledge generated from the work outlined in this proposal will be of essential interest to Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology companies in this area. Whilst we currently have no commercial exploitation plans, any finding that do have potential will be exploited through Oxford ISIS Innovations. JT has followed this route with ISIS Innovations based upon similar work on neuronal cell survival.\n\nCapacity and involvement \nBoth PIs undertake certain public engagement activities as outlined above. These include school visits, open days, science festivals, as well as academic conferences which enable us to both formally and informally disseminate our research. We will also use the University of Oxford Press Office to ensure maximum public impact of our notable research findings.\n \nImpact ability, deliverables and milestones \nWhilst this work does not have immediate commercial goals, our hope is that the finding from this research will inform the wider scientific and specific biotechnology communities involved in brain development and repair. From previous experience, the progress from initial discussion of invention to engagement with potential commercial partners is within the time frame of this proposal. If such opportunities present we would hope that a five year period for commercial exploitation would be realistic.\n\nResource for the activity \nWe do not seek additional funding for potential exploitation or specific avenues for communication, as our current activities and the normal plans for public engagement can be met within the outlined budget. Any resultant commercial exploitation or wider publicity would be provided by ISIS Innovation and the University Press Office without cost.

Define the genesis, migration, dendritic and axonal development of the population of L5 Er81 neurons and correlate this morphology with differential gene expression.\n\n2. Define the role of Er81 in the transcriptional network that regulates the development of a sub-population L5 pyramidal neurons\n\n3. To establish the role of Er81 in the connectivity of L5 neurons.\n\nWe made progress in all three areas over the last 1-1.5 years and we shall soon be in a position to summarise the details in publications. The project is progressing according to the original plans, but these are still early days to provide comprehensive and final summaries for these questions.\n\n\n\n1. Basic developmental studies of Er81 expression and characterisation of the L5 sub-population is progressing well and nearing completion. We are currently investigating the somatodendritic morphology of layer 5 neurons. The retrograde tracing and immunohistochemistry part of the project is completed for adult. \n\n2. The analysis of Er81 KO by immunohistochemistry has begun. We had difficulties to breed the Er81 KO colony, but now we have sufficient numbers to complete the study. We used viral tracing methods to dissect the circuits formed by Er81 positive layer 5 neurons and Er81 positive ventral horn motorneurons.\n\n3. The molecular studies to elucidate the genes that are regulated by Er81 by over-expressing Er81 in the developing cortex in vitro has been completed and we also completed the microarray-based expression analysis. We completed the validation of selected candidate genes by qPCR, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. Similar analysis is ongoing of the KO mouse. Some of the ChIP-PCR studies are completed, but others are still ongoing. Validation of candidate genes will start this year. \n\n4. Identifying Er81 target genes is on-going, the investigation of the Tshz2 KO mouse started, but not completed. \n\nThese experiments shall lead to the findings that we shall publish openly in the literature in due course. Our research is primarily concerned with basic developmental neurobiology, but the implications could be very general in due course. Er81 is a key gene that is involved in the generation and differentiation of upper (layer 5 cortical) and lower (ventral horn spinal cord) motorneurons. Understanding Er81 action can have very general implications, including devastating human pathologies. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
