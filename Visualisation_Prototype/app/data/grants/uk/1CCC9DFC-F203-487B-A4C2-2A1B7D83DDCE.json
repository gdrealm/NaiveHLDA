One such bug is Clostridium difficile. It causes debilitating diarrhoea, which in extreme cases can kill. It mainly affects the elderly. As this proportion of the population is increasing, the disease is becoming more common. Worryingly, a new, even more deadly variant has now arrived in Europe from North America. Aside from the human suffering, it costs the European health services over 2 billion dollars per year and now is responsible for more deaths per year in the UK than MRSA. Currently there is no vaccine available to prevent C. difficile disease but vaccination has been very successful in preventing other bacterial diseases that were once common. Development of a vaccine for C.difficile would therefore be a very important step forward in fighting this common and potentially deadly infection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900858","grantId":"G0900858","fundValue":"144130","fundStart":"2009-12-08","fundEnd":"2011-06-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Minton","coPersons":["Alan  Cockayne","Shaun  McNulty"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
