{"id":"EC33DC31-E105-4926-923B-FE2CA3BD55E5","title":"Enhancing the integration of quantitative methods skills in undergraduate social sciences curricula","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this pilot project is to enhance our understanding of the ways in which quantitative methods training can be more effectively integrated with teaching in substantive disciplinary based courses within the social sciences. Focus groups with student and staff groups will be undertaken to explore perceptions of the relationship between QM training and learning in substantive subject areas, and to identify the barriers to fuller integration of curricula and the actions which may be undertaken to overcome such barriers. </p>\n\n<p>A series of workshops will be organised for academic staff to explore ways in which skills and confidence in utilising QM in the learning and teaching process may be enhanced. Support will be provided for academic staff in integrating quantitative material into substantive course units through the development &amp; implementation of on-line resources within the University's Virtual Learning Environment. </p>\n\n<p>The project will last for 20 months and will focus on disciplines where historically the use of quantitative methods has been low such as Applied Social Sciences, Politics, International Relations, Social Work, Sociology and Social Policy.&nbsp; The project is part of a broader agenda to increase the knowledge and use of quantitative methods amongst undergraduates within the social sciences.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E016952/1","grantId":"ES/E016952/1","fundValue":"61670","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Cecelia Falkingham","coPersons":["Anthony  McGrew","Jackie  Powell","Bernard Jonathan Harris"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
