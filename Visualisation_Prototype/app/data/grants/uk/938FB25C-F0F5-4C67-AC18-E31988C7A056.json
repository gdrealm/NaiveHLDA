These include Computer Vision, Graphics, Motion-Capture, Human-Computer Interaction, Biomechanics and Healthcare, underpinned by a strong portfolio of DE research funding from RCUK and other funders. CAMERA will deliver Applied Visual Technology into our partners companies and their industries, to achieve high economic, societal and cultural impact.\n\nBath leads the UK in innovative creative industry research and training for post-graduates through our CDE, which is contractually partnered with 35 innovative UK companies. Growing from our established core strength in the area of Visual Technology - capturing, modelling and visualising the real world - and our strong historical foundation of entertainment-delivered research, CAMERA will focus on high-impact work in movies, TV visual vffects (VFX) and video games with partners at the The Imaginarium and The Foundry, two of the world's leading visual entertainment companies. This focused collaboration will push the boundaries of technology in the area of human motion capture, understanding and animation, and artist driven visual effects production, feeding into our existing CDE partnerships.\n\nFrom this strong foundation, we will extend and apply visual technology to new areas of high economic, societal and cultural impact within the digital economy theme. These include Human Performance Enhancement, with partners in British Skeleton and BMT Defence Services; and Health, Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies, with partners in the Ministry of Defence.\n\nCAMERA is well placed to lead the application of Visual Technology in these new directions: Bath researchers have helped athletes to win 15 Olympic and World Championship medals in the last 10 years and have contributed significantly to national efforts in integrating ex-soldiers with disabilities into civilian life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M023281/1","grantId":"EP/M023281/1","fundValue":"3994060","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2020-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Darren Peter Cosker","coPersons":["Matthew Alun Brown","Eamonn  O'Neill","Neill Duncan Campbell","Yongliang  Yang","Peter Maxwell Hall","Phil  Willis","Aki Ilkka Salo","James Lee Bilzon"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
