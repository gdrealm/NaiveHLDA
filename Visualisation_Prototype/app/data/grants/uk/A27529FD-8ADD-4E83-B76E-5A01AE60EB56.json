{"id":"A27529FD-8ADD-4E83-B76E-5A01AE60EB56","title":"Combinatorics of DAHA and higher dimensional Langlands","abstractText":"A collection of symmetries is called a group; an object which displays thesesymmetries is called a representation of the group. Given such a group,one wishes to understand all possible representations of it--- the differentobjects which display its symmetries.For groups which arise in linear algebra--- the matrix groups--- there is anextraordinary conjecture, called 'The Langlands Program', which predicts theanswer. This conjecture uses and unifies many many parts of mathematics---number theory, algebraic geometry, topology, and has many strikingconsequences.What we'd like to do in this proposal is find some consequencesof a generalization of the Langlands program that has not yet been formulated.These consequences will help to discover this generalization.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H015531/1","grantId":"EP/H015531/1","fundValue":"16105","fundStart":"2009-12-23","fundEnd":"2010-09-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Grojnowski","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
