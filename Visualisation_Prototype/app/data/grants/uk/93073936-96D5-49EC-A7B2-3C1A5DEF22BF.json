These are machine-readable (plain text) files containing hand-crafted examples of grammatical and ungrammatical structures in Indonesian, annotated with translations of each example and comments on grammatical structure. Test suites as well as naturally-occurring corpora are also useful in bench-marking, or establishing comparisons between different computational gram-mars and lexicons for the same language. \n\n\n\nTestsuites such as TSNLP for English, French, and German (Oepen et al. 1998, Oepen &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Flickinger 1998) and corpora such as the Verbmobil suites for English, German, and Japanese (Wahlster 2000), and the Wall Street Journal corpus for English (Marcus et al. 1994) have been useful in allowing comparisons in coverage to be made across grammars. \n\n\n\nThe systematic nature, broad coverage, and controlled content of testsuites can make them more useful than uncontrolled corpora in fine-grained investigation of differences in coverage across grammars. With our Indonesian testsuites available to the computational linguistic community, computational work on Indonesian can take advantage of the ability they afford for testing and benchmarking. The initial customer for these resources was the Australian Research Council (ARC) project &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Understanding Indonesian: developing a machine-usable grammar, dictionary and corpus&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; (2008-2010; principal investigators Dr. Jane Simpson, Dr. I Wayan Arka, Dr. Avery Andrews; partner investigator Dalrymple), which is building a comprehensive computational grammar of Indonesian and a large, balanced Indonesian corpus. Our testsuites provide a basis for developing and testing the coverage of the grammar, and are useful at two stages of grammar development. \n\n\n\n First, when the grammar writer augments the coverage of the grammar to handle a new construction, the testfiles provide a guide and basis for encoding the grammatical\n\nproperties of the construction in the grammar, and ensure that no aspects of the structure of the construction are overlooked. Second, as the grammar expands, the testsuites targeting constructions already covered in the grammar are used in regression testing, to ensure that no coverage is lost as the grammar is modified to cover new constructions.
