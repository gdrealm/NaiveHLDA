The innovation comprises: a flexible component model and related software architecture designed to support evolution; the design of a virtual machine environment using Compliant Components; and the implementation of this virtual machine environment above a microkernel, L4. The combination of these concepts and tools enables the evolution and flexible definition of software systems to be extended into the operating system level, enabling greater control of system services.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E009212/1","grantId":"EP/E009212/1","fundValue":"13897","fundStart":"2006-08-10","fundEnd":"2006-10-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ron  Morrison","coPersons":["Dharini  Balasubramaniam"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
