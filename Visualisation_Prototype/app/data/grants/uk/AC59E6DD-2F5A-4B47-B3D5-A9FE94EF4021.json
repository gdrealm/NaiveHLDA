{"id":"AC59E6DD-2F5A-4B47-B3D5-A9FE94EF4021","title":"Development of a self-disinfecting dental alginate impression material","abstractText":"An important part of restorative dentistry is taking an impression of the patient's mouth (teeth, gums and palate), in order to obtain a model to be used to construct dentures (partial or full), crowns or bridges. Elastic impression materials are an important class of impression materials; these are applied by the dentist to the patient's mouth as a dough or paste, and accurately reproduce the fine detail of the oral structures. After some minutes, the material sets to an elastic rubber-like gel, whereupon the impression is removed from the mouth, and sent to the dental laboratory where a model is cast. Alginates are supplied to the dentist in a powder form containing other ingredients, including setting agents. The dentist mixes a measured amount of the powder with water, to give a paste, which is placed in a tray and applied to the mouth. The paste sets to a gel after some minutes. Globally alginates are one of the most frequently used elastic impression materials for taking dental impressions. They are the major material used in developing countries, due to their low cost and ease of application. Currently, all dental impression materials are supposed to be disinfected as soon as they are removed from the patient's mouth, in order to minimise the risk of transmitting infectious agents to dental personnel. However, various studies have reported that post-setting disinfection procedures are often not followed, and can compromise the dimensional stability of alginates. There is a risk of microbial cross-infection via the impression material between the patient and dental staff due to microorganisms from the patient's mouth as well as from skin, the impression powder, water contaminants and the environment. Hence, in this study novel self-disinfecting dental alginate formulations are being developed which are effective against a broad spectrum of microbes in order to address the globally recognised need for improved infection control.The main objective of the project is to develop an impression material that is self-disinfecting, non-toxic to the patient and that crucially, is low cost, thereby encouraging its use worldwide. This development will contribute significantly to reducing cross-contamination incidence and risk of infection due to the dental impression handling process from initial taking to final production of the denture.Three formulations will be developed building on earlier work with low pH alginates having anti-viral activity against the Herpes simplex virus. The formulations will be modified for the maintainance of a low pH together with the release of nitric oxide, a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent. Disinfection will be tested on impression materials contaminated with infectious agents from i) the respiratory tract and, due to global concerns of the risk posed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), a model organism for TB (Mycobacterium smegmatis) will also be included, ii) the oral cavity, iii) tap water, iv) the environment and v) skin. Viruses, bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans (the cause of oral infections such as denture stomatitis and thrush) will be used to test the antimicrobial acivity of the formulations. Tests will be performed under conditions simulating the oral cavity, by using artificial saliva and sterile human saliva, and disinfection of contaminants, both on the surface and within the impression material will be examined. To model the transit time from patient to laboratory, the killing rates for the alginates will be investigated.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H020888/1","grantId":"EP/H020888/1","fundValue":"365565","fundStart":"2010-06-14","fundEnd":"2013-09-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We were able to develop several alginate impression materials with demonstrable antimicrobial activity.

The aim was to develop a relatively cheap and straightforward self-disinfecting alginate impression material with bactericidal and virucidal properties.\n \nA number of experimental alginates were formulated ab initio with for example varying magnesium oxide (MgO) content to reduce the pH of the set material, incorporation of sodium nitrite and ascorbic acid to release nitric oxide (NO), and variations in filler, retarding agent, cross-linking agent and alginate type to optimise the physical properties. A control experimental material (F1c) was also formulated with 10% MgO to compare with the former formulations. Neocolloid (Zhermack) and Empress (PSP Dental) were used as commercial control materials. In the latter part of the study Neeocolloid was used as the commercial control, due to its Shore A hardness, tear strength and other properties.\n \nIt was apparent that experimental alginate materials formulated with 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% magnesium oxide (MgO) respectively, showed increase in pH with an increase in MgO within the formulation. Experimental material F1, based on sodium alginate, was formulated by substituting the cross-linking agent MgO with diatomaceous earth. It gave comparable results to Neocolloid with regard to Shore A hardness and weight change in air, pH, tear energy and it reduced all bacteria tested. \n\nThe low pH exhibited by F1 can be attributed to the formation of hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of the hydrolysis of potassium fluorotitanate. In materials formulated with MgO (eg F1c), HF is removed via the formation of magnesium fluoride, subsequently causing an increase in pH, as seen with F1c. The persistent low pH observed with F1 can therefore be explained by the exclusion of MgO from the formulation. Mean tear energy reflected the structure of the set material, where a higher degree of cross-linking conveys higher tear strength. The mean weight loss in air at 1 hour was less for F1 compared with the commercial material Neocolloid. \n\nDue to the low pH alginate (F1), this material was incompatible with gypsum pouring products. Therefore a further set of formulations were devised, based on Zinc Oxide, (ZnO - which provided lower pH on setting than MgO), and studied in detail with respect to physicomechanical properties. From the latter, F1Zn8 (containing 8% ZnO) emerged as a suitable candidate, presenting with an initial low pH and it was compatible with gypsum. This formulation, together with F1, Neocolloid, F1Zn8NO (plus 8% ZnO and also containing sodium nitrite and ascorbic acid for nitric oxide delivery) and F1NO (no ZnO or MgO but also containing sodium nitrite and ascorbic acid for nitric oxide delivery) were taken forward for antibacterial study. \n\nThe bacteria tested for antibacterial activity were:-\nStaphylococcus epidermidis (skin)\nStaphylococcus aureus (skin and nose)\nEscherichia coli (gastrointestinal tract)\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (environmental and clinical - opportunist pathogen and a common contaminant and source of nosocomial infections)\nMycobacterium smegmatis (model organism for Mycobacterium tuberculosis)\nCandida albicans (a yeast, not a bacterium; oral yeast causes denture stomatitis and other infections)\nStreptococcus mutans (oral commensal - cariogenic)\nPorphyromonas gingivalis (oral pathogen - perio disease)\nFusobacterium nucleatum (oral pathogen - perioand other infections)\nLactobacillus casei (oral commensal - cariogenic)\n\nAll these were tested for survival on Neocolloid, F1, F1Zn8, F1Zn8NO and F1NO. We looked for killing at 2 hrs and 24hrs. All materials including Neocolloid showed a wide range of antibacterial activities. However, Neocolloid was least effective of the materials tested with survival of E. coli, Ps aeruginosa and S. mutans at 2 hrs. Material F1 was most effective with greatest reduction of all microorganisms tested (reduction to below detection limit of the experiment). F1Zn8 NO and F1NO were least effective with Candida albicans and S. mutans detectable again at 24 hrs. \n\nAnti-viral study\nWe tested the most promising materials (F1 and F1Zn8) and Neocolloid (commercial material) against 2 blood borne viruses (relevant to dentists obviously). The viruses tested were i) Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (2 strains tested) and ii) Hepatitis C virus (1 strain tested of this).\n\nHIV:\nBoth test materials F1 and F1Zn8 gave significantly greater reduction in infectious virus compared to the commercial material (Neocolloid). At 5 mins the virus had been reduced to approximately 35% of the starting titre on Neocolloid compared to a reduction to 10% approx. for the test materials. At 2 hrs Neocolloid reduced the virus titre to approx. 20% of the starting titre and the test materials reduced titres to less than 10%. At 5 hrs Neocolloid reduced titres to approx. 7% of starting titre and test materials reduced the titres to less than 5%.\nTherefore the test materials showed greater antiviral activity particularly over the shorter time point with consistently improved antiviral activity over the whole of the experimental time course.\n\nHep C:\nBoth materials showed improved antiviral activity against Hep C.\n\nAt 5 mins Neocolloid gave a reduction in virus titre to 25% approx of the 'virus alone' negative control compared to a reduction of between 12 and 15% approx. for the 2 test materials. At 2 hrs Neocolloid gave a reduction to 10% approx. with test materials reducing the titre to between 4 and 7%. At 5 hrs Neocolloid and the test materials had reduced the virus to approx. 5% of the starting titre.\n\nTherefore both test materials gave improved antiviral activity as before, particularly over the shorter timepoint ie an improved immediate reduction in virus titre compared to the commercial material.\n\nIn all cases, considerably greater antibacterial activity was achieved with F1 than with Neo and F1c. However, F1 was less effective at reducing E. coli.\n\nA low-pH alginate impression material exhibiting antibacterial activity has been developed with physico-mechanical properties comparable to a commercial material.
