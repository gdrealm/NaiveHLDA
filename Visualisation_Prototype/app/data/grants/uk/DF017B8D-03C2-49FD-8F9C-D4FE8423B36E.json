Much less attention has been paid to establishing what exactly things look like, probably because it seems self-evident. However even such elementary perceptions as achromatic colours have a more complicated internal structure than one might suppose. Contrary to the general belief that achromatic colours can be described as a one-dimensional continuum (referred to as lightness), we show that, in fact, they constitute a two-dimensional manifold. We plan to study the geometrical properties of this manifold using multidimensional scaling. We shall investigate apparent illumination/lightness invariance using a new approach. We shall also address the classical problem of lightness constancy (with respect to illumination and position) within a new theoretical and methodological framework.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C010353/1","grantId":"EP/C010353/1","fundValue":"172442","fundStart":"2006-03-08","fundEnd":"2009-09-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander D Logvinenko","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Glasgow Caledonian University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
