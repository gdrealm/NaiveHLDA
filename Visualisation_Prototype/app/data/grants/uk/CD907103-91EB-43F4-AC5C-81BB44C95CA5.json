The work is organized in three themes on crop, livestock and trade modelling. The partnership consists of 73 partners from 16 countries all over Europe. The overarching challenge is to develop a pan-European capability in the development, use and interpretation of models to perform risk assessments of the impacts of climate change on European agriculture. To address this the following challenges must be met:\n1. Identify and address a range of issues between models in different themes to enable their closer integration including issues of scale and data processing.\n2. Train a new generation of scientists to work across models which contribute to greater integration of models. This challenge can be described as focusing on the creation of integrated modellers as opposed to integrated models.\n3. Determine the contribution that can be made to reducing uncertainty over the impacts of climate change on European food security by adopting integrated models of crop production, animal production and trade.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K010514/1","grantId":"BB/K010514/1","fundValue":"233434","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Tiffin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
