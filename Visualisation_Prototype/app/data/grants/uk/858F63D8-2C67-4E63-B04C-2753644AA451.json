These dual-task interference patterns are thought to reflect a competition for cognitive resources, such as spatial information processing capacity, or “bottlenecks” in allocating attention.</p> \n<p>The proposed work will reach beyond these general terms accounts and ask whether simply the possibility of sharing a common workspace, such as the same spatial reference frame, between a memory task and posture control can significantly affect the level of interference between them. </p> \n<p>Four experiments will manipulate the orientation of a memory task’s workspace relative to the postural task’s workspace, and they will do this in two contexts that reflect the dual role played by posture control in our everyday behaviour. The first is the context of maintaining balance, and the second is facilitating suprapostural tasks such as enabling the body to aim at or align with objects in the environment. Based on pilot work data, we expect to find that the possibility of sharing workspaces during such dual-tasking can actually enhance coordination, whereas separate workspaces gives rise to interference patterns.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2248","grantId":"RES-000-22-2248","fundValue":"78575","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Subhobrata  Mitra","coPersons":["Elaine Vida Fraizer"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
