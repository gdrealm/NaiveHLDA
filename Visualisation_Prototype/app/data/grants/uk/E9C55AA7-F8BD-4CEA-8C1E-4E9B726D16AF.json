According to the Complementary Learning Systems model, interplay between hippocampal and neocortical brain areas is thought to underpin this process, with the relative contribution of each area to learning determined by the structural properties of the new memories, as well as their relationship with existing memories. Specifically, the level of systematicity within a set of new memories is predicted to be inversely related to the involvement of the hippocampus in their learning and its interaction with the neocortex during sleep.</p>\n\n<p>These novel predictions have not been explored in the context of memory consolidation. However, the influence of systematicity has been studied extensively in the context of language processing, and this research has informed key debates in psycholinguistics. We will exploit existing language paradigms to evaluate the influence of systematicity on the role of sleep in consolidation of new memories. The results of our studies will be influential in two ways. First, they will bring a new dimension to key debates in psycholinguistics by determining whether and how sleep influences language processing. More broadly, they will inform models of the influence of sleep on long-term memory formation</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-3194","grantId":"RES-062-23-3194","fundValue":"311018","fundStart":"2011-10-17","fundEnd":"2015-01-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Gareth Gaskell","coPersons":["Jelena  Mirkovic"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" not applicable this year not applicable this year Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism","dataset":"gtr"}
