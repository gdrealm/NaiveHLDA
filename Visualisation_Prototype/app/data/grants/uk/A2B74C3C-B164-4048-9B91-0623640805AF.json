{"id":"A2B74C3C-B164-4048-9B91-0623640805AF","title":"Innovative Low Carbon, High Fuel Efficiency Power Generation Technology","abstractText":"The overall goal of the work at Brunel would be to improve understanding of the ideal combustion system via theoretical\nanalysis, simulation and engine testing.\nThe objective of the first phase of work at Brunel would be to specify a combustion system that can attain the highest\ncombustion and thermal efficiencies within the unique environment of relatively high starting temperature, low starting\npressure and expanding volume. Initial work would involve benchmarking the requirements of the combustion system.\nSpecifically, this would be reliant upon use of existing empirical data for key nominated fuels (including natural gas and\nother potential biofuels offering synergy). Such calculations would provide a baseline. In reality faster modes may be\nrequired (e.g. fuel stratification, dual fuel etc). Thereafter, formal engineering concept generation and selection procedures\nwould be adopted to specify the ideal combustion system type and layout. The performance of the system taken forward\nwould then be evaluated in detail using existing 1D thermodynamic (GT-Power) and/or 3D CFD simulation codes. In\naddition to this simulation work Brunel would undertake a detailed review of potential markets and appropriate fuels for the\ntechnology, with a full report on potential future opportunities prepared.\nThereafter, in the second phase of work at Brunel the single cylinder would be fitted to an engine test bed and the\noperation of the novel unit fully quantified in terms of mechanical operation, gas exchange efficiency, combustion efficiency,\nthermal efficiency, fuel economy and engine-out emissions. This work would make use of the existing industry standard\ntest facilities at Brunel, with development support provided by the industrial partners as required. Specifically, the engine\noperation and efficiencies would be evaluated at rated power and other key sites nominated to aid understanding of the\nnovel mode of operation. Finally, these test results would be used to fully correlate the engine simulation and hence\nmaximise understanding of the novel mode of engine operation proposed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N50841X/1","grantId":"EP/N50841X/1","fundValue":"230046","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alasdair  Cairns","coPersons":["Hua  Zhao","Jun  Xia"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
