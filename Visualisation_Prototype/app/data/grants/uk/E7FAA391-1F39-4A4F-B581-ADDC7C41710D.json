{"id":"E7FAA391-1F39-4A4F-B581-ADDC7C41710D","title":"Submodular Optimisation Techniques for Scheduling with Controllable Parameters","abstractText":"Scheduling with Controllable Processing Parameters (SCPP) has been pursued for the past 30 years and has recently developed into an important field of study with various application areas including supply chain management, operations management, imprecise computation, power-aware computer processing, etc. In the SCPP models, some problem parameters such as job processing times are often not fixed but can be controlled. Typically, the decision-maker may choose the actual durations from a given range to allow some jobs to be completed earlier. Reducing the processing times may improve the overall performance (meeting the due dates, reducing the time in the system, etc.), but this usually incurs additional costs or quality losses. The trade-off between the improvement of a scheduling objective and the cost at which that can be achieved gives the decision-maker a range of time/cost options to select from.\n\nMany SCPP problems are known to admit efficient solution procedures. However, until recently no general methodological framework to handle these problems has been offered. Moreover, the problems arising from different application domains but sharing the same underlying model were often treated independently without a careful study of their common properties.\n\nIn our recent collaborative study we have discovered that SCPP problems can be reduced to optimisation problems over special regions that fall into the category of Submodular Systems (polymatroids and their generalisations, base polyhedra, etc.). Already our first work has shown a definite advantage of using the Submodular Optimisation (SO) methods for solving SCPP problems. The resulting algorithms are faster, more elegant and easier to justify than those known earlier and are capable of solving a wider range of SCPP models, including those with no prior history of study.\n\nA high level of abstraction does not easily allow practitioners and researchers in OR to employ the results of SO in their work. In particular, the advantages of the SO techniques, which are especially promising for solving SCPP problems, are not fully acknowledged by the scheduling research community and often overlooked. We anticipate that combined efforts of the scheduling and SO researchers will make interesting contributions to both fields, Scheduling and SO. The current project can help in achieving this goal by joining forces and taking advantage of the complementary skills of the UK team (Dr. Shakhlevich and Prof. Strusevich with their total publication record exceeding 100 journal papers, mainly on scheduling) and of the Japanese partner (Dr. Shioura who is famous for his fundamental research in Submodular Optimisation and Combinatorial Optimisation in general).\n\nWithin this project we intend to study several representative SCPP models producing their SO reformulations and advanced procedures for solving two versions of those models: the single criterion problem of finding a feasible schedule minimizing the total compression cost and bicriteria problems of simultaneous minimisation of the maximum completion time of all jobs and total compression cost. The obtained results will make interesting contributions to both fields, SO and Scheduling, and provide a new unified methodology for tackling complex problems with controllable parameters.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J019755/1","grantId":"EP/J019755/1","fundValue":"24054","fundStart":"2013-02-06","fundEnd":"2014-02-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The advantages of the Submodular Optimisation techniques are not fully acknowledged by the general scheduling community and often overlooked. \nThe project delivered convincing examples of effective applications of SO to Scheduling with the two major implications: \n- the Submodular Optimisation research community received new models arising from scheduling applications, for which there is a need to develop new SO techniques; \n- the Scheduling research community received a new methodology, that leads to more efficient and powerful algorithms, capable of solving the most complicated versions of the problems with two criteria optimised simultaneously.

That link has been explored in both directions. \n\n(1) For scheduling problems, we develop new algorithms based on Submodular Optimisation findings. The sope of scheduling models studied is broad, with models ranging in terms of the characteristics of processing machines (single or parallel machines, machines with equal or different speeds), job models (jobs with equal or different release dates/due dates) and objectives (single-criteria and bicriteria models). \n\nThe advantages of the new algorithms are: \n\n- a common underlying theory \n\n- efficiency (they outperform the algorithms previously known)\n\n- their ability to handle most complicated problems, for which no prior algorithms are known. \n\n\n\n(2) The special features of scheduling problems with controllable processing times had led to further advancement of Submodular Optimisation theoretical results and solution techniques. We have explored further the models with non-equal lower bounds on job processing times (the constraint typically not studied in Submodular Optimisation), decomposition method for optimising a linear function over submodular polyhedron intersected with a box, and optimisation of a parametric function arising in bicriteria scheduling research.\n\n\n\nOverall the project has advanced both disciplines: scheduling and submodular optimisation, and had led to formulating new research directions worth studying. - Manufacturing systems, where job processing may depend on a costly common resource such as energy, workforce, catalyser or raw materials;\n\n- Computing systems that support imprecise computations, where time-consuming computation tasks can be performed partially in order to meet the deadlines but at a cost of less precise results and information loss;\n\n- Supply chain scheduling, where a `win-win' situation can be achieved through simultaneous control of the processing times at different stages of the chain with additional costs paid to compensate the partners for any additional expenses incurred. \n\n- Make-or-buy decision making, where internal production workload can be reduced via subcontracting;\n\n- Energy aware scheduling in distributed computing (Grids and Clouds).
