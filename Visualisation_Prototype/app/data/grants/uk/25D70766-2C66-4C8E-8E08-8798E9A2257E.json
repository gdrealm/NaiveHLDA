Studies in the Polar Regions provide vital clues in our understanding of global climate, and early indications of changes arising from the coupling of natural processes, such as variability in the amount of energy from the Sun reaching the Earth, and man-made factors. For example, the polar winter provides the extreme cold, dark conditions in the atmosphere which, combined with chemicals released from man-made chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases, has led to destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer 18-25 km above the ground every spring-time since the 1980's. The Southern hemisphere ozone 'hole' is now linked to observed changes in surface temperature and sea-ice across Antarctica, decreased uptake of carbon dioxide by the Southern Ocean, and perturbations to the atmospheric circulation that can affect weather patterns as far away as the Northern hemisphere.\n\nRecovery of the ozone layer is expected now that CFC's are banned by international protocols, but this may be delayed by other greenhouse gases we are releasing into the atmosphere and natural processes including changes in the Sun's output. Although the total amount of energy as sunlight changes by a small amount (~0.1%) over the typical 11-year solar cycle, the energetic electrons and protons streaming from the Sun changes dramatically on timescales from hours to years. These particles are guided by the Earth's magnetic field and can enter the upper atmosphere, most intensely over the Polar Regions. A visible effect is the aurora, but the particles can also significantly modify the chemistry of the atmosphere down to the stratospheric ozone layer. Powerful solar storms can also damage satellites and disrupt electrical power networks. However the mechanisms by which energetic electrons generated by the Sun enter the Earth's atmosphere, and the complex, interacting processes that affect stratospheric ozone are not well understood, which limits our ability to accurately predict future ozone changes and impacts on climate.\n\nWe propose answering major unresolved questions about the impact of energetic electrons on stratospheric ozone by making observations of the middle atmosphere from Halley station in Antarctica. This location is directly under the main region where energetic electrons enter the atmosphere, making it ideal to observe the resulting effects. We will install a state-of-the-art microwave radiometer there alongside other equipment run by BAS scientists. By analysing the microwaves naturally emitted by the atmosphere high above us we can work out how much ozone there is 30-90 km above the ground as well as measuring chemicals produced in the atmosphere by energetic electrons that affect ozone. We will make observations throughout two complete Antarctic years/winters (1/2013-2/2015) and interpret them with the help of data from spacecraft that orbit the Earth and measure the energetic electrons entering the atmosphere. We will use the Antarctic observations and develop computer-based models to better understand the impact of energetic electrons on the atmosphere. The ultimate goal is to further understanding of the processes that lead to climate variability in the Polar Regions and globally - highly relevant for UK environmental science and collaborative research at an international level in which BAS and Leeds play a key role.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J022187/1","grantId":"NE/J022187/1","fundValue":"315976","fundStart":"2013-06-30","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The observational data produced by this project are being shared with scientific colleagues to inform their development of atmospheric models, the aim being to accurately represent the chemical and dynamical impacts of space weather and energetic electron precipitation into the polar middle and upper atmosphere following geomagnetic storms.

Key achievements • BAS microwave radiometer deployed at the Halley VI Research Station (75&deg;36'S, 26&deg;14'W), Brunt Ice Shelf, Antarctica during January-March 2013. • High abundances of mesospheric nitric oxide (NO) observed above Halley following small solar proton events and geomagnetic storms in winter 2013. • Halley riometer data and electron and proton fluxes and count rates indicate that &amp;amp;gt;100 keV electron precipitation produces significant NO directly at 60-90 km. • Successful upgrade of BAS microwave radiometer data acquisition software and spectrometers during visit to Halley by PI in February 2014. The routes identified in the Pathways to Impact statement remain valid for this project. The opening in October 2014 of a new Space Weather Operations Centre at the Met Office highlights the importance attached to better understanding solar variability and energy transfer into the Earth's geomagnetic system and atmosphere following solar storms. The outcomes of research from this project benefit the Met Office developments in upper atmosphere coupling and space weather; Ozone in Numerical Weather Prediction Applications; Climate Research; and Coupled Climate Chemistry Modelling.
