Current interest from academia and industry is driven by their remarkable photophysical properties and suitability for a variety of applications. The success of such complexes is mainly due to the presence of cyclometallated metal centre in a luminophore, which promotes efficient phosphorescence from the triplet state.We propose to make new luminescent molecules with two or more metal centres within one rigid integrated lumonophore. We think that in these large conjugated systems the heavy atom effect will be enhanced leading to efficient phosphorescence in the red and possibly extending far into the infrared region of the spectrum. The molecules of this kind are of interest in supramolecular chemistry as building blocks in assembly of new metallosupramolecular architectures, which in comparison with classical polypyridine-based assemblies, can provide more controlled geometry and superior luminescent properties. In addition, our molecules can give rise to many interesting effects arising from intermolecular pi-pi and Pt-Pt-centred interactions suggesting development of stimuli responsive materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I014942/1","grantId":"EP/I014942/1","fundValue":"81189","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Valery N Kozhevnikov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":" The main idea of the project was to make and investigate new systems with two or more metal centres within one molecule. As a result, we developed synthetic pathways to these complex molecules. The very first examples showed excellent photophysical properties. Our red emitters showed quantum yields of 65%, in the region which puts them our materials together with the top performing materials known to date. In addition we have observed that the introduction of the second metal centre decreases luminescence lifetime - a very desirable effect to be utilised in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). \nBy structural modification of the bridging ligands, we achieved emission in near-infrared region of the spectrum. This kind of luminescent molecules is interesting for application in lumincesent bioimaging. \nMultimetallic assemblies are of interest in supramolecular. We prepared first model systems in this regard and observed that, in comparison with classical polypyridine-based assemblies, our systems provide more controlled geometry and superior luminescent properties. Our red and NIR-emitters are of particular interest to be utilised in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and luminescent bioimaging. Chemicals,Energy,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
