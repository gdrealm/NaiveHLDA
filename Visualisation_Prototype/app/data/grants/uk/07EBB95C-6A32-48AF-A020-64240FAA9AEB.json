Using the new knowledge gathered, researchers from universities and community groups will together imagine how communities might be different. They will experiment with different forms of community building that ignite imagination about the future and help to build resilience and a momentum for change<br /><br />However, Imagine will do more than just connect research on communities. At the heart of the programme is a vision to connect communities with research. Engagement with communities at all stages of the research places collaborative and participatory research methods in a central role to widen the ways community partners and universities can work together. The consortium is aiming for the ‘democratisation of social research’. And with such a big team the members of the consortium are having to work out precisely what this might look like in practice. Just to add to the complexity, some projects will be contesting the very notion of community itself.<br />Website: <a href=\"http://www.imaginecommunity.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.imaginecommunity.org.uk/</a></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002686/1","grantId":"ES/K002686/1","fundValue":"1821370","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our work is still on-going but emerging findings have been used to inform work on co-production within the universities that the project team are working within.

At the moment our findings lie in the field of co-production and the need to work collaboratively with community partners to develop ways of working that are ethical and sustainable. Some of this work has been taken forward eg in a Case Study on Co-producing Ethics which has been produced for the ESRC website.
