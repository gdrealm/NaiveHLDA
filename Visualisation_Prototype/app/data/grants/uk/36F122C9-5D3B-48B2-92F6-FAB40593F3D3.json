Millions of workers are added to the global workforce and it is cheap labour, which makes the PRC so attractive for foreign direct investment (FDI). Unsurprisingly, it is workers who are most under pressure as a result. Chinese workers often work in conditions of super-exploitation, while workers elsewhere either become unemployed, because production is moved to the PRC, or they are pressured into accepting lower wages and worse working conditions through the threat of production transfer to China.</p>\n\n<p>This project aims at analysing the role of Chinese labour within these structural changes at the production, national and international level. It will be investigated to what extent trade unions and NGOs have been able to protect the interests of Chinese workers within China and through cooperation with international labour organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Methodologically, this project will draw on existing data such as FDI flows and GDP levels, semi-structured interviews with workers and managers, representatives of the official Chinese trade union, informal labour organisations, the Chinese government, the International Trade Union Confederation and the International Labour Organization. Official documents of these organisations will also be consulted.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I003436/1","grantId":"ES/I003436/1","fundValue":"274999","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andreas  Bieler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
