The programme of research includes: a review of how civic engagement has been conceptualised and measured in national and international surveys; a multi-level analysis of individual levels of civic engagement and the impact of contextual issues at the local and national level such as the socio-economic profile of an area, political culture and policy issues; finally detailed country case studies will be conducted in order to explore in detail the policy context and the institutional arrangements for civic engagement. </p> \n<p>The research will make a valuable contribution to the international evidence base and policy debates regarding civic engagement and democratic renewal and inform the development of effective civic engagement strategies.
