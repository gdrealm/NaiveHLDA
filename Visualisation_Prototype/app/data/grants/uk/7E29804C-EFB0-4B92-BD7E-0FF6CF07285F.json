{"id":"7E29804C-EFB0-4B92-BD7E-0FF6CF07285F","title":"Language and Mental Health","abstractText":"The relationship between language and thought has preoccupied philosophers since antiquity. Modern philosophising on the subject begins with Descartes and the rationalists. They regarded thought as universal, immutable, and rational, whereas language was merely expressive of it. Language was seen as an overt manifestation of thought, and could vary even when thought itself is not. Modern generative linguistics, by and large, adopts this point of view as well, regarding language as a cognitive 'module' that is relatively independent of thought. Within these views, language is not regarded as an organising principle for thought. Thought is taken to be organised by its own principles. In line with this common conceptualisation, language is not regarded as relevant for what it is to be rational, or for mental health. Language could fall away, and rationality and selfhood could be maintained. An alternative and older tradition in linguistics, however, opposes the separation of language and thought. Identifying a mode of thought that is only found in humans, this tradition maintains that language does not just express thoughts, but generates them. Without the generative mechanisms of language, and of grammar in particular, this particular mode of thought wouldn't exist. We call this an 'Un-Cartesian' view of grammar. The present project starts from a prediction that the Un-Cartesian view makes: where thought gets disorganised, grammar should get disorganised alongside, and vice versa. The Un-Cartesian view regards a particular set of grammatical principles as crucial to the organisation of meaning in language. Therefore, it makes specific prediction for which aspects of thought should break down when the grammatical principles in question do. We will explore these predictions through investigations of language in schizophrenia. Formal Thought Disorder (FTD) is one clinical symptom of schizophrenia, and which is diagnosed on the basis of abnormalities in language. In particular, we will examine if grammar as opposed to lexicon (vocabulary) is disrupted in people with FTD.\nApparent evidence against the Un-Cartesian view comes from acquired language disorders, for example conditions such as agrammatic aphasia following a stroke. In this case, language can fail to be understood and produced, yet the thoughts of the people concerned can seem normal. In the case of aphasia, there is initial evidence that the pattern of language breakdown is very different from language abnormalities found in schizophrenia. In this project, we will explore the behaviour of people with aphasia on the same tasks as those with schizophrenia in order to discover whether their grammatical profiles are distinct.\nThe present project assembles a multidisciplinary research team that crosses the boundaries of departments, faculties, and disciplines. We carry out theoretically guided research on language in the clinical context, and modify those theories in response to clinical evidence. We aim, in a first subproject, to extend our current research on the grammatical basis of reference in language (what speech is about). We then aim to sample spontaneous speech from people with schizophrenic thought disorder and to test whether these grammatical behaviours are specifically impaired. We also use a battery of newly designed language tests to profile language abnormalities in aphasia and schizophrenia. Finally, we will accompany our experimental work with a philosophical study assessing and rethinking the role of language for being a rational self. We hope that our project will contribute new tools for language assessment in clinical populations and generate fresh insights into both aphasia and schizophrenia, as well as shedding light on complex debates on the relationship between language and thought.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L004070/1","grantId":"AH/L004070/1","fundValue":"745932","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Wolfram  Hinzen","coPersons":["Stuart  Watson","Douglas  Turkington","Rosemary Ann  Varley","Nicol  Ferrier"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
