Pain pathways in young infants appear to be extra sensitive because they lack pain control systems, where the brain dampens pain signals as they enter the spinal cord. We aim to understand more about the way these controls develop in babies and how the connections in the brain that signal and control pain are affected by their time in hospital intensive care.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901269","grantId":"G0901269","fundValue":"1609400","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Fitzgerald","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
