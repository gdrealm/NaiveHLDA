In activities like gymnastics, with its emphasis on slimness and low bodyweight, vulnerability to these conditions is amplified.&nbsp;&nbsp; All eating disorders can have serious physical and psychological consequences. The implications of having an eating disorder for elite gymnasts relate to the freedom to choose lifestyles and the development of their identity, values and relationships. </p>\n\n<p>It is not known how much of a problem eating disorders are amongst elite gymnasts in the UK. Professor Michael McNamee and Dr Jacinta Tan will lead researchers from Swansea University in partnership with British Gymnastics, to continue to promote welfare of elite gymnasts by exploring these issues. They will combine social science methods with theory from the fields of psychiatry and philosophy to study eating disorders in elite gymnastics and make recommendations regarding policies to improve the welfare of elite gymnasts while trying to achieve their athletic potential.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H036563/1","grantId":"ES/H036563/1","fundValue":"80597","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  A lay report has been presented to research stakeholders, where discussions took place concerning the impact of this research on policy.

Tan, J.O.A., Bloodworth, A., McNamee, M.J. and Hewitt, J. (2012) 'Investigating eating disorders in elite gymnasts: conceptual, ethical and methodological issues' European Journal of Sport Science (see outcomes) details these ethical issues and suggests ways in which to address them.\n\n \n\no In terms of the findings of the research project. These are detailed in the lay report (for copy please email Dr Andrew Bloodworth, A.J.Bloodworth@swansea.ac.uk). In brief, selected findings are reported here. \n\no 1) Questionnaire findings suggested in the main a mentally healthy sample with high self-esteem and low levels of depression. Some preoccupation with food and eating was found however, with sizeable minorities reporting scores that suggest significant eating problems, high levels of restraint around food and high levels of concern around body shape and weight.\n\no 2) It was clear that judging in the disciplines of rhythmic and acrobatic gymnastics had a significant aesthetic component, gymnasts perceived that they would suffer points deductions purely on the basis of &quot;non-ideal&quot; body shape. Many of the gymnasts interviewed had responsibilities toward others in their team - and this at times appeared to reinforce a further pressure in terms of staying very lean. Gymnasts and coaches in this study appeared to endorse a more healthy body ideal - though they cited unhealthy practices and norms that existed elsewhere beyond the sample in the UK and abroad. \n\no 3) Many of the older gymnasts we interviewed had voluntarily adopted an informal mentoring role of younger gymnasts as part of the socialization process. Conscious of the manner in which body image concerns might be 'passed on' to younger gymnasts, older gymnasts were keen not to transfer their own potentially pathological concerns. Overall older gymnasts with a stronger sense of self offered more reflective accounts of eating-related constraints and self-disciplining practices, and were better positioned to question norms or practices when they thought this appropriate. Nevertheless, it was clear in the study that in the environments that comprised the sample, body image, weight and shape were the topics of many discussions, and preoccupation with these matters was commonplace, normalised, and indeed viewed as functional or essential. \n\no 4) It was reported on several occasions that gymnastics as a sport appears to privilege those who do not experience maturation until later in their career. Athletes and staff thought that while intense training might delay maturation, there would be no long-terms effects. There is evidence to support the notion that elite gymnastics training does not inhibit growth and maturation, but this has also been challenged. Apart from these issues surrounding eventual height - it was argued that education programmes ought to better inform coaches of the main challenges and dangers of working intensely with physically developing elite gymnasts.\n\no 5) Gymnasts were weighed and target weights were set with competitions in mind, although more frequent daily weighing appears to have been athlete rather than coach-lead. An unhealthy focus on body weight on the part of gymnasts, or teams of gymnasts, had been reported and coaches sought to guard against this development. Coaches and family members were also cited as important influences in protecting against potential risk factors for the development of an eating disorder, or serious eating concerns, such as the case of athletes sustaining a long term injury that took them away from the sport and may leave them isolated or experiencing difficulties with weight maintenance while inactive. \n\no These findings are all of scientific significance in that they report upon a population rarely accessed. Thus the understanding of eating attitudes and habits in this population is advanced by this study. It is important to note that the the data paint an ambiguous picture of a group of athletes mainly higher in self esteem (low self-esteem often being associated with eating disorders), with low levels of depressive symptoms (those with eating disorders often report depressed mood as well), yet one whose preoccupation with weight and shape is potentially powerful. Both qualitative and quantitative data support this ambiguous perception, though it is unclear to what extent the demands of elite gymnastics, both in terms of judges, and the technical aspects of the sport, render the preoccupation normalised or pathological. Thus how these pressures precisely relate to eating disordered behaviours and the development of full-fledged eating disorderss are unclear. Athletes might adopt self and other-driven disciplinary strategies regarding eating that outside of a sport context seem disordered over the short term, but be able to discard them in out-of-competition phases or on retirement. The point at which such behaviours become entrenched, or when such behaviour becomes less easy to control and increasingly destructive - pathological, in short - is very difficult to discern in a sample such as this. These difficulties in ascertaining what constitutes an eating disorder in such populations are relevant to subsequent research of this nature. The research is directly concerned with the development of policy regarding eating disorders in elite sports contexts and beyond. These include the development of educational materials for coaches and athletes, and for proposals as to how older athletes might mentor young athletes with regard to diet and lifestyle.
