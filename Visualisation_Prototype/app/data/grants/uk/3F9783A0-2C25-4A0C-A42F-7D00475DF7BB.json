The World's oceans slow the rate of climate change by absorbing a large proportion of CO2 emission due to human activity. The Southern Ocean is cold and windy, which favours the exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere. As a result, half of the carbon sequestrated in the world's oceans has been transferred through the Southern Ocean surface, providing therefore a significant buffer for climate change. \n\nIt is proposed to study the dynamics of the connection between the ocean surface and the deep ocean interior. Are water-masses and carbon slowly and uniformly diffused toward the deep sea or conversely are there narrow and intense carbon motorways plunging in the deep sea. Sparse ocean observations tend to show the latter, but the dynamics and the localisation of these pathways have never been studied. This is at odds with the evidence that these exports have a strong and direct impact on climate. The goal of this project is to gather a variety of recently developed very powerful and complementary tools to apply to the specific question of the dynamics of the Southern Ocean carbon sequestration. Specifically, we will investigate where the currents exporting water-masses and carbon in the deep ocean layers form and what is their rate of export. But more importantly, using a variety of computer model simulations we will investigate what are the processes that control the localisation and rates of export. This is a major question if we are to predict whether Southern Ocean carbon sequestration is likely to change in the future, with dramatic impact on climate.\n\nThis project at the cross-road of physics and biogeochemistry will extract the best of each, will contribute to new insight into the dynamics of the Southern Ocean circulation and will have implications for climate feedbacks that will lead to major advances in our understanding of climate and in our ability to predict future change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J008494/1","grantId":"NE/J008494/1","fundValue":"333368","fundStart":"2012-11-30","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This research is still in its infancy, but Dr. Dan Jones has made a concious effort to raise public conciousness of climate change and more specifically the Southern Ocean's role as a mediator and driver of global heat and carbon trends into the 21st century. This has been through a number of public/lay audience talks, delivered to various groups within Cambridge. \n\nIn addition he has engaged with the Met Office on climate model development, and is showing how pathways of heat and carbon from the atmosphere into the deep ocean interior are sensitive to the parameters and setup of various climate models. It is envisaged that this work will continue into the future and as the research develops and solidifies will feed into improvements of the global coupled climate models run by the met office, and ultimately contribute to reducing the uncertainty in future climate prediction. \n\nIn addition, this work has been central to developing the use of adjoint models within the UK earth sciences community. Dan Jones initiated, organised and led a workshop on the use of adjoint models for earth system sciences. This drew together many modellers from across the UK, as well as bringing in expertise from overseas. The result of this workshop has been a concerted effort by the participants to improve the supercomputing facilities within the UK to facilitate the running of adjoint models. This new technique has the potential to significantly improve our ability to attribute changes in earth systems to forcings, and thus understand the working of our planet.

Primarily we have discovered that the heavily used and much published SOSE model framework is inherently unstable over long periods. While it has been heavily used to simulate the Southern Ocean for periods of 6 or less years, we have found that running this model out for 20+ years reveals significant instabilities, notably in the subpolar gyres. These tend to develop unphysical convection, leading to the model collapsing after around 10 years. Dr. Jones has made significant advances in discovering why this instability exists, as well as fixing it. It seems that freshwater fluxes from glacial run off and iceberg calving are significantly too low, and he is presently working on creating a dataset to correct this. \n\nHe has also demonstrated that the object of the project, looking at current pathways from the southern ocean into the subtropics, occurs at a few specific locations. These appear to be in the south-east corners of the relevant gyres in the Atlantic/Indian and South Pacific. The timeframe of this transport appears to be on the order of decades, so he is presently addressing the model stability problems, before moving on to tackle the export pathways. \n\nThis represents quite good progress for the first year of a highly technical project. This work on correcting the gyre spin up, will feed directly into improving the SOSE maintained by Matt Mazloff of the Scripps institute of oceanography. This is a very widely used product, so the improvements Dan is adding will be widely felt. The ultimate outcome of the project, looking at export pathways and their sensitivity to surface forcing, will be an important addition to climate models, notably those run by the UK Met Office, who will be able to compare their export strengths with those rigourously described and tested within EXPOSE.
