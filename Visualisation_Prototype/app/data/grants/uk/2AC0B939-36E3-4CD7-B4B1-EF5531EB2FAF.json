{"id":"2AC0B939-36E3-4CD7-B4B1-EF5531EB2FAF","title":"LHCb Upgrade Bridging Funds Jan-Sept 2014","abstractText":"LHCb is a particle physics experiment operating at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It is the world's leading physics experiment in its field and has a unique capability to explore physics beyond the Standard Model. LHCb's main aim is to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model through precision tests of matter anti-matter asymmetries (CP violation) and rare decays of particles containing beauty and charm quarks. The experiment also has world-class programmes in other areas due to its unique design and coverage of an angular region closer to the beams that at the other main LHC experiments.\n \nThe opportunity now exists to dramatically increase the reach of LHCb's programme and to widen its physics profile. The UK groups propose to lead the upgrade of the VELO (Vertex Locator), the most precise vertex detector at the LHC, and LHCb's unique RICH (Ring Imaging Cherenkov) particle identification (PID) system. A programme of physics performance studies, computing, reconstruction software and trigger algorithm development, and involvement in a new scintillating fibre tracker complements this work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M001539/1","grantId":"ST/M001539/1","fundValue":"3815","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel Keith Watson","coPersons":["Antonino  Sergi","Cristina  Lazzeroni"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
