Over the past several years, about a million and a half East Europeans have come to the UK. In many respects, these migrants look like past migrants to the UK: they left poorer parts of the world in search of work and the better life in the UK. But in other respects, they look different from many of those who arrived before them: they're white. The link between racism and migration is well-documented. But what happens when migrant and host are supposedly the same 'race'? Our examination of Hungarians (representing the first and larger 2004 group of migrants) and Romanians (representing the second and smaller 2007 group of migrants) revealed that these migrants have not been spared the effects of racism. We found evidence of a legacy of institutionalised racism in an immigration policy that continues to favour European workers over non-European workers and examples of cultural racism in the tabloid media that vilify migrant workers from East Europe as morally suspect, culturally backward, and collectively responsible for a host of societal ills. But East European migrant workers are not just the targets of racism; they are also its perpetrators. We also found evidence of Hungarians and Romanians wielding racial stereotypes to describe others and defend their precarious position in the UK labour market. In these various ways racism has been reinvented in the context of these recent migrations to the UK. The main way in this research can be used in non-academic contexts is to help integrate East Europeans who have settled in the UK. One dimension of that integration is living with diversity. The current research shows that the diversity East Europeans encounter in the UK is not only unfamiliar to them but is also often received with fear, hostility, and racism. Diversity is not simply a condition; it is something that has to be learned. Efforts can thus be made to help East Europeans gain a Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
