{"id":"22CFDA8B-06E5-4E8F-BFF5-EA454D344690","title":"Squeezing light from optical resonators","abstractText":"Whispering gallery modes in optical resonators have recently gained immense practical importance, as a means of producing very small lasers and in other technological applications such as coupling optical fibres and as sensing devices. In the context of lasers, it is particularly important to understand the effects of deforming the shape of the resonator from perfectly cylindrical or spherical since the resultant asymmetric emission pattern is an important feature of that application. Surprisingly, emission patterns for small deformations are poorly understood, despite the fact that the corresponding ray dynamics are almost entirely regular and at first sight show little qualitative difference from the perfectly cylindrical and spherical cases. The essential reason for this is that understanding emission patterns demands that we complexify the whispering-gallery families of rays and this is a difficult problem for nonintegrable systems, so in addition to being of practical importance, the problem is also very interesting mathematically. The project proposes to overcome the inherent difficulties by using canonical perturbation theory to approximate the complexified ray families. The end product of the project should be a general and explicit recipe for calculating emission patterns of whispering-gallery type resonant modes, valid when the radial perturbation is of the order of a wavelength or smaller. Although accurate numerical solutions of such problems are possible, simple analytical predictions of the sort proposed here have been lacking and will be useful in the design and analysis of technological applications of optical resonators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F036574/1","grantId":"EP/F036574/1","fundValue":"126811","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A better understanding arose out of this project of the relationship between boundary integral methods for wave problems in cavities and ray dynamical propagation of wave energy and intensity between boundaries.

These methods have been benchmarked against 2D problems but the underlying theory can also be applied to 3D systems.\n\nAnalysis of Q factor degradation arising from geometry changes in dielectric resonators: the general theory describing emission from optical resonators can also be exploited to calculate degradations in quality factor that arise due to deformations in geometry. Different approaches can be used to approximate very small or moderately small deformations and a single uniform approximation can also be given which incorporates both regimes.\n\nTheory of effect of ray resonances on emission characteristics of dielectric resonators: whispering gallery modes which correspond to resonant ray families behave differently to more generic modes and require special treatment. An analysis has been give of emission from such modes and features such as differences between internal and external characteristics have been described. Design and analysis of optical resonators used as sensors filters couplers or lasers. The results of this work include an ability to describe in relatively simple terms, without the need for extensive numerical work, the external fields of deformed optical resonators.\n\nThe deformation in question may be as a result of manufacturing tolerances but could also potentially be engineered deliberately to control coupling to other optical components in selected directions.
