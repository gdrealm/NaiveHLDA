{"id":"B47D86E2-FE75-43DE-862F-089D296DC8E1","title":"Refining models of fibrotic lung disease","abstractText":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease where the fine, delicate structure of the lungs is replaced by a hard, concrete-like substance called fibrous matrix. This prevents the normal functions of the lung, such as the transfer of oxygen from the air to the body, as well as an irritating persistent cough. At the current time there are no treatments that can improve the outlook for people with IPF. There are, however, many potential new therapies that might have a beneficial effect on this terrible disease. Predicting which potential therapy might work requires careful testing, because it is not possible to test all the alternatives in people with disease. The aim of this study is to develop a way to predict which new therapies might work in people with IPF. This information will ensure the most promising therapies can be assessed in clinical trials for IPF, which will be crucial in the development of new treatments so urgently needed for this condition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100564/1","grantId":"G1100564/1","fundValue":"443881","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Gisli  Jenkins","coPersons":["Thomas  Meersmann","Robin John McAnulty","Ian  Hall","Simon Richard Johnson"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
