To achieve this, one of its strategic goals is a new way forward for science. Through its Science Strategy, the University of Exeter is adopting an interdisciplinary approach by breaking down barriers between academic schools and bringing staff together to tackle some of the big issues of our time. The present proposal will contribute to the achievement of this strategic science goal by boosting the small equipment research base used by early carrier researchers working across the following areas:\nGraphene Science and Engineering\nResearch in Functional Materials \nQuantum Systems and Nanomaterials \nCritical and Green Technology of Metals \nThe Centre for Systems, Dynamics and Control \nThe Centre for Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics\nDetecting, Preventing and Mitigating Emerging Diseases\nNano-Bio Science","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031538/1","grantId":"EP/K031538/1","fundValue":"409769","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Saverio  Russo","coPersons":["Monica Felicia Craciun"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
