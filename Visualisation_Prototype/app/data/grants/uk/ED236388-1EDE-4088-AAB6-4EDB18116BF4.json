Information is transmitted to receiving cells via protoplasmic protrusions called nerve fibers or axons. Axons are remarkable, long cellular projections, which in different species can extend from a few micrometers, to ~1 meter in the human sciatic nerve, and presumably over 30 meters in blue whales. All animals face the same formidable task of maintaining the structural integrity of axonal projection throughout the entire life span of the organism. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying this process represents a challenging but fascinating scientific endeavor, with deep implications in the treatment of human neurological disorders. Indeed, axonal loss is one of the primary causes of disability in a rage of pathological conditions including traumatic injuries to brain (TBI) spinal cord (SCI) and peripheral nervous system, inflammatory neuropathies, inflammatory demyelinating conditions (such as multiple sclerosis), and certain neurodegenerative disorders. A notable feature of many human diseases is a pronounced alteration in the levels of numerous proteins. However, the upstream regulatory mechanisms controlling the aberrant production of these proteins remain unclear. For many years, it was thought that RNAs only function as structural scaffolds and messengers transferring genetic information from DNA to proteins. This view was drastically changed over a decade ago, following the seminal discovery of a class of regulatory RNAs called microRNAs. microRNAs are fascinating non-coding RNA molecules which are never translated into a polypeptide chain (protein), and are comprised of only 21 to 23 letters of the genetic alphabet. Strikingly, these tiny pieces of RNA appear to function as molecular rheostats of gene expression programs (protein production) in almost every living organism. Surprisingly, microRNAs have been shown to be dysregulated in many neurological disorders as well as traumatic axonal injuries. Still, it remains unclear whether microRNAs are central to the molecular mechanism controlling axonal structural integrity in intact and injury challenged neurons. Here, we propose to use the genetically tractable model organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) to shed light on the role of microRNAs in this process. The extensive conservation of molecular and cellular mechanisms governing nervous system development and function makes Drosophila an ideal experimental platform for attaining this goal. For these studies we will employ a multi-pronged strategy combining highly versatile transgenic technologies for microRNA loss and gain of function, state of the art transcriptional profiling, high-throughput microRNA target identification, and cutting-edge genome editing technologies for elucidating gene regulatory networks controlled by candidate microRNAs. While preventing clearance of severed axons in traumatic nerve injury appears to be detrimental for functional recovery, the knowledge acquired in this study may engender new targets for developing therapeutic strategies for other neuropathological conditions where axons are not severed but at risk of undergoing degeneration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L010275/1","grantId":"BB/L010275/1","fundValue":"482987","fundStart":"2014-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tudor Alexandru Fulga","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" Not applicable.
