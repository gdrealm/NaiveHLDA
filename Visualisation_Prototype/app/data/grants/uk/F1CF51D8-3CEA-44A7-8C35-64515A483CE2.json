Mutations in these cells results in the accumulation of immature cells called myeloblasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of patients to the exclusion of healthy cells. This compromises the body s own defences to fight infection. Despite improvements in chemotherapy two thirds of patients with AML will die from their disease. Our group has set out to identify and characterise the mutations that give rise to AML as a means of directly targeting these rogue stem cells. Our recent studies of the Wilms tumour 1 (WT1) gene mutations identified a particularly poorly performing patient group. Curiously and in contrast to Wilms tumour, a paediatric kidney cancer, from which the gene takes its name, its role in leukaemia is only speculative. We now want to decipher how mutant WT1 contributes to the onset of AML, its interaction with other mutational events and the mechanisms by which it confers poor outcome and drug resistance on the leukaemic cells. We have brought together experts in the fields clinical and basic research haematology and leaders in the field of Wilms tumour research to address these questions and to open the door to the better clinical management of this disease in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700052","grantId":"G0700052","fundValue":"373289","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jude  Fitzgibbon","coPersons":["Dominique  Bonnet"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
