Such 'editing' by ADARs results in adenosine, one of the building blocks that make up RNA, being converted to inosine (I). When such changes are made at many positions ('hyper-editing') within a double-stranded RNA molecule (dsRNA), there are various functional consequences. Our research is focused on understanding one important role of hyper-edited inosine-containing dsRNA (IU-dsRNA) in mammalian cells.\n\nAnalysis of mice in which ADAR genes have been deleted highlights the importance of RNA editing in mammalian cells. Deletion of one family member, ADAR1, results in embryonic lethality. Moreover, death of ADAR1 mutants results from inappropriate production of interferon, a molecule produced during immune responses, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Our previous data provides an explanation for this observation. We have shown that IU-dsRNA, the product of editing by ADARs, directly inhibits interferon production and apoptosis. Conversely, in the absence of ADAR1, the interferon response is upregulated, presumably due to the lack of IU-dsRNA. Our current research proposal aims to determine precisely how IU-dsRNA inhibits the pathway leading to interferon production and apoptosis. \n\nWhen mammalian cells are treated with poly(IC), a long dsRNA that mimics viral infection, signaling pathways are triggered that result in production of interferon and apoptosis. We have previously demonstrated that IU-dsRNA interferes with the recognition of poly(IC) by two dsRNA sensors, RIG-I and MDA5. By interfering with poly(IC) recognition, RIG-I and MDA5 are not activated, the pathway that results in interferon production remains switched off, and interferon levels remain low. We now plan to carry out experiments that aim to understand the interaction that occurs between IU-dsRNA and RIG-I or MDA5. This will lead to a better understanding of how IU-dsRNA functions in this pathway, and how it is regulated. We additionally plan to directly test the effect of IU-dsRNA on viral infection. In particular, we will test whether the presence of IU-dsRNA in mammalian cells affects infection by influenza A virus. Use of influenza A constitutes an ideal model system as it triggers interferon production by activating RIG-I. In addition, influenza virus A RNA undergoes hyper-editing by ADAR1. We will thus apply our previous findings to examine the effects of editing and IU-dsRNA in a broader biological context. Our experiments so far have made use of short synthetic IU-dsRNAs as a model system to mimic editing in cells. While these have been invaluable for illuminating the roles of ADARs in mammalian cells, we will now undertake experiments to identify cellular IU-dsRNAs that are similarly able to suppress interferon production. This will be an important undertaking in order to better understand how hyper-editing targets cellular RNAs in order to downregulate IFN.\n\nThe finding that ADAR1 is essential for suppressing interferon signaling suggests it may protect organisms from the deleterious effects of interferon activation associated with many pathological processes, including chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and cancer. By carrying out our proposed project to investigate how IU-dsRNA suppresses interferon and apoptosis, we will be closer to understanding the function of ADAR1 in mammalian cells that make it critical for survival.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J007935/1","grantId":"BB/J007935/1","fundValue":"376863","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Deirdre Scadden","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
