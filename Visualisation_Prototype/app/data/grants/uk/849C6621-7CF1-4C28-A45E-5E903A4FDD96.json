A number of mechanisms are being employed to reduce energy use. An important one is increased energy efficiency. However, there are questions about whether increased energy efficiency actually reduces energy use, due to the notion of ‘rebound effects’. Rebound effects occur when improvements in energy efficiency actually stimulate the direct and indirect demand for energy in production and/or consumption because of the impact of the increased efficiency on the effective, or implicit, price of energy. </p>\n\n<p>The objective of this project is to conduct empirical analyses of the extent and nature of economy-wide macroeconomic ‘rebound’ effects in the UK economy in response to microeconomic increases in energy efficiency. This will involve developing a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the UK economy. While the model is system-wide, the analysis will focus on key production sectors and consumption activities that are likely to be important in determining economy-wide rebound effects. It will also examine a wide range of policy scenarios, including detailed explorations of the impacts of costly energy efficiency changes and resistance to the adoption of new (energy-saving) technology.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F000030/1","grantId":"ES/F000030/1","fundValue":"193613","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Turner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
