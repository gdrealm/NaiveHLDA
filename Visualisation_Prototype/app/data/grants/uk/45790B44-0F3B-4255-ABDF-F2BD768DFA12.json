{"id":"45790B44-0F3B-4255-ABDF-F2BD768DFA12","title":"Design Meeting Protocols: Design Thinking Research Symposium 7","abstractText":"Understanding the intricacies of the design process, particularly in social contexts, is fundamental in solving ever more complex problems, not only in the traditional design domains of architecture and engineering, but also problems in of management, computing, urban planning, and even politics. \nDesign, as the recent Cox review of creativity in business underlined, is now fundamental to how organizations, communities, and governments can work together in solution-oriented discussions and debates. Yet although progress has been made in understanding how individual designers think, the question of how they, clients, and other stakeholders interact and work together during the design process has received less attention. \nThis project will bring together top international scholars in design cognition research, asking them to analyse the same real world dataset. The dataset will be a series of videotaped design meetings obtained from a range of design disciplines. By comparing and contrasting analyses and interpretations of the same dataset in a single forum this project provides an opportunity for the debate and synergy that can broaden and deepen our understanding of design in the real world. It is also an excellent chance to extend and enrich the network of design researchers. \nBy establishing a milestone in design cognition research, this project will not only become a reference point for future studies looking at the design process, but also provide valuable insight for the creative industries.\n\nCox, G.
