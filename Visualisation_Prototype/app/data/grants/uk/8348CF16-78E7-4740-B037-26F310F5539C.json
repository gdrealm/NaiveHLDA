Currently, this problem is addressed by either expensive mechanical cleaning of structures or by the use of chemical antifoulants. As of 2008, the use of several of these chemical agents will be prohibited due to their potent environmental effects. This project aims to develop environmentally safe agents to reduce biofouling by assessing a number of plant-derived terpenes for their effect on the settlement of key biofouling organisms, namely barnacles and tunicates. It will also develop suitable paints for the delivery of their compounds on man-made structures placed in the marine environment. Finally, it will seek appropriate avenues for full commercial exploitation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E522340/1","grantId":"NE/E522340/1","fundValue":"85461","fundStart":"2006-10-16","fundEnd":"2007-10-15","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Rowley","coPersons":["Anthony  Clare","Ifor  Bowen"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
