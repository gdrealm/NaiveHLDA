{"id":"3CACE7A4-1037-4CAF-BD13-94BE8D63B9E0","title":"Strengthen Resilience in Volcanic Areas (STREVA)","abstractText":"STREVA will bring together researchers from universities, research institutes and volcano observatories, to explore\nmethods for reducing the negative consequences of volcanic activity on communities. We will work both with the\ncommunities facing volcanic threats, and with those responsible for monitoring, preparing for and responding to those\nthreats. Our main partners are volcano monitoring agencies and observatories in Colombia, the Caribbean and Ecuador,\nand through them, disaster managers and disaster researchers throughout the region, as well as residents of communities\nat risk. We will use a number of techniques to build links between the project and the wider community, including\nworkshops, running scenario exercises, and using social media to report our results. Our aim, by working collaboratively\nacross different disciplines, is to develop and apply a risk assessment framework that will help communities to develop\nbetter plans for living in volcanic areas that reduce the negative consequences of volcanic activity.\nVolcanic risk is a complex problem, which we shall understand by investigating a number of volcanoes across the region.\nThese case studies will help us to identify common issues in volcanic disaster risk and ultimately develop regional hazard\nassessment processes. These will be crucial for long-term planning to reduce the exposure of people and communities to\nvolcanic hazards. The countries in which we will work are all middle income and face multiple volcanic threats, often in\nclose proximity to large towns and cities. The main focus will be on seven volcanic sites across the Lesser Antilles,\nEcuador and Colombia.\n\nWe will begin the project by reviewing the secondary literature on three well monitored and active volcanoes, to understand\nwhat has already been done to understand and reduce risk to the surrounding population. We will then take these lessons\nand apply them to three high-risk volcanoes where monitoring and understanding is less advanced. Through in-depth\nempirical research in these volcanic areas we shall begin to develop, test and apply our new risk assessment framework\nand methods for application..\n\nSTREVA's work will generate improvements in:\n(i) methods for forecasting the start of eruptions and changes in activity during eruption;\n(ii) prediction of areas at-risk (the &quot;footprint&quot;) from different volcanic hazards;\n(iii) understanding of the factors that make people and their assets more vulnerable to volcanic threats;\n(iv) understanding of institutional constraints and capacities and how to improve incentives for risk reduction\n\nBy the end of the project, our new knowledge will help us to measure volcanic risk more accurately, and monitor how that\nrisk is changing. The practical results will be a strengthening in the capacity of stakeholders at different scales (staff in\nvolcano observatories, local and national governments and NGOs) to produce risk assessments for high-risk volcanoes\nand use them to improve preparedness and response to volcanic emergencies and build resilience in the surrounding\ncommunities through long-term planning. In adopting this approach, STREVA will have real impacts in real places, and will\nsignificantly advance the fields of volcanic risk analysis and disaster risk reduction.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J02483X/1","grantId":"NE/J02483X/1","fundValue":"234936","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Modelling of volcano deformation is necessary to assess volcanic activity.
