{"id":"D1D5ECC5-84F8-42A9-A401-D40D3DDE41E3","title":"Strategic package (for Professor Sir Andrew Wiles FRS)","abstractText":"Professor Sir Andrew Wiles FRS, who famously proved Fermat's Last Theorem, is probably the most celebrated mathematician in the world. He is currently engaged in research on the Birch Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and special values of L-functions, a field in which there is much active research, both in the UK and world-wide. Needless to say, any real progress on the Birch Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture would be a spectacular achievement. Wiles already has an important early result, with Coates, in this area. The conjecture is wide open for elliptic curves of rank two or more, and Wiles, together with two postdoctoral researchers, plans to explore this problem in great detail.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J009458/1","grantId":"EP/J009458/1","fundValue":"437904","fundStart":"2012-02-29","fundEnd":"2016-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sam  Howison","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
