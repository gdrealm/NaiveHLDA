{"id":"350CB42B-259C-4BC9-939D-CF50149CF39C","title":"Attributing and predicting changes in the probability of climate extremes","abstractText":"We plan to address the following research questions:\n- in which regions are the frequency and intensity of heat waves and cold spells increasing? \n- Are climate models able to reproduce these changes?\n- Can we improve their prediction if using initialized climate forecasts?\n\nThis work extends in scope and regions studied two existing projects: The first one is the EQUIP project, which predicts changes in European and UK heatwaves and drought. We propose to extend this work by also studying North America and East Asia. These regions show tentative evidence that mean temperature is better predictable by initialized than forced runs over the near-term (about 5 years; e.g., D. Matei; J. Marotzke, pers. Com.). These regions also show interesting and challenging changes in observed patterns of frequency and intensity of temperature extremes . The second project we plan to build on is a project that works towards attributing changes in worldwide frequency of hot and cold extremes, and this proposal extends her work from use of a single model (HadGEM1) to use of the CMIP5 archive. This will much increase the impact of her results, and provide highly relevant information to the authors of IPCC chapters 10 and 11 (see pathways to impact).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J005363/1","grantId":"NE/J005363/1","fundValue":"90951","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Results from this publication have been cited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th's Assessment report in the Detection and Attribution chapter (ch10; WGI report) and in ch11.

These changes lead to predictive skill for the future. However, using data from multiple models shows that the skill varies by model. In all models and most regions, there is skill on the 5-10yr timescale originating from external forcing, leading to a general tendency for hot extremes to become more likely. Including that in models improves their skill in forecasts. In contrast, the additional skill gained by initializing the model with observed surface conditions varies from model to model and is often small or insignificant relative to that gained from accounting for forcing such as increasing greenhouse gases. The results also show that recent observed changes in the frequency / intensity of hot extremes have been caused by external forcing, dominated by anthropogenic forcing. Publication in review; results show that prediction of heat waves nearterm (5-10yrs) benefit from accounting for human influences particularly greenhouse gas forcing Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
