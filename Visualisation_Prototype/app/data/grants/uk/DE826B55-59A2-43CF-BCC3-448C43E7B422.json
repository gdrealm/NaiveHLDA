Until recently the lack of tools for analysing spatio-temporal systems has not been a limitation since most experiments produced purely temporal information in the form of measurements at a specific location or site. But there are many important systems where space and time are essential for explaining the observed phenomena. The main objective of this research study will be to investigate the identification of models of spatio-temporal systems where the cell entries can be either continuous or binary variables and to study the validation and other properties of this important class of nonlinear systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D032741/1","grantId":"EP/D032741/1","fundValue":"295373","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Billings","coPersons":["Daniel  Coca"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
