In insects, this seasonal cycle is called diapause, and is stimulated by the reduction in daylength as winter approaches. The other great rhythm on this planet is the circadian cycle which is the daily 24 hour cycle that we all recognise as our 'body clock'. Recently we have found a connection between a gene called timeless that controls the 24 hour rhythm of the geneticists favourite pet, the fruitfly, and the seasonal diapause cycle. A new mutation in the timeless gene, ls-tim, occurred in south-eastern Italy about 8000 years ago, a few thousand years after the last glaciation when flies invaded Europe from Africa This mutation allows the fly to make two types of TIM protein, L-TIM and S-TIM, whereas the ancient gene, s-tim can only make S-TIM. The new mutation, ls-tim, is spreading under natural selection, because it adapts the fly to the seasonal environment of Europe. It does this by reducing the light sensitivity of the ls-tim fly's diapause mechanism. Thus, even in relatively long days, ls-tim flies 'see' shorter days, and this stimulates them diapause earlier than in s-tim flies. The earlier the fly goes into diapause in Europe, the better its chances of surviving the oncoming winter. In addition, the 24 hour circadian clock of ls-tim is also less light-sensitive and this too is adaptive in Europe, which has very exotic photoperiods in summer which causes the fly's biorhythms to creak. Consequently, L-TIM attenuates the fly's photosensitivity for both circadian and seasonal behaviours, and that is perhaps why this new mutation has spread in Europe. Biochemically, the L-TIM protein is less light sensitive because of its weak physical interaction with a circadian photoreceptor called Cryptochrome. The ls-tim mutation creates a site in the L-TIM protein that is not shared in S-TIM. This new site may be phosphorylated, a protein modification that may alter the shape and stability of L-TIM. This may provide the biochemical clue for why ls-tim flies behave differently. We shall study this site to see whether it is indeed phosphorylated. We shall also investigate whether ls-tim flies change the ratios of the L-TIM and S-TIM they produce under the short days and cold temperature that produce diapause. In addition we will study under these conditions how strongly L-TIM and S-TIM 'touch' the photoreceptor Cryptochrome in the fly's brain and eyes, as this physical interaction provides the light input into the circadian mechanism. There has been a long running debate about whether the circadian clock contributes to diapause. Using the timeless gene, we shall genetically dissect the fly's nervous system in order to investigate which groups of neurons are important for diapause. Because the 24 hour clock neurons are well known and easily identified, we should be able to see whether these cells are relevant for the fly's hibernation. We can then visualise L-TIM and S-TIM protein in the relevant cells of ls-tim flies under diapause conditions, to see whether the two proteins behave differently. Insect diapause is a potential target for the control of medical and agricultural pests in temperate regions, and so our work may have practical spin-offs in future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F014082/1","grantId":"BB/F014082/1","fundValue":"491429","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Charalambos  Kyriacou","coPersons":["Eran  Tauber","Ezio  Rosato"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":" We have mutagenised the N-terminal of the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM) to investigate which properties confer the reduced circadian and photoperiodic light responses of the ls-tim variant. We observe that it is the length of the N-terminal region rather than the specific sequence which is important. As this N-terminal fragment mediates the interaction with the photoreceptor CRY, this suggests that the TIM N-terminal is involved in a steric hindrance effect which prevents the normal light responses. We observed that very little PER or TIM could be detected at diapausing temperatures, suggesting that the circadian clock is arrested during diapause. Thus the diapausing effects of the N-terminal of TIM are likely to be developmental in origin. \n\n\n\nAn extensive neurogenetic analysis of diapause using clock mutants revealed that all clock mutants affected diapause hence there is clearly a modular association between the circadian clock and diapause. We also discovered that a clock in the eye of the fly is responsible for these effects, because stopping the eye clock prevents diapause\n\n\n\nBecause of the very low TIM levels at low temperatures we were unable to perform some of the biochemical experiments we had planned, so we embarked on a series of studies that focused on some of the many contradictions that exist about diapause in the literature. We were able to solve many of these problems and also clarify the role of some other non-clock genes that contribute to diapause. Finally, and in contradiction to the literature, we observed that diapause in Drosophila melanogaster is an ancient adaptation, not the recently evolved one others have claimed. Thus we have made a significant contribution to understanding the biology of diapause. Diapause is a very topical subject because it is potentially a target that can be used against temperate insects of agricultural and medical importance. It is also a biomarker for climate change. We will exploit our findings with high impact papers (several in prep) and further grant applications. Agriculture/ Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
