{"id":"CD719FAC-F1AD-440C-9443-8007AB159C64","title":"Mean field modelling of human EEG: Application to Epilepsy Seizure Prediction","abstractText":"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders to afflict human beings. Almost every member of the public knows, either directly or indirectly, someone who has epilepsy of some description. The aim of the proposed research is to use mathematical modelling and analysis to develop an algorithm which is capable of predicting the onset of epileptic activity via analysis of electrical signals recorded from the brain of the patient. The project will consist of developing a mathematical model that is capable of reproducing the types of dynamics observed in clinical data and using these models, the project team will develop an understanding of how healthy states become seizure states and use this knowledge to develop algorithms that can extract this information from clinical data sets recorded at the Centre for Epilepsy at King's College Hospital in Denmark Hill, London. The project is an exciting collaboration between mathematicians and clinicians which will lead to a better understanding and possible treatment of a debilitating medical condition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D068436/1","grantId":"EP/D068436/1","fundValue":"222452","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Robert Terry","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
