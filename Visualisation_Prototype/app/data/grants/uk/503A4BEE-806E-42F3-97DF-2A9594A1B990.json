It is especially required at the postnatal stage of development, but has continued effects on metabolism and adiposity throughout adulthood. Mice that lack Gnasxl are very lean and use up their energy resources quickly.\nGenetic abnormalities of the corresponding human gene cause similar disease symptoms, although these occur rarely and not all parallels have been fully investigated yet. \nThe Gnasxl gene is not active in all tissues, but functions only in a few areas of the brain and in some peripheral tissues that have a role in balancing energy resources (e.g. adipose tissue, pancreas. With this project we want to find out, which tissues are the most important sites of Gnasxl function. We will approach this question by generating mice that lack Gnasxl in specific tissues only, for example in brain or in adipose tissue, and analyse the physiological effects of these disturbances. \nResults from our experiments should clarify, in which regulatory pathways Gnasxl acts and improve our understanding of control mechanisms for energy balance and obesity in mouse and human.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601256","grantId":"G0601256","fundValue":"363241","fundStart":"2007-11-29","fundEnd":"2010-11-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Antonius  Plagge","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
