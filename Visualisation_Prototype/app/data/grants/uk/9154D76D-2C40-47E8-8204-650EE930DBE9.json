{"id":"9154D76D-2C40-47E8-8204-650EE930DBE9","title":"A toolkit for tyrosine kinase signalling network analysis.","abstractText":"Tyrosine kinases (TKs) control multiple essential physiological processes including multi-cellular development and metabolic homeostasis. Deregulation of TKs and their associated downstream signalling cascades are key drivers in debilitating diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Consequently, the ability to accurately profile TK signalling events at a systems level is of considerable interest. Here we seek to develop a prototype Toolkit which measures TK signalling networks into a contract-based service and explore the further development of the technology as &quot;kit&quot;-based profiling products for non-specialist users. We envisage that this commercial service will be of interest to a broad range of investigators who wish to profile cellular signalling in multiple biological contexts. Furthermore, the development of a kit-based product will enable non-specialist investigators to perform such experiments using standard equipment found within proteomic core facilities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M013782/1","grantId":"BB/M013782/1","fundValue":"144051","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Huang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
