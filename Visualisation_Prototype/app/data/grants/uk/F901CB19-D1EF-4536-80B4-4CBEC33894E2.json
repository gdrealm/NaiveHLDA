{"id":"F901CB19-D1EF-4536-80B4-4CBEC33894E2","title":"Cultural leadership and the place of the artist","abstractText":"Context \nThis project aims to inform conceptual understanding of cultural leadership amongst artists and policy makers and to influence the long term direction of leadership development training in the sector. The proposal aims to develop awareness, use and impact of two related research projects: the Artist as Leader (AHRC funded 2006-8, PI Douglas, RA Fremantle) and Discourses of Cultural Leadership (IDEAS/RGU funded doctoral research, 2012-15, Price).\n\nThe Artist as Leader studied the processes through which artists shape their art forms, their sector's organisations and the wider public sphere. It involved contributions from artists and policy makers including senior leaders from Creative Scotland, Arts Council England, Southbank Centre, Jerwood Foundation, Scottish Government and British Council. The research was acknowledged by the national Clore Leadership Programme as influential in establishing dedicated Artist Fellowships among its opportunities. Ongoing relevance is demonstrated by continuing investment in cultural leadership by public and voluntary organisations in the UK and internationally.\n\nHowever, the high level of demand for non-academic professional engagement with the research was not originally foreseen. Moreover, cultural sector circumstances changed rapidly in the aftermath of the Artist as Leader report's publication, with the implications of the global economic crisis creating political and financial upheaval. The economic growth and cultural sector investment which had framed initial work was replaced with a climate of cuts, resilience and survival.\n\nThe need to follow-up Artist as Leader was recognised by RGU in 2012 with investment in doctoral research responding to these altered contexts. This built on the Artist as Leader's framework for analysis, focusing on the now established term 'cultural leadership' (including libraries/heritage practice) and exploring relationships between this and the 'artist as leader' concept.\n\nAims and objectives\nWhile the research has been updated, the professional network currently lacks opportunities to work through its implications for policy and practice. There is a need to develop pathways for engagement and to maximise the impact of both research projects. This demand is compounded by challenges currently facing the cultural sector in terms of relationships to public funding, pressures to develop new organisational models, and adjustments to roles and relationships necessitated by change.\n\nThe project aims to meet both this demand and an additional need identified through Discourses of Cultural Leadership in learning from different national contexts, building cross-cultural expertise. The project creates a partnership actively responding to the core research issues, discussing and disseminating its findings and establishing practical applications of its analytical methodology.\n\nPartnership, activities and outcomes\nThe project will operate over 12 months from October 2015. Non-academic partners are the Clore Leadership Programme, Creative Scotland, the European Network of Cultural Administration Training Centres (ENCATC); additional interest is confirmed from BOZAR (Brussels) as a collaborating venue. These organisations and their networks will be engaged through a series of 3 one-day knowledge exchange events in London, Edinburgh and Brussels (25 participants at each) which will inform the development of sector-specific communications representing the research to wider networks of artists and organisational leaders. Responses to these initiatives, together with event discussions and ongoing feedback from our partners, will inform the direction of future research. A new web site will be developed to present the research, events and discussions. The event structure is based on previous labs held within the Artist as Leader work, including an Artist in Residence tasked with ensuring creative responses to the process and generating critical reflection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N00342X/1","grantId":"AH/N00342X/1","fundValue":"79916","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Douglas","coPersons":["Christopher  Fremantle"],"organisation":"The Robert Gordon University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
