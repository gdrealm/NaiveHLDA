Two of these techniques called PET (Positron Emission Photometry) and fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in particular, exploit the coupling between changes in neural activity and their associated metabolic demands. These demands are satisfied by increased cerebral blood flow in much the same way as increased muscular activity involves increased blood flow to the muscles. The changes in the proportions of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood which provide the magnetic contrast that underpins the fMRI signal is called BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) contrast. However, although the above techniques can be used to understand which areas of brain are involved in different tasks and how this is affected by injury, the underlying physical basis of how neurons regulate their blood supply is not well understood. The imaging techniques exploit the fact that increased activity produces localised increases in blood flow but basic research into the relationships between neural activity, the associated metabolic demands and changes in regional cerebral blood flow is still needed. Components of the proposed co-operative group will develop techniques to improve fMRI and optical imaging to understand how different parts of the brain communicate to organise complex behaviour. Another component (already funded by the EPSRC) is currently developing novel ways of analysing neuroimaging data. Other components are using the techniques developed by other projects to investigate the effects of cocaine on brain activation and visual cortical function following repair in animal models of human retinal disease (retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration). Another component project is investigating how cue salience affects the magnitude and latency of the hemodynamic response. The results of these studies and the proposed experiments will be used to inform the design and analysis of fMRI imaging in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9825307","grantId":"G9825307","fundValue":"549554","fundStart":"1999-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"J  Mayhew","coPersons":["Paul Geoffrey Overton","Peter  Redgrave","Ying  Zheng","Nikos  Papadakis","Peter John Coffey"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
