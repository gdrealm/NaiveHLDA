{"id":"B0C5A0D4-E046-414C-AF57-E4AD3F2CF675","title":"Geometry, holography and Skyrmions","abstractText":"Particle physicists have a good understanding of the fundamental constituents of matter, but the mathematical complexity of their theory means that, even with the use of supercomputers, it is impossible to use it to predict even the basic properties of even the simplest atoms familiar from everyday life, such as helium, carbon and oxygen. Fathoming the core of these atoms is the realm of nuclear physics, but current approaches are detached from fundamental theory and instead are mainly based on fitting phenomenological models to experimental data. The ambitious aim of this project is to provide a link between fundamental theory and nuclear physics through a novel mathematical description, using a geometrical formulation, in which atomic nuclei arise as stable localized excitations called Skyrmions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K003453/1","grantId":"EP/K003453/1","fundValue":"331284","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-21","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  In studying solitons in holographic and near BPS theories.
