Previous studies have examined the relationships between a range of social, economic and situational factors and levels and predictability of crime using a range of techniques. However the impact of altering these factors (where they can be influenced), and how such measures might be combined with other potential crime reduction measures are not fully understood.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This research aims to achieve new insights into the pattern of crime in cities using big data analytics to analyse the relationships between multiple datasets and levels of crime, and use genetic algorithms to derive innovative optimised strategies that result in lower levels of street crime alongside balancing other objectives - such as lower service costs (eg from improved design of street lighting, and policing patterns), lower carbon emissions, and improved public confidence and acceptance.&nbsp; These strategies will be tested through using the city as a living lab, drawing on Glasgowâ€™s Technology Strategy Board (TSB) City Demonstrator role.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003287/1","grantId":"ES/L003287/1","fundValue":"198036","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Bellingham","coPersons":["Maxim  Fedorov","John  Quigley","Ivan  Andonovic","Francesco  Sindico","Robert  Rogerson"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
