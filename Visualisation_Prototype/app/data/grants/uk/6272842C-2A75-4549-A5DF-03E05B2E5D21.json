Recently we have shown that mutations within a specific region of seipin (N-glycosylation motif) are associated with dominant, apparently gain-of-function mutations resulting in a variable neurological phenotype completely independent to lipodystrophy of which the hallmark characteristic is a motor neuron disease affecting the upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons, or both 10,39. A recurrent feature of human neurodegenerative disorders, including motor neuron disease, is the accumulation of disease-related proteins as aggregates within neurons or glial cells; whether such inclusions are harmful or beneficial to cells remains to be clarified. Consistent with this our preliminary studies indicate that seipin mutations associated with motor neuron degeneration result in the aggregation of the mutant protein in cell culture. \n\nThe studies described in this proposal are intended to enhance our understanding of the likely subcellular localisation and morphology of wild type seipin, providing important clues as to its function, and the effect of seipin-related motor neuron degenerative disease-associated mutations, providing important information regarding the disease process. In addition these findings will be compared with the results of similar experiments of a common BSCL2 lipodystrophy mutation, providing valuable information relating to this condition. We have already laid strong foundations for this aspect of the project by conducting extensive preliminary studies including the generation of seipin-specific antibodies, wild type and mutant tagged constructs and a comprehensive battery of wild type and mutant stably-transfected cell lines. \n\nAnother important facet of this proposal is disease gene identification, an area in which we have a strong track record, for a second variant of the dHMN-V/CMT/SPG17 phenotypic continuum. This aspect of the project will be facilitated by our recent identification of a comparatively small critical interval on the long arm of chromosome 6, comprising just 42 transcripts. Consequently, as well as being of clear value to studies into the forever-expanding number of related inherited variants of motor neuron degeneration, the findings of this project will also be of benefit to our understanding of other aggregate-associated neurodegenerative diseases as well as to the field of congenital generalised lipodystrophy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600983","grantId":"G0600983","fundValue":"200000","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Crosby","coPersons":["Heema  Patel"],"organisation":"St George's University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
