These are mathematical functions that predict how well chemical compounds will act as drugs. QSARs are used to guide the synthesis of new drugs.\n\nThe current situation is:\n1) There is a vast range of approaches to learning QSARs.\n2) It is clear from theory and practice that the best QSAR approach depends on the type of problem.\n3) Currently the QSAR scientist has little to guide her/him on which QSAR approach to choose for a specific problem. \n\nWe therefore propose to make a step-change in QSAR research. We will utilise newly available public domain chemoinformatic databases, and in-house datasets, to systematically run extensive comparative QSAR experiments. We will then generalise these results to learn which target-type/ compound-type/ compound-representation /learning-method combinations work best together. \n\nWe do not propose to develop any new QSAR method. Rather, we will learn how to better apply existing QSAR methods. This approach is called &quot;meta-learning&quot;, using machine learning to learn about QSAR leaning. \n\nWe will make the knowledge we learn publically available to guide and improve future QSAR learning.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K030582/1","grantId":"EP/K030582/1","fundValue":"173171","fundStart":"2013-10-14","fundEnd":"2015-10-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project is still ongoing.

We also established a close collaboration with the OpenML Team from the University of Technology, Eindhoven and internally, in Brunel University with Dr Crina Grosan - an expert in machine learning. Below is a summary of the key outputs.\n\n1. Annotation scheme. We have developed an annotation scheme for the annotation of machine learning experiments that are typically used for the prediction of biological activities of chemical compounds. The annotation scheme consists of descriptors for datasets, machine learners, their predictions and also drag targets. While several formalisms for the description of datasets and machine learning algorithms already exist, they are generic and not tuned for the prediction of biological activities necessary for drug discovery. For example, the ontology DMOP (Data Mining Optimization), developed within the European e-LICO project (http://www.e-lico.eu/DMOP.html), is sufficient to describe such properties of a dataset as number of data items, feature correlation, etc. However DMOP and other formalism do not provide descriptors that capture information about, for example, diversity of a chemical space. There also exists a classification of drug targets (see ChEMBL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/target/browser), but it does not capture the functionality of targets or their similarity. Our annotation scheme captures all the essential properties of datasets, predictions, and drug targets.\n\nThe results of a preliminary work on an annotation scheme for the drug discovery have been published as a use case in this paper:\n\nPanov, P., Soldatova, L.N., Dzeroski, S. (2014) Ontology of Core Data Mining Entities. J. of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery. 28/5-6: 1222-1265.\n\n\nThe article is available through Brunel University digital library: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2664086\n\n2. Software development. We have developed and successfully tested the software infrastructure to run QSAR and meta-QSAR experiments.\n\n3. Software integration. We have integrated the workflow of our project into the OpenML platform (http://openml.org/). OpenML is a popular platform where datasets and predictions made by various machine learning algorithms are stored, shared and compared. This open approach to the sharing of machine learning experiments is designed to save time and efforts, as there is no need to repeat computational experiments. We have made an agreement with the OpenML Team that this platform will have a dedicated to drug discovery section. In this way the drug discovery research community will benefit from this already established platform and its functionality (i.e. the comparison of different predictions across different datsets).\n\nWe have adjusted our software to enable the deposition of our datasets and the results of machine learning runs directly to OpenML. We have worked together with the developers of OpenML platform and they implemented a secure access to the store datasets. \n\nDr Sadawi and Prof. King (the University of Manchester) participated in OpenML Workshop, University of Technology Eindhoven in October, 2014 \nBy the end of the project all data and machine learning predictions will be available at OpenML. \n\n4. QSAR learning. We have done initial trails of QSAR and meta-QSAR learning. We are currently running the main QSAR learning experiments.\n\n5. Dissemination. Intermediate project results have been presented by Dr Soldatova at the 20th Euro-QSAR conference in St Petersburg, Russia in September, 2014 as an oral communication &quot;Meta QSAR&quot; (http://www.ldorganisation.com/v2/produits.php?langue=english&amp;cle_menus=1238915734).\n\nSlides of the presentation are available at the project website: http://www.meta-qsar.org/pubs.html \nInitial project results were presented by Prof. King at OpenML Workshop, University of Technology Eindhoven in October, 2014. His talk is available at youtube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llTppH2zLuE&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLBZBIkixHEicUl5fE2BQwHTc0GjytF_tH When our results are complete they will be fully and openly published, including on the semantic web. The results will enable the better design of drugs by academic and commercial laboratories.\nThe problem of how best to learn QSARs is of great industrial and medical importance. Drug development is arguably the most important applications of science in the UK. The average cost to bring a new drug to market is ~?500 million. A successful drug can earn ?billions a year, and as patent protection is time-limited, even an extra week of protection can be of great financial significance. The UK (both academia and industry) is a leader in QSAR research and chemoinformatics in general as can be seen by its publication record. This project aims to help to maintain this lead.
