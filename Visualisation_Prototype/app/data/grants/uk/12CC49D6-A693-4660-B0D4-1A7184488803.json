It addresses clear knowledge gaps identified by NERC, DEFRA and UKERC in the effects of MREDs on flow conditions, habitats and ecological interactions. It will use a wealth of observation techniques above and under water, ranging from radar to sonar and in situ measurements, to be deployed over 2 years at 3 key sites around the UK. These measurements will feed into models of ecological interactions and habitat preferences, allowing predictions of the multiple effects of large MRED arrays.\nBeing fully cross-disciplinary, this project will engage different academic beneficiaries at each stage. Researchers in the field of instrument design (in the laboratory and at sea) will benefit from our experience in building the different systems and adapting them to long-term deployments on the seabed, in extremely challenging environments. This will be done by carefully planned Knowledge Exchange activities and open-access publication of our results, as well as exchange of personnel. The avenues opened for continuous imaging of complex and dynamic 3-D structures will be useful to researchers in other fields associated with ecological systems and marine structures, but also in medical 4-D imaging.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J004332/1","grantId":"NE/J004332/1","fundValue":"175077","fundStart":"2011-09-07","fundEnd":"2015-03-27","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  There is likely to be a rapid increase in the number of tidal stream turbines in the next decade. A major concern is that deep diving seabirds (auks Alcidae sp and cormorants Phalacrocorax sp) may collide with the moving components of devices during foraging dives. However, if individuals do not dive near tidal stream turbines within the tidal pass habitats favoured for installations, then they will not face collision risks. Identifying associations between physical conditions and deep diving seabirds would allow species fine scale foraging distributions within tidal passes to be predicted, leading to estimations of spatial overlap between species foraging distributions and tidal stream turbines. Here we outline a suite of biological and physical datasets from the Fall of Warness, Orkney, UK that have been collated to identify associations between physical conditions and vulnerable species. Preliminary results reveal associations between strong currents and several vulnerable species although seasonal variations were seen. However, the inclusion of more physical conditions in future statistical analysis will allow more precise predictions of species fine-scale distributions. This will lead towards confident estimations of spatial overlap between deep diving seabirds and devices in tidal pass habitats.

Some of techniques developed during the project are being taken up by the industry and are the subject of further proposals to enable their use into the future.
