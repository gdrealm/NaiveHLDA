{"id":"F680237A-1FF5-4F8A-9CF5-FD0B46D1B149","title":"Young People who enter Jobs without Training","abstractText":"<p>Despite achieving the highest proportion on record of 16-year olds entering post-compulsory education in the UK (73.3 per cent) in 2004, there remains a sub-group of young people who leave school at 16 or at 17, enter employment and participate in no formally recognised programme of further education or training. Most recent estimates suggest that 5 per cent of all 16-year olds and 11.9 per cent of 17-year olds are in the jobs without training (JWT) category (DfES, 2005).</p> \n<p>The research will provide a greater understanding of young people aged 16 or 17, who leave full-time education and who are characterised as having entered employment without training. A sample of young people (aged 16-17) who are currently in jobs without training and who are not working towards or do not have, an NVQ level 2 (or above) qualification will be interviewed, as well as a sample of their parents and their employers. Local and national policymakers will also be interviewed as part of the study. One principle aim of the study will be to present an up-to-date in-depth analysis of the experiences, circumstances, attitudes, ambitions and barriers to participation in learning of young people who are in jobs without training.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D004861/1","grantId":"ES/D004861/1","fundValue":"81456","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Mary Maguire","coPersons":["Prue Jane Huddleston"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
