If they are incorrectly made, through inheritance, or damaged, through infection, the consequences can be drastic. Biochemists have spent many years learning how to purify and study individual proteins from the thousands which make up a living cell. Now, the new field of proteomics seeks to identify and study many proteins at once. This proposal aims to take this further, by developing ways of studying individual protein molecules at work inside a living cell. We use a yeast, an organism which is quite simple but has been shown to resemble human cells in many ways. Using genetics we will ?tag? proteins with fluorescent molecules. This allows us to observe the protein. New methods in microscopy enable us to detect individual protein molecules and to watch how they behave under different conditions, and with which other proteins they interact. Since these proteins have equivalents in human cells, we should learn much about how human proteins behave in health and in disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400062","grantId":"G0400062","fundValue":"776088","fundStart":"2005-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Armstrong","coPersons":["Antony Michael Carr","Mark  Osborne"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
