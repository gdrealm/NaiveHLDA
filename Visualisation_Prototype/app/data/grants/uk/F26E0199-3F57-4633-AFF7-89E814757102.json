Our goal is to transform the network of stakeholders involved in care environments into a virtuous cycle of design improvement, in which architects, professional bodies, academics, policy makers, charities, and care home providers are all motivated to pursue improvement in the built environment for older adults. \n\nWith changes in population demographics resulting in a growing number of care homes, economic, health and ethical considerations demand that attention be directed to effective means of creating an enabling built environment to provide older adults with healthy and socially fulfilling lives. This research addresses a significant knowledge gap focussed on measures to mitigate problems and enhance the experience of older people within the built environment.\n \nA fundamental impact of ageing is that a person's needs and abilities change; however, the built environment is failing to respond to these changes. Despite current legislative statutes and design guidance, little is known from empirical evidence (generated by older people, their family and care providers) about enabling and disabling elements of the built environment. These elements have never been defined to support the advancement of building and digital technology design. Through systematic analysis of the failings and successes of older people's care environments, BESiDE research will identify how better-informed building design can facilitate greater mobility, physical activity, social connectedness and wellbeing of older people. BESiDE's aims are to: \n\n1) Actively involve and inform professional practices of architecture and design through research focussed on failings and successes of the built environment (internal and external) across the experience of ageing.\n\n2) Impact professional practice through developing digital technologies within the built environment to promote greater mobility, improved quality of life, physical activity and connectivity of older people. \n\n3) Inform policy, through BESiDE's Advisory Board and Project Partners, as to what designs and digital interventions encourage activity and how these can be engineered to facilitate increased wellbeing in older people.\n\nCollaboration across disciplines of computing, architecture, healthcare, medicine of old age and design will drive this work forward and build the UK's capability in supporting older people within the built environment. Engagement with older people and stakeholders will shape understanding of barriers to wellbeing within the built environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K037293/1","grantId":"EP/K037293/1","fundValue":"1301190","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  As a new grant (about a year old), primary research is still underway. The research addresses critical challenges facing designers of the built environment, particularly older peoples' care environments. Through a multi-faceted analysis of environments specifically designed for older people, BESiDE will provide a practical, usable and holistic understanding of design for wellbeing, ageing, and long-term mobility for use within the context of the built environment. To effect this transformation and to achieve impact, the BESiDE team has planned targeted activities. To ensure that these activities have the desired impact, we have assembled a consortium of Expert Advisor stakeholders from the professional communities we plan to impact. In addition, we have assembled a large group of older adult stakeholders. Collectively, these professionals and older adults will advise on what needs to be done; they will also advise on how to have the most impact by providing contacts within relevant stakeholder communities.\n\nWithin the context of older people's care homes, BESiDE's impact aims are to: \n1. Train professionals on better design of the built environment (internal and external) for ageing.\n2. Inform policy change as to what built environment designs encourage activity and how these can be engineered to facilitate increased wellbeing in older people.

Our aims are to:\n\n1.
