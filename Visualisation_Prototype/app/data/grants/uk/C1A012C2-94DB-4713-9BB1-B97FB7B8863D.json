{"id":"C1A012C2-94DB-4713-9BB1-B97FB7B8863D","title":"New African Migrants in the Gateway City: Ethnicity, Religion, Citizenship","abstractText":"<p>This 30-month urban anthropological project is directed by Professor Pnina Werbner, Keele University. It will employ one senior postdoctoral researcher with prior experience of research in Africa. The project responds to a growing recognition that London has become a major gateway city for black African migrants, who now outnumber Caribbeans in the capital, yet little in-depth research has been conducted on this new, complex diaspora. The aim is to address this gap in the study of migration to Britain by exploring processes of community formation and inter-ethnic relations among black Africans in a London neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>The focus on a single locality hosting a wide range of African groups will enable the researchers to study African ethnicity as it is currently evolving in contemporary Britain, with particular emphasis on the incorporative role of churches and religious identities in creating the ground for active citizenship. The centrality of church networks in mediating civil society will be investigated alongside other forms of inter-ethnic neighbourhood interaction and mobilisation in which Africans originating from different parts of the Continent, Caribbeans and other ethnic minorities come together. A second major focus will be on family, gender and ongoing transnational relations. The project will use a range of ethnographic and urban anthropological methodologies.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1243","grantId":"RES-000-23-1243","fundValue":"208136","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Pnina  Werbner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
