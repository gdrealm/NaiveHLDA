Adequate physical models and simulation tools are necessary to address this issue.This collaborative research involves four partners: 1) Pisa : Atomistic modelling of ballistic transport in gated structures with contacts.(2) Vienna: Effective mass approach to transport inclusive of scattering.(3) De Montfort University : Characterisation, parameter extraction and defect analysis of devices fabricated at Cambridge. The parameters will be fed into the modelling at Pisa and Vienna.(4) Cambridge University : Fabrication of devices.The overall goal of the project is to carry out a comprehensive analysis linking theory with experiment to enable some fundamental design rules for fabrication of such technologies in future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D064600/1","grantId":"EP/D064600/1","fundValue":"329641","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bill Ireland Milne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
