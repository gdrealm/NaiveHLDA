{"id":"E3C53A8A-23F8-4E0E-9839-EA02139AB070","title":"History of Analytic Philosophy International Network (HAPINet)","abstractText":"Analytic philosophy is generally regarded as one of the leading philosophical traditions in the English-speaking world, and it has also been growing in the rest of the world, most notably, over the last decade or so, in mainland China, following its earlier establishment in Taiwan. It is the main aim of this proposed network to investigate the historical and philosophical significance of these developments by comparing the history of analytic philosophy in China and Taiwan with its history in the West.\n\nAnalytic philosophy in the West originated in the advances in logic that took place in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Around this time, too, China began to open up to Western influence, and terms from Western logic were translated into Chinese, inspiring not only work on logic in China but also interest in the logical aspects of traditional Chinese philosophy. A Chinese tradition of logic came to be constructed, and debates took place concerning the relationship between Chinese logic and Western and Indian logic. The Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the Second World War, the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and then especially the Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976, hindered the further development of dialogue with the West; but in the last two decades mainland China has increasingly opened up, with Western philosophers being invited to teach and speak at conferences in China, and more and more translations of key Western texts being undertaken.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, and especially in analytic philosophy, translation is all too often taken for granted, yet the translation of philosophical texts not only requires philosophical skills but also raises philosophical questions that are easily overlooked if working in just one language. One of the aims of the present project is to identify and explore precisely these questions. For example, basic terms concerning meaning (e.g. 'content', 'sense', 'reference', 'denotation', etc.) can be very usefully investigated by considering how they might be translated into different languages; and their translation into Chinese raises particular difficulties due to the different nature and structure of the Chinese language and the different culture in which that language has developed. Exploring the ways that basic terms of analytic philosophy have been - and are being - translated into Chinese can thus throw much light on the most fundamental ideas and implicit assumptions of analytic philosophy.\n\nFour workshops/conferences are planned: two to be held in York (summer 2014 and spring 2015) and two to be held in Beijing (autumn 2014 and autumn 2015). These will bring together analytic philosophers and historians of analytic philosophy in the West (especially in the UK) and in China (both mainland China and Taiwan). One workshop, in particular, will bring together the translators of The Oxford Handbook of the History of Analytic Philosophy (edited by Michael Beaney and published in 2013), which is currently being translated into Chinese under the directorship of Prof. Jiang Yi of Beijing Normal University, supported by a grant from the Chinese government. Some of the original contributors to the Handbook will be invited to Beijing to explore with the translators some of the key philosophical issues that have arisen in undertaking this translation.\n\nThe project will be managed by a committee made up of the PI, Ci and representatives from other universities in Beijing, Taipei and the UK. The management committee will meet at each of the workshops and conferences. The project has the firm support from philosophers and universities in both Beijing and Taipei.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L015773/1","grantId":"AH/L015773/1","fundValue":"35338","fundStart":"2014-06-23","fundEnd":"2015-12-22","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Anthony Beaney","coPersons":["Yi  Jiang"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
