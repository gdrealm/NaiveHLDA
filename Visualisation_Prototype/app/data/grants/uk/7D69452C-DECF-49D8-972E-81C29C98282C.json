Research focussed on the varied and inventive mating habits of invertebrates reveals the astonishing ways in which males can remodel the behaviour and physiology of the females with which they mate. This includes the transfer during mating by males of chemicals that go deep into female brains and nervous systems to alter behaviour, and those that effectively take over the female reproductive system. Small wonder then that females are sometimes resistant to such manipulations. Our recent work reveals just how global and sophisticated are the changes wrought upon females by mating males. We examined the responses of female fruitflies that mated with males that either did or did not transfer during mating a single ejaculate 'sex peptide' known to affect female sexual receptivity and egg laying. We examined both how messenger RNAs (mRNAs, that make gene products), and microRNAs (miRs, which sit on mRNAs and block them or target them for destruction) changed in females following receipt of sex peptide. We found many alterations to mRNAs, but what was really striking was the number of miRs that were different. This is consistent with the emerging general view that miRs have extremely important and widespread roles in regulating how genes work, with 20-30% of all genes (roughly 13,000 genes in the fruitfly) estimated as targets for miRs. Hence sex peptide sets in train global effects on female genomes not only at the level of DNA to RNA synthesis (transcription), but also on the rate at which RNA is translated (i.e. made into proteins). We are interested in SP because it has a 'swiss army knife' of functions and can alter the reproductive performance of both males and females. Remarkably, SP can significantly benefit the reproductive performance of males at the expense of that of females. This shows that SP plays a role in the battle of the sexes, where males can gain by maximising their returns from each mating even if that results in a decrease in the longer term reproductive prospects of their mates. SP benefits males because it decreases female sexual receptivity for several days and increases egg-laying. Hence males that transfer SP father more offspring than males that lack SP. However, females that receive elevated levels of SP suffer adverse consequences in the long term. The effects of SP are dependent on female diet and can be significantly altered, abolished or even reversed in sign under poor and good quality food. This research puts us in a timely position to address the following two fundamental questions: (1) to find out how male sex peptide intervenes in the female genome - which are the key genes that are targeted by miRs following receipt of sex peptide? and secondly - given that female diet is key to determining how much females are able to respond to sex peptide - (2) to examine how female genomes respond to sex peptide following both short- and long-term (evolutionary) changes in diet. The research is important because this is the first example we have where we can investigate the co-ordinated changes in both mRNAs and miRs to an external stimulus like the sex peptide that underlies important reproductive functions in both sexes. The fact that diet is also an important part of how females respond to sex peptide is also crucial as it allows us to test at the level of the genome SP responses following both short- and long-term alterations to diet. Our research will also therefore show miRs that change under different dietary conditions, which is important because diet is also a crucial determinant of lifespan.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H008047/1","grantId":"BB/H008047/1","fundValue":"497959","fundStart":"2010-04-12","fundEnd":"2013-08-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tracey  Chapman","coPersons":["Tamas  Dalmay","Vincent  Moulton"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" Research focussed on the varied and inventive mating habits of invertebrates reveals the astonishing ways in which males can remodel the behaviour and physiology of the females with which they mate.

We examined both how messenger RNAs (mRNAs, that make gene products), and microRNAs (miRs, which sit on mRNAs and block them or target them for destruction) changed in females following receipt of sex peptide (SP).\n\n\n\nWe are interested in SP because it has a 'swiss army knife' of functions.

SP benefits males because it decreases female sexual receptivity for several days and increases egg-laying. Hence males that transfer SP father more offspring than males that lack SP. However, females that receive elevated levels of SP suffer adverse consequences in the long term. The effects of SP are dependent on female diet and can be significantly altered, abolished or even reversed in sign under poor and good quality food.\n\n\n\nThe main aim of this research is to answer two fundamental questions: (1) to find out how male sex peptide intervenes in the female genome, and (2) to examine how female genomes respond to sex peptide following both short- and long-term (evolutionary) changes in diet.\n\n\n\nWith regard to the first aim, we have now published our first set of findings on changes in gene expression in females following receipt of sex peptide (Gioti et al 2012). This shows a dramatic set of changes over time and across different tissues. We have followed this up with a more in depth time series analysis which is now nearing completion, as well as an investigation of the associated changes in the expression of microRNAs. These data give a unparalleled insight into the profound changes in females following mating, and the first indication of what sexual conflict might 'look like' at the genomic level. Following completion of validation tests these data are to form a significant publication. Associated with this, we also showed that females lacking specific microRNAs have altered responses to receipt of SP, and we are currently finishing up a manuscript for submission to the journal Genetics. Towards the second aim, we initiated lines in which we successfully conducted experimental evolution on low and high adult nutrition. Our analyses show that these lines have evolved and diverged both in terms of how they utilise food, but also in terms of how females in them respond to receipt of sex peptide. We are now characterising those responses at the genomic level. These data will form two further significant publications. An important part of this second aim is to consider better the life history. Therefore we did a study in which we examined how costs and benefits of receipt of sex peptide change with female age. This work has been accepted for publication in Proceedings of the Royal Society B (Fricke et al 2013).\n\n\n\nOverall, the research results are important because they represent a great example where we can investigate the co-ordinated changes in both genes and microRNAs to an external stimulus like the sex peptide that underlies important reproductive functions in both sexes. The fact that diet is also an important part of how females respond to sex peptide is also crucial, and allows us also to consider key life history traits such as lifespan. In terms of non-academic impact, there is considerable public interest in understanding the battle of the sexes. Given the intersection of the work with diet and health, there is also much interest in understanding the effects of diet on traits such as lifespan via reproduction. The work therefore has the potential for use in the education domain. There is much interest in the prophylactic effects of food manipulations of age related pathologies, and our work\n\nwill also be relevant here. This is primarily a fundamental bioscience project. However, there are two potential sets of exploitation routes (i) diet, health and ageing-related impacts, and (ii) genetic insect pest control SMEs. Our research could inform the latter for example, via suggesting new husbandry techniques to alter the extent of deleterious effects of male-female interactions. It might also suggest novel modulators of insect behaviour.\n\n\n\nFor the former, we have been engaging with the strong research interests in diet and health at UEA School of Medicine, and at the Institute of Food Research within the Norwich Research Park. In terms of pest control links, we have expanded our work with Oxitec Ltd (Oxford\n\nInsect technologies) through an additional CASE PhD award and also through Project Partnerships.\n\n\n\nAn additional exploitation route is through the analysis of novel, large genomic datasets for the development of bioinformatic algorithms and toolkits.
