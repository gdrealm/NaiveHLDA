{"id":"286F422D-2F96-4D4E-AFBF-0A7723D082BD","title":"Networks across the Border: Investigating prehistoric social and cultural networks through the Tyne-Forth Prehistory Forum","abstractText":"England and Scotland are separated by a political boundary that runs down the middle of the River Tweed from Berwick and then slices the Cheviot Hills in two. It has been there since the 11th century AD. There is no evidence any boundary existed in prehistory, yet archaeologists interested in prehistory have often worked on one side or other of this border. But what if we approached the landscape and the archaeological remains from around the River Tyne to around the River Forth as undivided by the border? Then we could consider the wider patterns made by prehistoric communities in establishing and maintaining their social networks across this landscape. To do this we need to create a new social network, bringing archaeologists and other specialists from England and Scotland together in the Tyne-Forth Prehistory Forum. \\n\\nWe have already explored in two 'trials' that we can bring together these archaeologists, specialists interested in the materials people used, scientists interested in understanding how people once lived and farmed, colleagues who conserve and protect archaeological sites and landscapes, and those vital sparks, the amateur enthusiasts. We know the idea works: we reviewed the state of the existing 'regional research frameworks' at the first Tyne-Forth Prehistory Forum; at the second we began to discuss prehistoric communities living in the upland environments of the Cheviot Hills. \\n\\nThere is great enthusiasm among members of this forum to accelerate this interaction and to investigate together how further research can be conducted to investigate these past communities and their environments. We are applying for financial support for the Tyne-Forth Forum. In particular we are asking to cover the cost of attending our meetings for young researchers struggling on grants, experts retired from work, amateur enthusiasts with no sources of money and archaeological contractors who nowadays find few chances to grapple with research questions. We will prehistoric evidence in the landscape through a field visit and hold meetings in various venues around the region. The programme of meetings we propose will knit the diverse research groups together as a community which can continue collaboration for years to come. We aim to be a forum for debate in which methods of working and terminologies can be compared, where what is special and important about our region can be discussed, and similarities with neighbouring regions can be compared. We intend to create a space where we can discuss gaps in existing knowledge and how we might develop strategies to learn more, where we can bring together the work of many specialists who otherwise seldom meet to discuss these themes and where expertise can be shared and developed. We will do this through five themed conference meetings held at different venues around the region, a field trip to key sites and landscapes, and through e-newsletters, a web-page and magazine pieces. We will advertise our events widely and encourage new members to join the 65 or so already committed. There are many cutting-edge topics to explore, from how people inhabited their changing landscapes, to the social and trade links that supported past communities, to cultural similarities and differences (in, for instance, how they treated their dead), to how these societies were organised and structured. We will encourage new, collaborative research by helping individuals meet to plan and discuss such ventures. Our links and collaborations will be much stronger and more enduring by the time this financial support for our project ceases, and we anticipate that research projects springing from this Forum will lead to further conferences and discussions in the future. We expect this AHRC networking funding will help us establish new, inclusive research communities equal to the challenge of investigating prehistoric social networks across the Border.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I001549/1","grantId":"AH/I001549/1","fundValue":"27184","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project fostered research interactions between professional, student and voluntary archaeology practitioners, and between those working in a variety of different institutions in England and Scotland, including museums, universities, contract archaeology companies, and local authorities. The project enhanced the career development of student archaeologists in particular, a number of whom became participants at several or all network events. The edited volume in preparation includes contributions, as we hoped, from research students, contract archaeologists and heritage organisation staff as well as staff based at Universities, and is designed to reach all of these constituencies, and members of voluntary archaeology groups. There has not yet been an attempt to record subsequent activities involving collaborations between members of the network, but one community group was involved, for instance, in a subsequent project development and others accepted invitations to participate were the research funded; other members of the proposed project included contract archaeologists as well as Research Organisation researchers. In the medium term it is hoped that connections made during the funded network period will stimulate further interactions between those working (voluntarily or otherwise) on archaeology in the region, including research that directly benefits the appreciation of cultural heritage for those living in and visiting the region.  ","person":"Christopher John Fowler","coPersons":["Richard  Tipping"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" This research network successfully drew together researchers from a range of different professional and voluntary communities working either side of the Anglo-Scottish border, and stimulated new dialogue about the archaeology on both sides of that border. Seven meetings took place - five day conferences and two field meetings - over the period of the award. These meetings were attending by a growing number of delegates, culminating in an attendance of 115 at the public meeting in Edinburgh in September 2012. By completion the Forum reached a membership of 158 individuals engaging with research into the prehistoric archaeology of the region, exceeding the target of 100 set at the outset of the project. It was able to fund two 'sandpit' events stimulating the design of two further research projects. The network also fulfilled all of its primary research objectives in investigating (a) the history of prehistoric archaeology in NE England and SE Scotland, focussing on the extent to which national borders and 'professional' boundaries played a part in that history, (b) how prehistoric communities inhabited the varied landscapes of the region, (c) how such communities communicated and formed social and cultural networks, (d) whether an equivalent cultural boundary (or boundaries) to the modern political border existed in prehistory. Each issue proved to have a complex character so that, for instance, it was noted that cultural boundaries shifted throughout prehistory, at time suggesting similarities across the Tyne-Forth region while at others suggesting boundaries within that region. The network has stimulated some new collaborations in considering this complexity in more detail, and an edited volume is in preparation summarising key work discussed at the network events. The results may be taken forward in future research on working across such borders, on the prehistoric archaeology of the broad region, and in future collaborations among network participants. Participants in the network events might develop further research projects enhanced by the connections they have made and the presentations and discussions that took place at network meetings. At least one research project - a large-scale collaborative and interdisciplinary project - has been designed resulting from these interactions, although that project has not yet been successful in attracting funding and so has not been implemented (an AHRC Standard Grant application led by PI Chris Fowler was unsuccessful in 2014). An edited volume is currently in preparation, and this will detail a series of findings about approaching prehistoric archaeology across national borders, and specifically about approaches to prehistoric archaeology in northeast England and southeast Scotland that can be used by other researchers to develop approaches to the past that do not stop at national borders, but engage with prehistoric social phenomena at a scale that is sensible in terms of the original extent of those phenomena.
