Women and Exposure in Contemporary French Culture","abstractText":"This project examines new articulations of the public / private divide and the emphasis on intimacy in French culture as these phenomena relate to women. Focusing on the politics and poetics of new models of exposure it analyses selective autofication, film, photography and conceptual art, as well as internet and televised forms, drawing out the issues raised by female-authored works in which self-revelation /voyeurism are especially pronounced. The project considers women as objects of representation and as producers of intimate / voyeuristic works. It also examines the political implications for women of the consumption of intimacy as cultural product.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112808/1","grantId":"112808/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Shirley  Jordan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
