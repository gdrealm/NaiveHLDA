In the absence of a cure TSE diseases are invariably fatal. These diseases affect both animals and humans, and include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, chronic wasting disease in mule deer and elk, and scrapie in sheep and goats. Some animal species and humans have become infected with these diseases after eating TSE agent-contaminated food, or through transplantation of TSE agent-contaminated tissues or tissue products (eg: transfusion of blood from a variant CJD-infected donor). Many questions remain concerning the route the infectious TSE agent takes from the site of exposure (eg: intestine) to the brain where it causes damage to nerve cells. We have shown that soon after exposure TSE agents first target and accumulate within lymphoid tissues (Peyer's patches in the small intestine, lymph nodes and spleen) before they spread to the brain. Many TSE agents must accumulate in these lymphoid tissues before they can subsequently spread to the brain (a process termed neuroinvasion) where they ultimately cause neurodegeneration and death. After oral exposure TSE agents also accumulate within lymphoid tissues in the large intestine such as the appendix. However, the contribution of the large intestine to oral TSE pathogenesis is unknown and has been mostly overlooked. This is unfortunate as the large intestine may be an important early site of TSE agent accumulation that influences disease susceptibility. For example, inflammation or pathology within the large intestine may affect disease susceptibility. In the current project, mice will be created that contain lymphoid tissues in the large intestine only. These mice will be used to test the hypothesis that lymphoid tissues in the large intestine are important sites of TSE agent accumulation which influence disease pathogenesis and susceptibility. To achieve this, the following measurable objectives will be addressed: Objective 1- Characterise the development and status of the lymphoid tissues within the small and large intestines Objective 2- Determine the influence of lymphoid tissues in TSE agent neuroinvasion from the large intestine Finally, the effects that other intestinal pathogens may have on TSE susceptibility are not known. For example, the pathology that these pathogens cause in the intestine may increase the uptake of the TSE agent, whereas an influx of inflammatory cells may destroy the TSE agent reducing susceptibility. In Objective 3 the effects of infection with a common gut parasite on oral TSE pathogenesis will be determined. These data will provide predictions on how infection with gastrointestinal pathogens may influence TSE susceptibility. Objective 3- Determine the influence of infection with a gastrointestinal pathogen on oral TSE pathogenesis Currently, effective therapeutics and prophylactics to treat TSE diseases are lacking. Furthermore, no reliable preclinical diagnostic test is available. A thorough understanding of the early events in TSE pathogenesis will aid the determination of risk, the development of pre-clinical diagnostics and therapeutics, especially the development TSE-specific mucosal vaccines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G003947/1","grantId":"BB/G003947/1","fundValue":"350321","fundStart":"2009-05-05","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil Andrew Mabbott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" -Demonstrated that M cells are the main route of TSE agent uptake from the small intestine after oral exposure.\n\n\n\n-Demonstrated for the first time that distinct mechanisms regulate the development of the GALT in the large and small intestines. \n\n\n\n-Demonstrated for the first time that the large intestine is not a primary site of TSE agent neuroinvasion after oral exposure.\n\n\n\n-Demonstrated for the first time that congruent parasite infection in the large intestine does not influence oral TSE pathogenesis or susceptibility.\n\n\n\n-Demonstrated for the first time that a congruent parasite infection in the large intestine can exacerbate the onset of clinical TSE disease.\n\n\n\n-Project still in progress and will be published as soon as ready.
