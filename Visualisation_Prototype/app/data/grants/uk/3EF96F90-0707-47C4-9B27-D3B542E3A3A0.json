{"id":"3EF96F90-0707-47C4-9B27-D3B542E3A3A0","title":"Magnetotail dynamics and Substorms","abstractText":"We note that the invitation tendered by STFC is related to the work programme proposed as Project 3.5 of in the UCL/MSSL Consolidated Grant 2012 proposal. The tasks set out in that section of the proposal can be summarised as follows: (i) determine the radial evolution of particle pitch angle distributions in the magnetotail (6 months), (ii) determine whether the magnetosheath is the source of the cold dense plasmasheet (6 months), (iii) determine the how thermal and superthermal particle populations support the current density profile in the magnetotail under various geomagnetic and solar wind conditions (9 months), (iv) construct an empirical model of particle distributions in the magnetosphere and apply it to help interpret data from the MMS mission (15 months +).\n\nWe note that the referees' reports for all elements of this proposal were strongly supportive. We believe the scientific goals of that proposed work remain valid, and under this new funding we will set out to achieve a number of these, using the methodology set out in the original proposal. Our initial thoughts are to prioritise tasks (ii) and (iii), which, although challenging, were called out as particularly noteworthy by a number of the referees. However, note that we now need to recruit a PDRA (or two) to work on these tasks, so the actual order we set out to approach these tasks will be refined in the light of the experience and interests of that person, in order to maximise productivity on the grant. Despite the fact that the new grant would be for less than half the duration anticipated for the original proposal, and the newly-recruited PDRA will almost certainly be less experienced than the PDRA we originally named, and against whom we baselined the proposed schedule, we would expect that we would make significant inroads on at least 2 of the topics listed above and detailed in our original proposal.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L005638/1","grantId":"ST/L005638/1","fundValue":"201209","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  We are in the middle of the grant period but have already published several papers in peer-reviewed journals relating to the generation of currents by flow bursts during magnetospheric substorms.
