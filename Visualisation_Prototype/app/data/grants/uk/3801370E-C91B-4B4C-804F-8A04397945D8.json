One of the most advanced methods of investigating brain function is to use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However, fMRI does not measure neural activity; rather, it measures the changes in blood volume and oxygen consumption associated with neural activity. This relationship between nerves and blood vessels in the brain is called neurovascular coupling. Though the existence of neurovascular coupling was first discovered over a century ago, to this day how it actually occurs is poorly understood. The research we will perform will try and understand exactly what the relationships and mechanisms of neurovascular coupling are using a anaesthetised rat preparation. A greater understanding of the fMRI signal will lead to increased sophistication in ways to exploit the technique, both in the design of complex experiments and more importantly, how they should be interpreted. Increased understanding of neurovascular coupling will also have wider implications. There are many diseases or illnesses involving changes in neurovascular coupling, including Alzheimers, stroke and brain tumours. If we can uncover how the healthy brain regulates its blood supply we will be in a better position to address problems when this relationship breaks down.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601581","grantId":"G0601581","fundValue":"356295","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jason  Berwick","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
