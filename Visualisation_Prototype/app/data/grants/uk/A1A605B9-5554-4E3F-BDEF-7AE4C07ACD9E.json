{"id":"A1A605B9-5554-4E3F-BDEF-7AE4C07ACD9E","title":"Follow On: New Catalysts for Respiratory Protection","abstractText":"The aim is to exploit a recent discovery concerning the production of a new high activity catalyst for use in respiratory protection devices for the removal of toxic carbon monoxide from air. The methodology uses supercritical carbon dioxide as an antisolvent and this prepares a nano-structured material that is the key to the observed activity. Initial results show the new catalyst is over twice as active as the current commercial catalyst. Funding is requested to complete patent exemplification and to ensure commercial exploitation can be achieved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E50096X/1","grantId":"EP/E50096X/1","fundValue":"77401","fundStart":"2006-11-24","fundEnd":"2007-11-23","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Hutchings","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
