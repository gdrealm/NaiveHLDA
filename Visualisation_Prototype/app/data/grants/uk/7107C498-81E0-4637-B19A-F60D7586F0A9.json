As more people survive to a greater age, the number of AD sufferers is likely to grow considerably. In recent years the identification of some of the genes involved in AD has resulted in a deeper understanding of how the disease develops. However, there are more genes involved, especially in the common forms of AD with onset in later life. This programme of research aims to identify a gene or genes in a region of chromosome 10 showing very strong evidence of containing at least one susceptibility gene for late-onset AD. We will screen this region intensively using a large sample of over 3000 individuals (MRC Genetic Resource for AD) with AD and without. We will also look for relationships between AD and genes showing compelling evidence of functional involvement in other chromosomal regions likely to contain genes. Finally, we will follow-up the MRC Genetic Resource to produce a sample capable of detecting genes which modify disease symptoms (e.g. Psychosis) and course, as well as those that increase disease risk. The knowledge gained from identifying new genes for AD will provide an important platform for future therapeutic developments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300429","grantId":"G0300429","fundValue":"1734880","fundStart":"2004-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie  Williams","coPersons":["Simon  Lovestone","Peter  Holmans","Lesley  Jones","Michael Conlon O'Donovan","Michael John Owen"],"organisation":"University of Wales College of Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
