{"id":"FFBA40B4-F164-4320-A9AC-4D33DC642C8D","title":"Establishing new collaborations with academic and industrial communities for container fleet management","abstractText":"Container fleet management, e.g. empties repositioning, has been an on-going issue since the beginning of containerisation. The current EPSRC project focuses on developing an integrated tool to support decision-making including fleet-sizing, leasing, distributing and repositioning. This proposal aims to build new collaborations with academic and industrial communities to enhance the current research portfolio. The new collaborations will complement the existing collaborations by exchanging with leading academics across disciplines, and performing site visits, observations, and pilot applications in industrial companies. New research areas such as inter-company container sharing strategies will be explored, which complements the current focus of intra-company container management policies. It is expected that the project will result in long-term collaborations with partners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F012918/1","grantId":"EP/F012918/1","fundValue":"24704","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dongping  Song","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":" Container fleet management, e.g. empties repositioning, has been an on-going issue since the beginning of containerisation. We have developed a simulation tool to support decision-making including fleet-sizing, leasing, distributing and repositioning. This project enabled us to build new collaborations with academic and industrial communities to enhance our research portfolio. The main achievements include: a new fluid-flow model has been developed through collaborations with leading academics, which complements the current research methodologies; more realistic data were collected and empirical policies were extracted through collaborations with industrial communities, which enhances the model validation and evaluation; new research areas such as inter-company container sharing strategies were investigated, which complements the current focus of intra-company container management policies. The project will leave a legacy of academic and industrial links and collaborations that will pay-back for many years. Collaboration with academic researchers and industrial companies.
