Such realities provide users of cyberspace with an ability to access locality-based information sources, applications, service providers, and even people via various forms of mash-up. This can enhance access to internet information sources, making information-pull easier and more intuitive to use, particularly when relevance to the geographical area and related events is important. We anticipate key benefits to exist for decision support in disaster-response situations and social-networking interactions, as well as a host of other business and social location-based services. However, the amount of information available via the internet could simply serve to confuse. Which sources should people pay most attention to? Which should they trust? If sources are accidentally or maliciously incorrect, the consequences can be serious. Therefore, there is an acute need to provide information-quality measures to users of information sources, to help them make decisions regarding the trustworthiness of information. The University of Warwick will specifically address the delivery of information-provenance and integrity support for use in location-based information mash-ups (for both smartphone and personal-computer devices) through the design of an augmented-reality overlay which presents information-provenance and communication-integrity information in a manner optimised for human cognition, in order to build trust in the information they provide.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/I002588/1","grantId":"TS/I002588/1","fundValue":"289480","fundStart":"2011-01-26","fundEnd":"2011-10-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sadie  Creese","coPersons":["Michael  Goldsmith","Koen  Lamberts"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
