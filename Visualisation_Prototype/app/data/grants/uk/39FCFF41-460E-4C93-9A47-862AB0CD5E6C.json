{"id":"39FCFF41-460E-4C93-9A47-862AB0CD5E6C","title":"Stem and progenitor cells of the postnatal CNS","abstractText":"One of the big surprises in neurobiology recently has been the realization that there are pockets of stem cells in the adult brain that continuously generate new neurons throughout life, both in rodents and humans. The majority of ?adult-born? neurons populate the olfactory bulb (a brain structure required for recognition and memory of odors) and the hippocampus (an enigmatic structure involved in laying down memories of places and events). We are still in the dark about the precise role of the new neurons. Nevertheless, there is widespread excitement that, because stem cells can generate some types of neurons under normal conditions, they might have a wider potential to generate neurons to replace those that are lost through injury or neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson?s or Alzheimer?s. This is a challenging idea because, as far as we know, the stem cells do not normally make the kinds of neurons that are destroyed in these diseases. The question is, do they have the potential to make the neurons we want, if only we could learn how to ?tweak? them? \n\nWe and others recently discovered that there is not just one kind of stem cell in the healthy brain but several, possibly many, that have slightly different properties and that specialize in making different kinds of neurons in the olfactory bulb. This is encouraging because it implies that there might be yet more types of stem cells that we don?t know about yet, perhaps some with the properties we are looking for. On the other hand, it complicates the picture because we now have more cells to sort through. In the programme of work we describe here we make a start towards understanding the different behaviours we might expect from different stem cell subtypes when they are confronted with different forms of damage such as ischemia (interruption of blood supply such as occurs during stroke) or demyelination (loss of the insulating layer around nerve fibres, such as happens in multiple sclerosis) or in a genetic form of motor neuron disease (in which spinal motor neurons die, leading to paralysis. We will do this by genetically manipulating mice to mark one stem cell subtype or the other with a fluorescent label, so that we can follow their behaviour separately in the intact brain. The fluorescent label also allows us to purify and study them separately in a culture dish.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800575","grantId":"G0800575","fundValue":"1874630","fundStart":"2009-01-16","fundEnd":"2014-01-15","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"William David Richardson","coPersons":["Nicoletta  Kessaris"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
