Scarring plays a part in most of the major blinding conditions in the world today. It is also important in many lung, heart, kidney, intestinal, brain and skin conditions.\n\nThe group of eye diseases called glaucoma are the commonest cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and the commonest reason for an eye outpatient appointment. In glaucoma the nerve carrying vision to the brain gradually collapses. We treat glaucoma by lowering the eye pressure. We can create a new eye drainage channel. Unfortunately this fails due to scarring. In our recent long term surgery study, in patients who had minimal scarring with low pressures not one patient got worse over nearly a decade. In contrast if scarring was bad 24% got worse. The problem is we can only achieve this in 30% of people using an anticancer agent called 5-fluorouracil.\n\nWe have discovered that inhibiting enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases dramatically reduces scarring. When we inject this after glaucoma surgery we greatly reduce scarring, more than any anticancer agent we currently use. The problem is we have to inject the eye many times. We have now invented a way to make it into a tiny tablet which is painlessly placed into the operation area. This releases the drug at just the right level. A pilot study has shown this tablet is better than anything we currently have. The aim of this project is to scientifically develop the best shape and concentration of the tablet and then scale this up for human use and benefit.\n\nThis is being carried out by research groups at UCL Ophthalmology and the London School of Pharmacy, two groups with a world-class track record for developing new treatments. They are part of the new National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre which has been established to ?fast track? developments like this rapidly though to patient benefit and include the new NHS Pharmaceutical production facility at Moorfields Eye Hospital.\n\nIf successful, this new single tablet has the potential to considerably improve the treatment of glaucoma all over the world with fewer visits to clinic and prevention of blindness. There is great potential to improve the treatment of other diseases of the eye including macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, blinding retinopathy of premature children and other scarring problems in the human body.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801650","grantId":"G0801650","fundValue":"744263","fundStart":"2009-10-26","fundEnd":"2013-10-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peng Tee  Khaw","coPersons":["Stephen James Brocchini"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
