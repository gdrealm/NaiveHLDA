For stratified charge combustion the reactants are neither homogeneously mixed (premixed) nor completely separated (non- premixed). Thus the analysis of this kind of combustion has special modelling needs in comparison to fully premixed or fully non-premixed flames. Turbulent combustion in a stratified fuel-air mixture is highly relevant in the context of both spark-ignition gasoline and compression-ignition Diesel engines and has the potential for reducing fuel consumption especially at low-speed, light- load operations in automobile applications. Stratified-charge combustion can also be found in the Lean Premixed Prevaporised (LPP) combustors in aircraft gas turbines where fuel and injected secondary air form an inhomogeneous fuel-air mixture ahead of the flame front. The capability of predicting accurately the flame propagation behaviour in the presence of mixture inhomogeneities and intense turbulence would facilitate the development of low-emission, energy-efficient devices, such as automotive engines and gas-turbine combustors. The proposed research project consists of three parts. In the first, three-dimensional (3-D) Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) with simplified chemistry, appropriate for the combustion of realistic hydrocarbon fuels, will be performed for a variety of mixing fields and turbulence intensities to enhance the present state of fundamental understanding and to create a database for the assessment of existing combustion models and to develop new models wherever necessary. Three-dimensional DNS with a reasonable degree of detailed chemistry will be carried out based on the information gained from 3-D DNS with simplified chemistry. The second part of the project involves the development of a combustion model in the context of Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The model will be implemented with a view to future incorporation into industry-standard Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) packages, which can then be used for engineering design purposes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E026516/1","grantId":"EP/E026516/1","fundValue":"147093","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings of this project gave a thorough insight into the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) modelling of turbulent combustion of stratified mixtures using scalar dissipation rate approach. The new closures developed in this project are robust as they have gone through a detailed a-priori test for a range of different parameters. Apart from enriching the relevant field of research, the research outcomes provided high-fidelity simulation tools for simulating premixed turbulent combustion for Internal Combustion (IC) engine (e.g. modern Direct Injection engine) and gas turbine (e.g. Lean Premixed Prevaporised (LPP) technology) manufacturers (e.g. Ford, Rolls Royce and Siemens), which will contribute to the development of energy-efficient and environment-friendly devices and wealth generation in the future. This will give rise to considerable socio-economic impact. Moreover, this project gave rise to the development of a highly skilled professional with expertise of turbulence, combustion, Direct Numerical Simulation, parallel computing etc, who is going to contribute to UK industry and economy for years to come.

Development of a three_dimensional DNS database of freely statistically\n\nplanar turbulent flames propagating through stratified mixtures in different\n\nconfigurations [1,2] for different values of global mean equivalence ratio,\n\nroot_mean_square equivalence ratio, global Lewis number and turbulent\n\nvelocity fluctuations, integral length scales of turbulent velocity fluctuations\n\nand equivalence ratio fluctuations. This provides a wealth of important\n\ninformation, which can be used for the purpose of assessing existing models\n\nand develop new models in the context of RANS and LES. The database\n\ndeveloped during the course of this project will continue to be a very useful\n\nsource of information for gaining fundamental understanding and model\n\ndevelopment beyond the duration of this project.\n\n2. The performance of the existing algebraic models for scalar variances, covariances,\n\ndissipation rates and cross_dissipation rates have been assessed\n\nin detail based on a_priori analysis of DNS data [1]. The existing models that\n\nare the best suited for predicting the relevant quantities are identified and\n\nfor some quantities either new algebraic models were proposed or existing\n\nmodels were modified, when existing models were found to predict the\n\nquantities in question adequately. Transport equation based closure for\n\nsome quantities where algebraic models are found not to perform well [1].\n\n3. Models have been proposed for all the terms for the transport equations of\n\nfuel mass fraction variance [3,4], co_variance of fuel mass fraction and\n\nmixture fraction fluctuations [5,6], scalar dissipation rates of mixture\n\nfraction and fuel mass fraction [7_9] and the cross scalar dissipation rates of\n\nfuel mass fraction and mixture fraction fluctuations [10] in the context of\n\nRANS. The quantities such as variance, co_variance, scalar dissipation rate\n\nand cross_scalar dissipation rate play pivotal roles in the reaction rate\n\nclosure in turbulent combustion of stratified mixtures. The aforementioned\n\nmodelling activity aided by DNS data devised a coherent unified modelling\n\nmethodology which can be used for reaction rate closure both high and low\n\nDamkohler number conditions. This modelling exercise was also closely\n\nrelated to the modelling turbulent premixed combustion because it is a\n\nspecial case of turbulent stratified combustion modelling. As a result of this,\n\nsignificant advances in different aspects of scalar dissipation rate [11_16],\n\nFlame Surface Density (FSD) [17,18] and scalar flux [19_22] modelling of\n\nturbulent premixed flames.\n\n4. The statistics of flame propagation statistics in turbulent inhomogeneous\n\nmixtures have been studied in terms of displacement speed and its\n\ncomponents [2,23] and FSD based reaction rate closure has been extended\n\nfor turbulent combustion of stratified mixtures for both high and low\n\nDamkohler number conditions in the context of RANS. The possible\n\nextension of the RANS models for the purpose of LES is also identified [2,23].\n\n5. Identifying the strengths and limitations of the simplified models for\n\ncombustion (e.g. Multi_zone model) which are in use in analysing DNS data\n\nof localised ignition of thermally inhomogeneous mixtures, which is often\n\nrealized in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines.\n\n6. The newly developed models have been implemented in an industrystandard\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package so that they can then\n\nbe used for future engineering design purposes.\n\nIn addition, the models and findings have been shared with the Combustion\n\nResearch Group in Cambridge (especially with Profs. R. Stewart Cant, E.\n\nMastorakos and Dr. N. Swaminathan) who are also engaged in computational\n\nand experimental analysis of turbulent combustion of stratified mixtures.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n------------------\n\n1. S.P. Malkeson, N.

The major beneficiaries of this work are automotive engine and gas turbine manufacturers, who are engaged in developing new concepts for low-pollution and high-efficiency engines throughout the world. The design process of Direct Injection and Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition engines is limited by the lack of knowledge on turbulent stratified charge combustion, and predictive capability of combustion performance based on engineering CFD calculations. Ford and Lotus are mentioned as compression-ignition engine developers, and Rolls-Royce as a gas turbine manufacturer will have interest in the outcome of this work concerning the fundamentals of turbulent stratified charge combustion. However, the benefits are not limited to the above-mentioned UK manufacturers, as all automotive manufacturers have a program on HCCI engines and all gas turbine manufacturers are interested in LPP combustors. The relevant industrial partners were made aware of the developments that took place in this research during interactions at the aforementioned international conferences and UK based meetings (e.g. Meetings organised by the British Combustion Institute ). The present fundamental findings concerning turbulent stratified combustion will be of immediate value to all the industries mentioned above. Moreover, the project outcome will be directly beneficial to industries, as the developed model will be incorporated in commercial CFD software used by industry for a-posteriori analysis. 1.
