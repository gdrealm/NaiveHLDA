{"id":"BFEE9110-2FE9-4AA9-8B71-5C10CD6AD748","title":"Schooling Society - what role does schooling play in citizenship and cohesion in Europe in the 21st century?","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this project is to examine the different ways in which schooling influences the civic and political socialisation of young people in Europe in the 21st century. A key tenet of many academic theories and social policies is that schools play a key role in socialising future citizens into their roles in civic and political communities. Yet the role of the state in citizenship, education, and cohesion is being transformed as the myriad implications of globalisation, decentralisation, and migration take effect. This project therefore seeks to re-examine these long held assumptions and to re-assess the extent to which school policies and practices still have an impact on civic and political socialisation. Some of the questions that will be addressed include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Do countries with more centralised state school systems have higher levels of cohesion and civic engagement than countries which have more independent schools?</li>\n\n <li>Does placing more emphasis on national identity in education help to create a stronger sense of belonging and civic commitment?</li>\n\n <li>Does citizenship education increase support for democracy or a greater willingness to participate?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>This project will examine these questions from an inter-disciplinary and quantitative perspective, and using data from the 2009 ICCS study.</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001620/1","grantId":"ES/K001620/1","fundValue":"151607","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This grant has been transferred to the Institute of Education, where I am continuing to work on this research programme.
