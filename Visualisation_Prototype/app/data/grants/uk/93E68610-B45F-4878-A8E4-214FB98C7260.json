{"id":"93E68610-B45F-4878-A8E4-214FB98C7260","title":"PATT-Linked Grant for Travel and Subsistence 2012-2014","abstractText":"This is an application for a PATT-linked continuation grant to cover the travel and subsistence costs of observing runs carried out by staff at the Astrophysics Research Institute (ARI). The observing time is won in internationally competitive, peer-reviewed applications procedures. ARI staff carry out observational research programmes in a diverse range of astrophysics: star formation, the structure and content of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, active galactic nuclei, galaxy evolution, gamma-ray bursts, novae and supernovae. We currently have 22 active researchers, of whom 6 are regular users of STFC telescopes or other PATT-supported ground-based telescopes. We have followed current STFC guidlines and give full details of travel and subsistence for PATT observing runs over the last two years. Projected expenditure in the next two years will be dominated by two JCMT legacy surveys using SCUBA-2, one of which is LJMU-led, that have now begun and will run at least until September 2014.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K00185X/1","grantId":"ST/K00185X/1","fundValue":"25202","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Toby John Moore","coPersons":["Christopher Alfred Collins","MF  Bode"],"organisation":"Liverpool John Moores University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
