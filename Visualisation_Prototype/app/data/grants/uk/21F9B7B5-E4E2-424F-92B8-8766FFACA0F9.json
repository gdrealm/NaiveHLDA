High blood pressure affects at least 10 million people in the United Kingdom and is a major risk factor for stroke and heart attack. In spite of considerable improvements in treatment we still have a limited understanding of the inherited, or genetic factors, which may run through families and predispose to raised blood pressure. The MRC British Genetics of Hypertension (BRIGHT) study is a national collaboration with the aim of identifying the genes for high blood pressure, by using large scale family studies, undertaken with the help of the MRC General Practice Framework. The scientific tests we are using to map these genes for raised blood pressure are similar to looking for a needle buried in a haystack. Nevertheless, through the generosity of British families with high blood pressure and technological advances we believe we have a real chance of finding the genes that cause this disorder. The BRIGHT Study results suggest there are several areas of our genetic code that may be involved in elevating blood pressure. We are now seeking funding to investigate these further within the BRIGHT study families. We believe this resource will permit scientists to map the specific variations in genetic make-up that contribute to high blood pressure. By understanding these factors we may be able to develop new and better treatments for those with raised blood pressure and reduce strokes and heart attacks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9521010","grantId":"G9521010","fundValue":"5104250","fundStart":"1996-10-28","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Caulfield","coPersons":["Nilesh Jayantilal Samani","M  Brown","Nigel  Benjamin","Patricia  Munroe","Mark  Lathrop","David  Clayton","Martin  Farrall","John  Connell","John  Webster","Anna F Dominiczak"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
