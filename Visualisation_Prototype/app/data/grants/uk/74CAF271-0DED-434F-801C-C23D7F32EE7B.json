{"id":"74CAF271-0DED-434F-801C-C23D7F32EE7B","title":"Sustainability in the European Union's Container Ports Industry","abstractText":"<p>The research aims to study sustainable development strategies and policies in leading EU container ports in a multi-stakeholder environment and develop compatible criteria for the assessment of economic, social and environmental aspects of port based developments to ensure the sustainability of outcomes. The main methods to be used include conventional multi-criteria evaluation. More sophisticated techniques such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) are used to evaluate the overall performance of port sustainable development and complement multi-criteria evaluation. Both DEA and SFA are applied in a novel way in this research in the sense that both economic and environmental variables are simultaneously incorporated into the models for analysis, this indicates that in a single DEA or SFA model some output variables need to be maximized whilst other output variables need to be minimized. </p>\n\n<p>The outcome of the research will; 1) inform the EU and national governments about appropriate sustainable port development policies and strategies in a multi-stakeholder environment; and, 2) provide a useful tool to evaluate and analyse sustainable development strategies and polices in the container port industry for international organizations, national governments and port multi-stakeholders.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F000561/1","grantId":"ES/F000561/1","fundValue":"2626","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tengfei  Wang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
