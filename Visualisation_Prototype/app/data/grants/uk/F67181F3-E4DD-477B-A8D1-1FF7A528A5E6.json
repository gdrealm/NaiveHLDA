As most anxiety problems start in adolescence, we need more research investigating how and why some young people develop anxiety and how these causes can be targeted in early-life. Anxiety may arise because of a hyperactive fear system. The fear system is usually activated by danger, but it can also respond to situations that resemble, but are not actually dangerous. Learning to differentiate what is dangerous from what is safe is critical to understanding anxiety.</p>\n\n<p>This study investigates whether more anxious adolescents will show greater fear to threat cues (cues that signal a negative outcome) and also to safety cues (cues that are never paired with a negative outcome), to the general context in which a threat cue appears, and to threat cues even though they no longer reliably predict a negative outcome. It is expected that this profile of exaggerated fear will predict anxiety and threat beliefs 6 months later. Studying these questions in adolescence is important given that mental abilities and emotional skills change in this age range, with the potential to shape long-term emotional development.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-3203","grantId":"RES-062-23-3203","fundValue":"317110","fundStart":"2012-01-31","fundEnd":"2015-01-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer Yun Fai Lau","coPersons":["Robin  Murphy"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" We have conducted 5 studies investigating the role and plasticity of biased threat processing in anxiety problems during development. Our research questions and findings can be grouped under three themes:\n1. How difficulties in attention and learning during emotional contexts differentiates low-anxious from high-anxious individuals. Previous studies of anxious adults show that anxiety is characterised by an initial vigilance for threatening cues (where they turn their attention towards threatening cues), followed by avoidance (turning their attention away). There is some evidence that these attentional patterns may facilitate, among anxious adults, enhanced learning of what predicts these threatening outcomes. In three of our studies, we extend these findings to anxious adolescents. First, we show that compared to their non-anxious peers, anxious adolescents are poorer at threat-learning, struggling to discriminate whether it is the relevant background or specific cue that predicts a threatening outcome (study 2, manuscript under review). We show that difficulties in threat-learning may characterise girls more than boys, tentatively explaining why females show greater risk for anxiety problems (study 3, manuscript in preparation). In study 1 (published), we show that anxious adolescents are more avoidant of threatening cues. Putting these data together may suggest that attentional patterns of avoidance disrupt relevant learning of threat cues and threat outcomes. \n2. How fear responses to threat and safety signals can be dampened down in adolescents by teaching individuals how to re-appraise stimuli that are emotionally-ambiguous: Our previous work has shown that one of the associated features of poor threat-learning is that anxious adolescents generalise their fear of the threatening stimulus to a safe stimulus. To make matters worse, our previous work has also shown that anxious adolescents find it difficult to use more sophisticated appraisal strategies to regulate their emotions. In Study 4, we investigated whether a simple cognitive training script could teach adolescents how to re-interpret a stimulus or situation that seemed threatening but in actuality was safe, in a benign (non-threatening) way. We compared adolescents who had been assigned to the cognitive intervention to a control condition where adolescents were simply exposed to the threatening/safe stimuli over and over again in the absence of a threatening outcome. Our simple intervention significantly improved self-reported anxiety to the threatening and safe cues - compared to the control condition. \n3. How difficulties in the appraisal of stimuli to regulate emotions may be transmitted from mothers to their children: Our fifth study (currently being analysed) is investigating whether difficulties in re-appraising threatening/safe stimuli characterises pregnant women who are anxious - and whether this is a stable trait that affects the early psychosocial environment of their newborn infants. While the present ESRC grant has only funded three waves of data collection from the mothers (second trimester, third trimester, 1 month following birth), we intend to seek further funding for the follow-up of these babies - to investigate whether mother's appraisal style predicts threat-learning difficulties in infants. Our findings have increased the knowledge base on why some adolescents are more anxious than others, focusing particularly on the way that they attend to, learn from, and appraise threatening information. This knowledge will shape the development of novel interventions for targeting adolescent anxiety, and drive research into investigating the early origins of these threat-processing difficulties. More specifically, we have developed and piloted a cognitive script for enhancing the use of reappraisal strategies to inhibit fear towards threatening and safety cues. This cognitive script needs to be investigated further in clinically anxious adolescents. Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
