What were the different regions of the afterlife like as places? What should one do in order to increase the chances of going to heaven after one's death? Even if one had not led an entirely blameless life, was it still possible to make sufficient amends on one's deathbed in order to avoid hellfire and be sentenced to a spell in purgatory instead? My research is concerned with the ways in which late medieval believers were encouraged and instructed to go out of this world, both in their imaginations and on their actual deathbeds. \\n\\nI will be focusing on a number of highly influential devotional or pastoral treatises which teach techniques for meditation or dispense advice on preparing the sick and dying for their last hour. Over and above the detailed reading of the original sources, however, there are two points of fundamental significance that I want to make. The first concerns the relationship between words and vision. Long before the thirteenth century, imaginative contemplation of death and the afterlife was well-established as a spiritual exercise in monastic communities. Once, however, an ascetic practice that was hitherto grounded in the daily life of a community starts to be disseminated more widely in society through the medium of books, the verbal dimension assumes a new importance. Authors of 'how to meditate' exercises face the challenge of stimulating visions by means of words on the page. And certain old problems acquire renewed urgency, such as whether we should believe other people's verbal reports of things that normally transcend our capacity for sense-experience. The positions adopted by different authors in respect of these problems are various, and also often equivocal or precarious; what is beyond dispute, however, is that words are somehow always integral to late medieval visions of the afterlife. This point cannot be emphasized enough, because scholarship on medieval spirituality has tended to focus on the visual and the sensual dimensions at the expense of the verbal and conceptual.\\n\\nThe second point of wider significance concerns the impact of the Protestant Reformation. Luther's 'Sermon on preparing to die' of 1519 has been said to represent a radical break with the entire late medieval rite of passage for the dying. On a superficial level, this appears to be true. Luther expresses indifference to the traditional deathbed sacraments; above all, he dispenses with all the forms of words that traditionally accompanied the business of dying, and recommends that the dying person concentrate on a set of mental pictures instead. Yet if Luther's 'Sermon' is set in the context of other sources from both before and after the Reformation, it becomes plain that his radically inward 'imagistic' approach completely failed to supplant the late medieval word-based rituals for going out of this world. These continued to provide the basis for Protestant rites of passage (albeit with altered theological content) well into the second half of the sixteenth century. It is not my intention to deny that the Reformation made no fundamental difference to anything at all - that would be an untenably extreme position. The point is rather that the break with late medieval culture was not always sudden, and may have happened at different times in different domains. \\n \\nThe results of this research will be presented in a book ('Out of this world: words, vision and the afterlife in late medieval culture') whose theme will appeal to medievalists beyond the author's own background in German studies - to specialists of other medieval literatures, to historians of religious thought and devotion, to art historians.\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H003770/1","grantId":"AH/H003770/1","fundValue":"24843","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  No impact beyond academia, but this was never to be expected.

Since the time of the Desert Fathers, there had always been an ascetic strain in Christianity which cultivated penitence through constant recollection of the Last Things. In the thirteenth century, however, the practice of meditating on the themes of death, judgment, heaven, hell, and purgatory became more common outside the monastic way of life in which it had always been rooted. Moreover, the procedure for speculating on questions such as &amp;quot;What will happen when I die? What is the afterlife like?&amp;quot; came to be regulated by more explicit and directive norms. These norms were elaborated and transmitted through the medium of texts containing written regimens of eschatological meditation: instructions specifying when, how, and to what purpose the meditator is to remember his or her last end. Such regimens first appeared in handbooks of moral pedagogy written for the elite of lay society in the 1270s; they witnessed a truly wide dissemination during the later Middle Ages, and survived the religious upheavals of the early sixteenth century to become ingrained in the confessional cultures of Catholics and Protestants alike.\n\n\n\nOne aim of the research was to make important examples of regimens for meditating on death and the afterlife more widely known, and to show that a late medieval tradition did not come to an abrupt end with the Reformation. Some of the authors I researched were central figures in the history of religion and spirituality, though the aspects of their writings I was interested in have not been much studied. Other sources have only recently been edited, or still await a critical edition, meaning that there has been no sustained engagement with their contents and their rhetoric before now.\n\n\n\nMy principal object however was to understand meditative regimens as a phenomenon of textuality. Whereas in the monastic environment up to around 1200 the knowledge of meditation was, to use a term made current by Mary Carruthers, an orthopraxis, &amp;quot;a craft 'knowledge' which ... cannot even be set down in words [but] must be learned by practicing, over and over again&amp;quot; (The Craft of Thought, pp. 1-2), with the appearance of textual regimens devised for users who were either outside the monastic way of life, or not yet fully acculturated to its habitus, the procedures for meditation and the materials to meditate on necessarily had to be spelled out in words. This change, from a knowledge passed on in the practice to one disseminated and taught by how-to-do-it text, gave a new quality to the traditional cultivation of eschatological mindfulness, whose different facets require explication. The most important among these is the relationship between the rhetoric of the text and the state of mindfulness it is intended to induce in the meditator. That state, which is both mental and affective, may be realized in the medium of inner sense experience (so that the operative question is how words stimulate mental sensation and imagery), or it may be articulated as &amp;quot;inner textuality&amp;quot;, as words and sentences that the text causes the meditator to hear or speak, read or write, in the mind. Here, the focus is on the metaphors by which the texts describe their internalization and repetition--metaphors such as &amp;quot;writing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;imprinting&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;sealing&amp;quot; words on the heart.
