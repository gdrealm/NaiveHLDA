In part this is due to the production of oxygen and the consumption of carbon dioxide by very small, single celled organisms, which are referred to as the photosynthetic picoplankton. Marine cyanobacteria of the closely-related genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are the prokaryotic components of the photosynthetic picoplankton. Current and previous work in my lab has demonstrated that the in situ community structure of these organisms is fairly complex, with specific ecotypes or lineages occupying different niches to populate the world's oceans, allowing them to grow and photosynthesise under a broad range of environmental conditions. Whilst such molecular ecological studies can effectively map the spatial distributions of specific genotypes, the factors that dictate this global community structure are still poorly defined. This is important because changes in dominant picocyanobacterial lineages indicate major domain shifts in planktonic ecosystems and by observing and interpreting their distributions and physiological states we are essentially assessing changes in the rates of biogeochemical cycles. Athough the role of macronutrients, particularly N and P has received previous attention still there is a relative dearth of data on factors controlling picocyanobacterial community composition. Certainly, little if anything is known of the role of trace metals in this process. Thus, we hypothesise that in oceanic ecosystems genetically distinct picocyanobacteria are restricted to specific niches by their ability to acquire (limitation) or regulate trace metal accumulation (toxicity). In order to address this topic we propose to investigate trace metal (and macroelement) cell quotas in i) representatives of specific marine Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus lineages and to assess the affect of light stress and macronutrient shifts on these quotas and ii) in natural picophytoplankton assemblages using prior flow cytometric sorting, ICP-MS and X-ray microanalysis techniques. In so doing we will also obtain, for the first time, a real indication of picocyanobacterial cell physiological state over large spatial scales / in effect using elemental quotas as a proxy for what environment a given cell/population of cells is experiencing in situ / and hence can realistically begin to determine those macro and trace elements that are potentially depleted in situ and which are potentially restricting growth rate and/or yield.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F004249/1","grantId":"NE/F004249/1","fundValue":"348764","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This research is being used by researchers to specify the particular trace metals involved in key biogeochemical processes - particularly those novel enzymes now known to be important in key biosynthetic and degradative pathways for e.g. major greenhouse gases e.g. N-containing osmolytes, DMSP etc Environment Societal","person":"David John Scanlan","coPersons":["Claudia Andrea Blindauer"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" The oceans play a major role in determining the world's climate.

In order to address this topic we investigated trace metal (and macroelement) cell quotas in representative Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus lineages using prior flow cytometric sorting, ICP-MS and X-ray microanalysis techniques. We showed that elemental quotas for trace metals are exceedingly low but even more unexpected were the vanishingly low P quotas of natural picoplankton populations. By combining these physiological analyses of cell quotas with biochemical analysis of trace metal targets and molecular analysis of picocyanobacterial community structure we show that coastal Synechococcus strains have a metal intensive physiology (as evidenced by higher numbers of acquisition and storage mechanisms for trace metals in genomic data) compared to open ocean strains. Moreover, analysis of in situ population structure using a fine-scale genetic marker developed in the project identified dramatic population shifts between coastal (mesotrophic) and open ocean (oligotrophic) systems. Moreover, within the North Atlantic clear differences in population structure occurred within the Northern gyre suggesting the factors potentially dictating this structure (abiotic and biotic) clearly differ between oceanic regions that are physically very similar. Overall the technologies developed during the project and the results obtained provide new insights into the factors restricting growth rate and/or yield in these organisms across large spatial scales of the Atlantic Ocean. This research will be taken forward to specify the particular trace metals involved in key biogeochemical processes - particularly in those novel enzymes now known to be important in key biosynthetic and degradative pathways for e.g. major greenhouse gases e.g. N-containing osmolytes, DMSP etc Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
