We will develop methods for system design that allows adaptationion of network to changes in the available energy, as well as to the distribution of the energy within the network itself. The project will also develop novel vibration and thermal energy harvesters, and appropriate storage units.\n\nAll these aspects will be integrated into an overall practical wireless network test-bed to demonstrate and test the concepts studied in the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K017330/1","grantId":"EP/K017330/1","fundValue":"391320","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sami Erol  Gelenbe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
