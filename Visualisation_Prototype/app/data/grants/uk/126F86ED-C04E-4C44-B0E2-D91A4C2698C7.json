A broad range of inherited human diseases can be traced back to single proteins that do not fold correctly. A change in the genetic code results in a protein that is unable to reach the correct 3-dimensional structure necessary to function. Other disorders are associated with conditions within cells that are unsuitable for proteins in general to fold correctly. For those proteins that are secreted or expressed on the surface of cells, protein folding occurs in the intracellular compartment known as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Within the ER, each protein is evaluated by quality control mechanisms that decide whether it's folded correctly. When proteins misfold, a complex remediation scheme is engaged which removes those forms from the ER and destroys them. Collectively, this mechanism is known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). As cell surface and secreted proteins represent approximately 30% of all the human proteins made, distinguishing and degrading such a wide range of potentially misfolded proteins presents a significant challenge. ERAD uses a network of interconnected factors able to identify, target, deliver and degrade non-native proteins with various configurations. A central component in this scheme is the family of ubiquitin ligases embedded in the ER membrane. One example is Hrd1, which forms nexuses of ERAD activity by scaffolding different accessory factors on both sides of the ER membrane. This MRC project aims to characterise both the composition and organisation of Hrd1-containing complexes and to ascertain the contributions that the entire family of ER-resident ubiquitin ligases make to ERAD. \n The benefits of the proposed research will be to advance our understanding of how misfolded proteins are degraded in cells, and how this fundamental mechanism alleviates cellular stress that is the hallmark of many diseases. Our current view of ERAD has been based on a limited analysis of individual components and substrates. The proposed research aims to advance this picture by 1) characterising in detail, the functional Hrd1 complexes the carry out ERAD, 2) using a proven isolation strategy and mass spectrometry to characterise other ER-resident ubiquitin ligase complexes that participate in ERAD and 3) determining how cells use expression of the different ERAD components to respond to stress. As the number of diseases linked to protein misfolding grows, it is anticipated that the comprehensive analysis proposed here will advance our understanding of how these conditions may arise. Moreover, this study may help direct efforts to devise novel and alternative therapeutic strategies for the treatment of disorders of associated with protein misfolding and trafficking, such as cystic fibrosis and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L001209/1","grantId":"MR/L001209/1","fundValue":"314050","fundStart":"2014-01-31","fundEnd":"2017-01-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John C Christianson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
