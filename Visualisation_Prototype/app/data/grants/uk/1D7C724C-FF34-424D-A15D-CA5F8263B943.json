This research expands on previous research in three ways:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>It will address whether bilinguals' relative language dominance plays a role in their cognitive performance.</li> \n <li>It will expand the age ranges to younger ages, under 4-6 years of age.</li> \n <li>We will examine bilingualism across the lifespan in a homogeneous population, controlling for socio-economic or cultural differences.</li>\n</ol> \n<p>All of the participants will be tested for language abilities in Welsh and English, for cognitive abilities unrelated to executive control, and for cognitive and linguistic abilities dependent on executive control.&nbsp;We predict that the overall findings will be consistent with previous findings showing bilinguals' performance to be better than that of their monolingual peers; that we will be able to determine some &quot;outer boundaries&quot; to the bilingual advantage; and that we may be able to find this advantage in the very early pre-school years and lasting through the older adult years.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0175","grantId":"RES-062-23-0175","fundValue":"619880","fundStart":"2006-11-13","fundEnd":"2012-02-12","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Virginia Mueller Gathercole","coPersons":["Enlli Mon Thomas"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
