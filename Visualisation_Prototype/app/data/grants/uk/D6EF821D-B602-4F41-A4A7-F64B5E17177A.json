Many patients suffer kidney failure and require dialysis treatment as a result of their diabetes. The number of patients with diabetes is rising quickly. Although current treatments are helpful they are by no means perfect. This research seeks to examine the potential for C-peptide to act as an additional treatment for diabetes. C-peptide is released from the pancreas gland with insulin but has previously been thought to have no function. New information however suggests that C-peptide may in fact have important effects in kidney cells that may protect them against diabetes. This research will examine these cellular phenomena in kidney cells growing in culture and in rats with diabetes. It is hoped that the results may justify extending to clinical trials to human subjects with diabetes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500688","grantId":"G0500688","fundValue":"210333","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel John Brunskill","coPersons":["Gary Brian Willars"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
