Although the ECG provides a very useful immediate test often patients have to be admitted in order to be sure they are not having an MI. The diagnosis of MI is made by the release of cardiac proteins known as troponins. These proteins are released slowly into the blood and also disapear slowly from the blood. The consequence is that patients need to be kept in hospital for at least 12 hours to make sure troponins do not appear in their blood. Furthermore once they do appear, and a diagnosis of MI is made, it can be difficult to know if patients are having further MIs because the troponins stay elevated after the first MI. The purpose of this application is to determine if another cardiac protein, known as cardiac myosin binding protein C, is released more quickly and/or cleared more quickly than troponin.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000737","grantId":"G1000737","fundValue":"411632","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Stephen Marber","coPersons":["Manuel  Mayr"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
