{"id":"FD5D01C3-BC84-4389-95C6-DE4D36B74356","title":"Jackknife Methods of Estimation and Inference in Dynamic Econometric Models","abstractText":"Time series data in economics, finance and many other disciplines, are typically characterised by high degrees of correlation over time, and dynamic models that relate variables to their past values are in widespread use in the modelling and forecasting of such data. In samples of fixed size, however, estimators of the unknown parameters in such models are typically biased and can lead to misleading interpretations of the observed data and to inaccurate (and potentially costly) forecasts. The jackknife method of bias reduction was developed for use with random (uncorrelated) samples but, with suitable modifications, it can also be used with time series data; this research project will analyse and develop jackknife methods in dynamic models of the types used in both theoretical and empirical research in econometrics. In particular the research will analyse the performance of jackknife bias reduction methods in stationary and nonstationary time series models and evaluate their effects on related statistical hypothesis tests. The effectiveness of the jackknife with different estimation methods and on the accuracy of post-sample forecasts will also be explored. A combination of analytical statistical and econometric techniques will be used combined with appropriately designed computer simulations and applications to relevant data.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G010218/1","grantId":"ES/G010218/1","fundValue":"79862","fundStart":"2008-09-29","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marcus James  Chambers","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
