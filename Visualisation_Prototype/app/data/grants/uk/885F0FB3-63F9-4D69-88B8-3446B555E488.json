The standard therapy for prostate cancer aims to block the androgen receptor signalling pathway by removing its activating hormone, androgen from the circulation and/or blocking androgen action. However, most cancers become resistant to treatment and become refractory to hormone manipulation. The outlook for these patients is poor. \nA detailed functional analysis of the proteins that contribute towards signalling through the androgen receptor pathway should identify alternative, novel targets for treatment of this disease.\nIn this project we will focus on studying the enzymes that modify the function of proteins by directly attaching or removing a small protein called ubiquitin. Addition of ubiquitin, termed ubiquitination, or removal of ubiquitin from proteins, termed deubiquitination, are important events in regulating many of the functions of the androgen receptor. \nActivation of the androgen receptor is critical to all the stages of prostate cancer, including later stages of the disease when standard treatments are ineffective. We aim to identify those proteins implicated in androgen receptor ubiquitination and deubiquitination and further determine the importance of these proteins in androgen receptor action. Our ultimate hope is that we can disrupt the enzymatic action of these proteins using small molecule chemical inhibitors. In this way we may be able to provide alternative treatments for those prostate cancer patients who no longer respond to standard treatments.\nConsistent with our research Institute?s policy we will fully engage the wider public with our research findings through press communications, organised open days, school visits and attendance at charity events.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601123","grantId":"G0601123","fundValue":"350153","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Craig Nigel Robson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
