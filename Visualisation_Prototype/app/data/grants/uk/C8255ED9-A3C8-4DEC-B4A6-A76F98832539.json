{"id":"C8255ED9-A3C8-4DEC-B4A6-A76F98832539","title":"Degrees of Success: The Transition between VET and HE","abstractText":"<p>Increased participation in post-compulsory education is regarded by politicians as an important contribution to equal educational opportunities. However, international studies have shown that not all upper secondary education, particularly vocational education and training (VET), leads to improved educational opportunities.</p> \n<p>This project investigates the transition processes between vocational and higher education (HE). The project will analyse a number of existing datasets, most importantly HE access data provided by UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service)&nbsp;and HE participation data from HESA (Higher Education Statistics Agency). The resulting map of the landscape of transition will then be further investigated using a focused research design looking at the learning experiences of young people who have made the transition from VET to HE. Factors affecting their transition processes will be identified and their perceptions of HE learning environments will be investigated.</p> \n<p>These two parts of the project are supplemented by User Forums bringing together practitioners in HE and VET. These Forums have a twofold role: firstly, they will be used to discuss and disseminate the findings of the project to make them relevant to the widening participation agenda. Secondly, the User Forums will refine the project's research questions and develop new tasks for the quantitative and the qualitative part of the project.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-139-25-0238","grantId":"RES-139-25-0238","fundValue":"282573","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey  Hayward","coPersons":["Hubert  Ertl"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
