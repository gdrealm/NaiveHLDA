This is in keeping with a body of research demonstrating the relationship between innovation, breaking out of safe, traditional or limiting paradigms of thought and upsetting norms.\n \nWe use gentle disruption, here, as the basis for co-design, researching how we might extend this potentially broad and valuable approach from conventional artist- or designer-led practice into what the Design Council has called 'collective thinking and designing that addresses a community's issues' (www.design council.org.uk/resources-and-events/designers/design-glossary/co-design/); to inspire group-based designerly thinking; and to fuel new conceptual tools for generating creative accord in action contexts. In this way, it will advance understanding in the field of co-creation and the tools that can facilitate it.\n\nThe first phase of this proposal involves a process which brings several groups together to explore common ground in making community action effective. We will stage two events, the first around existing knowledge; the second developing these insights into collaborative innovation. Both will feature creative works by the three participating groups, which are being commissioned to elicit a theme of interest to all and to continue a weaving process that involves all partners as active co-workers in identifying and building on a joint focus. These creative works give space for reflection through collaborative activity and present each group's perspective so that others can react to it. \n\nThe second part of the proposal hints at what might come out of this process, and which aspects of the reflection that underpins the first phase might be incorporated in continuing the work together. As the point of phase one is to determine collaboratively - between university and community researchers - what the research question in the second phase will be, there is little to say about content, but phase two will contrast in form from phase one in that it will seek to answer a particular question rather than stimulate reflection per se.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K006622/1","grantId":"AH/K006622/1","fundValue":"99487","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  So far, they have been given back to the communities from which they were drawn in a series of launches and it is early days.

What inversions and subversions take place when one looks at the places and practices that inspire people enough to act? How does reverence (and, by extension, irreverence) play out in supporting, protecting or requesting the community resources we want in our futures? \n\nA mixed team of community and academic researchers worked together at each stage of the project, co-designing outputs and agreeing a protocol for speaking about what was produced, which recognises this symmetry of access to and responsibility for the project. \n\nDrawing on material produced at two internal events and three regional events, we identified themes of play, gentleness, enchantment, orality and trust, and explored how they informed social action. \n\nThis culminated in the final output, Everyday Disruptions, a book of multiple voices with removable tokens and linked electronic folder, edited through consensus and designed to support other activists and change-makers in reflecting on their motivations and means to sustain themselves in the often long and difficult business of effecting change. The book is a viral manifestation of the findings of the project about the need for stimulus and sustenance. The gentle disruption methodology pushes co-design into new directions, which are particularly effective for the meeting and melding of heterogeneous groups. \n\nThe insights into social action and how it is supported could now be taken further into making objects and processes to sustain communities in their undertakings to bring about, channel or prevent change.
