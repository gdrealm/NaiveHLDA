Yet, the underpinning technology for the generation and detection of radiation in this spectral range remains severely limited, being based principally on Ti:sapphire (femtosecond) pulsed laser and photoconductive detector technology, the THz equivalent of the spark transmitter and coherer receiver for radio signals. The THz frequency range therefore does not benefit from the coherent techniques routinely used at microwave/optical frequencies. Our programme grant will address this. We have recently demonstrated optical communications technology-based techniques for the generation of high spectral purity continuous wave THz signals at UCL, together with state-of-the-art THz quantum cascade laser (QCL) technology at Cambridge/Leeds. We will bring together these internationally-leading researchers to create coherent systems across the entire THz spectrum. These will be exploited both for fundamental science (e.g. the study of nanostructured and mesoscopic electron systems) and for applications including short-range high-data-rate wireless communications, information processing, materials detection and high resolution imaging in three dimensions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J017671/1","grantId":"EP/J017671/1","fundValue":"6568980","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alwyn  Seeds","coPersons":["Edmund Harold  Linfield","David  Ritchie","Alexander Giles Davies","Gabriel  Aeppli","Cyril  Renaud","Oleg  Mitrofanov","Michael  Pepper"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
