{"id":"B30BF692-BEA4-407D-9019-F6C70ED72F77","title":"CSF1R in homeostasis and immunity","abstractText":"The sequence of DNA in the genome of a mammal such as a mouse or a human contains a code that specifies the way that a body develops and grows. Specialised types of cells use only parts of the genome to generate their function; for example a red blood cell must produce the proteins (globin) that are needed to carry oxygen, where these proteins are not needed in the liver. This project is concerned with deciphering the code within DNA that ensures that the genes that code for particular products are produced in the right place at the right time. It deals specifically with a model gene, the CSF1R gene, which is needed for the production and function of large white blood cells called macrophages. The only we can dissect the function of individual elements of the code is to remove them from the genome. In this project we will use mouse transgenic technologies to determine what happens to CSF1R is we take out part of the code that controls where and when it is produced. The second part of the project applies the tools generated to determine the function of macrophages. These cells are found in every organ in the body. They are part of the body's defense against infections, but they also contribute to repair and regeneration. Their function is controlled by the CSF1R gene, and we are developing therapies that target that gene. The mouse models will enable us to identify and test new therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M019969/1","grantId":"MR/M019969/1","fundValue":"819116","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Arthur Hume","coPersons":["Peter  Hohenstein","Neil Andrew Mabbott"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
