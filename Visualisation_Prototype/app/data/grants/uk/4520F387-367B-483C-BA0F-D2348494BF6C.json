The research facilities of the Prof. Carole Perry's Biomolecular &amp; Materials Interface\nResearch Group will be utilised in addition to the facilities within the School of Science and Technology to support the\ndevelopment of the materials for commercial exploitation. As required, materials will be analysed to ensure that they meet\nthe requirements for proposed pharmaceutical and healthcare applications (e.g. British Pharmacopeia).\nMaterial Collection and Pre-Processing\n1. Evaluation/development of continuous collection methodologies, including:\nDetermination of variation in process critical factors such as organic content, water content, albumin and yolk\ncontamination of collected material, particle sizing.\nOptimise transit and pre-processing stabilisation of raw material (storage time limits, temperature limits, concentration of\nstorage solution).\n2. Evaluation/development of initial processing approaches:\nDetermine particle sizing resulting from different milling parameters (time, initial water content, milling speed) and develop\noptimised milling parameters and QC methodology.\nDetermine powder properties resulting from different drying parameters (time, initial water content, drying speed) and develop optimised drying parameters and QC methodology.\nDetermine and check specification of processing raw materials e.g. site water supply, base and alcohol (trace metals\ncontent, elemental profile and purity) and develop QC methodology for raw materials.\nAnalytical services to determine effectiveness of initial processing output (testing to British Pharmacopeia grade CaCO3).\nPrimary Processing\nIterative evaluation of different continuous processing approaches, conditions and materials\n3. Evaluation of the influence of processing variables on process output:\nProcess; NaOH concentration, alcohol concentration/type (ethanol or isopropanol), position of milling in process (before,\nduring or after).\nProcess conditions; temperature, volume of treatment: mass of feed material ratio, time and mixing rate.\nMaterials; continuous monitoring of starting materials and end product in relation to the desired specification (testing to\nBritish Pharmacopeia grade CaCO3). In addition intermediate stages in the process and the extent to which raw materials\ncan be recycled in the process will be monitored/evaluated as necessary.\nQC methodology will be developed for the process.\nSecondary Processing - Agglomeration\nIterative evaluation of different continuous agglomeration approaches\n4. Evaluating the influence of processing variables on the agglomeration process:\nInfluence of processing on particle/agglomerate size including coating thickness and structure from the atomic\n(crystallography) through to micro and macroscopic scales (microscopy) including particle and coating porosity.\nOrganic content of particles, influence on formulation pH and general composition (chemical and elemental [e.g. Fe, Al, Pb,\nAs, Cd, Hg and total heavy metals] analysis, purity of calcium carbonate, moisture content) using relevant analytical,\nmicroscopic and spectroscopy methods.\nDetermine material compliance to any relevant regulatory standards pre and post-agglomeration.\nComparative studies will be conducted with at least 3 competitor materials.\nCombination of process steps to demonstrate process complementarity\nNTU will support AvGo in evaluating the process developed to date though analytical testing of product output to check\nconformity, e.g. testing to British Pharmacopeia grade CaCO3, and providing guidance in the event of any compliance\nissues detected.\nNTU will also assist in consolidation of process operations, evaluating opportunities to file for new intellectual property and\ncomposition of the final project report.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508950/1","grantId":"EP/N508950/1","fundValue":"147204","fundStart":"2016-01-31","fundEnd":"2017-07-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Carole  Perry","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Nottingham Trent University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
