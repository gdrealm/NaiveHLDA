{"id":"4339E430-EAE4-4B23-89BC-B978D492CE92","title":"DYD-RCT: On-line randomised controlled trial of an interactive web-based intervention for reducing alcohol consumption","abstractText":"We are investigating whether a website (Down Your Drink) can help heavy drinkers drink less alcohol. It is estimated that around 7.1 million people in England aged 16 - 64 (26% of the population) are drinking over the recommended safe levels. Although treatments do exist, there are many people in need of treatment that do not have access to it.\n\nSome studies have found the use of websites for people with long-term conditions (such as heart disease) to be associated with improved knowledge, confidence, social support, health behaviours and clinical outcomes. Internet interventions are popular with users, as they are convenient (can be used at any time of day or night), accessible (can be used by anyone with Internet access), anonymous and confidential. They can be revisited as often as wanted, which may help to change behaviour and prevent relapse.\n\nWe have updated the existing Down Your Drink website inline with user feedback and research findings on user requirements of Internet interventions. To find out what features of Down Your Drink are responsible for changing behaviour, if any, our participants have access to different areas of the website. We hope to make Down Your Drink freely available in December 2009.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501298","grantId":"G0501298","fundValue":"334101","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul George Wallace","coPersons":["Simon  Thompson","Elizabeth  Murray","James  McCambridge","Stuart  Linke","Christine  Godfrey"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
