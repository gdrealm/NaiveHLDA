These conversations between academics, design SMEs and the national heritage agencies will provide opportunities to narrate accounts of how design focussed SMEs have been able or inhibited from engaging with innovation in relation to heritage, how those agencies which influence regulation and governance are engaging with design sector, and how together they understand the role and value of design in relation to heritage. \n\nOur starting point is that while design is widely recognised in novel urban forms (buildings, public spaces etc) that meet future needs, it is less well recognised in conserving selected heritage that integrates with new and extended places. Still less attention has been given to opportunities for innovation to make the vast majority of the existing urban fabric smarter for the future. By bringing together those involved in valuing heritage and design into directed conversation, this project will not only highlight stories of success where design SMEs have been able to create value but also provide a deeper understanding of some of the constraints which hold back others from achieving such success.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L013983/1","grantId":"AH/L013983/1","fundValue":"39600","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Rogerson","coPersons":["Cathy  Treadaway","Julian  Malins","James Simon Ritson","Judith  Farren Bradley"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
