Thus the project contributed to the current efforts to address pressing societal/economic needs for increased capacity and better future workforce in mathematics-related professions. \n\nImproving mathematics teachers' professional practice through collaborative research:\no The project was carried out collaboratively with two secondary mathematics teachers and was designed in a way that promoted professional reflection and development. Evidence from the project showed lasting impact on the professional thinking/practice of the participating teachers, and also spread of this thinking/practice to colleagues in their school. Furthermore, the project has contributed already to the career advancement of one of the participating teachers: the teacher's work in the project featured prominently in her successful application for Advanced Skills Teacher status.\n\nImproving mathematics teachers' professional practice through wider dissemination:\no The project has reached professional audiences through a range of dissemination activities in England and abroad, communicating its research findings in forms that are tailored to the needs of teachers, policy makers, and curriculum developers. One project output, a publication in a practitioner journal, has been found particularly helpful by groups of mathematics teachers as well as projects and initial teacher education courses that aim to develop highly skilled mathematics teachers.

Proficiency in proof can provide students with a basis for deep learning in mathematics and prepare them for advanced mathematical studies. Yet, even high-attaining secondary students face serious difficulties with proof and prior research offered little guidance about how teachers can help students overcome these difficulties.\n\nThe project took a step towards addressing this problem. Organised as a design experiment in two secondary mathematics classes over a period of two years (when the students were in Years 10 and 11), it aimed to generate theoretical and practical knowledge about how secondary teachers can better support students’ learning of proof. The project focused on high-attaining students: given the limited prior research knowledge about how to improve students’ understanding of proof, it was strategic to focus, as a first step in a long-term research programme, on a student population that offered better chances for success.\n\nThe project showed the feasibility of the goal to develop high-attaining secondary students’ proof competencies and identified the generation and resolution of ‘cognitive conflicts’ as a key contributive factor to that development. There was also evidence that the students who participated in the project achieved better GCSE results and were more likely to pursue advanced mathematical studies than previous student cohorts in the same school. - The lesson sequences developed by the project can inform curriculum development and can thus be used by teachers, textbook authors, or policy makers who are interested in how proof can be incorporated into the secondary school mathematics curriculum.\n- Researchers can use the findings of the project as a springboard for further investigation of issues of proof in school mathematics. For example, the innovative practice created in the participating classrooms calls for research that would explore what might take to scale up this practice. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
