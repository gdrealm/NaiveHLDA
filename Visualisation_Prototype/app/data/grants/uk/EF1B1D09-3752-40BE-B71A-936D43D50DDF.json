Through a fusion of the study of online search behaviour of consumers (Google UK) and online citizens (social scientists), it will be possible to gain a richer understanding of the nature of online behaviour. As the speed and mode of online information delivery continue to develop at astonishing rates, a clearer understanding of how to measure, analyse and comprehend online behaviour is of paramount important for corporations and governments alike.</p>\n\n<p>The aims and objectives of the project are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>summarise and present to Google UK analysts relevant research in the social sciences on online search</li>\n\n <li>explore possibilities with Google analysts on how search information can be used by social-science researchers via Google Analytics tools</li>\n\n <li>define collaboratively key societal challenges in understanding the role of search for citizen and consumer</li>\n\n <li>identify collaboratively possible methodologies, research hypotheses and research design ideas for the challenges identified</li>\n\n <li>establish an academic network to exchange information with Google UK.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-192-22-0134","grantId":"RES-192-22-0134","fundValue":"9400","fundStart":"2011-05-16","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Oates","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
