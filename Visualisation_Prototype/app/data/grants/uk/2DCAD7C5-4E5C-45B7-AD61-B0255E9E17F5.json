To tackle the global threat and self dependency on fossil fuels, renewable energy such as solar, wind, wave and biomass gives the pathways to reduce the overall CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. This project addresses the issues related to integrated solar photovoltaic system - converting incoming solar energy into electricity and biomass power technologies - generation of electrical power from waste materials, for rural electrification. \nThis project seeks to develop a new class of solar photovoltaic technologies - Concentrating Photovoltaic (CPV) to integrate with Biomass and waste power generation as a backup source and develop high efficiency hydrogen generation and storage from the integrated systems. The integrated system will be installed at Uttar Sehalai Tribal Hamlet, located in a remote village, 200km west of Calcutta for rural electrification with key focuses on satellite based remote monitoring technologies. The village comprised of 80 households and has a population of approximately 400. It is located very close to Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan (a probable World Heritage Site). \nThe scalable prototype developed in this project will be the first ever such integrated system (Biomass, CPV and Hydrogen) for the provision of electricity that will be installed in India. Due to the lack of electricity in the village, the major fuels currently used are kerosene, firewood and wood based raw coal. Most of the nearby villages are also without any grid connections and as a result, children from the poorer families do not have the motivation and necessary resources to take advantage of basic education and health. Many of them that start schooling are forced to discontinue their studies due to the need to work to provide for their families. Availability of energy is a critical driving factor in economic development, while limited fossil fuel resources and environmental hazards drive the need for sustainable and environmental friendly solutions based on renewable energy. Thus, the project will brings together Biomass, Concentrating Photovoltaic, and Hydrogen Generation and Storage expertise from University of Leeds, Heriot-Watt University, University of Nottingham in the UK and Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, PSG College of Technology in India with the goal of developing a low cost autonomous power generating system for rural electrification.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J000345/1","grantId":"EP/J000345/1","fundValue":"1401640","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Given the threat posed by global warming, it is accepted widely that the potential photovoltaic renewable energy can be realised by (i) increasing their efficiencies, thus making them more viable; and at the same time to giving effective attention to minimising and (ii) using the heat generated in addition to electrical energy. Currently PV cells convert only typically 15 to 18% of the solar radiation into electricity, while the rest of the available energy is lost as heat or reflection. A key barrier to the widespread adoption of photovoltaics is achieving economic viability and reducing losses that occur due to increased temperature. One route towards enhanced efficiency is the use of a solar concentrator, as the area of the expensive photovoltaic cells can then be is reduced. Production of greater output per unit solar cell area can be achieved when solar radiation is concentrated on the photovoltaic via low cost reflecting/refracting materials. Many conceptual practical design, operation and control issues require further research to determine the most successful means by which solar concentration can be deployed for photovoltaics.\n\nOne innovative approach has been used in this project is to use the low concentration 3-d compound parabolic reflectors which enable the capture of a large part of the diffuse solar radiation in addition to the direct component. The focus of this research was to develop a solar concentrator which is compact, static, translucent and, at the same time, able to collect maximum solar energy. A novel geometry of a 3-D static concentrator has been designed and coined the Square Elliptical Hyperboloid (SEH) to be integrated in glazing windows or facades for photovoltaic application. The SEH concentrator is optically optimised for different incident angles of the incoming light. The optimised SEH concentrators are obtained by investigating their different non-dimensional parameters such as major axis over minor axis of the elliptical entry and the height over side of the exit aperture. Evaluating the best combination of the optical efficiency and the acceptance angle, results confirm that the 4x SEH built from dielectric material, working with total internal reflection, is found to have a constant optical efficiency of 40% for an acceptance angle equal to 120 degree (-60, +60 degree). This enables capture of the sun rays all day long from both direct beam light and diffuse light making it highly suitable for use in northern European countries. A higher optical efficiency of 70% is obtained for different dimensions of the SEH; however, the acceptance angle is only 50 degree. The optimised SEH concentrator has been manufactured and tested indoor and outdoor conditions at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh; the experimental results show an agreement with the simulation results thus validating the optical, electrical and thermal model. In addition, a heat exchanger was designed and integrated with the rear of SHE system to investigate combined photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) use. Series of incident solar radiation intensity and fluid flow conditions revealed that use of PV/T for SEH system enables to increase overall efficiency by reducing the solar cell operating temperatures. This research produced seven peer reviewed journal article (four in press and three are review ongoing), six conference article and one book chapter.
