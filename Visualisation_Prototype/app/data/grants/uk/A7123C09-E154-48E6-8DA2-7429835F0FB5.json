In current experiments entanglement of the qubits, represented by long lived internal atomic states, is achieved via quantum control of the (collective) motion of the ion crystal. Instead, we propose an unprecedented experimental program supported by theory, where the huge dipole moments associated with Rydberg excited ions are the basis of extremely strong spin-dependent long range interactions, and thus exceptionally fast entangling operations as basic building blocks for quantum computing and quantum simulation. While in the short term the fundamental questions to be explored are the understanding of Rydberg excitation and dynamics of single and multiple ions stored in linear Paul traps, and the various ways of manipulating this dynamics with external electromagnetic fields, the long term promise of this project is a potentially scalable very fast ion trap quantum processor, and in particular also a novel efficient quantum simulator of spin models, for Heisenberg type interactions to exotic matter with topological phases. A main experimental challenge is the requirement of a coherent light source near 122nm for the ion Rydberg excitation. Our consortium is in the remarkable and unique situation where in a single laboratory both these coherent light sources as well as advanced ion quantum computing setups are available, thus allowing us to explore this extremely promising new frontier of Rydberg ion quantum information processing on a comparatively short time scale. The planned experiments will be based on the well established techniques of ion trapping, quantum state detection and manipulation with laser fields. An adapted quantum shelving method is proposed to detect transitions to Rydberg states with unity detection efficiency on individual ions even in large crystals. Initially we will accurately determine energy levels and atomic properties of ion Rydberg states, and then we aim for mutual Rydberg state interactions of adjacent ions. Such gate interactions, Rydberg induced quantum phase transitions and a full tomography of the resulting quantum state benefit from the highly developed schemes in quantum information processing. In the future, beyond the experimental horizon of the three-year project, fast Rydberg ion quantum logic operations could possibly be combined with the conventional gate schemes and modern ion trap technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J007854/1","grantId":"EP/J007854/1","fundValue":"225543","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This is basic research and the findings have impact on the current developments of research on atoms in highly excited states.

In current state of the art experiments entanglement of qubits, represented by long lived internal atomic states, is achieved via quantum control of the collective vibrational motion of the ions forming cold crystals. While this method works reliably for small ion crystals it is a current challenge to extend this approach to large ensembles of ions required for large scale quantum information processing and quantum simulation.\n\nThe aim of the project was to explore a novel idea for overcoming this problem. We have conducted an unprecedented experimental program supported by theory, where the huge dipole moments associated with ions excited to high-lying Rydberg states are the basis of extremely strong and long-ranged interactions. \n\nWe have broken new theoretical and experimental ground in the understanding of highly excited electronic states of trapped ions. From the theoretical side we have devised new protocolls for the processing of quantum information which permits the implementation of a parallel quantum processor. From the experimental side we have implemented novel ion trapping and laser excitation techniques. Here we could demonstrate for the first time the excitation of a trapped ion to a high-lying electronic Rydberg state. The findings are important for the research of other groups that aim at harnessing the power of excited ionic states for quantum information processing and quantum simulation. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
