Bacterial membrane proteins are essential for antibiotic resistance since they are involved in the export of the drugs from the cell. These proteins are usually embedded in oil like environment making them very difficult to work with. We first need to isolate them from the membrane using lipid mimics such as detergents. Membrane proteins usually have many functions and bacteria have developed mechanisms to utilise them in order to extrude antibiotics through these proteins. Understanding the structure and function of these important biological molecules will contribute to the understanding of the relationship between membrane protein and substrate recognition and provide valuable information to structural biology and pharmacology. In order to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of these proteins we need to grow crystals and expose them to X-rays in order to obtain the molecular structure. We have obtained such crystals of a bacterial membrane protein antibiotic transporter. The structural information of this membrane protein will provide an important insight on the binding and recognition of antibiotics from this new family of proteins. We are also going to understand the biochemistry of this protein in the presence of antibiotics. Having all these information, the structure and biochemical analysis, will have pharmacological importance since it will allow the development of novel antibiotics that can fight bacterial resistance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H01778X/1","grantId":"BB/H01778X/1","fundValue":"360027","fundStart":"2010-10-18","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Konstantinos  Beis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" From kinetic data of the transporter in the presence of antibacterial peptides, we have determined the transport rates of the antibacterial peptides from the transporter and have also worked out how the transporter is energesised. This is a very significant finding for the family of proteins. We have also shown that the transporter is proton driven and have determined its affinity for the antibacterial peptides. We have also solved the low resolution structure by EM. We also solved the high resolution structure of two membrane proteins involved in the transport of antibacterial peptides. Our functional data can be utilised by other academics to study similar systems. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
