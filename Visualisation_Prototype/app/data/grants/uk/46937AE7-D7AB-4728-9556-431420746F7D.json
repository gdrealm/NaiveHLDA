{"id":"46937AE7-D7AB-4728-9556-431420746F7D","title":"Bacterial dynamin: cellular function and molecular mechanism","abstractText":"We have previously identified a molecule in a number of common bacteria that was thought to only exist in the cells of higher organisms such as yeasts, plants and animals, as well as humans. The molecule is involved in the shaping of the lipid membranes that engulf all living cells and that also form internal compartments inside some cells. Our finding re-emphasises the evolutionary link between all living organisms and opens up questions regarding the origins of processes that are very important to our brains, such as neurotransmitter uptake. It seems, that parts of these processes have already been invented by bacteria earlier. In the current proposal, we aim to eclucidate the exact molecular mechanism of thse membrane-shaping molecules using the bacterial versions. This is required since the human versions have proved to difficult to work with over recent years. An exact understanding will eventually make it possible to understand why, under certain circumstances, things go wrong and diseases develop. Apart from this, knowledge of what bacteria do with these molecules without having a brain or indeed intracellular organelles will be interesting.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F006284/1","grantId":"BB/F006284/1","fundValue":"322357","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Published in scientific journal  ","person":"Jan  Lowe","coPersons":["Linda Ann Amos"],"organisation":"MRC Centre Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
