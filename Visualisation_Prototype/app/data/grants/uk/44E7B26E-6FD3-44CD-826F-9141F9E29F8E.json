From the very beginning of this phenomenon, popular literature has been one of the key media for the circulation of texts and images from one country to another. Despite the need to address such crucial aspects of modern society, studies on the history of the transnational dimension of popular culture have only recently started to appear. Previous attempts, however, have always been confronted with the problem of dealing with an immense amount of data. The proposed project intends to address the question of how to conduct surveys of this production through the use of dedicated digital tools. Thanks to the database created by the Popular Literature and Media Culture association (LPCM), and the collaboration with the European Library, three research teams from the Universities of Belfast, Limoges and Debrecen will be able to harvest the catalogues of the 48 European national libraries and to analyse the transnational dimension of popular fiction with the help of maps and graphs.\nThe present proposal builds on 5 years of collaborative work carried out by an established network of European universities. In 2008, an international and interdisciplinary group of scholars received funding from the European Commission's Culture Programme for a ground-breaking initiative entitled EPOP: Popular Roots of European Culture through Film, Comics and Serial Literature (1850-1930). In 2011, this group gave birth to the LPCM, currently involving researchers from 15 countries, in Europe and beyond. In 2012-2013, to support the initiatives of the LPCM with an innovative research and networking tool, the IT Services of the University of Limoges developed the database at the core of the project.\nA major objective of the planned activities is to verify the possibility of using the database to establish collaboration with non-academic institutions such as national and specialised libraries. In addition to the important relationship with the European Library, the project involves a close collaboration with the Library of Crime Literature (Bilipo) a Parisian public library exclusively concerned with crime-themed publications. The researchers involved in the project will work together with the staff of the library to assist them in using the database as a tool to better organize and study their own collection and to promote its contents through virtual exhibitions.\nCrime fiction has been chosen as a case study to test the potential of the database and to develop additional search, organisational and visualization tools that are able to answer the participants' research questions. By harvesting the European Library's repositories, the three research teams, all trained by specialists of this literary genre, will look at how crime novels have been held and catalogued throughout the twentieth century in a number of European countries. Research will be focused on the comparison of the different (trans-)national corpora to emerge from this survey, and to discuss how to use geomatic and statistical approaches to analyse and visualise the collected data. Established accounts of the history of the genre will be challenged through a quantitative perspective whose aim in particular is to stress the lack of transnational studies.\nOther outputs include: two workshops and a conference to disseminate the research results; a special issue of the peer-reviewed journal Belph&eacute;gor, that will include a selection of the conference papers; two virtual exhibitions; a series of public events, with the participation of several European authors of crime fiction; the submission of a grant application to the AHRC or the ERC to expand the implementation of the technical instruments, and to make them accessible to researchers working on other corpora in all areas of literary studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L010283/1","grantId":"AH/L010283/1","fundValue":"80006","fundStart":"2014-01-23","fundEnd":"2015-04-22","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  It is certainly early days to assess how broadly our findings have been used, as the project is still on going and many of the findings are still being developed. The main source of use so far has been, predictably within our consortium and large network of partners within the international crime Fiction research group we have created simultaneously with the AHRC grant application. For example, scholars previously engaged largely in monographical or comparative approaches have embraced a quantitative one, based on our digital resources. For example' Sandor Kalai's paper on Hungarian Crime Fiction is based on the harvesting and use of Zotero applied to Hungarian collections; Pepper's paper on international Mafias is based on our digitalization of the BILIPO catalogue and of the BILIPO resource Les Crimes de l'annee Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural","person":"Dominique François JEANNEROD","coPersons":["Federico  Pagello","Natacha  Levet","Anna  Keszeg","Andrew  Pepper","Loïc  ARTIAGA","Kálai  Sándor"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" We have discovered some limits in the original database model and the harvesting process has proved more onerous than anticipated. But we have, on the other hand, developed new plugins and tools to palliate this difficulties and created instruments of enhanced visualisation. The research funded on this grant has enabled for the first time to show consistently the benefits of a digital turn applied to the study of large international corpora in popular literature. It has allowed to envision continuities, historical and transnational links and solidarities, common themes and patterns, and to illustrate their interdependencies in an optimised way. Heuristically, it has revealed structures in European exchanges in crime fiction, and has brought to light collections long hidden and forgotten. Pedagogically, this visualisation has improved the understanding of this publishing and multimedia phenomenon in the 20th Century. Our developed tools and apps might be used by the research community in general, and for anyone interests in bibliographic records. It will be of special use for the management and valorisation of collections in dedicated archives, libraries and Museums. \nIt can serve as a teaching resource, in the classroom and online Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
