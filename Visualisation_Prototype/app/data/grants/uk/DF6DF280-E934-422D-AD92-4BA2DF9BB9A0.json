The automation of key processes in the banking, characterisation and quality control of stem cell lines, intended as starting materials for research and development of cellular therapies, will generate significant improvements in the speed and quality of cell banking and testing. These increased efficiencies will be focused mainly in the area of staff &quot;contact time&quot; where automation of some banking functions and reduction in sample preparation time for QC and research will free up significant staff time for enhanced characterisation of clinical seed stocks. This streamlining will result in improved quality and consistency of cell products: minimising process variability and enhancing robustness and reliability. It will also enhance the Bank's ability to conduct underpinning development work on key safety characteristics which will define the suitability of cell lines used for therapy, such as studies of genetic stability and maintenance of phenotype and function after banking and extended in vitro culture. This information will be essential for the utility of these cells for cell-based medicines. It will also enable the Bank to provide further support to the clinical and manufacturing communities in the development of both clinical hESC and hiPSC lines. The equipment will also be used in the numerous current and proposed collaborations with academic, regulatory, SME and pharmaceutical partners, in which the UKSCB is providing support to facilitate regulatory approval of commercial products.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L012642/1","grantId":"MR/L012642/1","fundValue":"352151","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Charles John Hunt","coPersons":["Glyn  Stacey"],"organisation":"Nat Inst for Bio Standards and Control","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
