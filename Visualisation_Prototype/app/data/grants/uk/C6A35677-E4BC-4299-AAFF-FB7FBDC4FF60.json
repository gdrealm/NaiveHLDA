{"id":"C6A35677-E4BC-4299-AAFF-FB7FBDC4FF60","title":"Immune cell communication facilitated by the supramolecular organisation and intercellular exchange of surface proteins","abstractText":"I am particularly keen to play a useful role in a public discussion of science. I have an article on the IS in press at Scientific American magazine (scheduled for late Summer 2005) which has a worldwide subscription of over one million. For this article, I interviewed many colleagues for their stories surrounding the earliest observations and discussions on the IS. In addition, I give public lectures at the Royal Institution (2000 and 2005), where I was made an honorary Life Member as part of the ?Scientists for the New Century? program in 2000. Together with Prof. Paul French (Physics Department), I presented our research at the Royal Society Summer Exhibition in 2003. In 2000, I won the Oxford University Press/ Times Higher Education Supplement Science Writing Prize, and my article was published in The Times Higher Education Supplement. In 2003, my research program featured in BBSRC Business quarterly magazine. In 2003 and 2004, feature articles were written about our research in Biophotonics International and in 2002 our work was featured in Optics &amp; Photonics News . In 2000, The Times newspaper published a feature article on me, and my research, entitled ?Hot on the trail of Natural Killer cells?.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500563","grantId":"G0500563","fundValue":"897297","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel M Davis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
