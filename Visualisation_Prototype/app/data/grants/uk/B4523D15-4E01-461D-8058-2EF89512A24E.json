Petrochemical\nfacilities extend over very large areas and have extensive, complex infrastructure to transport and store chemicals and gases\nunder high temperatures and pressures. The health and saftey of the workers and of nearby residents is of paramount\nimportance and companies such as BP extend considerable effort and spend very large sums of money to ensure that their\npetrochemical facilities are as safe as possible. The current health &amp; safety and pollution monitoring approaches at \nPetrochemical facilities involves the deployment of a large number of gas detectors as key locations around the petrochemical \nfacility. These gas detectors while being extremely accurate are limited in the extent of the area that they can detect gas \nemissions coming from. Apart from missing gas leaks point-based detectors do not have the capability of identification patterns\non infrastructure indicative of stress or weakening of restraining material.\n\nCurrently available imaging based gas monitoring instruments are not capable of meeting the essential requirements of the\nPetrochemical industry. Both Thermal cameras with filters and filter-based snapshot systems can detect the presence of \nhigh concentrations of a number of gas species but have very poor sensitivity, they cannot differentiate different species \nfrom a complex gas and are severely affected by the presence of water vapour in the atmosphere. Imaging Fourier Transform \nInterferometers (FTIRs) have the potential to overcome the sensitivity and accuracy limitations of these other \ntechnologies but current systems are very expensive, very heavy and have a very high power supply requirement with \nconsequent severe effects on the portability and deployment in environments with hazardous leaking gas. There is therefore \nan urgent need for the development of a low-cost, highly portable imaging FTIR system that can differentiate and quantify gas \nspecies at the sensitivity required by the Petrochemical industry. \n\nThe proposed instrument will be a development of a mid-infrared Fourier Transform Spectrometer, based on a novel static optical \nconfiguration, that has been developed at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL). This instrument, known as the micro \nFourier Transform Spectrometer (microFTS), employs a simple optical arrangement to split and then recombine light to form a \ncomplex modulated interference pattern (known as an interferogram). The instrument is compact (50 mm by 50 mm by 30 mm), \nlightweight (~0.9 kg) and has a very high data acquisition time rate (~1 x 10-4 s-1). An important, additional component of the\nproject will be the development of an easy-to-use gas identification and analysis software package which will enable the microFTS \ndata to be processed into images showing both the presence and the concentration of the gas species of most importance to the \nPetrochemical industry.\n\nThis project will involve collaboratoration with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). The project will utilise \nnew, state-of-the-art analytical facilities at NPL which will enable a comprehensive evaluation of the sensitivity of the new \nmicroFTS instrument in detecting the gas species of most importance to the Petrochemical industry (e.g. methane, carbon monoxide\n, carbon dioxide, ammonia, acetic acid), at a range of temperatures (both gas and background), concentrations and mixtures.\n\nThe project will also involve extensive collaboration with BP. A series of extensive field-based evaluation campaigns of the microFTS \ninstrument will be carried out at the BP facilities at Saltend, near Hull. The opportunity to evaluate the design and capabilities of the \ninstrument in real situations under normal atmospheric conditions will be enbale to ensure that the instrument produced at the end of\nproject is an instrument that industry would wish to uti","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K006614/1","grantId":"ST/K006614/1","fundValue":"89275","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The first phase of the project involving the design of a novel low-cost, field portable Imaging FTIR is now nearing completion.
