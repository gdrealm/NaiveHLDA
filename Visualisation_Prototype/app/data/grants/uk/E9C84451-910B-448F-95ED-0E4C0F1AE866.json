This simple research question has not been adequately answered to date, identifying a failing of criminological theory and empirical research. Prior to the last decade, increasing crime rates were the norm in industrialised society since WWII. Empirical studies of crime falls have been undertaken using national and cross-national data sets, examining different crimes and contexts. Theories of the crime falls include those relating to economic growth and employment opportunities, demographic change, improved policing, increased risk of punishment and increased prison populations, changing abortion rates, cultural change, religiosity, and changes in illicit drug markets. Where they have been tested such theories have proven insufficient or at best partial explanations for some contexts.</p>\n\n<p>The present study proposes a crime-specific problem-solving methodology to address the research question and identifies ways to sustain the crime drop. This will include the testing of new theories, but the main novel aspect will be the data-driven approach. Trends and patterns for particular crime types and sub-types will be examined for similarities and differences across nations. A significant part of the research will be the compilation and analysis of the necessary national and cross-national data sets.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2386","grantId":"RES-000-22-2386","fundValue":"79731","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Farrell","coPersons":["Andromachi  Tseloni","Nick  Tilley"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
