{"id":"ECA37289-BD7C-4968-AC21-2FD8F9763779","title":"Novel Interface and Strain Control in Epitaxial Nanocomposite Films","abstractText":"The proposal is concerned with studying vertically structured nanocomposite (VSCN) films which can give better physical properties compared to single layer or multilayer films. Under a currently funded proposal together, we have demonstrated several remarkable functional enhancements as well as interesting spontaneously ordered structures (nanocheckerboards) and unprecendented levels of strain in thick film. In particular, we have shown that an important ferroelectric material can be made to work well at several hundred degrees above its normal operation temperature. We believe this is the beginning of the road for the field and there are many new things still to be explored and discovered. We aim to continue with this exploration together. Basic science will be undertaken to understanding of the limitations to the level of strain, the interface compatibilities, and the lateral ordering. New systems will grown and explored to demonstrate the power of the VSCN method, and finally demonstrations of the functional applicability of the strongly enhanced BaTiO3 system will be carried out.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H047867/1","grantId":"EP/H047867/1","fundValue":"384952","fundStart":"2011-02-08","fundEnd":"2014-11-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith Louise Driscoll","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" There are many very interesting findings so far! We have made strongly improved ferreoelectrics, the best tunable oxides in the world, amazing memristor behaviour and the beginnings of a room temperature magnetoelectric. We can really tune these thin film nanocomposite materials. The grant is still in progress. It is a very exciting emerging field. I find it hard to get the Univ. to patent my ideas.
