A significant advance in this area was the demonstration of release of a chemical messenger, ATP, from the urothelium when the bladder is stretched, as occurs during filling, and which eventually activates sensory nerves. The details of this mechanism are unclear, but our previous work identified a hitherto uninvestigated cellular fraction, so-called myofibroblasts, that may have a key role in this sensation. We wish to test the hypothesis that the urothelium, and the associated myofibroblast layer, form a sensory structure in response to bladder filling and harmful stimuli as may accumulate during urinary tract infections, or inflammatory conditions. We will first characterise the responses of these cell structures to physical and chemical stimuli and then investigate the effect of ageing on these processes, using both animal models and human samples. The project will provide novel insights into sensory function of hollow organs and processes of ageing; it will also identify molecular targets from which drugs may be developed to control bladder activity when it becomes dysfunctional.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G015554/1","grantId":"BB/G015554/1","fundValue":"487250","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our new findings provided novel understanding of the regulation of urothelial and bladder function, have identified urothelium-specific pathways and mechanims underlying the susceptibility of ageing bladders to overactivity and human relevance.

Importantly, human urothelium biopsies have similar properties.\nWe have extra findings beyond the original objectives: prostanoid paracrine mediator, role of angiotensin, E-Coli toxin, acid channels, and discovering circadian clock genes in urothelium and smooth muscle, affected by ageing. The project was also of benefit to teaching by providing student research projects. All these have enhanced our understanding of the urothelium as the novel regulator for bladder function and its contribution to diseases, would provide new directions of research in the field of urological research, and stimulate translational research. The molecular targets and pathways might be used for the development of urothelium-specific new therapies with minimised side effects.
