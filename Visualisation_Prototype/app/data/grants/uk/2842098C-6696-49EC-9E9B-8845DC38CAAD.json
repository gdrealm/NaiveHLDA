However, soon after the domestication, barleys with six rows of grain emerged that ultimately dominated early barley cultivation. Mutations in a single gene called SIX-ROWED SPIKE 1 (VRS1) have been identified as responsible for this important developmental switch. In two-rowed types, VRS1 mRNA is expressed in progenitor cells of the lateral spikelets which remain sterile presumably because VRS1 protein represses expression of genes that are required for development of 'lateral fertility'. Inactivating VRS1 via mutation would de-repress expression of lateral fertility genes, resulting in a six-rowed spike. While VRS1 is core to this process, we also know from historical studies with barley mutants that at least 11 different SIX-ROWED SPIKE genes influence the degree of fertility of the lateral spikelets. For example, we recently identified SIX-ROWED SPIKE 5 (VRS5), and showed that different versions of this gene (that we call 'alleles') are always paired with different versions of VRS1 in commercial two- and six- rowed barleys. This pairing is important because in lines that have the six-row version of VRS1 (denoted as vrs1), a two-row VRS5 allele (Vrs5) causes the development of small grain from the lateral spikelets. In contrast, the six-row version of VRS5 (vrs5) causes the lateral spikelets to develop fully, with important consequences on yield. This observation demonstrates that getting the correct combination of alleles at VRS genes is extremely important. While mutant studies have identified many VRS genes, we recently showed that natural variation in only four genes is associated with determining whether current elite UK barley cultivars are genetically optimal two- or six-row-types. As expected, one of these was VRS1 and another VRS5. We recently identified the third gene as VRS3 and are trying to identify the fourth, which does not coincide with the location of any of the eleven VRS mutants. In parallel, VRS4 has been identified by German collaborators. \nWhile we now know these genes are intrinsically linked by their involvement in the developmental pathway that restores fertility to a nascent floral organ (i.e. the lateral spikelets) at the moment we have no idea if or how these components interact, what other genes/proteins are involved or how six-rowed types evolved over the 10,000 years since the domestication of the species. These are the issues we plan to address in this project. We believe that a better understanding of this fundamental developmental process will provide insights into how we can exploit variation in genes controlling plant morphology and architecture to ultimately improve plant yield.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K017667/1","grantId":"BB/K017667/1","fundValue":"35570","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The award started in Novermber 2013 and the post-doc hired in February 2014, so it is premature to issue major findings.

Each node forms a central spikelet, flanked by two lateral spikelets. In two-rowed barley, only the central spikelet is fertile while in six-rowed barley, both the central and lateral spikelets are fertile. In this grant we are investigating the molecular interactions between loci which control the switch between two and six-rowed forms. We have conducted a fine-scale developmental ontogeny of lateral spikelet development in different row-type barley lines to identify the earliest indicators of lateral spikelet fertility. We have also initiated expression and protein-protein interaction assays. Our current work can be used to analyse other row-type mutants and highlight features that are key for lateral fertility Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
