Recent work suggests that only a small fraction of the total cancer cells, the cancer stem cells, is responsible for the growth of cancers. We will develop assays that effectively monitor the actions of drugs on cancer stem cells whilst avoiding involvement of animals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900799/1","grantId":"G0900799/1","fundValue":"345086","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Mackenzie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
