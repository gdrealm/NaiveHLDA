It is based on a novel idea, which we developed together with our collaborators at Nottingham University. The central aspect is to use laser induced interactions to create entanglement in a controlled and relatively simple way. If successful it might bring radical simplifications to quantum information and metrology with ultracold atoms. Entanglement enhanced metrology is a rapidly growing field of research which owes its high impact to the prospect of beating current limits in precision measurement with implications ranging from fundamental tests to industrial applications. However, despite some prominent proof-of-principle experiments, classical schemes are still prevailing when it comes to the most precise measurement of given quantity. A particular aspect of this project will thus be the assessment of the suitability of the developed entanglement scheme for a real enhancement of precision. \n\nA close collaboration with NPL will add world leading expertise in metrology research and put the project into direct industrial context with regards to metrology applications. In particular this collaboration will also open new perspectives for my development with regards to the strategic plans of the University.\n \nIn addition to the precision measurement application, the use of low-lying electronic states drastically limits the number of radiative decay channels opening an entire field of exciting opportunities to study dissipation-mediated entanglement. The prospect of robust entanglement as a resource not only for metrology, but also for quantum computation opens significant research and career opportunities beyond the duration of the grant.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L001713/1","grantId":"EP/L001713/1","fundValue":"250687","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  project ongoing, so for no useage  ","person":"Kai  Bongs","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
