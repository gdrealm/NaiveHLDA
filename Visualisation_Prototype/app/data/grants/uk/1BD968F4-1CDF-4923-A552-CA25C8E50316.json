From oral testimony it would appear that every adult fiddled the rations to get a little bit extra at some point. This testimony appears at odds with the views of economic historians who judge consumer rationing and price control schemes to have been successful. This project reconciled these apparently contradictory views. Through an analysis of all the available qualitative and quantitative evidence, the project reconstructs the pattern and extent of black market activity. \nBlack market activity focused on a handful of commodities, notably meat, petrol and clothing. Most black market activity involved gifting and trading of unwanted coupons and rations. This illicit trade did not threaten control; in fact it made rationing more economically efficient and was socially progressive. Large-scale and highly organised black market activity was rare. \nThe project uses survey data and other qualitative evidence to explain this pattern of illicit dealing. Careful study of personal writing and enforcement records reveals that people limited their involvement in illegal deals. Content analysis of responses to an unused social survey, demonstrates the importance of popular notions of fairness In restraining illegality and highlights the moral underpinnings of economic life in mid twentieth century Britain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113028/1","grantId":"113028/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Cardwell Roodhouse","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
