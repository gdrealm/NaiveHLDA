{"id":"2CAE03CE-06F9-4BE3-A732-5F0CD5D1AD9E","title":"The Demand for Durables in the Second Half of Life in the UK","abstractText":"<p>This project shall help to better understand the demand for durables, in particular at the time of retirement entry and generally in the second half of life. While nondurable demand and large durables like housing have been studied extensively, the replacement of smaller durables like white goods, electronic appliances and the like is understudied. This project aims at explaining why the demand for durables experiences a temporary increase around retirement and a substantial decline at older ages. The empirical regularities shall be investigated in detail using three separate UK datasets - the Expenditure and Food Survey, the British Household Panel Survey and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.</p>\n\n<p>The key questions in this project are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Durable purchases at retirement: do households postpone durables purchases before retirement and use lump-sum payments received upon retirement to replace and renew their household appliances and consumer electronics? Do complementarities between durables and leisure affect purchase behaviour around retirement? </li>\n\n <li>Durable purchases beyond retirement: how can we explain the large drop in durables expenditures at older ages? Do households rationally take into account their life expectancy when making durables replacement decisions?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2454","grantId":"RES-000-22-2454","fundValue":"77076","fundStart":"2008-01-02","fundEnd":"2009-01-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Melanie  Luehrmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
