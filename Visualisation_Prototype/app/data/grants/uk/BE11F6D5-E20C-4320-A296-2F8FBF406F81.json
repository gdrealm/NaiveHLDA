The study of appropriate phase transitions, formation and evolution of singularities and defects in nematic liquid crystals leads to challenging mathematical problems. In order to understand these phenomena we rely on analysis of variational problems and nonlinear partial differential equations arising from corresponding physical models.There are several major theories to study nematic liquid crystals: Onsager theory, Maier-Saupe mean field theory, Oseen-Frank director theory, Ericksen theory, and Landau-de Gennes theory. These theories are based on investigation of the free energy of the liquid crystalline system. Minimizers of the free energy correspond to equilibrium states and in order to understand the liquid crystalline system behavior it is enough to study properties of these minimizers.The main goal of this project is to analytically investigate variational problems arising in Onsager-Maier-Saupe and Landau-de Gennes models. We would like to study the qualitative properties of the equilibrium states of liquid crystalline systems by investigating the minimizers of the corresponding energy functionals. In particular we plan to investigate formation and profiles of the singularities in liquid crystalline systems, phase transitions in biaxial nematics, and relation between different liquid crystal theories. We also would like to gain the insight about nonequilibrium phenomena in the liquid crystalline systems by studying the gradient flow (and related) dynamics generated by free energy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I028714/1","grantId":"EP/I028714/1","fundValue":"102726","fundStart":"2011-04-22","fundEnd":"2013-10-21","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The immediate impact is in the research area of mathematical liquid crystals and it has been described in the Key Findings section.

In particular, development of variational and maximum principle methods for problems in Landau-de Gennes theory yielded a string of new interesting results that shed a light on formation and structure of point defects in liquid crystals. Investigation of the generalized Onsager model provided better understanding of the current dynamical models for nematic liquid crystals.\nNew directions of the research in the area have been identified and new open problems were formulated. In particular, it includes the structure and stability of critical points of Landau-de Gennes energy in two dimensions and modeling of polydisperse nematics using Onsager-type models.\nThe existing collaborations have been strengthened and new links between myself and various groups working on liquid crystals were established through research visits and research discussions during various seminars, workshops and conferences. Development of new mathematical ideas lead to a breakthrough in analytical treatment of liquid crystal models, in particular Landau-de Gennes model. These analytical techniques can be used not only by researchers working in the field of mathematical liquid crystals but also in a wider area of applied analysis, including polymer physics, superconductivity and micromagnetics.
