{"id":"DBEFB179-2B83-4654-A75E-362D00A8BFCA","title":"Quantum etch plasma simulation","abstractText":"The project will produce a prototype Quantum-Etch system: a plasma etching model based on accurate quantum models. This etching program will allow academic and industrial researchers to pre-test major design changes in etching systems. The consequence will be a major efficiency gain for the semiconductor industry in designing industrial etching chambers allowing for the most suitable designs to be quickly identified and moved on to lab testing. Project outputs will include a Requirements Analysis following customer interviews, Development Roadmap, Prototype Quantum-Etch system and a detailed Business Plan which will be used to raise further finance for development and marketing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F008961/1","grantId":"EP/F008961/1","fundValue":"93686","fundStart":"2007-08-05","fundEnd":"2008-09-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Tennyson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
