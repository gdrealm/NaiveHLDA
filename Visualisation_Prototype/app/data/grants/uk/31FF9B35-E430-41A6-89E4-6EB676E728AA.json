{"id":"31FF9B35-E430-41A6-89E4-6EB676E728AA","title":"UKube in the classroom - from space to Fukushima","abstractText":"We propose a pilot scheme to build up to the launch of the UK’s first CubeSat mission - UKube-1, part of a knowledge transfer\npartnership sponsored by STFC. The e2v Centre for Electronic Imaging at the Open University are building a camera module to\nbe launched on the mission to take pictures of the Earth and to study the damage caused to the camera by radiation in space.\nThis aspect is particularly timely as we can also encourage informed debate about radiation effects (e.g. in Japan following the\nrecent radioactivity releases). We aim to provide students with interactive sessions comprising of a short talk linking our work to\ntheir stage in the science curriculum, hands-on experience with flight-equivalent camera modules and a question and answer\nsession for the students so they can find out what they really want to know about the mission.\nThrough this pilot outreach project we therefore aim to:\n• Develop and demonstrate an outreach strategy for post-launch and future UKube missions (expected annually) where pupils can\nget hands-on experience with fully operational flight-equivalent equipment.\n• Engage pupils in our frontier research, in their local area, on the STFC sponsored UKube-1, the UK’s pilot CubeSat mission.\n• Generate interest in UKube-1 in the build up to launch (currently scheduled for September 2012).\n• Motivate school students to study physics and engineering beyond 16 and on to university by demonstrating the work of our PhD\nstudents on the UKube mission; they will only be 4 years ahead of the older school students and will offer experiences that can\nbe related to.\n• Provide development opportunities for our STFC funded PhD students in communicating science to the public.\n• Demonstrate how the science that the students are learning in their curriculum is relevant and essential for space missions.\nFor example, for GCSE level students we will link the project with the study of ionising radiation, gravity and different re with students the concept of ionising radiation and its effect not only on Earth and people (e.g. current events in\nFukushima) but also on space missions. To do this we will have previously conditioned the cameras so that they will perform as\nthough one has been exposed to Jovian radiation, one to Earth orbit and one to levels at Fukushima (there are no Health and\nSafety implications in this conditioning!). The students will be able to directly observe how increasing radiation levels degrades\nthe images the students take.\n• Show the students how the technology in their own mobile phone cameras (CMOS) can be developed towards space missions,\nlinking the research into their everyday lives.\n• To answer students’ questions about the project through question and answer sessions, providing further information online.\n• Create an online presence in the form of a blog to record the images taken by the students, and most importantly the questions\nasked by the students and the answers to these questions, building up an FAQ as the project progresses of what the students\nreally want to know with links to sources of further information. This will also introduce a “multiplier effect”, allowing teachers not\ninvolved in this pilot scheme to use the resource to lead their own lessons on the UKube mission.\n• Discuss with the students and teachers in the question and answer sessions what they think about the project, aiming to bring\ncontinual improvement, feeding into plans for post-launch outreach activities (when images will be sent from the satellite) and for\nfuture UKube missions (expected annually).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J500136/1","grantId":"ST/J500136/1","fundValue":"6780","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The outreach methods have been used continuously since the end of the grant to run other outreach projects for different missions with great success. The UKube camera flight-equivalent models have been extremely well used for outreach and visitors to the university well beyond the end date of the grant to reach many more than the 1200 people that were reached locally over the time of the grant period itself.
