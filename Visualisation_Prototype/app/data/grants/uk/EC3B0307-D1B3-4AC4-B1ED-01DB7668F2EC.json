Retailers now stock an extremely wide range of foods. Even single types of food (e.g., pizza) are now available in numerous varieties that differ in size and the number of calories that they contain. For example, our data show that the number of calories in fish pie 'ready meals' can vary by up to 450% in the UK. In animals, this kind of 'variability' promotes overeating and an increase in body weight. For the first time, this project will explore whether this also happens in humans. There are two ways in which variability in our food environment might increase the number of calories that we consume. These are summarised below. In PHASE 1 we will look at our capacity to 'compensate' for calories in food. When we consume one meal shortly after another then good compensation occurs when the size of the first meal controls the size of the second meal (i.e., a larger first meal causes people to consume a smaller second meal). In animals, poor compensation has been linked to a degraded 'cephalic-phase response.' This anticipatory response governs appetite and represents a series of physiological changes (e.g., salivation and insulin release) that prepare the body for the consumption and digestion of food. Critically, merely looking at or smelling a food is sufficient to elicit a response that is proportional to the calories contained in a food. This shows that learning is involved and that responses are based on previous encounters with individual foods. In this phase we will determine whether the cephalic-phase response is reduced in highly variable foods and whether this promotes poor compensation leading to overconsumption. Cephalic-phase responses will be measured in a number of ways. In particular, we will develop a new method based on changes in skin temperature near to the liver. Previously, researchers have found that this 'thermogenic response' is particularly sensitive to different foods. In this interdisciplinary project we will work with an expert in sensor technology to develop this sensitivity still further. In PHASE 2 we will explore the idea that variability in our food environment makes it more difficult for us to predict the extent to which a particular food will stave off hunger. In 2002 a Nobel Prize was awarded for advances in the field of behavioural economics. This work shows that uncertainty tends to generate cautious and conservative responses and has been used extensively to predict animal behaviour and a range of decisions relating to gambling, financial trading, and risk taking. We find it surprising that 'prospect theory' has not been applied to understand dietary behaviour in humans. For the first time, we will draw on these principles to test the idea that our variable food environment causes uncertainty about the effects of consuming a food, which creates confusion and a concern that hunger might be experienced after it has been consumed. In response to this uncertainty we make conservative dietary decisions and select and then consume larger portions of food. In summary, this project will address important questions relating to variability in our dietary environment. Previously, this issue has been largely overlooked. Nevertheless, research in animals would suggest that variability has the potential to play an important role in promoting overeating and obesity. The beneficiaries of this project are wide ranging. For individual consumers, this might involve increased public awareness of the effects of variable foods. For children, guidelines and/or legislation might be introduced to limit exposure to highly variable foods. For obese individuals, interventions might be possible that re-train sensitivity to the calories contained in specific foods. As such, this work has considerable potential to impact a number of groups, including; health professionals, policy makers, educators, and the wider public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I012370/1","grantId":"BB/I012370/1","fundValue":"416658","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project is ongoing (completion date: End of June 2015) and our findings have not been used yet.

Retailers now stock an extremely wide range of foods. Even single types of food (e.g., pizza) are now available in numerous varieties that differ in size and the number of calories that they contain. In animals, this kind of 'variability' promotes overeating and weight gain. This project represents the first systematic translation of these findings to the study of obesity in humans. \n\nOur research indicates that exposure to a wide variety of the same kind of food (e.g., pizza) promotes uncertainty about the energy content and expected satiation of that type of food. Specifically, we've shown that people tend to underestimate the expected satiation a food that they are uncertain about. For instance, we found that participants who had consumed a wide variety of pizzas (of various portion sizes and energy densities) believed that a portion of pizza would be less satiating compared to participants who had consumed fewer pizzas. Importantly, these expectations translated to real-life differences in food intake--when fed a portion of pizza and then given access to a second snack, the participants who had been exposed to a wide variety of pizzas ate more than the participants who had been exposed to fewer pizzas (Hardman et al., in prep). These findings suggest that dietary complexity reduces satiation and increases food intake, thereby contributing to weight gain.\n\nOur research indicates that highly variable foods may also contribute to weight gain by reducing energy expenditure. One of the advantages of being able to accurately predict the energy content of food is that our body can generate anticipatory physiological responses which increase the efficiency of nutrient absorption. One of these 'cephalic phase responses' is thermogenesis--the increase in body heat which occurs before and during food intake. This increase in body temperature indicates an increase in energy expenditure; thus, decreases in cephalic phase thermogenesis could contribute to small but meaningful increases in body weight over time. Using a novel technique we developed for measuring thermogenesis in humans, we showed that cephalic phase responses were weaker in people who had highly variable dietary experiences compared to people with more limited and consistent dietary experience (Griggs et al., 2013; Coffey et al, 2013; Griggs et al., in prep.). This is the first demonstration that dietary complexity disrupts cephalic phase responses in humans, and identifies a second mechanism by which the current food environment might be contributing to obesity.\n\nFood variety is not the only source of uncertainty in today's environment-- uncertainty regarding when and how much one plans to eat at their next meal could also bias people to overeat. In order to determine whether these sources of uncertainty are also problematic for weight control, we conducted experiments in which we explored how the time until the next meal (i.e., the inter-meal interval) influenced how much food participants chose to consume during a lunchtime meal. We observed that participants elected to consume more food at lunch when the post-meal interval was longer than when it was shorter; however, uncertainty about the time of the next meal did not bias participants to overeat. This finding suggests that the uncertainty about the energy content of a meal may be more problematic for weight control than uncertainty about meal timing. Our research highlights and extends knowledge about why the current food environment is proving so detrimental to food intake and weight control. Our research indicates that it is not only the increased access to food today that has led to obesity; it is also the increased variety of food available today which is problematic. We believe this work can be used by health professionals and policymakers to increase public awareness regarding the effects of highly variable foods--for instance, guidelines and/or legislation might be introduced to limit exposure to highly variable foods as preventative measures for obesity, especially in children. For obese individuals, this work highlights the necessity of developing new strategies for managing intake of highly variable foods other than those that rely on estimates of energy content or satiation. Food companies and manufacturers might benefit from our work by using our methods to evaluate the variability of their food products and the impact of this factor on satiety. Generally, the wider public will benefit from an opportunity to take more informed control of the foods that they consume and the foods that they give their children.
