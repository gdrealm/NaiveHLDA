A randomised controlled trial","abstractText":"Patients with HIV infection often have severe damage to the body?s immune system and are at risk of various other infections (so called opportunistic infections) that may cause disease and death. Daily intake of the antinfective medication: cotrimoxazole (CTX) has been shown to be highly effective in reducing the frequency of these infectious complications of HIV disease. This prophylactic treatment with cotrimoxazole has therefore become standard practice for HIV infected patients. In industrialised countries, after the introduction of antiretroviral (ARV) treatments for HIV infection, studies showed that the additional prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole could safely be discontinued once patients showed evidence of restoration of their immune function. For some years now, many HIV infected patients in Africa have also started to receive antiretroviral treatments. ARVs help to restore a person?s immune system (although they cannot cure a person from HIV infection) and the provision of ARVs has changed the health of thousands of HIV infected people and dramatically reduced the death rate among those who take them. It may also be possible to discontinue CTX prophylaxis among patients whose immune system is working well again, but no studies have demonstrated the safety of this practice in Africa. Since ARV treatment is lifelong, it would be desirable; in order to reduce pill burden, reduce the risk of possible treatment side effects and contribute to better ARV treatment adherence and reduction of treatment costs. The planned study in Uganda will address this important question among African patients by investigating whether patients who are responding well to ARV treatment can discontinue prophylactic treatment with CTX without a substantially higher risk of becoming ill.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_EX_G0902150","grantId":"MC_EX_G0902150","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paula  MunderiHeiner  Grosskurth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit on AIDS","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
