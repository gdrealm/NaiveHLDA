There is a lack of medicines to treat osteoarthritis, and since the elderly population are more likely to have severe osteoarthritis, this will be an increasing problem. Despite many years of research, there are no drugs available which can slow or stop the progression of osteoarthritis. In part, this is due to the fact that drugs for use in any disease which is not life threatening must be very safe (i.e. have few side effects). Also, the costs of running clinical trials in osteoarthritis are prohibitive. There is a need to develop new strategies to combat this disease. The connection between diet and osteoarthritis has been explored to some extent. The high intake of some foodstuffs has been linked a slower progression of the disease. These analyses are imperfect since diet is recorded via a retrospective questionnaire across a long time period. Nevertheless, they prove the concept that diet can influence joint health. There are many compounds found in food which have biological activities. To date, we have focused on two compounds: sulforaphane which is found at high amounts in broccoli and other related vegetables; diallyl disulphide which is found at high amounts in garlic. Both of these compounds have been investigated for activity in other diseases e.g. heart disease and cancer, but have not been looked at in terms of arthritis. We have added sulforaphane and diallyl disulphide to our laboratory models of the cartilage destruction that is a key facet of osteoarthritis. We have shown that they are effective in slowing or preventing cartilage destruction in these. We have also added these compounds to human cartilage taken from patients with osteoarthritis and maintained in the laboratory and shown that they slow destruction. The objectives of this study are therefore: to refine and improve our work to identify which foods are associated with protection from osteoarthritis; to continue to identify the components of these foods which will prevent or slow cartilage destruction; to test these compounds in a variety of laboratory models using cells or tissues from patients with osteoarthritis; to undertake studies in man to find out whether these compounds get into the joint and/or cartilage tissue in appropriate amounts to slow cartilage destruction. These studies are essential ahead of a full-scale clinical trial in human osteoarthritis and represent an exciting possibility in the prevention and treatment of this disabling disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I006060/1","grantId":"BB/I006060/1","fundValue":"525125","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our research findings have been widely publicised.

Around 8.5 million people in the UK having moderate to severe disease. Approximately 70% of these patients are in constant pain. There is no therapy which can slow or stop the destruction of cartilage and patients are offered joint replacement surgery at the end stage of the disease (where the joint is surgically amenable). Increasing age and increasing obesity are the major risk factors for osteoarthritis and with changing demographics, this problem will become worse.\n\n\n\nIsothiocyanates are compounds that can be derived from eating cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli. We have taken a range of isothiocyanates and tested them in laboratory models of cartilage destruction and osteoarthritis. A number of compounds are effective in these laboratory models and one of these, sulforaphane, derived from eating broccoli has been taken forward for further study.\n\n\n\nWe have explored the way in which sulforaphane works in cartilage cells (chondrocytes) and found that it exerts its action on a major pathway of inflammation. It appears to do this in an unusual manner and we are exploring this further.\n\n\n\nWe have gained ethical approval to feed broccoli to osteoarthritis sufferers ahead of knee replacement surgery. Patients were split into two groups: one followed a diet low in broccoli and all related vegetables; one ate 100g a day of a broccoli known to give a high level of sulforaphane upon eating. We have collected blood samples and all tissues taken at total knee replacements. We have shown that it is possible to measure sulforaphane and its metabolites in the synovial fluid of the patients eating broccoli: this is the first time that it has been demonstrated that consumption of broccoli in man can lead to sulforaphane getting into the joint. We are now measuring the difference in gene expression between the two groups to see if we can see a functional consequence of the broccoli consumption. If we can prove that sulforaphane is effective in slowing the destruction of cartilage in osteoarthritis in man, evidence-based dietary advice can be given. Data from the proof-of-principle trial may also be used as preliminary evidence to conduct a full scale clinical trial of pain and function. Retail","dataset":"gtr"}
