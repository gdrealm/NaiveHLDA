{"id":"8B1E402B-E52D-4ABA-8D79-64DDD18E7BAE","title":"Mapping Virtual Emotions: 3D-surface capturing of animated facial expressions in animals and humans","abstractText":"Building upon my current research into consciousness and the dreaming brain, I seek to develop a new artwork to reveal aspects of characteristic human emotions (i.e. laughing, crying etc.) with the use of new technology in particular digital scanning devices and special effects animation software. The proposal is to use a 3D high-resolution laser scanner to capture animal faces (in association with the Natural History Museum) and using the data of these faces, animate and then combine them with human emotional facial expressions. In doing so it is hoped to visualise through critical experimentation what evolution has selected and accommodated.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119601/1","grantId":"119601/1","fundValue":"4833","fundStart":"2006-01-10","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Barbara  Rauch","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
