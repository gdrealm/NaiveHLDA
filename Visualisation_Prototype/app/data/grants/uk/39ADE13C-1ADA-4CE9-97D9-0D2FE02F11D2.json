We will conduct the first such study in Brazil (an excellent example of such a country) focusing on people with diabetes. This research will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>add an extra level of sophistication to our understanding of themes within existing CAM sociology</li>\n\n <li>address concerns of local users, by providing evidence that can contribute to more informed decision making on CAM/TM in Brazil.<br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2565-A","grantId":"RES-000-22-2565-A","fundValue":"14293","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Andrew Tovey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
