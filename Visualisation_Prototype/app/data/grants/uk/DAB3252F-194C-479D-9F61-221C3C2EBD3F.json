HIV-1 and other retroviruses encode a so-called Late Budding domain (L-domain) whose mutation induces the accumulation of immature virions that remain tethered to the plasma membrane by a membranous stalk. Recent work by our group and other laboratories has identified the cellular protein Tsg101 as the cellular partner that facilitates HIV-1 and Ebola virus budding thorough the interaction with a highly conserved aminoacid motif (PTAP) in the L-domain of these pathogens. In subsequent work a group of cellular proteins that participate in budding of highly divergent enveloped viruses has also been identified. We and others have recently constructed a protein-protein interaction map that connects Tsg101 with the cellular machinery that is believed to facilitate viral budding, but the functional importance of many of these interactions needs to be determined. The main goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular events that mediate the recruitment of the cellular budding/fusion machinery by Tsg101 during HIV-1 particle assembly. This aim will be studied by determining the role in HIV-1 budding of known proteins that interact with Tsg101 (VPS28, EAP20, EAP30 and EAP45) and by identifying and studying the function of novel Tsg101 interacting proteins. Finally, we propose two different approaches to determine whether the PTAP/Tsg101 is a valid therapeutic target for AIDS treatment. Importantly, a greater understanding of how HIV-1 viruses exploit the host cell to facilitate the budding process could provide opportunities for chemotherapeutic intervention using a completely novel class of antiviral compounds that would be active against a number of human pathogens including HIV-1, HIV-2, Ebola virus, HTLV, Lassa fever virus and essentially any virus that exploits the PTAP/Tsg101 interaction during budding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400207","grantId":"G0400207","fundValue":"653913","fundStart":"2005-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Juan  Martin-Serrano","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
