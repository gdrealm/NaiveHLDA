We will create a substantial body of theory which will enable the widespread use of Euler diagram visualizations. The project will develop original techniques to allow the practical layout of diagrams that currently cannot be drawn automatically. A major outcome will be the production of a usable software tool exemplifying the new layout techniques..Euler diagrams (a generalization of Venn diagrams) are an attractive method for visualization information because they represent exclusion, containment and intersection of sets in an intuitive manner. In addition, they have the advantage of a rigorous mathematical basis. However, despite their benefits as a visualization method, the practical use of Euler diagrams has been held back because users must lay out these diagrams by hand. Manual layout places a heavy burden on users and is impractical for Euler diagrams involving many sets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E011160/1","grantId":"EP/E011160/1","fundValue":"322631","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Howse","coPersons":["Gem  Stapleton"],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
