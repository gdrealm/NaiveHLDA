Whilst also developing a complementary systems-level perspective exploring the potential roles of social enterprises in the eGovernment in the medium to long-term. Each of these intertwined strands of research are described further below.</p>\n\n<p>To explore the role of social enterprises in eGovernment Services comparative case studies will be developed. These case studies will be interrogated by applying an established impact evaluation framework. A combination of methods will be used to undertake this investigation including existing knowledge and data based upon:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>previous research</li>\n\n <li>surveys</li>\n\n <li>focus groups</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Possible long-term pathways for the role of social enterprises in eGovernment services will also be developed. Seeking to address questions including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to what extent, and how, can different actors influence pathways?</li>\n\n <li>what might be the key technological, organisational and institutional changes involved in each pathway?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Interviews and focus groups with eGovernment practitioners (from across the public, private and third sector) will be employed as appropriate at each stage of the research.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L00271X/1","grantId":"ES/L00271X/1","fundValue":"50609","fundStart":"2013-09-23","fundEnd":"2015-09-22","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  n/a research in progress and findings yet to emerge  ","person":"Chris  Martin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":" n/a research in progress and findings yet to emerge n/a research in progress and findings yet to emerge Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Other","dataset":"gtr"}
