It is vital to know how to respond efficiently and effectively to such threats, be it on the farmyard or in hospitals.</p> \n<p>This project is based on interdisciplinary collaboration between sociology and applied linguistics and uses a novel combination of methods: corpus linguistics, critical discourse analysis and critical metaphor analysis. Its aim is to investigate the narratives and discourses around cleanliness in two sectors: poultry farms (dealing with the threat of avian flu) and hospitals (dealing with the threat of MRSA) and to compare them with policy and media discourses. The in-depth study of the language of cleanliness and hygiene in different local contexts allows the mapping of the linguistic topography of cleanliness and the identification of fault lines along which different understandings interact and might come into conflict. Based on the findings derived from two case studies, we will develop a number of recommendations to improve communication across two sectors of public and encourage sustainable good practice in and across these sectors.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1306","grantId":"RES-000-23-1306","fundValue":"155597","fundStart":"2006-05-03","fundEnd":"2008-10-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Brigitte  Nerlich","coPersons":["Paul  Crawford","D  Brown","Ronald  Carter"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" We set out to study the language of biosecurity, hygiene and cleanliness in UK government, healthcare and agricultural policies and compare it with language used by key practitioners dealing with MRSA and the threat of avian flu, such as modern matrons and poultry farmers. Our aim was to examine how different agencies formulate issues, construct arguments and prioritise different practices and situated logics. We assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nursing, the social study of health and illness, environmental studies and linguistics, especially corpus linguistics, discourse analysis and metaphor analysis. Our aim was to find answers to the following questions:\n\n\n\no How do government policies, media reporting and the local knowledge of modern matrons interact with the way people construct issues of 'everyday' cleanliness and hygiene on the ground? \n\no What implications do similarities and differences between policy and practitioner narratives have for the implementation of policy and good practice?\n\n\n\nTo achieve these aims the project has successfully \n\n\n\no Examined how issues of cleanliness in hospitals are addressed in policy discourse (WP1).\n\no Determined how these issues are portrayed in the UK media (WP2).\n\no Analysed how matrons and infection control personnel talk about cleanliness in the context of the threat from healthcare associated infections (WP3)\n\no Investigated, compared and evaluated language use for qualitative and quantitative patterns of discourse (WP4). \n\no Tested the utility of combining methods of critical discourse analysis with those of corpus linguistics.\n\n\n\nThis project complements other work on the language and politics of infectious diseases and on the discursive and metaphorical framing of infectious diseases, carried out in relation to foot and mouth disease and SARS, for example (Nerlich et al., 2002; Wallis/Nerlich, 2005; Washer, 2006). One of the lessons learned from these epidemics is that the way people communicate about a threat largely determines how they are likely to understand it and behave toward it. As Powers and Xiao put it with reference to the 'social construction of SARS', &quot;[w]e communicate ourselves into a particular way of thinking and acting&quot; (Powers/Xiao, eds., in press). infection control, disease management We contributed to the development of a hand-hygiene learning toy\n\n\n\nhttp://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2010/july/gloyo.aspx Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
