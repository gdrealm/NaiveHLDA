First, patient-derived blood or skin cells can be turned into beating heart muscle cells, and it has been shown that they can have the characteristics of the heart disease seen in the patient. This allows us to investigate them as a &quot;disease-in-a-dish&quot; model and work out drug treatments or gene therapy specific for that type of patient. One very useful aspect of the stem cells is the ability to grow them in large numbers. To take advantage of that, new machines are being developed to screen multiple cells simultaneously. Both Imperial and Nottingham have experience in designing these large-scale experiments. We wish to purchase a number of state-of-the-art machines, shared between Imperial and Nottingham; develop cell models and assays for these; then make them available to the Regenerative Medicine community. Second, we aim to make muscle grafts from the stem cell-derived heart cells and to implant them in disease models in rats and mice to assess whether they will provide repair. We have used an MRI machine to do this previously, but ours has been decommissioned. We are asking for a contribution to the purchase of another MRI, and for its housing at Imperial in the building where the majority of Cardiovascular Regenerative Medicine researchers work, and next to other imaging machines which we will also use.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L012618/1","grantId":"MR/L012618/1","fundValue":"714591","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2015-03-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sian E Harding","coPersons":["Chris  Denning","Michael David Schneider"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
