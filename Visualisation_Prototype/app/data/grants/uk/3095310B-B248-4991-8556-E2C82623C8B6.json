They also transport proteins between internal compartments, each of which has a unique composition and a specific function. Transport out of and into cells, and between internal compartments, is crucial for the normal functioning of cells, as well as the inter-cellular communication that is essential in all animals. Defects in these transport steps are associated with many diseases. It is therefore important we understand how this transport operates at the molecular level. The aim of the work in this application is to apply the technique of high-resolution electron microscopy, combined with a variety of modern molecular approaches, to increase our understanding of a number of key transport steps. This will allow us to gain insights into how the transport pathways function in a healthy cell, and consequently how defects in particular aspects of this transport may contribute to disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501725","grantId":"G0501725","fundValue":"151784","fundStart":"2006-09-08","fundEnd":"2009-03-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Lowe","coPersons":["Viki  Allan","Stephen  High","Philip George Woodman"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
