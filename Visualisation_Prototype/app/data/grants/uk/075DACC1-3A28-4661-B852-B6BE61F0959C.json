{"id":"075DACC1-3A28-4661-B852-B6BE61F0959C","title":"Union and Empire: The Making of the United Kingdom in 1707","abstractText":"This project directly relates to a contracted monograph which will examine the making of the Treaty of Union in 1706-07 which still remains, devolution notwithstanding, the constitutional basis for the United Kingdom. The Union is examined not only from the perspectives of Scotland and England, but also in relation to its wider transatlantic and, indeed, transoceanic contexts. A key element is the rehabilitation of political historiographic tendencies which either downplay issues of principle or do not connect political ideas with political processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113145/1","grantId":"113145/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Allan Iain  Macinnes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
