{"id":"18737A58-5BFA-48EF-B94B-DD0652D20540","title":"Engineering soft/hard tissue interfaces","abstractText":"Ligament and tendon injuries are relatively commonplace in patients of all age groups. These connective tissues enable joint locomotion and their injury can result in a debilitating loss of joint function and consequently a significant reduction in a patient's quality of life. Currently, ligament damage is repaired either by using a synthetic material to replace ligament function or by using tissue that is often harvested from elsewhere in the patients body (often from the hamstring or the quadriceps tendon). Failure of these repairs usually occur as a consequence of tensile stress concentrations at the interface with bone (enthesis) that can result in ligament detachment. In normally functioning ligaments, the interface with bone is specially structured with four continuous and yet distinct regions which protect the attachment point by ensuring that it is subject principally to compressive loads. In this work, we will seek to reproduce this structure by interfacing a tissue engineered ligament with a calcium phosphate based anchor material in a bioreactor system. The adhesion of the ligament to the ceramic structure will allow the mechanical conditioning of the tissue outside the body. By providing the necessary mechanical and chemical stimuli to a population of mesenchymal stem cells within the ligament, it may be possible to recreate the specialised enthesis structure in vitro. Ultimately, it is hoped that this multi-component tissue engineered structure will form an intimate bond with bone, resulting in the eventual regeneration of the ligament and enthesis in vivo leading to a better long term clinical outcome for the patient.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G022356/1","grantId":"BB/G022356/1","fundValue":"294175","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Liam Michael Grover","coPersons":["Keith  Baar"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
