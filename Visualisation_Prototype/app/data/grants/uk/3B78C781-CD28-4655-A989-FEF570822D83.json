There are two principal neuronal cell types in the cortex: the projection neurons, which relay information from other regions of the brain, and the interneurons, which interconnect projection neurons and modify their outputs. We are far from understanding how projection neurons and interneurons form functional circuits. As a first step we need to know how many cell types there are and how their different functions are established. At least some neuronal properties are determined during development. Our work aims to determine how and where specific classes of neurons develop in the embryonic brain and whether their sites of origin determine their properties. \nWe will use mice as a model system in this project because we can genetically modify them and mark specific populations of neurons to allow visualization of their sites of origin and long-term fates in the adult brain. \nOur work may provide clues as to whether and how abnormal interneuron development may contribute to human neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia where interneurons have been implicated.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501173","grantId":"G0501173","fundValue":"324025","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicoletta  Kessaris","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
