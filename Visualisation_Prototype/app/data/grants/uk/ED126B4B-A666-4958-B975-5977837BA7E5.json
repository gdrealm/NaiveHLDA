Economies-of-scale especially driven by the semiconductor industry favour solutions based on unmodified commercial processes. The constraints dictated by the varying range of physical dimensions of the different components make wafer-level integration too costly for low-cost mass manufacture. For example, a typical lab-on-chip application may require CMOS components of area in the region of 1-10 sq. mm, MEMS components in the region of 25-100 sq. mm and microfluidics components in the region of 200-2500 sq. mm. Therefore integrating these at wafer level would be hugely wasteful to CMOS/MEMS technologies, as the common lab-on-chip area would be constrained by the requirement of interfacing fluids and external systems to the devices. A common technique for integrating these components at die-level, for example in chemical sensing, includes the following sequence. Wire bonding the chip to a package or substrate, encapsulating the wire bonds in an insulating material, levelling off the top surface, patterning the sensing regions (on chip surface) through the encapsulant, and finally aligning and laying on the microfluidics layers. The main challenges to this approach are all related to the fact that the bond wires are protruding above the sensing surface. In addition to this resulting in crucial reliability issues, the surface geometry is vastly affected, i.e. unwanted wells are created inside the bond pad regions and, the top surface (above the encapsulant) is far from planar- resulting in sealing and thus reliability issues when overlaying the microfluidics. A novel solution to this integration problem is proposed here. The idea is to develop a methodology for interfacing to CMOS chips without any bond wires such that the top chip surface is left planar with no bondpad openings. The challenge is therefore to develop a technique to: (1) provide power and control signals to a CMOS chip and (2) communicate data from the CMOS chip to an external device in a contactless fashion. Furthermore, an added challenge of having no off-chip connections is that no off-chip components, for example, antennas or capacitors can be used- such as in the case of RFID's. We therefore propose to apply optical techniques in a hybrid PCB/CMOS assembly such that the top surface is left virtually planar with all external components being mounted underneath the CMOS die. The scheme intends to supply power and control via an infrared (IR) emitter through the silicon using a relatively large area deep well photodiode to recover power and data. The transmitted light (i.e. non-absorbed photons) can therefore be modulated using electro-optical effects and reflected back through the die to a detector mounted beneath the CMOS die. The data can therefore be extracted from the received signal using relatively simple discrete electronics. Although this scheme is initially intended for hybrid, lab-on-chip applications, the wider scope for exploitation is enormous, with an impacting application-base throughout the microelectronics industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G070466/1","grantId":"EP/G070466/1","fundValue":"153155","fundStart":"2009-10-12","fundEnd":"2012-10-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Research outcomes have been disseminated through journal publication, at a number of conferences, workshops, etc. Any results will be useful to the wider community (biomedical circuits and systems, CMOS photonics) to develop next generation integrated photonic systems.

The constraints dictated by the varying range of physical dimensions of the different components make wafer-level integration too costly for low-cost mass manufacture. A common technique is therefore to integrate these components at die-level; however, this brings on its own challenges. For example, to package a lab-on-chip system for chemical sensing requires careful encapsulation of delicate bond wires and the engineering of a robust seal for fluidic isolation. This presents a question on reliability but also a bottleneck in scalability, i.e. for mass manufacture.\n\nThis research has proposed a radically different approach to solving this interconnect problem. Instead of connecting fine wires between the chip and package, the concept of a truly contactless CMOS lab-on-chip (i.e. zero bond wires) has been put forward. Specifically, this project has explored the feasibility of developing a fully optical link (i.e. delivering power to a chip and communicating data to/from) with the constraint of utilising only unmodified, commercially available CMOS technology and no wired off-chip components. The concept put forward for addressing the challenging data out communication task, involves utilising an external infrared light source (eg. LED), passing this through a CMOS chip (in free space) and detecting the remaining light using an external photodetector. By implementing an optical modulator on-chip using simple pn-junctions, the free-carrier absorption in the optical path can be controlled and thus data can be encoded and communicated to the external photodetector. The chip can be powered through a simple solar cell arrangement (using an on-chip photodiode).\n\nSpecific project outcomes include:\n\n- Demonstrating the world's first implementation of a free-space optical modulator in unmodified, commercially available CMOS technology. This is significant because silicon is an indirect bandgap material and therefore light sources cannot be efficiently integrated.\n\n- Investigating the effect of free carrier absorption in silicon CMOS technology, the key parameters (eg. doping concentration, device topology and structure, optical wavelength, alignment, etc) and compared performance at three different process nodes (specifically 0.13, 0.18 and 0.35 micron).\n\n- Developing an optoelectronic test platform (i.e. laboratory apparatus) for a free space optical link between discrete (external) devices (i.e. light source and detector) and an integrated circuit based modulator. Specific features include: (1) multiple light sources (eg. infrared/visible-light lasers/LEDs/incandescent sources), (2) precise alignment and positioning, (3) continuous-time or phase-locked detection.\n\n- Prototyping several integrated devices, circuits and systems for optical scavenging (parasitic pn-junction photodiode structures) and power management (charge pumps, regulators, bias references) to provide a stable on-chip power supply towards developing truly contactless CMOS chips.\n\n- Securing the background intellectual property to this invention.\n\nAll the project outcomes listed above have/are in process of been disseminated in peer reviewed publications (available open access via our institutional library portal).\n\nOngoing and future research will concentrate on further optimizing the structures that have already been developed towards the monolithic integration in commercial lab-on-chip platforms.
