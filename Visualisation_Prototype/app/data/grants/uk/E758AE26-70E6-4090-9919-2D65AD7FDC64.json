Herpesviruses can also increase the risk of certain types of cancer, and can cause life-threatening conditions in immune-suppressed people, such as transplant patients. To be able to treat and control infections by these viruses, it is crucial that we understanding how these viruses infect us, how they produce new copies of themselves, and how they spread to new people. The research being proposed will use cell culture models to study the way in which herpesviruses control our cells own machinery in order to form new copies of the virus. Overall, the information gained from this research will give a greater understanding of how this important family of viruses can infect and replicate in our cells. Such information will hopefully identify new targets that could be inhibited by drugs to combat these viruses and the many diseases caused by them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700129","grantId":"G0700129","fundValue":"390999","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Crump","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
