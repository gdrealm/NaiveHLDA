In an initial experiment it has been discovered that ruthenium dioxide powders exposed to microwave energy in a conventional domestic oven can self assemble into a 3 dimensional micro-wire spiral structure. This project will focus on examining the nature of these spirals using a variety of microscopic techniques to determine whether this is a generic route to creating novel structures for other oxide materials with similar dielectric properties. Such structured materials will be likely to have applications in catalysis and in electrical components for novel power sources. It is also possible that the product of irradiation with microwaves is metallic in which case there is an option for winning rare metals from their ores in a unique manner.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D048869/1","grantId":"EP/D048869/1","fundValue":"57104","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Worsley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":" A domestic microwave oven can be used to extract valuable metals (like ruthenium) from their oxides under atmospheric conditions (or under nitrogen). These are normally very high energy processes so the fact that it can occur in a 600W oven is exciting; the extraction of metals in this way using only electricity is also potentially important in the future for exploiting metal resources in non terrestrial applications. The other interesting finding is that the metal particles self assemble into wire like structures and these themselves could be interesting catalysts. The interesting finding in this work was that microwave ovens can extract metals from what are refractory oxides. This has potential application for non terrestrial metals exploration. The self assembly of metal wires from oxides also has potential applications in electronics and the high surface area structures could be good catalysts. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
