Key overarching questions for our network included whether Indian voters are shifting from identity and patronage-based to issue-based motivations for voting; the impact of urbanisation on electoral patterns; and the behaviour of voters at different levels of election (village, state and national). Original research by members of the UK-based team of this India-Europe research network has focused on two major themes under these overarching questions:\n\n1) ISSUES, PATRONAGE AND IDENTITIES IN ELECTIONS \nOliver Heath and Louise Tillin have conducted original survey research in 2013-14 to assess government performance versus patronage as explanations for voter behaviour. A survey conducted across two central Indian states has shown that where institutional performance is stronger and service delivery more reliable, voters are less responsive to small clientelistic inducements to vote (such as small sums of money or gifts in kind), but as the size of clientelistic inducement increases the effects of institutional performance on voter behaviour declines.\n\nFurther research by Heath in collaboration with other network members (Sanjay Kumar and Gilles Verniers) conducted in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh has looked at aspects of identity, including the effects of co-religiosity on voter behaviour. They find that Muslims are more likely to vote for Muslim candidates, but only when those candidates have a realistic chance of winning - there is thus a strong strategic element to their vote calculus. Moreover, they show that Hindus do not discriminate against Muslim candidates, and that parties do not face an electoral penalty for fielding a Muslim candidate.\n \n2) WHY DO VOTERS VOTE? \nEthnographic research coordinated by Mukulika Banerjee in seven field sites in local, state and national elections has focused on the question of why amidst (and notwithstanding) severe disadvantage and deprivation, voters turn out in large numbers in Indian elections. The field work and research done for this project has led to considerable advancement of thinking on the issues that voters consider significant while making their electoral choices. The ethnographies unravel the embedded contexts within which voter deliberations are done, as also the meanings they attach to this activity. Both the context and the meaning are missed out in large-scale surveys of voter-opinions and political trends. Besides, new efforts have been made to fine-tune the research methods to cover urban areas, which involve a significant difference of context, and are under-researched as yet. In addition to ethnographic studies, other members of the UK-based team are using quantitative methodologies to understand variation in election turnout. In addition, Heath and Adam Ziegfeld are using quantitative methods to understand factors impinging on levels of turnout. Their ongoing research assesses the impact of new parties on levels of turnout. Network activities include methodology workshops and future planned publications to investigate the contribution of mixed method research to understanding the question of turnout and why voters vote.\n\nIn addition to these two major themes, other members of the UK-based team have studied electoral patterns in individual states; and furthered capacity building aims of the original grant proposal including supporting research activities at partner NGO Janaagraha, and involving PhD students from partner institutions in conferences and publications of the network. Findings on public service delivery and voter behaviour will be of interest to government and third sector organisations in India interested in questions of accountability and improving policy outcomes for the poor. We intend to publish both in academic venues and more publicly accessible venues in India such as Economic and Political Weekly to enhance the impact and accessibility of our findings. Survey data analysed in the publications will be made available where practicable. \n\nEthnographic data and quantitative analysis of electoral participation and turnout levels will be of value to partners such as the Election Commission of India, who are key interlocutors for this project (former Chief Election Commissioner of India has attended two workshops of the network in London).\n\nFurthermore, the research on election dynamics conducted by the multiple members of the network is of relevance to a wide range of organisations including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, international media, emerging market risk analysts and business communities - we are engaged with such bodies in multiple ways, and as our research reaches fruition will seek to further our dissemination activities to reach broader audiences as well as academic peers.
