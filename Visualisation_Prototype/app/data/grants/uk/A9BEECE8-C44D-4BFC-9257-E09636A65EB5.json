{"id":"A9BEECE8-C44D-4BFC-9257-E09636A65EB5","title":"Novel Devices for Light Control Based on Suspended Semiconductor Nanocrystals and Nanostructures","abstractText":"This project is at the interface between colloid chemistry and electronic engineering. It is aimed at the development of novel devices for optoelectronic applications. The devices are based on colloidal suspensions of electrically polarised particles, which perform similarly to liquid-crystalline materials. Suspended semiconductor nanoparticles and heterostructures will be used for control of electronic and optical properties of the systems. We are aiming to combine two novel ides and approaches: (i) a chemical approach to create a fabrication method for nanoparticles of permanent electric dipolar moment based on freezing the polarisation of microemulsion drops, which produces colloidal liquid crystals , and (ii) an engineering approach to develop novel Suspended Semiconductor Particle Devices for light control based on semiconductor nanocrystals and heterostructures. We will develop these ideas to produce colloid liquid crystals based on semiconductor materials. This would allow us to use weak electric fields to control the optical and electronic properties of thin films of suspended semiconductor particles. The successful combination of these new ideas would provide a route to fabrication of completely novel devices for light control with a number of optoelectronic applications, like large TV displays, electronic paper, sky roofs and smart windows.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C53431X/1","grantId":"EP/C53431X/1","fundValue":"189760","fundStart":"2006-03-31","fundEnd":"2008-03-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vesselin N.
