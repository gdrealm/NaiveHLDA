{"id":"DAA14015-7D83-4AE0-8628-7E1701F3D2D7","title":"Renewal of Collaborative Computational Project 2","abstractText":"CCP2 has been very active in sponsoring UK collaborations in atomic and molecular collisions, interactions with high intensity laser light and anti-matter physics for well over 2 decades. These core areas have led to a large number of scientific `firsts' (outlined in the case for support), development of the UK R-matrix codes and even a spin-off company. CCP2 now proposes to broaden its scope to encompass - in addition- areas of atomic physics, such as topics in cold atom physics and quantum information not presently covered by any CCP activity.Funding is sought for networking activities such as visits between collaborators within the UK institutions, overseas travel, workshops and meetings on topical activities as well as meetings of the working group itself.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G003459/1","grantId":"EP/G003459/1","fundValue":"64858","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tania  Monteiro","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
