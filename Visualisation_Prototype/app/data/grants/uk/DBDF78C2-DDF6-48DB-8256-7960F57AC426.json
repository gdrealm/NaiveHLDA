Whilst the policy approach is set nationally by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) each prison develops a local policy framework to promote equality and reduce discrimination across eight 'protected characteristics'; race, sex, disability, sexual orientation, religion and belief, age, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity (MOJ, 2012).</p>\n\n<p>The research aims to develop a body of knowledge about the response to diversity in public and private sector prisons using three prisons from the Yorkshire region as case studies.</p>\n\n<p>The three year project will adopt an appreciative inquiry methodology to explore:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>how prisoners in diverse minority groupings experience diversity policies and procedures in place at each establishment</li>\n\n <li>which aspects of policies, procedures and practices in each prison are perceived by minority groups to promote feelings of respect and well-being</li>\n\n <li>how prison staff experience policies and procedures that guide their practice with prisoners from diverse minority groupings</li>\n\n <li>ways in which diversity policies, procedures and practices in each prison could be improved to promote a greater feeling of respect and well-being in minority groups</li>\n\n <li>explore and develop theories of intersectionality as a way of understanding how people experience prison life.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005049/1","grantId":"ES/K005049/1","fundValue":"644514","fundStart":"2013-09-09","fundEnd":"2016-09-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Nothing to report at this stage in the project  ","person":"Victoria Jane Lavis","coPersons":["Charles Middleton Elliott"],"organisation":"University of Bradford","findingsText":" No findings to report at this stage in the project Nothing to report at this stage in the project Other","dataset":"gtr"}
