{"id":"8344DAD5-7CAE-4F83-85BA-3E7AD68343AA","title":"SKA industrial engagement","abstractText":"The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a large, next-generation radio telescope that is planned to be many times more\nsensitive than the current most sensitive telescopes in the world and transform our view of the Universe. It is a global\nmega-science project involving scientists and engineers from institutes and industry partners in more than 20 countries. It\nwill be a radio interferometer with an aggregate collecting area of about 1 million square metres spread over at least 3000\nkm and operating in the frequency range ~50 MHz to 20 GHz. It is one of a small number of flagship astronomical\ninstruments that will span the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma rays, and beyond the electromagnetic\nspectrum to gravitational waves, cosmic rays and neutrinos, and whose collective aim is chart the full history of the\nuniverse from its beginnings in the Big Bang to the present day.\nIn March 2013 the international SKA Office issued a request for proposals (RfP) for consortia to bid for work-packages to\nundertake the detailed design of the various elements of the SKA telescope and successful consortia were awarded the\nwork by the SKA Board in October. The University of Manchester is the lead institute for the SADT and SAT consortium\nand is also playing leading roles in three other consortia - NIP in the Central Signal Processing and Science Data\nProcessing consortia, and MFAA antenna design in the Aperture Array consortium. The work to be carried out under this\ngrant focusses on delivering the agreed designs to Critical Design Review level and to produce the procurement\ndocumentation to allow the SKA to move forward to a build phase. The various areas being explored as part of this grant\nare described below.\n1) SADT and SAT. The SKA can be regarded as a vast sensor network whose backbone is an optical fibre network linking\nall elements of the system, from the collectors (dishes, aperture arrays) to the correlator, to the high performance computer\nscience data processor, and on to the national and regional science centres around the world. The University of\nManchester leads the consortium working on the optical fibre network and the options for transporting the signals\nthroughout the SKA, as well as on generation and distribution of the synchronisation and timing signals that are used\nthroughout the telescope.\n2) NIP. One of the key science projects for the SKA centres on searching for, and then making exquisitely precise timing\nmeasurements of, pulsars. This will allow new tests to be performed on Einstein's theory of General Relativity and give the\npossibility to detect gravity waves. To perform these experiments requires construction of dedicated Non-Imaging\nProcessing (NIP) hardware. This NIP development is being led by the Manchester team.\n3) MFAA. Finally, a team from the Electrical and Electronic Engineering department in the University is developing a new\nreceptor technology known as an Octagonal Ring Antenna (ORA) as part of an aperture array. This offers the possibility of\nextremely sensitive simultaneous measurements over large fractions of the sky at the lower end of the SKA's frequency band.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M007561/1","grantId":"ST/M007561/1","fundValue":"206660","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Keith James Grainge","coPersons":["Benjamin Willem Stappers","Anthony  Brown","Michael John Keith"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
