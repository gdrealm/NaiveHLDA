Over the next twenty years, progressive reformers, machine politicians, police officials, and participants in commercial leisure contested the place of vice in American cities. The districts thrived by flouting the law but their existence set legal precedents that restricted civil liberties. Reformers closed the districts with assistance of the federal government during the First World War but the prohibition undermined pre-war strategies for regulating vice and fundamentally altered the organisation of crime.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113156/1","grantId":"113156/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mara  Keire","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
