{"id":"BF1BF752-4771-4C7E-920C-4A14959E2086","title":"Real-time high sensitivity detection of biological agents","abstractText":"For security and defence purposes, for example in battlefield settings or at airports or other public buildings, it is important to be able to detect harmful biological substances such as proteins and viruses and bacteria. These types of biological agents can often be detected by using complex time-consuming tests based on antibodies. Antibodies are large proteins produced by humans and other mammals as part of their immune system to recognise invading agents such as viruses and bacteria to protect the body. They are therefore very good at recognising other molecules, but their large size and complex structure make them difficult to produce to the same quality all the time, and they are not very stable to temperature or harsh treatment. This means they are not ideal for building biosensors for long shelf life and use in a wide range of difficult environments. \n\nOur work focuses on an area called synthetic biology, which the BBSRC defines as &quot;Linking bioscience, engineering and computer sciences to develop rationally designed biological parts, devices and systems&quot;. We are proposing to integrate engineered biological molecules with electronic devices to provide efficient and simple methods for the sensitive detection of biological agents such as proteins, viruses and bacteria. We will generate a molecular signal amplification process which is only switched on upon successful and specific detection of the harmful biological substances.\n\nWe will produce small proteins that mimic the binding properties of antibodies, but which are simple to produce and are robust and highly stable. We will produce two of these that bind to a target protein and will link these to other biological parts including something we call a split enzyme which will only be able to reform once both the antibody-type protein bind to the target protein. This reformed enzyme will lead to an amplification of the binding signal allowing sensitive detection of the target protein. We will test how well the new device works and in future can develop biosensors that detect multiple different target proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J020370/1","grantId":"BB/J020370/1","fundValue":"129243","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings on screens against TNT and derivatives demonstrating exquisite discrimination at the molecular level are currently being written as a research publication. \n\nThe work is underpinning the contract that is currently being finalised with DSTL.
