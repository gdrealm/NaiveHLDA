{"id":"1A5A35EA-D54D-4AA0-A214-3FECFD966A37","title":"Disambiguation of Verbs by Collocation","abstractText":"In this project, we propose using statistical approaches to the analysis of corpus data in order to discover Typical Usage Patterns (TUPs) and hence create a resource for the Disambiguation of Verbs by Collocation (DVC). This project goes beyond the current state-of-the-art represented by word sense disambiguation based on machine-readable dictionaries; typical valency-based approaches, which rarely pay attention to collocations; WordNet, which does not analyse lexical syntagmatics or collocates; and semantic role labelling, which tags mainly thematic roles (e.g. Agent, Patient, Location), rather than semantic types (e.g. Human, Firearm, Route). In our project we propose to associate meanings with normal usage patterns, rather than words in isolation, and to integrate lexical collocations with valency, providing an empirically well-founded resource for use in mapping meaning onto word use in free text. DVC will show the comparative frequency of each pattern of each verb, enabling programs to develop statistically based probabilistic reasoning about meanings, rather than trying to evaluate all possibilities equally.\n\nThe internal structure of lexical arguments of verbs will be analysed using computational linguistics techniques, so that for example the relationship between &quot;repair the roof&quot; and &quot;repair the damage&quot; is recognized. Even though the nouns &quot;roof&quot; and &quot;damage&quot; have different semantic types, they activate the same meaning of &quot;repair&quot;. Once this has been done, the structural relationship is applied to other verbs, e.g. &quot;treat a patient&quot; and &quot;treat his injuries&quot;.\n\nIn a pilot project at Masaryk University, Brno, CZ (http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/projects/cpa/), involving analysis of 700 verbs, Prof. Hanks, the co-investigator of the project, showed that, while words may be highly ambiguous, patterns are rarely ambiguous and, furthermore, most uses of most verbs can be assigned unambiguously to a pattern. The existing verbs will be used to train a statistical method the output from which will be verified lexicographically. As the number of annotated verbs increases, the training procedure will be repeated and so improve the accuracy and speed of the annotation. At each step, the researchers employed by the project will analyse the computer output and correct errors. The objective of the DVC project is to analyse 3000 common English verbs and annotate at least 250 corpus lines for each verb. An in-depth data analysis of 100 verbs will be carried out. The resource will be made publicly available at the end of the project.\n\nThe DVC project is based on and will contribute to the Theory of Norms and Exploitations (TNE) of Prof. Hanks. TNE says, in essence, that a language consists of two interlinked systems of rules governing word use: a set of rules for the normal uses of words and a second-order set of rules governing the ways in which normal patterns are exploited. Exploitations are deliberately unusual utterances. They play a large role in linguistic change (word-meaning change). as today's exploitation may become tomorrow's norm. \n\nThe value of DVC will be proven by textual entailment and paraphrasing, in this way demonstrating its potential usefulness in a large number of fields of computational linguistics which benefit from these two applications.\n\nThe project will be disseminated using a wide variety of means. A fully user-friendly publicly available website will contain news about the progress of the project and will provide links to project research papers. It will also host interactive demos that will enable visitors to see the patterns collected and test the technologies developed in the project. Papers will be submitted to international conference and peer-reviewed journals. Evaluation conferences such as SEMEVAL and RTE will be used to assess the methods developed in this project in a standard environment. An important outcome of the project will be a monograph (theory, methodology, empirical findings).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J005940/1","grantId":"AH/J005940/1","fundValue":"605586","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The Pattern Dictionary of English Verbs is becoming widely accepted among computational linguists in Europe as a resource similar to FrameNet, a foundation tool for computational applications, language teaching, and (of course) future dictionaries. \nProfessor Hanks' monograph, Lexical Analysis, the Theory of Norms and Exploitations, is recognized Internationally as an important contribution to the theory of meaning in language.

The project has demonstrated through empirical analysis of corpus evidence that meanings are, in many cases, not properties of individual words but rather that there is s close link between meanings and patterns of word use. The full extent of such links and the nature of patterns of word use are subjects of ongoing investigation.\n\nCompleted work on DVC is being made freely available to the public, as the project progresses, at the purpose-built, dynamic website http://pdev.org.uk. \n\nIn close collaboration with our subcontractor (NLP Consulting s.r.o. of Brno, CZ), we have designed, tested, debugged, and implemented a specially designed database for storing and processing verb patterns and their implicatures. This database is designed as a fundamental resource for use in both computational linguistics and language teaching. It is a basis for future work on activities such as pattern prediction, analysis of entailments and presuppositions, machine translation, and text generation. We also foresee applications in language teaching such as development of a lexical syllabus component and error correction. \n\nWe have built a hierarchical 'shallow ontology' inventory of 230 semantic types for the classification of noun arguments, to facilitate pattern creation for verb sense disambiguation. For example, consider the verb execute: the meaning of &amp;amp;amp;quot;They executed the rebels&amp;amp;amp;quot; is distinguished from &amp;amp;amp;quot;They executed his orders&amp;amp;amp;quot; only by means of the contrasting semantic types of the two nouns in the direct-object position, namely [[Human]] vs. [[Speech Act]]. Unlike any other ontology, the DVC shallow ontology has been created by empirical observation of the smallest number of contrasting semantic types needed for verb sense disambiguation. A corpus-driven mechanism for populating each semantic type with sets of lexical items has been developed. A comparison of the DVC shallow ontology with more elaborate (but possibly less well-founded) ontologies such as SUMO and DOLCE and with the semantics of WordNet and EuroWordNet is in process.\n\nA SEMEVAL (semantic evaluation) exercise has been accepted for its 2015 edition. This involves a collaboration between research centres across Europe, including Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento and The Centre for Natural Language Processing, Brno. The goal of this exercise is to bring the resources created by the DVC project to the attention of the Natural Language Processing community and encourage their use in real-world applications such as statistical machine translation. The prototypical patterns of word use established by DVC can be used as a reference point for the comparative investigation of specialized corpora and literary texts.\n\nA by-product of DVC is new insights into the nature of and possibilities for creative uses of 'exploitations' of normal, conventional word uses. It is our intention that these insights will be used to improve English Language teaching methodologies and resources. Applied linguists studying creative and non-literal language have also expressed an interest in using this data.\n\nAnother by-product of this work is Hanks's theory of semantic resonance; this will be the subject of a funding application in due course.
