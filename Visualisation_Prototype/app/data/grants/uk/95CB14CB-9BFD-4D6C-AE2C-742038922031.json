{"id":"95CB14CB-9BFD-4D6C-AE2C-742038922031","title":"The Wollaton Medieval Manuscripts: texts, owners and readers","abstractText":"The medieval manuscripts from Wollaton Hall library are a rare survival. Despite their significance they are not well known and none has been edited in full. They have been curated by the University of Nottingham since 1947 as part of a family archive (the Middleton Collection). Most were described in 1911 for the Historical Manuscripts Commission. Their loan status excluded them from Ker's Medieval Manuscripts in British Libraries, and their fragile condition discouraged access and display. In July 2007 the situation changed, with a Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) award for the purchase of 10 key manuscripts and for their preservation, digitisation and public display. \\n\\nThis project proposes a programme of research which will maximise the opportunity presented by the HLF award by adding significant research value to the dissemination aspects of the HLF project.\\n\\nThe project will focus on 11 medieval manuscripts. The 10 purchased and the Wollaton Antiphonal which is also held by the University. The manuscripts include major literary works of significance for understanding the culture (local, national and European) of the period 1300-1500. The research will focus around 10 themes, selected to bring out the strengths of the collection and identify further areas of research potential. These themes will be explored by a team of distinguished academics:\\n\\ni. Development and history of a medieval library (Prof. Ralph Hanna, University of Oxford, Dr Dorothy Johnston, University of Nottingham, Prof Thorlac Turville-Petre, University of Nottingham) \\nii. Middle English literature in the East Midlands (Prof. Turville-Petre)\\niii. The Wollaton Antiphonal and regional art (Dr Alixe Bovey, University of Kent)\\niv. Aspects of English liturgical music (Dr Nicolas Bell, British Library)\\nv. Medieval English bindings and fragments (Prof. Hanna)\\nvi. The manuscripts as physical artefacts and their preservation (tbc)\\nvii. Education of the laity and lay readership, 13th-15th centuries (Dr Robert Lutton, University of Nottingham)\\nviii. The manuscripts of Gower's Confessio Amantis (Emeritus Prof. Derek Pearsall, Harvard)\\nix. A collection of French romances and fabliaux (LM 6) in its French context (Prof Alison Stones, University of Pittsburgh) \\nxi. Hagiography and the cult of St Zita in Eastern England (Prof. Caroline Barron, Royal Holloway, University of London)\\n\\nThe project aims to draw the academic contributors together as a network of scholars from across disciplines and institutions, with a shared interest in the manuscript collection. An advisory panel of scholars will also steer the research project and contribute to the network. The advisory panel will be largely, but not exclusively, drawn from the University of Nottingham, to encourage its researchers to engage with the newly purchased collection. \\n\\nTwo workshops (the first closed and the second open to the public) will bring the network together formally on two occasions. The network will also be supported through a dedicated research page on the HLF-funded manuscripts website. The Keeper of the Special Collections archive will foster the development of the network and will explore and support future research partnerships with the network group. \\n\\nThe outcomes of the project will consist of a major scholarly catalogue of the manuscripts, with essays on different research questions as outlined above; a static exhibition at the University's Lake Side Arts Centre (Western Gallery), complemented by a touring exhibition for the region, and enhanced research content of HLF-funded initiatives - i.e. the manuscripts web pages and e-learning initiative for schools.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G000662/1","grantId":"AH/G000662/1","fundValue":"243162","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Thorlac  Turville-Petre","coPersons":["Ralph  Hanna"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
