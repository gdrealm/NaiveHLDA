Our efforts will focus on the addition of electrons to a variety of organic compounds because this process can transform them into especially useful new derivatives.We aim to use an electron shuttle to transfer electrons from the surface of a metal to the organic compound in question; an understanding of the way that this works is of paramount importance if we are to optimise and harness it. By using a combination of electochemistry and preparative chemistry, we aim to delve deep into the mechanism of a complex process and emerge with a range of new reducing conditions.This will result in the development of selective new reduction reactions, which is important to chemical industry as well as academia because it enables valuable organic compounds to be prepared quickly and efficiently with minimisation of cost and waste produced.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E017738/1","grantId":"EP/E017738/1","fundValue":"347706","fundStart":"2007-12-08","fundEnd":"2009-12-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Used to make complex organic molecules.
