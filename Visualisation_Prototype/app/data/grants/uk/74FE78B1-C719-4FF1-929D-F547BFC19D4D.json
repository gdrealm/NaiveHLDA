We plan through this current study to benchmark our expression technology against those systems currently available in the marketplace. This study will showcase the key areas of technical superiority of our technology, inform its subsequent positioning in the market place, inform our business planning and act as an enabling primer for private equity investment. The outputs from this grant will lead to partnering collaborations with industry, provide impact for BBSRC funded research, and potentially lead to wealth generation and job creation for the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J019089/1","grantId":"BB/J019089/1","fundValue":"146160","fundStart":"2012-06-18","fundEnd":"2013-09-17","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  see final report submitted to bbsrc  ","person":"Jason  Micklefield","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" see final report submitted to bbsrc see final report submitted to bbsrc Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
