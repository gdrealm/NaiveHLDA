{"id":"003BCBB3-AFAC-45D8-867F-90DECEFC3C5D","title":"Eros, Eris and Empire: A Companion to Golden Age Love Poetry.","abstractText":"This project will offer the first book-length study in English of one of the most important bodies of verse in European literature: the amorous lyric of Imperial Spain (extending from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the mid seventeenth century). The volume will open new horizons in the interpretations of major poets of the period (Garcilaso de la Vega, Herrera, Lope de Vega, Quevedo and G&oacute;ngora), but will also consider, as appropriate, the work of lesser-known contemporaries. Beyond a re-evaluation of critical responses to the love poetry, the texts will be explored in terms of the unresolved issues at the heart of what has recently been termed the 'transvaluation of values' (Creel) by means of which Renaissance secular culture is said to have overthrown the asceto-monastic traditionalism of the Middle Ages. By interrogating the poetic practises of these poets within a developing generic context, and in terms of an aesthetic response to the crisis of early modernity, this book will engage with historical moment, but disengage critically (and respectfully) with the substantial body of biographical research which (post Lapesa) has tended to dominate approaches to elegiac love lyric. While each chapter will offer discreet studies, highlighting the artistic concerns of individual poets, the volume as a whole will be informed by an intellectually coherent objective: to challenge the generally accepted vision of harmonious Renaissance voices crossing over a resisting Rubicon into a rebellious Baroque. The intention is to move beyond the theory of the 'epistemic break' (ontological and political) that is associated with the anti-mimetic impulses of seventeenth-century verse, and the break-down of a world view based on absolutes, in order to demonstrate the multiperspectivism and subjectivity that countered Imperial ideology even in the earliest sixteenth-century poets. The book will explore a wide range of issues including the practise of imitation and emulationin Renaissance poetics, the rhetorical nature of lyric subjectivity, and the complex inter-relationship between writer, text and reader. In order to appeal to as wide a public as possible all foreign language quotations will be translated into English. The book is under contract to Tamesis (delivery 2009, for publication 2010) and will appear as part of their prestigious Companion series. This was an invited commission envisaged as a single authored follow-up to Jonathan Thacker's Companion to Golden Age Theatre (see Victor Dixon's review, TLS, issue 5452, 2007, p. 26).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G005737/1","grantId":"AH/G005737/1","fundValue":"28712","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project was funded as part of the AHRC Research Leave Scheme which did not require an explicit Impact dimension.

Eros, Eris and Empire', Tamesis, 2013). At the core of the project is a critical re-evaluation of one of the most important bodies of verse in European literature - the amorous lyric of Imperial Spain. By analysing the poetic texts as an aesthetic response to the contradictory currents of containment and subversion which characterised the period, and by providing a material context for the literary analysis presented, the project situates early modern Spanish poetry in terms of the problematic evolution of Hispanic modernity. \n\n\n\nThe following findings have emerged:\n\n1. A demonstration of how representational amorous texts of the period expose a complex correlation of historical experience and literary expression.\n\nAnalysis reveals that the primary tension in early modern Spanish poetics derives from the fraught interaction of the macrocosm with the smaller world of the resistant, sentient individual. In opposition to recent anti-imperialist readings of Garcilaso's poetry, for instance, this project urges caution. Where counter-heroic or counter imperialistic impulses are discernible in sixteenth-century texts these are not easily disentangled from this mutually intrusive context, nor from a dialectic of private and public self-hood that is subjectively and ambivalently experienced. \n\nA re-evaluation of traditional responses to the work of 16th-century poets, such as Garcilaso and Herrera, reveals how transgressive strategies, which serve to disturb linear chronology and to unsettle spatial perspectives, resist the regulation of borders and seem to promote systems of cultural free exchange. However, these are often balanced by regressive narcissistic turns to self-texturing that communicate a burden of cultural/collective geography and of personal history.\n\n\n\n2. The project findings contribute in interesting ways to wider debates concerning the significance of historical perspective.\n\nA key achievement of the project has been to advance the theoretical debate on readership: the challenge for the modern reader of Renaissance texts which are intertextually saturated (i.e. which signal their own proximity to and distance from Classical models) involves the ability 'to situate ourselves knowingly' (Tuve) in two distinct moments of cultural production. My analysis of these poems recognises that the creative process under consideration is a fragile indeterminate mix of synchronic and diachronic perspectives. All of the lyric poets treated in the various studies, in different ways, are shown to give the body of their time the illusion of individual feeling and each poem, on its own terms, creates a reader after its own heart. The fashioning of the reader by a conflicted 'self-fashioned' poetic subject informs the interrogation of a poetics of memory that involves the co-operation of an active, informed, reader. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.The project suggests a move beyond the theory of the epistemic break.\n\nThis project exposes the limitations and risks of approaching Baroque poets such as Quevedo and G&oacute;ngora as oppositional models of a stable Renaissance poetics. By demonstrating how traditional responses to Renaissance/sixteenth-century poetry (especially those which cling to Neoplatonic paradigms) have failed to recognise the counter-harmonising principles that encompass the material, the spiritual and the aesthetic, we are compelled to rethink conventional notions of 'break'/'rupture.' The outcome is a recognition that this very 'rupture' is itself an emulative transfiguration of a Renaissance poetics still very much in progress (as evidenced in Herrera and in the Rimas humanas [1609] of Lope); a fluid project of transvaluation that involved the transformation of values that were more problematically forged (e.g. in Garcilaso) and plurally perceived (in Quevedo and G&oacute;ngora) than we have been prepared to acknowledge. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe published monograph draws all the strands of the project together and is concerned with a broader evaluation of early modern poetics that foregrounds the processes rather than the products of thinking. The locus of the study is the Imperial ‘home’ space, where love poetry meets early modern empire at the inception of a very conflicted national consciousness, and where the vernacular language, Castilian, emerges in the encounter as a strategic site of national and imperial identity. The political is, therefore, a pervasive presence, teased out where relevant in recognition of the poet’s sensitivity to the ideologies within which writing comes into being. The primary commitment of the book, however, is to lyric poetry, and to poets, individually and in their dynamic interconnectedness. Moving beyond a re-evaluation of critical responses to four major poets of the period (Garcilaso de la Vega, Herrera, G&oacute;ngora and Quevedo), the book disengages respectfully with the substantial body of biographical research that continues to impact upon our understanding of the genre, and renegotiates the Foucauldian concept of the ‘epistemic break’ (see 3 above), often associated with the anti-mimetic impulses of the Baroque. This more flexible model accommodates the multiperspectivism that interrogated Imperial ideology even in the earliest sixteenth-century poetry, and allows for the exploration of new horizons in interpretation.\n\n\n\nSummary of the significance of research findings for the academic community:\n\n\n\nThis project offers a detailed reassessment of Golden Age Spanish love poetry from Garcilaso to Quevedo (with particular emphasis on the earlier period of the Renaissance) in the light of modern theories of transvaluation, lyric subjectivity, liminality, self-fashioning, reader-response (as/when appropriate); but it also takes into account Renaissance theories of imitation and emulation and is informed by a scholarly sensitivity to the role of Classical theoretical and literary models.\n\nAs such it advances debate and understanding within the subject-specific research community with regard to the following:\n\n1. The relationship between eros and eristic imitation: how the anxieties surrounding autonomous and imitative discourse reflect wider socio-cultural concerns about the instability of status and identity.\n\n2. The function of rhetoric within the frame of imitative/emulative poetics.\n\n3. The complex relationship between the intimate space of the poem and the public space of the reader.\n\n4. The self-fashioning of the lyric subject (and reader) and how this relates to crises of authority and control that characterise the broader historical, social and religious context of Renaissance and counter-Renaissance Spain.\n\n\n\nIn broader terms the project advances knowledge and understanding by:\n\n - opening new horizons in the reading of canonical texts of the period\n\n - positing a plural vision of the 'Spanish Renaissance' which challenges the concept of a late 16th-century, anti-mimetic, 'epistemic break' \n\n - recognising the cognitive potential of analogical interpretation within an historical model that seeks to develop (however imperfectly) a working contemporaneity with the early modern and the Classical worlds. Ultimately the analytical dimension of the project is forged in an awareness that points of identification with the past can become sites of interrogation upon which to build the future. Although this project will undoubtedly have greatest intellectual impact within the subject area, the outputs associated with it will also have a wide dissemination among students and scholars of peninsular literature worldwide, and should also be of interest to other less specialist readers in English and Romance Language Renaissance Studies. All the quotations are translated into English. The book-length study, in particular, has been conceived and designed to facilitate and promote the dissemination of the research to non-academic readers interested in Renaissance literature and culture.
