An earlier seminar series considered a range of issues around identification, intervention, education and social development for these children, during which it emerged that there is a pressing need for clearer approaches to assessment before further advances can be made. Comprehensive development of appropriate standardised assessment materials for the very large number of languages other than English spoken in the UK is unrealistic; the current seminar explored alternative possibilities, with a particular emphasis on facilitating collaborative research bids from the participants. The series had the following aims:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Establishment of methodological principles for development of cross-linguistic and bilingual assessments for communication impairment.</li>\n\n <li>Facilitating and supporting collaborative research bids in this area.</li>\n\n <li>Development of techniques to evaluate assessment procedures based on translations and/or adaptations of existing tests.</li>\n\n <li>Appropriate dissemination of output to practitioners and professional bodies.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0707","grantId":"RES-451-26-0707","fundValue":"15398","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Carolyn Ann Letts","coPersons":["Ghada  Khattab"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
