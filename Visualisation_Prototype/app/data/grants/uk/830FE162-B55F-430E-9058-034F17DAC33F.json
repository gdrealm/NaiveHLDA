This has resulted in positive comments. Although it might be na&iuml;ve to expect policy makers to take some of these on board given the contentious and critical nature of the work we have had positive feedback from the policy makers we have interviewed. For example, Jennifer Cole of RUSI (Royal United Services Institute) was interested in the findings in terms of community preparedness. However, most specifically we have had impacts on teenagers and emergency planners in Sussex as a result of the ethnographic and performance work. The young people and the emergency planning professionals who participated in Emergency Exercise 2010, the performance ethnography, were invited to participate in an internet forum after the event to reflect on the project; their responses showed that the young people learnt about the world of preparedness, which they had hitherto known little about, through the performance of the exercise; the young people especially appreciated being allowed into a preparedness site, a nuclear bunker, and this privilege both gave them a feeling of power, but also of responsibility; the professionals involved realised that the contribution that young people may make to preparedness would be useful in the future, this was something they had sought before with little success via questionnaires, but also the professionals discovered the negative preconceptions of emergency professionals, as seen by the young people involved.

Contemporary preparedness makes use of a spectrum of pedagogies\nincluding public and dramaturgical.\nContemporary preparedness efforts rely on a mixture of pedagogies. The use of text\ninstructions, memory aids, reconstruction activities, and information technologies and\nvideo (as illustrated by the site produced by Avery, 2009) are frequently part of the\npedagogical mix that becomes part of a fused pedagogy of affect, behaviour, and\ncognition (Preston, 2009a). These can be analysed not just in terms of ‘conventional’\npedagogical categories. Firstly, they can be examined as public pedagogies, popular\ncultural forms that are pedagogical through enactment rather than (necessarily) direct\nteaching (Preston, 2009b). Secondly, drama and performance are employed in\ncontemporary sites of preparedness to produce ‘theatres of survival’ (Chakrabarty,\n2010a – conference paper) which are often racially orientated towards the\nrepresentation of and prioritising of ‘white’ racial interests (Chakrabarty, 2011). This\npoints towards understanding contemporary preparedness as not only multi-modal and\npedagogical but increasingly using new pedagogical techniques (the public and the\ndramaturgical). This finding has informed future research through an EPSRC / ESRC\nfunded project (John Preston PI) ‘Game Theory and Adaptive Networks for Smart Evacuations’ (October 2010 – October 2012) which will examine the ways in which we\ncan understand and improve city evacuations as ‘co-produced’ by the public, using\nmulti-modal technologies.\n2. Race, ‘tacit intentionality’ and the ‘absent presence’ of ‘race’ in\npreparedness\nIn none of our research did we encounter any participant who was prejudiced or any\nevidence of overt racism in policy. However, tacitly assumptions were often made\nwhich could disadvantage BME people. Following the work of Gillborn, we would\nrefer to these as ‘tacit intentionality’ (Preston, 2009c – conference paper) in that by not\ntaking ‘race’ explicitly into account in preparedness or policy planning some are tacitly\nadvantaged / disadvantaged. Preparedness materials which advantage ‘whites’ also\nintersect with other social characteristics such as masculinity (Preston, 2010a).\nExamples of good practice included awareness of multiple language materials, taking\ninto account access to material resources in preparedness planning. With regard to the\nfuture research plans in this area UEL has agreed to appoint from October 2010 a\nPDRF to work on areas of ‘critical race theory’ and ‘disaster education’.\n3. Who is preparedness for?\nIn our focus group research a common finding was that no one considered that\npreparedness was ‘for them’. This lack of connection (and sometimes outright\nrejection) of preparedness was due to issues of representation and consultation. We will be conducting further work with community groups around issues of racism, discrimination and preparedness using the networks established through the project.
