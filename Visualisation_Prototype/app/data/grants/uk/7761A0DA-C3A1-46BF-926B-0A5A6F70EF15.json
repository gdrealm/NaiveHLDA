We discovered that PspCN, a polypeptide of microbial origin, &quot;turbocharges&quot; a human protein (CFH) that inhibits the complement cascade. Guided by the results of a market assessment, we now propose to design, manufacture and test PspCN-decorated surface coatings for medical implants. We aim to demonstrate that the PspCN displayed on these potentially protective coatings will grab hold of CFH, which is abundant in blood, and induce the captured CFH to switch from a latent to an activated form. Thus, in an improvement on the efforts of competitors to utilize CFH in its latent form, our approach will afford coated surfaces that are protected from the complement cascade by the patient's own, activated, CFH.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L024403/1","grantId":"BB/L024403/1","fundValue":"172807","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Nigel Barlow","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
