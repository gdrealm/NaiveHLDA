Its function is to preserve and secure irreplaceable human genomic material and ensure its availability in perpetuity if required. The material that ECACC makes available will be used to improve our knowledge of the genetic causes of disease. This knowledge will be used to improve the diagnosis and treatment of such diseases.\n\nECACC has its own website that describes all its activities, and actively promotes itself at sicentific meetings and by customer mailing.\n\nCAMR will be administered by the newly formed Health Protection Agency (HPA), effective from April 2003, and ECACC will participate in the policies of that organisation for communication with the public. A description of ECACC activities is included in the CAMR Annual Report, which is widely circulated.\n\nFinally, as partner to the MRC DNA Bank, ECACC will be included in the educational and public information policies of this organisation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9703548","grantId":"G9703548","fundValue":"2419860","fundStart":"1997-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Lewis","coPersons":["Philippa  Bracegirdle","Bryan  Bolton"],"organisation":"Ctr for Applied Microbiological Res CAMR","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
