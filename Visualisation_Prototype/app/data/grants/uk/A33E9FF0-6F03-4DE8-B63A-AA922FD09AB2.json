{"id":"A33E9FF0-6F03-4DE8-B63A-AA922FD09AB2","title":"The collagen matrix in corneal pathology, and the effect of new therapies for loss of transparency and refractive status","abstractText":"The cornea is the transparent window at the front of the eye through which we see the coloured iris and black central pupil. It is made up mostly of a protein called collagen and forms part of the tough outer shell of the eye. Most of the outer shell is opaque and white in colour, but the cornea has evolved to transmit light. Evidently, the transparency of the cornea is absolutely essential for vision, and it is believed that the reason why the cornea, unlike all other collagen-containing tissues in the body, is transparent, is because of the special size and arrangement of the collagen and the special properties of the interspersed cells. One purpose of our proposed investigation is to discover precisely how the arrangement of the collagen and the properties of the cells allow the cornea to be transparent. We will then examine how certain treatments act to restore transparency where it has been lost. In addition to allowing light into the eye, the cornea is also curved in a special way to help focus the incoming light on the retina. Again, it is believed that aspects of the collagen organisation might influence this curvature and be important for corneal astigmatism and the recovery of good vision after corneal surgery (including new refractive surgeries such as LASIK). The research is to be carried out using a range of techniques, including synchrotron x-ray technology and several high powered microscopical methods. It will be carried out by a team of Biophysicists in Cardiff, but will involve a number of scientists and clinicians from around the world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600755","grantId":"G0600755","fundValue":"1337030","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith Michael Meek","coPersons":["Andrew  Quantock"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
