{"id":"B6C46F2E-A6D6-417D-BB26-AF131436CDB2","title":"An Exoplanetarium For Schools","abstractText":"The Keele Astrophysics Group wishes to develop an exciting schools outreach programme using a\nmobile “Exoplanetarium”. During the grant period we will upgrade our current planetarium to a\nspherical mirror projection system, which will allow us to develop dynamic new presentation\nmaterial based on Keele’s internationally recognised, STFC-funded, SuperWASP search for\ntransiting exoplanets and on other aspects of STFC-funded research at Keele such as star\nformation and stellar evolution. In partnership with Keele’s Widening Participation Division\nand the West Midlands Science Learning Centre (based at Keele), we will take the\nExoplanetarium into many tens of secondary schools in Staffordshire, Shropshire and Cheshire.\nOur aims are:\n(1) to promote our STFC-funded research in exoplanets and star formation and to promote the\nidea of post-16 and higher education in science to more than 5,000 secondary school\npupils per annum, especially in areas (e.g. Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton) with poor\nparticipation rates in higher education;\n(2) to enthuse and inspire those pupil’s teachers and to forge lasting partnerships with a\nlarge number of schools, which will be re-visited on an annual basis and in turn will\nvisit us at our recently refurbished Keele Earth and Space Observatory;\n(3) to offer this facility and our expertise to schools at excellent value for money;\n(4) to train a cohort of young scientists (undergraduate and postgraduate students at\nKeele) in delivering outreach programmes;\n(5) to make this ambitious programme sustainable well beyond the period of this grant.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J500070/1","grantId":"ST/J500070/1","fundValue":"6850","fundStart":"2011-09-20","fundEnd":"2012-09-19","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The Stardome/Exoplanetarium is now a fixture in Keele University's schools outreach offering.\n\nIn school year 2013/14, we visited 31 schools and the Stardome was also used on 7 further outreach occasions on campus including&quot;Stargazing Live&quot;.\n\nIn terms of &quot;reach&quot; the Stardome was used for shows that engaged approximately 3800 school-age children (from 4-18) and a further 500 members of the general public.\n\nIn terms of significance, more than 90% of children said they enjoyed our shows and about 75% of secondary school children said that it had made them consider science at University. &gt;95% of teachers said that their pupils had benefited and that they would book the Stardome again.\n\nThe Stardome has proved an excellent training tool for student outreach ambassadors. Last year, approximately 20 student ambassadors travelled with the Stardome into schools and received training in outreach.

We have purchased and operate a portable digital planetarium (Exoplanetarium) that is taken into primary and secondary schools. We use this to address issues from the science national curriculum, enthuse children about science, and astrophysics in particular, and to demonstrate and exhibit some of the planetary discovery science that we do at Keele. I would be very happy to advise or act as a consultant for other groups wishing to set up a similar programme (and have already done so).
