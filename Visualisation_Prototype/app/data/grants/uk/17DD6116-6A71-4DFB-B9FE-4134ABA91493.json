{"id":"17DD6116-6A71-4DFB-B9FE-4134ABA91493","title":"Automation of 3D cell model assembly by additive printing","abstractText":"This project shall test the feasibility of automating the manufacture of advanced cell-based analysis platforms by additive\nprinting of platform components. The analytical platforms shall be 3D cell cultures which enhance the function of resident\ncells. Additive printing shall deposit biocompatible materials consistently and efficiently in 3D architectures within multiwell\nculture plates compatible with medium-throughput analysis. 3D-printed structures designed to mimic tissue architecture\nshall be populated with stem cell-derived populations with tissue-specific functionality selected to match the printed\narchitecture; the feasibility of printing cells directly into these structures shall be studied. For demonstration purposes, the\npotential of automated additive printing shall be evaluated using hepatocytes derived from iPS progenitor cells and\ndeposited in liver-relevant 3D patterns, with model functionality being compared against competing systems and animal\nmodels based on drug-metabolising enzyme levels. The outcome shall be a pre-industrial demonstration of the potential to\napply additive printing in the assembly of 3D cell-based assays used in drug discovery and other industrial processes. This\ndemonstration will create a springboard for further research and development aimed at automation of advanced cell-based\nmodel assembly to industrial quality standards.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M506849/1","grantId":"EP/M506849/1","fundValue":"107459","fundStart":"2014-09-30","fundEnd":"2015-12-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ricky Darren Wildman","coPersons":["Felicity Rosamari Rose","Christopher John Tuck","Jing  Yang"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
