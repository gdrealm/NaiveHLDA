In my project, I shall examine Aristotle's answer to this question. Aristotle's discussion of human and animal agency is set within the broader context of an account of acting and being acted-upon in general. I believe that his discussion has an important bearing on certain contemporary debates about these issues. My aim, then, is not merely to shed light on the interpretation of Aristotle but also, through my work on Aristotle, to contribute to these contemporary debates about agency.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113017/1","grantId":"113017/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ursula  Coope","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
