This increase has been observed in the UK as well as worldwide and overconsumption of food is thought to be a major culprit. Foods that are very high in sugar and fat, commonly known as junk foods, are thought to be particularly to blame. It is well known that many of us find it difficult to resist eating such foods. In fact, many of the behaviours that these foods induce - binge eating, inability to control intake, and insensitivity to negative consequences - parallel behaviours seen towards addictive drugs. Together with recent evidence showing substantial overlap between parts of the brain activated by exposure to drugs and food, this suggests a role for certain brain regions in controlling dysfunctional behaviours towards food and underlying the rise in obesity. However, despite these recent advances a key question still remains: do junk foods have such a strong effect on the brain and behaviour because they taste good (i.e. they are very sweet or fatty) or because of their nutritional value (i.e. they are packed with calories)?\n\nThe main question this proposal seeks to answer is how does the nutritional value of food (i.e. its caloric content) lead to activity in the brain and how does this affect behaviour. This question will be addressed by recording chemical and electrical signals from a brain region called the nucleus accumbens; this region is known to be essential for producing behaviour towards things that we find rewarding. Recordings will be made while rats drink saccharin solution, an artificial sweetener that does not contain any calories. This solution may or may not be accompanied by infusions of glucose (sugar) directly into the stomach. It is expected that when saccharin is paired with glucose infusions rats will drink more and approach the bottle more quickly when it is offered than if saccharin is paired with water infusions.\n\nTwo type of physiological recording will be made during this behaviour. First, the neurotransmitter dopamine will be recorded using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. This technique uses a small carbon-fibre sensor to detect dopamine at a rapid rate. Thus, brief changes can be aligned to specific behaviours, for example, approach to the bottle containing saccharin. Dopamine is essential for learning about rewards such as food and our hypothesis is that dopamine signals will be increased by glucose infusions.\n\nSecond, electrical activity from individual neurons (brain cells) will be recorded using electrophysiology. Information is transmitted throughout the brain via electrical impulses known as action potentials and these can be recorded by placing thin wire electrodes in the brain. Changes in the number of these action potentials occur in response to certain events or behaviours. In nucleus accumbens, the region we are interested in, neurons combine information from many areas in order to generate a behavioural output. Thus, understanding how these neurons fire in response to different events, behaviours, and rewards is an important step in linking the experience of food to its behavioural consequences. In this proposal, it is expected that glucose infusions will alter neuronal activity in the nucleus accumbens.\n\nFinally, behaviour and neuronal activity will be manipulated by targeting a specific connection in the brain between the hypothalamus and dopamine cells. This will be done in two ways: with drugs that target a certain protein known to be important for sensing glucose, and with a technique called optogenetics, which allows expression of molecules which can be activated by light in specific brain cells.\n\nCompletion of this work will provide a new perspective on several fields of neuroscience. In the longer term, it will inform public policy with regard to healthcare, nutrition and education and, ultimately, it may also help us better understand why we choose to eat the foods that we do.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M007391/1","grantId":"BB/M007391/1","fundValue":"442569","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"James Edgar McCutcheon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
