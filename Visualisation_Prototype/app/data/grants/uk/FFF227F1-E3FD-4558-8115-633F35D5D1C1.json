The study will test the hypothesis that, although the public may support and respect the Armed Forces - even if it does not support the political objectives of the missions they undertake - this is accompanied by a lack of understanding of what Service personnel do. </p>\n\n<p>It will ask whether the public has prejudicial attitudes, which lead to stigmatising beliefs regarding ex-Service personnel because of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the presumed characteristics of Service life that are judged to affect the predispositions and behaviour of military personnel when they rejoin civilian society</li>\n\n <li>negative perceptions about the military stemming from the role of the UK Armed Forces in carrying out missions which lack public support.<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2878","grantId":"RES-062-23-2878","fundValue":"335377","fundStart":"2011-01-04","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Dandeker","coPersons":["Rossy  Bailey","Nicola  Fear","Elizabeth  Clery","Susan  Klein","David Alan Alexander","Simon Charles Wessely"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
