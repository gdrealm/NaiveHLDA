{"id":"A615C098-8CEA-4B82-B663-70BC9472D213","title":"Applied statistical and mathematical modelling of peripheral T-Lymphocyte homeostasis","abstractText":"In normal replete hosts, cell turnover within the na&iuml;ve compartment is slow and the majority of na&iuml;ve cells at any time are in a quiescent non-cycling state. However, in conditions of lymphopenia, na&iuml;ve T cells can undergo divisions, termed homeostatic or lymphopenia induced proliferation (LIP). Induction of cell division is dependent on signals through the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) from self-peptide MHC (spMHC) complexes and also cytokines such as interleukin 7 (IL7). Studies of TCR transgenic models reveal a spectrum of responses with some TCR transgenics failing to proliferate in lymphopenia, some undergoing slow cell division while others undergo more rapid divisions accompanied by subtle changes in the cell surface phenotype (e.g. increased CD44) and effector function that imply a transit from na&iuml;ve to memory phenotype. The contribution to the memory pool of the naive pool through LIP, however, remains unknown as are the specific criteria of cell division that govern such entry. Our key aim is to determine the minimal requirements for entry into the memory pool via LIP. Is there a critical number and/or rate of cell divisions associated with differentiation through LIP? How important is the LIP process in T cell homeostasis? To address these questions, we will take advantage of a system biology approach integrating immunology, mathematics and statistics. Data on cell divisions and phenotypic characteristics will come from experimentation using transgenic mice. Relevant mathematical models and statistical approaches will be developed and adapted for analysing these data. Identification of the parameters that define the na&iuml;ve to memory transition during LIP is crucial for understanding how T cell memory is maintained and for building more comprehensive models of na&iuml;ve and memory T cell homeostasis in the normal host.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F005504/1","grantId":"BB/F005504/1","fundValue":"443801","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin  Callard","coPersons":["Benedict  Seddon"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
