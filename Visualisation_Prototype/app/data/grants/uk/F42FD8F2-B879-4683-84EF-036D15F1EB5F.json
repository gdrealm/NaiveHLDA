Firstly, we can grow them indefinitely in the laboratory in either small or large scale and secondy, by use of appropriate methods, they seem to be able to differentiate into almost all of the cell types found in the adult body. At a first glance this makes them similar to human embryonic stem cells which have been hailed as an attractive resource for regenerative procedures that involve transplantation of specific differentiated cells into human patients. Embryonic stem cells are derived from individual Human embryos so any cells we produce form these cell lines are likely to be rejected by the body's immune system. iPSC should not suffer from this problem if the cells we make from them are transplanted back into the same individual from which they were made but there is a potentially greater advantage of iPSC namely the creation of 'disease in a dish' models. This relies upon making an iPSC line from a patient suffering from a genetic disease then differentiating that iPSC line to the type of cells affected by the disease so we can see what problems arise and how we might be able to fix them. All of this relies upon the hiPSC line being able to differentiate into cells that are functionally identical to those found in the body. Available evidence and our pilot data suggest that although they may produce cells that look similar to adult cells (such as those of the bone marrow or the nervous system), these may not work as effectively as the genuine article therefore in order to realize the promise of iPSC technology, we have to find out why they are defective and develop ways to fix these problems. Our pilot data suggest that problems with mitochondria, the energy suppliers of the cell, may be a significant reason why iPSC and their differentiated problem could be dysfunctional. Mitochondria exist as distinct structures within the cell and while some of their components are produced from their own indepdent genes, the majority of their structure and function is controlled by genes residing in the cells nucleus. The ways in which mitochondria function are quite different in various cell types; for example hESC don't use them to generate energy very much but differentiated cells derived from hESC do. The human cells (somatic cells) we reprogram to make hiPSC fall into the latter category but it seems that the reprogramming is incomplete and hiPSC may still try to control their mitochondria in similar ways to the original somatic cells. This is potentially bad for the survival of the hiPSC but even worse, they may not be able to regulate mitochondria properly on differentiation. In view of this our objectives are to compare the mitochondria of hiPSC and hESC and then differentiate them to three cell types with differing energy requirements (and therefore different mitochondrial regulation). We will compare the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function, analyse their control mechanisms and attempt to explain why this might not work optimally. Once this understanding is gained, we will be able to develop means to solve these problems and produce hiPSC with fullly functional mitochondria although this in turn may allow us to improve other aspects of iPSC function that rely upon completion of reprogramming. The successful execution of this project will be enormously beneficial not only to ours and other groups investigating iPSC biology but it will also promote development of disease treatments using these cells which will provide significant social and economic impact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I020209/1","grantId":"BB/I020209/1","fundValue":"325885","fundStart":"2012-02-24","fundEnd":"2015-02-23","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The study undertaken in this project has highlighted better methods to asses the quality of induced pluripotent stem cells that is predictive of their ability to undergo multilineage differentiation.

This could have serious consequences for the utility of induced pluripotent stem cells as models of human disease and for their future applications in regenerative medicine. The data generated by this project do indicate that mitochondria may work slightly less efficiently in induced pluripotent stem cells however analysis of several genes that are important both for controlling mitochondrial activity and a number of other functions within the cell (such as maintaining its framework or cytoskeleton) suggests that they may be present at much lower levels than we expected. We are currently completing our analyses of these genes but consistent under-expression of several of these might affect the ability of induced pluripotent stem cells to generate differentiated cells that are medically useful The key outcome so far is that the problems associated with induced pluripotent stem cells could extend beyond the mitochondria. Fortunately, the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction seems to be less severe than we had first thought and if we can devise strategies to repair the mis-expression of the small set of genes we have found to be at fault, we could make much better induced pluripotent stem cells. This would be enormously valuable to the pharmaceutical industry in which their is increasing interest in the use of these cells for modelling diseases and screening libraries of small molecules to identify prospective new drugs. Moreover, if induced pluripotent stem cells can be shown to be equivalent to embryonic stem cells without the possibility of immune rejection, their application to cell replacement therapies becomes a stronger possibility Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
