Lung fluid overload is normally prevented by molecular pumps in the lung lining linked to sodium permeable channels controlled by signalling molecules, including the enzyme, PI3K. Influenza A viruses make a protein, termed NS1, in infected cells that is an important determinant of viral virulence. Indeed, the ?bird ?flu? which currently circulates in SE Asia is dangerous to human health because this virus strain encodes a form of the NS1 protein that differs slightly from that found in normal flu viruses. If we are to develop new treatements for such dangerous viruses, then it is important to understand the ways in which the influenza virus NS1 proteins can alter the physiological properties of the infected cell. Recently published work showed that NS1 could increase the activity of PI3K in the host cell, and work from the applicant?s laboratory showed that NS1 can also increase sodium channel permeability by both PI3K-dependent and -independent pathways. By showing that NS1 can alter the properties of infected cells we have discovered an entirely novel function for the NS1 protein and the purpose of the study is to identify ways in which this protein can disturb the functioning of the lung / airway epithelia. The data provided by these studies may therefore lead to improved treatments for influenza by revealing the mechanisms that allow these viruses to disrupt lung function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001173","grantId":"G1001173","fundValue":"30001","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart M Wilson","coPersons":["Anil  Mehta"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
