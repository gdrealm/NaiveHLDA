{"id":"890C82CB-DC88-4A7A-AFF0-4D745E0F49F7","title":"Proposed visit of Professor Chuyeshov (Kharkov, Ukraine)","abstractText":"The aim of this proposal is to bring Professor Igor Chuyeshov, Head of the Department of Mathematical Physics and Computational Mathematics of Kharkov National University, to the UK for a one-month visit. Professor Chuyeshov is a distinguished mathematician with particular expertise in the theory of infinite dimensional dissipative dynamical systems. During this visit he would give a short course on Global attractors for dissipative PDEs at Heriot-Watt University, and would work with the proposed Principal Investigator and his colleagues on problems from 3D statistical hydrodynamics. This reseach will be a continuation of the collaboration, started during a short visit of Prof. Chuyeshov to Edinburgh at May 2006 under the financial support from the London Mathematical Society. Prof. Chuyeshov would also visit other UK institutions to give seminar talks and to hold further scientific discussions with colleagues at those places.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E059244/1","grantId":"EP/E059244/1","fundValue":"13663","fundStart":"2007-04-19","fundEnd":"2007-07-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sergei  Kuksin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
