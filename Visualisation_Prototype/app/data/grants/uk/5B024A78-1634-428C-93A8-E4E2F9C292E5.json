Services the TWG must provide include \na unified Systems Administration Framework, giving a single web presence for the acquisition\nof user accounts, management of project membership, generation of usage reports, help desk and so on.\nCentral to this is a single DiRAC-ID given to each user, and this is also used to give access\nto community web pages documenting the DiRAC systems and enabling the research communities to perform their research.\n\nThis work to enable integration, operation and efficient utilisation of all DiRAC facilities by RAC-selected projects will be carried out \naccording to priorities set by the DiRAC Technical Working Group.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K005790/1","grantId":"ST/K005790/1","fundValue":"193559","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Boyle","coPersons":["Richard Donovan Kenway"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
