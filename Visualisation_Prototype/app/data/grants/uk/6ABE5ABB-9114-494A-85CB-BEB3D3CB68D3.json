{"id":"6ABE5ABB-9114-494A-85CB-BEB3D3CB68D3","title":"Modern approaches to the study of ancient slavery","abstractText":"Slavery was a key institution in antiquity, but historian's reconstruction of the ancient slave has varied significantly, not just across time, but even between different countries today. Core assumptions about the ancient slave in Germany (for example) can be subtly different to those in the US or Britain. The monograph samples the different approaches examining why the differences exist and what they imply. Scholarly reconstructions of slavery often tell us more about the modern world then the ancient. Possible alternatives are explored.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112886/1","grantId":"112886/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2006-05-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Niall  McKeown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
