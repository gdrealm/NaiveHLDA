The first is to test how contextual risk (ie, neighbourhood and family poverty and family adversity) is associated with children's emotional and behavioural problems from birth until mid childhood. This project will, therefore, identify with precision high-risk child populations, which will, in turn, inform policy decisions about targeted interventions.</p>\n\n<p>The second is to investigate how factors in the child, family, school and neighbourhood may dampen this association (ie, promote resilience). This project will, therefore, offer insights regarding key adjustment pathways to resilience, which will, in turn, guide policy and practice initiatives to promote child well-being and reduce societal costs. To meet these two main research objectives the project will use qualitative and quantitative data from the first four sweeps of the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), a longitudinal survey of more than 19,000 children in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>The project has also two subsidiary objectives:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>to enhance the capacity to analyse the MCS and similar data sources through the involvement of graduate students and the training courses offered</li>\n\n <li>to enhance this data resource through creating usable variables from geographic identifiers and the coding of open-ended responses on children's aspirations.</li>\n\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J001414/1","grantId":"ES/J001414/1","fundValue":"287654","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-21","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Eirini  Flouri","coPersons":["Alice  Sullivan","Nikos  Tzavidis","Heather Evelyn Joshi","Richard Donovan Wiggins"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
