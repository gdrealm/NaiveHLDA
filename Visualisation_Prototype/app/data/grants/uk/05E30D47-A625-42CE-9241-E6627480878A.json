It is part of a wider project to bring into a virtual whole all surviving leaves of the manuscript, divided among four different countries, and to provide access at every level from the general reader to the most advanced scholar. Within that wider project, this scholarly edition will focus on the needs of researchers, scholars, and educated readers. It will offer meticulous detail in image and transcript, with highly-developed tools in a sophisticated Interface, to enable research hitherto impossible.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119242/1","grantId":"119242/1","fundValue":"278888","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Visitors\n\nIn the first four weeks after its launch in July 2009, the site had over one million unique visitors. By the end of December 2010 this number had grown to over two million.\n\n\n\nMedia coverage\n\nAt the launch project members engaged in numerous interviews. Media coverage of the virtual re-unification of Codex Sinaiticus was exceptionally high and exclusively positive. They included sources such as the New York Time, CNN, and The Guardian (UK) (see below). The 420 articles published in July 2009 alone generated 200 million Weighted Opportunities To See (WOTS) and a total Gross Rating Point (GRP) figure of 1,702 and an exceptional positive Net Effect Cost of Reach Equation (CORE) figure of &pound;1,170,880. 90% of media coverage came from the internet, 71% of coverage was from outside the UK.

There are four key components to this digital edition: images, transcription, conservation document and translations. This summary describes the transcription, which was undertaken in this research project.\n\n\n\n1. The transcription provides a detailed interpretation of the images, and the two are linked together so that to click on a word in one is to highlight the same word in the other. Following the layout of the manuscript, the transcription also contains pop-up boxes explaining every one of the manuscript's 27,000 corrections. The entire transcription is downloadable from the website in xml, and can be developed or searched under the project's Creative Commons Licence.\n\n\n\n2. The researchers were able to examine high resolution digital images of every page, and to examine the leaves in Leipzig, St Petersburg and Sinai. The edition included the first publication of the 25 full or incomplete leaves from Sinai. The images of several pages from Sinai were edited in Photoshop to bring images of separate fragments together in a reconstruction of all that is left.\n\n\n\n3. The researchers were able to confirm the broad identification of the correctors identified by the British scholars Milne and Skeat in the 1930s, and to refine many of the identifications of individual corrections. They also noted some peculiarities leading them to suggest the possibility that there was a fourth scribe. This free-to-view website can be explored by anyone, to find out about a remarkable and beautiful manuscript, to explore the biblical tradition, or to study the modern history of the manuscript.
