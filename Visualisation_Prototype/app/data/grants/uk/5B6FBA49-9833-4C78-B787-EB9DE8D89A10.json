Folklorist preserved tales and songs as aesthetic documents, but by reconnecting them to the context of their performance, the historian can also uncover their social function. Riddles might form a marriage negotiation, tales were cultural capital, and legends were lessons in vital geography. Various genres or oral literature will be examined through case-studies including on board ship, within an extended family, and among a protoindustrial work party work party. From these examples, historian can better grasp how communities worked together, despite the conflicts that divided them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113014/1","grantId":"113014/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David Matthew Hopkin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
