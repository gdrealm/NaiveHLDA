While these developments are designed to help expand markets and increase customer convenience, they also potentially increase vulnerabilities to crime. Although customer ‘self-scan’ is now a common feature of the retail landscape, many large retailers are also experimenting with mobile scanning and purchase payment utilising devices owned by the customer.</p>\n\n<p>The roll-out of mobile scanning raises questions about how this technology can be introduced in a way that does not increase opportunity for crime/shrinkage and also how the retail space might need to be adapted to achieve this. By working in partnership with three major retailers, this research aims to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>explore issues around the implementation of mobile scanning technologies</li>\n\n <li>establish the potential impact of such technologies upon loss/shrinkage</li>\n\n <li>understand the impact of mobile scanning on the use of existing product protection technologies&nbsp;</li>\n\n <li>how this might lead to the development of new product protection approaches.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the project will consider whether this type of technology will require a new generation of crime prevention thinking within the retail environment.&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L005085/1","grantId":"ES/L005085/1","fundValue":"57759","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Adrian  Beck","coPersons":["Matthew  Hopkins"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
