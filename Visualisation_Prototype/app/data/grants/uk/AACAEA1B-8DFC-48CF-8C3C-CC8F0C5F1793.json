An intermediate language exists in the sequence of RNA that translates a gene's message into a protein's amino acid sequence. The process of producing RNA is called transcription and is the most important regulatory step in gene expression in organisms ranging from simple bacteria to humans. The protein RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the enzyme which catalyses transcription and is the target, directly or indirectly, of most regulation of gene expression. The cells that make up our bodies are highly regulated and dynamic systems. In and around cells, functions are determined by the interplay of different types of biomolecules, such as proteins. These interactions are possible through the recognition of specific, complementary surfaces at the atomic level. For a better understanding of these cellular mechanisms, researchers need to develop new technologies for the study of biomolecules. In particular, modern molecular techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) offer a powerful method to determine the different shapes (or conformations) and motion (or dynamics) of molecules and the interactions between them. In this proposal we aim to develop a novel application of NMR that can be applied and analysed on very large biomolecules, such as RNAP. The structural detail provided by these techniques is also sufficient for the elucidation of enzymatic mechanisms (e.g. the series of steps required for the synthesis and degradation of new molecules) and to analyse the interaction of biomolecules. We will exploit this new methodology to understand more about how viruses can interfere with the activity for the RNAP in order to alter gene expression to serve its own needs","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G004668/1","grantId":"BB/G004668/1","fundValue":"330462","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Matthews","coPersons":["Sivaramesh  Wigneshweraraj","Ernesto  Cota Segura","Peter  Simpson"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
