{"id":"715C8926-4DB9-4139-8C2D-3E8A4FFA4AF1","title":"Follow On: Optimising the performance and efficiency of non-thermal, atmospheric pressure plasma reactors for the destruction of pollutants in waste g","abstractText":"This project concerns the development and demonstration of the commercial feasibility of a novel, energy efficient technology for the destruction of hazardous pollutants (e.g. volatile organic compounds) in waste gas streams that is based on the use of atmospheric pressure, non-thermal plasma discharges. In particular, previously we have shown that a certain configuration of plasma reactors produces an unexpected and significant enhancement in destruction efficiency. In this project, we will investigate the origins of that effect in order to gain a fundamental understanding of the processes involved. In this way, we aim to optimise the design and configuration to produce effective destruction at an energy cost that is competitive with other remediation technologies. The expertise gained in the previous EPSRC project combining plasma discharges with catalysts will be valuable in optimising the process. The market drivers for the project will be informed by interactions with a University spin-out company, Plasma Clean Ltd, who may take on responsibility for the ultimate exploitation of the technology upon it meeting commercially viable performance targets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E502792/1","grantId":"EP/E502792/1","fundValue":"60984","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Christopher Whitehead","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
