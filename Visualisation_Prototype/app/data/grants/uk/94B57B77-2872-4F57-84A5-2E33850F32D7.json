Specifically, this project will consider the impediments to effective collaborative research across the boundaries between academic research and practitioner communities, sometimes referred to as the 'rigour and relevance gap', and will consider the offer of arts and humanities disciplines to inform the question. The project will be developed through the case study of the key outcome of the cluster EGOR, PAS: 198 Specification for Environmental Conditions for Cultural Collections, as this published work attempts to bridge the boundary between academics and practitioners.\n\nAims\n\nThe purpose of this project is to:\n - Understand the dynamics and the boundaries of collaborative research so that a more effective and richer heritage science research can be achieved.\n - Engage and challenge arts and humanities disciplines in dealing with communication and cultural barriers in collaborative research. \n - Develop a framework that sets out the practices and protocols necessary for effective collaborative research and the uptake of research evidence that will sustain cultural heritage in the future.\n - Foster engagement with academic researchers, practitioners, and end users in the cultural heritage domain.\n\nTo achieve these aims, Mind the Gap will: \n\n - Identify the barriers to communication between academic disciplines, practitioner and specialist communities as evidenced in SHP Research Clusters. \n - Improve research practice so that cross-disciplinary working can be effective and innovative, by exploring the contribution of arts and humanities disciplines such as linguistics, anthropology, history, education.\n - Undertake an attitude study of participants in the heritage science domain in the UK, to ascertain their experience of, and attitudes to, collaborative research and practices.\n - Publish a White Paper setting out a framework for collaborative research in heritage science.\n - Disseminate the findings of this project to policy makers including research councils, practitioners, professional and academic bodies, to ensure wide ranging and lasting impact. \n\nIt is anticipated that the findings of this project will help to better understand how the economic and societal impacts of heritage science research are achieved and what organisational culture and practices' are in place to ensure the right research-based evidence, in addition to the culture necessary to achieve it. Using the 'lens' of arts and humanities disciplines, Mind the Gap will tease out the issues that define a 'working culture' and the distinct features of cultural heritage organisations, and heritage science cultures as reflected in language differences, working practices, and the take up of evidence in problem solving. \n\nOne of the major outcomes of this will be the publication of a White Paper which will set out recommendations for overcoming the rigour-relevance gap in heritage science research and a framework for effective collaborations between academic and practitioner communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K006010/1","grantId":"AH/K006010/1","fundValue":"79796","fundStart":"2013-01-28","fundEnd":"2014-01-27","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings of this work will form the basis of further engagement and development of training packages to inform collaborative research projects.
