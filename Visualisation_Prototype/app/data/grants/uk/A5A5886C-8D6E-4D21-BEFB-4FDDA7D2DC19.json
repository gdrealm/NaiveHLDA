{"id":"A5A5886C-8D6E-4D21-BEFB-4FDDA7D2DC19","title":"William Shakespeare: A Critical Guide","abstractText":"The project is a monograph in the Routledge Critical Guides series, William Shakespeare, which is to be published in 2007. This is organised into four sections: Life and Contexts, Works, Criticism, and Performance. The first section offers a succinct account of Shakespeare's professional career, and of the theatrical, cultural and historic circumstances in which the works took shape; the section also addresses questions of biographically, myth-making and fiction unique to the consideration of this author. The second section, Works, is a concise survey of the complete Shakespearean literary and theatrical canon. The third section, is a comprehensive and authoritative overview of the major modern critical schools of thought and a guide to critical method, which, as it involves the exercise of critical judgments about its own principles of selection, inclusion and exclusion, about the organisation of materials into methodological, theoretical and historical categories, and about its own meta critical narratives, constitutes a significant intervention in its own right. The fourth section, Performance, traces the screen and stage histories of Shakespeare's works during the twentieth century, as well as addressing the book's core concern with the relationships between readily, critical, theatrical and cinematic performances.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E505600/1","grantId":"AH/E505600/1","fundValue":"26231","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Shaughnessy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
