As an email sent to me at the end of the project states: 'This project has really helped move us on. The combination of events and reports to the Board have certainly transformed how I think universities and businesses might work together. I know several others within the Institute and the sector more generally share my view. I hope we can continue to build the relationships that have been started so effectively by you' (Steven Freudmann).\n\nThe project received significant media attention. The Travel Trade Gazette - one of the two leading trade publications - featured the project several times. ITT newsletters also ran features on the project throughout the year and the ITT web site still contains details.\nIt is difficult to quantify the impact of media exposure but the very positive associations reported to have developed between senior industry figures and the research of academics should precipitate a reassessment of relations between practitioners and academics in some quarters.

The findings represent a model for engaging with this and potentially other sectors. I have already started to develop similar project with the Association of British Professional Conference Organisers (ABPCO) to good effect and I am aware that colleagues elsewhere are adopting this model of engagement.
