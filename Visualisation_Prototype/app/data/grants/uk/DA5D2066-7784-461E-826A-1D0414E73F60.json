In particular, it examines the hazards of collective action when differentially endowed actors seek intellectual property protection through geographical indications (GIs). As evident in products like Champagne and Tequila, GIs protect the tripartite relationship between product, qualities and territory. Protection through GIs makes for an exclusive club, as the GI can only be used by firms located in the designated territory that also adhere to the specified production rules. Closely tying production rules to territory provides an opportunity for a greater share of economic returns to be locally appropriated. However, as firms compete with each other for market shares the collective action problem is complicated. This research uses field work, stakeholder meetings and comparative legal analysis to study the possibilities of, and problems confronted in, using GIs to localise economic control. Beyond the Feni case study, this research makes theoretical contributions by using the concept of ‘clubs’ to study GIs. Through its project design (eg stakeholder meetings and dissemination meetings in Goa and Geneva), the research feeds into policy.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0119","grantId":"RES-061-23-0119","fundValue":"110814","fundStart":"2007-02-19","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Dwijen  Rangnekar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
