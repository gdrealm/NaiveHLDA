{"id":"0EAEFE3D-6692-4970-ABD4-AFDBF94E1E1D","title":"p63 isoforms and keratinocyte differentiation","abstractText":"The p63 family of proteins are important for the normal development of the head and neck region, limbs and the skin during embryonic life. This family is also important in maintaining the presence of normal epithelial surfaces, such as the skin and breast in adulthood. p63 is found to be abnormally expressed in most epithelial cancers, however, the cause or the consequence of this altered expression is not known. This proposal seeks to understand the role of p63 in skin differentiation with the hope that this will also help in understanding the role of p63 in the development of cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700754","grantId":"G0700754","fundValue":"590780","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dennis John McCance","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
