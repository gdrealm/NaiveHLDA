This pathogen causes a wide variety of human infections with varying degrees of severity, including bacterial pharyngitis and tonsillitis (?strep throat?). While sporadic infections may be successfully treated with conventional antibiotics, a number of patients, both children and adults, suffer frequently recurring bouts of infection, such that surgical removal of the tonsils becomes the clinical treatment of choice. This is a major cost to the NHS and other health services throughout the world. Exploiting recently available new information (e.g. from genome sequencing), this project will look at the mechanisms whereby S. pyogenes interacts with human tonsils. This will provide new insight into how this bacterial pathogen binds to human tonsils and the response of the tonsils. Such insight may provide the basis of new, non-surgical, treatments for tonsillitis. Results of the research will be presented at national and international conferences. These are covered by the press and other media. In addition Newcastle University Public elations Office is well-versed with disseminating findings of interest to the general public","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400849","grantId":"G0400849","fundValue":"397823","fundStart":"2005-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Kehoe","coPersons":["Barry Hugo Hirst","Janet Ann  Wilson"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
