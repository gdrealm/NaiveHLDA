They have important large-scale practical applications in centralised matching schemes that perform allocations of these types in a number of countries.\n\nWhen designing mechanisms for these matching problems, two issues present research challenges going forward: (i) optimality (based on the social welfare of the agents involved) and (ii) truthfulness.\n\nThese two desirable properties may be conflicting. This led Procaccia and Tennenholtz to introduce the idea of approximate mechanism design without money - this involves the design of truthful mechanisms which may lead to a loss of optimality in the constructed solutions, but such loss can be theoretically bounded.\n\nIn the above practical applications, monetary transfer is not appropriate. Two further applications that motivate optimal truthful mechanisms, where monetary transfer is not allowed, involve combinatorial auctions and facility location problems.\n\nThis proposal lies in the area of Algorithmic Mechanism Design (AMD), part of the wider field of Computational Social Choice Theory. We are interested in particular in mechanism design without money.\n\nThe famous Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem roughly states that, in environments without money, the only truthful mechanism is (the trivial) dictatorship. However, it does not apply whenever the domain of preferences of the individuals over the possible outcomes is restricted. That is the case in most real-world applications, where indeed more interesting mechanisms occur.\n\nWe plan to advance the area of AMD without payments by tackling combinatorial auctions, junior doctor placement and reviewer assignment, kidney exchange and facility location problems. We will develop new truthful mechanisms whilst measuring their degradation in performance as compared to previous (non-truthful mechanisms). In particular, we will investigate the trade-off between truthfulness and optimality when considering approximate mechanism design.\n\nNew software will arise from this work and we have routes for exploiting it through existing University of Glasgow collaborations with the NHS (concerning the assignment of junior doctors to hospitals as part of the Scottish Foundation Allocation Scheme, and the assignment of kidney donors to patients via the National Living Donor Kidney Sharing Schemes).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K01000X/1","grantId":"EP/K01000X/1","fundValue":"329764","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  These papers opened completely new research lines concerning the matching problem with preferences and verification in combinatorial auctions.

Example is allocating students to dormitories. Our mechanism is the first known that provides provable guarentees on the quality of the computed allocation. This opened a completely new research direction, that of approximate truthful mechanisms, for matching problems under preferences. Our second paper provides strong theoretical results for approximate truthful mechanisms for combonatorial auctions also without monetary transfers. These mechanisms use a notion of verification, which can be an attractive alternative to monetary payments in real world auction systems. We opened a completely new direction for approximate mechanisms for matching under preferences. This direction and our approach has already been used by economists in different but related matching setting.
