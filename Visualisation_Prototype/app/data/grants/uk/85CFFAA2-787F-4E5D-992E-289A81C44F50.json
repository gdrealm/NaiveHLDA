This provides the ability to separate census statistical data (for example, but other geospatially-linked data are equally capable of utilising this approach) and the boundary (geometry) data to which it relates. </p>\n\n<p>Geo-linking allows for distributed, multi-source datasets to be seamlessly linked in a fashion that facilitates data separation for management and administration purposes. In essence, the approach proposed will provide an extensible infrastructure applicable not only to the immediate needs of the Census Programme but also more widely to broader requirements emerging from the e-Social Science programme, especially its e-Infrastructure strand and also the ESRCs national data strategy. Additionally, using the same standards based approach, the project will aim to demonstrate how further value added processing can be invoked by transforming the geo-linked outputs through a series of ancillary web processing services. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F034792/1","grantId":"ES/F034792/1","fundValue":"70068","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Medyckyj-Scott","coPersons":["James  Reid","Richard  Wiseman"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
