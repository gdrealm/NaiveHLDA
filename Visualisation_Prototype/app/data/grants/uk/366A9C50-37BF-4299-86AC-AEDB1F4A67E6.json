{"id":"366A9C50-37BF-4299-86AC-AEDB1F4A67E6","title":"COMPUTATIONAL MODELLING FOR ADVANCED NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS","abstractText":"Modern computational methods can be a very valuable tool in assessing the behaviour of nuclear power stations, and ensuring that they present minimal hazard to either the public or the environment. This proposal is to fund research further to develop such methods, and by careful comparison of their predictions with actual measurements, establish predictive tools that are appropriate, robust, efficient and validated. The work proposed seeks to achieve this by developing a basis for the verification and validation of computational tools against well-defined benchmark cases. It also seeks to develop advanced computational methods to address problems in normal operation and fault conditions, as well as to investigate aspects of system behaviour in severe accident situations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I003010/1","grantId":"EP/I003010/1","fundValue":"1569230","fundStart":"2010-12-20","fundEnd":"2014-12-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Walker","coPersons":["Gerard  Gorman","Hector  Iacovides","Christopher Charles Pain","Michael  Reeks","Raad  Issa","Michael  Fairweather","Dominique  Laurence","Michael John Bluck","Matthew Denham Eaton","Geoffrey F Hewitt","Antony J Goddard"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
