{"id":"152E33EB-57D9-4175-9981-302D2551DBDD","title":"Molecular Mechanisms in Schizophrenia Susceptibility","abstractText":"Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness which affects about 1 in every 100 people in Britain. Currently, little is known about how the brain is altered in schizophrenia. However, scientists have recently found genes that increase the chances of developing the illness. Researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London, are investigating how changes in these genes lead to changes in the human brain. They will first test to see if changes in these genes lead to differences in the level of the gene products in brain. They will then alter the level of these gene products in cells taken from the human brain to see how it affects these cells. This research will provide important new understanding of how changes in the brain lead to schizophrenia. This will help scientists develop new treatments for this devastating illness.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802166","grantId":"G0802166","fundValue":"469855","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  Bray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
