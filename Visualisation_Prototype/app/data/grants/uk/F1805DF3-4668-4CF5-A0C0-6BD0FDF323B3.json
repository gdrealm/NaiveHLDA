{"id":"F1805DF3-4668-4CF5-A0C0-6BD0FDF323B3","title":"The role of creative interventions in fostering connectivity and resilience in older people","abstractText":"This proposed project aims to understand how creative interventions help develop connectivity and resilience for older people. This will be achieved through critical reflection on the outcomes from a range of relevant projects across the Connected Communities portfolio such as community gardening, filmmaking, built environment, product design, digital media theatre, music, cultural learning and visual arts interventions for those with early stage dementia. Juxtaposing the results from different projects will result in innovative ways of thinking about resilience and propose solutions to issues raised by community partners. \n\nFour seminars will be undertaken consisting of presentations, workshops, and breakout sessions. Synthesising learning points from across the Connected Communities portfolio will help draw together the diverse, yet shared issues. Equal Arts, the C.I. and main community partner will recruit a group of older people who will play a full part in the workshops and explore what resilience and connectivity means to them. Researcher participants will also be invited to bring along community partners to ensure discussion is grounded in their lived experience. Policy makers such as Arts Council England will also be involved and part of the management group to ensure that they are part of the process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L013274/1","grantId":"AH/L013274/1","fundValue":"32279","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anna  Goulding","coPersons":["Andrew  Newman","Alice  Thwaite"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
