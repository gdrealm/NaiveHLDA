New understandings of the common areas of interest between art and anthropology are expected to result from the intensive contact between members of the group and to lead to further collaborations between anthropologists and artists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E508995/1","grantId":"AH/E508995/1","fundValue":"10572","fundStart":"2006-10-16","fundEnd":"2007-09-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Amanda  Ravetz","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
