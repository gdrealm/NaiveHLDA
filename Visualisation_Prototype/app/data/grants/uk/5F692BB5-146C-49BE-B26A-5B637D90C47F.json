{"id":"5F692BB5-146C-49BE-B26A-5B637D90C47F","title":"The Development of Object Recognition into Adolescence","abstractText":"<p>Previous research asked children to play a game in which they had to say which of three versions of an animal was correct. Sometimes the two incorrect versions were produced by exchanging a part from another animal. Sometimes the incorrect versions were produced by altering the relative sizes of the correct parts. Though these two games were equally difficult for adults, children found the part changes much easier. They were at the level of adults by age 11 for part changes. However, it was not until aged 15 that they were at the same level as adults for distinguishing between size changes. In a parallel section of the previous work, the same age progression was found in a task that asked children to learn to recognise novel objects made from geometric shapes. </p>\n\n<p>The new research will arrive at a better understanding of the adolescent's difficulties in these cognitive tasks. Objects are stored in our minds in two different ways. One of the ways is a single part; the other explicitly states the relationship between the parts. This second way demands more attentional capacity and therefore the child may prefer to remember objects in mental images from the first holistic method.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E003699/1","grantId":"ES/E003699/1","fundValue":"462760","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jules  Davidoff","coPersons":["Martin  Juttner"],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
