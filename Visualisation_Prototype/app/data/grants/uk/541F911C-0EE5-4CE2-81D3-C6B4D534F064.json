Most chemotherapy works by damaging DNA, and when a cell detects this DNA damage a suicide pathway which is programmed into all our cells gets switched on. Previous research by our group has shown that the status of a protein called BRCA1 is important in determining whether a breast tumour cell switches on this suicide programme in the presence of DNA damaging chemotherapy. If a woman inherits a faulty version of BRCA1, her chances of developing breast cancer are greatly increased, however paradoxically the resulting breast tumour cell is much more sensitive to DNA damaging chemotherapy than a breast tumour cell which has normal functioning BRCA1. This is an important issue for the treatment of breast cancer because breast cancer which develops due to the inheritance of a faulty BRCA1 protein represents only 5% of all breast cancers. The research outlined in this proposal seeks to determine how the presence of BRCA1 allows a breast tumour cell to evade death in the presence of DNA damage. We have identified another protein called NFkB which only becomes active when tumour cells which have functioning BRCA1 are treated with DNA damaging chemotherapy. We have shown that if we stop NFkB becoming active in cells which have functional BRCA1, we can cause these cells to enter suicide mode thus rendering the tumour sensitive to DNA damage. We conclude that the ability of BRCA1 to turn on NFkB, is an important prerequisite for BRCA1 to enable cells to evade suicide in the presence of chemotherapy. The research that we have proposed will examine further the role of NFkB in enabling BRCA1 to allow cells to survive in the presence of DNA damage. We will investigate how BRCA1 turns on NFkB. The normal function of NFkB is to switch on the expression of a set of signature proteins which are able to inhibit the cells suicide pathway. We will look for expression of these signature proteins in the cells where NFkB is switched on in response to damage. \nThe work proposed in this grant will be of significant value in the design of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of breast cancer. The design of specific inhibitors against target proteins turned on in this pathway should render the breast tumour cell significantly more susceptible to DNA damaging chemotherapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600267","grantId":"G0600267","fundValue":"288855","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"D Paul Harkin","coPersons":["Mary  Harte"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
