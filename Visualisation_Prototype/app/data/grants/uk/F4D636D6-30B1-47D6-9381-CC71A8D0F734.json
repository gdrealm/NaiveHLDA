The normal age of puberty is about 10.5 years in girls and 11.5 years in boys, but it is very variable. There is considerable public and medical interest in the causes of very early puberty because of the consequences of a mismatch between the psychological and body changes caused by the early rise in 'the hormones' and the actual level of maturity of the individual. Indeed, recent brain imaging studies have shown that brain maturation extends into the early twenties. Improved diet is thought to underlie the gradual fall in age of puberty onset, but the ever increasing incidence of childhood obesity is accelerating this trend. On the other hand, a delay in puberty can be caused by many factors, including malnutrition, emotional and social deprivation and in particular stress. Early or late onset of puberty can have serious health effects and often raises a great deal of anxiety in the individual or family concerned. Understanding the processes that control the timing of puberty will help in the management and treatment of children affected. Normal puberty starts with activation of a small area in the brain called the hypothalamus that begins to secrete a hormone called gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which sets in motion a cascade of hormonal signals that lead to stimulation of both the ovaries and the testes. The hormones from the developing ovaries or testes drive sexual maturation and the many other physical and emotional changes associated with adolescence. What triggers the activation of the GnRH system in the brain remained a mystery until very recently when it was discovered that a genetic mutation of a particular chemical receptor in the brain of humans stopped them from going into puberty. Similar mutations in animal models caused identical problems. These receptors are activated by a brain chemical named 'kisspeptin'. The scientists who discovered this chemical were working at the Pennsylvania State Medical Centre in Hershey USA and they gave it this name because; Hershey is the location of America's famous chocolate factory and the scientists named it after the chocolate company's signature miniature treat chocolate 'kisses'. Although, kisspeptin is undoubtedly the single most important activator of the GnRH system it now remains to be discovered what triggers the kisspeptin system at puberty. There is growing awareness that adverse early life environments can have major detrimental effects on health and disease later in life. For example, in humans and animals the immediate period after birth is especially dangerous for bacterial infection because the body's immune system is not yet fully developed. Indeed, more than 40% of all human newborn deaths (~1.7 million per year globally) are due to neonatal bacterial infection. Animals that have been exposed to bacterial substances (endotoxins) during the first week of life are more sensitive to stress when they reach adulthood. Additionally these animals display altered immune, metabolic, anxiety, memory and cognition function as adults, which show that early life exposure to bacteria can exert long-term 'programming' effects on a number of body functions. These and other observations have led to the idea of 'developmental origins of health and disease'. In pilot studies using the animal model of early life infection stress we have shown a delay in the onset of puberty. We have also shown a permanent decrease in brain levels of kisspeptin and an increase in brain levels of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor, the major stress hormone receptor. This provides a unique opportunity not only to discover key interaction between the stress hormone system (CRH) and the trigger system (kisspeptin) that controls the timing of puberty, but may help future developments of more effective treatments for stress-related disorders of puberty.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F007396/1","grantId":"BB/F007396/1","fundValue":"455600","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our research is at the forefront of stress and kisspeptin signalling, the latter the cornerstone of reproduction including puberty.

We have also encouraged other research groups to address new question relating to reproductive physiology, in addition to promoting new avenues of kisspeptin physiology into the cardiovascular arena. Our work on the early programming effects of immunological challenges has also gone beyond the boundary of reproductive physiology and into potential neuroprotective effects in brain function working with new collaborators in China. The latter may well provide exciting new opportunities for international collaboration.

Late onset of puberty can have serious health effects and often raises a great deal of anxiety in the individual or family concerned. A delay in puberty can be caused by many factors, including malnutrition, emotional and social deprivation and in particular stress. There is growing awareness that adverse early life environments can exert long-term &amp;quot;programming&amp;quot; effects on a number of body functions resulting in major detrimental effects on health and disease later in life. The overall aim of this project was to investigate the neural mechanisms by which adversity in neonatal life programmes pubertal delay. A mild immunological challenge (exposed to a bacterial substance called an endotoxin) in neonatal rats, simulating a bacterial infection which is extremely common in the perinatal period in humans worldwide, was shown not only to delay the onset of puberty but to have long-term adverse effects on the function of the ovary and the ovarian reproductive cycle. In addition, the responsivity to stress-induced suppression of the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator, the key brain system that drives the whole of reproduction, was enhanced in the adult rats that were challenged as neonates. Moreover, a critical time window limited to the first postnatal week was evident for these long-term programming effects. The neural mechanisms underlying the delay of puberty onset in response neonatal exposure to endotoxins involved a down-regulation of the newly discovered brain chemical system called kisspeptin that is undoubtedly the single most important activator of the GnRH neural system. This down regulation was not only evident at the time of puberty but persisted into adulthood, which might also explain the increased sensitivity to stressful events at this later stage. We also discovered an increase in brain levels of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor, the major stress hormone receptor that might play a part in delaying puberty. In addition, we discovered a novel role for the CRH system in the timing of normal puberty, adding credence to the notion of an importance for CRH signalling in pubertal delay under adverse conditions. Interestingly, antagonists of the CRH system did not block the delay of puberty in response to neonatal endotoxin, suggesting that other brain chemical systems are involved, which remain to be established. Nevertheless, this project revealed a novel interaction between CRH and kisspeptin signalling in the brain. We have shown for the first time that CRH or a variety of different stressors suppress kisspeptin and its cognate receptor in the brain concomitant with a reduction in GnRH pulse generator frequency. Moreover, we demonstrated that kisspeptin signalling in the brain is critical for modulating the frequency of the GnRH pulse generator. The general public are always interested in reproductive phenomena and our research will help them in that endeavor; I receive numerous e-mail queries relating to infertility issues, particularly from people in the USA. The knowledge gained from this research can clearly be used to help understand the impact of stress on fertility, which is not insignificant and increasingly prevalent not only within human society but in the agricultural and fisheries industries. The information may be extremely useful in the development of new drugs for treating stress related disorders. The fact that stress-induced infertility or sub-fertility has numerous knock on consequences, eg brittle bone, cardiovascular and cognitive impairment means it is a cornerstone in health and well being and indeed it is not unreasonable to think of its potential in terms of food security and biodiversity.
