Until recently the focus has largely been on correspondence between more privileged members of society, but interest has been growing in the sourcing, preservation and documentation of letters written by emigrants, belonging to all social classes (see, for example, Miller 1985, Kamphoefner, Helbich and Sommer 1988, Fitzpatrick 1994, Gerber 2006 and Cancian 2010). Emigrant letters are expressive and indicative of correspondents' identities, values, preoccupations and beliefs, and are a powerful source of information and understanding about migration issues. Researchers have transcribed the original manuscripts, or scanned them using optical character recognition (OCR), and by digitising letter collections have made them more accessible and, to a certain extent, more searchable by fellow academics and the general public. Unfortunately, however, emigrant correspondence projects have almost always evolved independently of one another. Although they have been successful in tackling important research questions relating to social history and immigration studies, they have not joined forces, or engaged with stakeholder groups from other disciplines who might be able to contribute to our knowledge of the migrant experience.\n\nMoreover, different letter collections cannot easily interconnect if they are simply digitised without further annotation and markup. Annotation could provide new and creative ways of exploring, extrapolating and visualising the content, to see whether features observed in one letter are also evident in other letters, within or across letter collections. Relatively few projects have moved beyond the digitisation stage to examine how new technologies can be used to exploit text content and enhance the usability and searchability of emigrant letter collections. \n\nThe purpose of this project is to bring together the various stakeholder groups working with emigrant letter collections to explore the digital potential of these very idiosyncratic documents. Central to this will be the development of a system of correspondence annotation and markup to represent the linguistic, structural, discoursal, contextual and physical properties of the letters, thus offering different layers of meaning and 'ways in' to the texts. This will allow for more sophisticated searches - the outputs of which can then be presented through meaningful visualisations. \n\nThe Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Correspondence SIG, established in 2008, has made some headway in developing a system of markup for correspondence generally. It has not yet addressed the specific features of emigrant letters, which present unique methodological challenges. Through the proposed series of international workshops, TEI experts, archivists, curators, historians, immigration scholars and linguists will be provided with the opportunity to consider ways in which emigrant letters can best be digitally represented in order to offer multi-perspective, cross-disciplinary ways of examining and understanding experiences of migration. Through sharing expertise and knowledge transfer, it is hoped that this work will pave the way for fully interoperable resources, allowing letter collections to speak to different audiences and eventually integrate with other letter collections, thus promoting new ways of understanding and researching. Although the focus of these workshops will be on emigrant letter collections, the discussions can also inform best practice in the markup of other types of correspondence, for example e-mail, benefiting an even wider range of stakeholders working in this field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K006231/1","grantId":"AH/K006231/1","fundValue":"24779","fundStart":"2013-04-08","fundEnd":"2014-07-07","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The TEI P5 markup schema for emigrant letters, produced by Peter Stadler and his team at Universit?t Paderborn for this project, has been uploaded onto GitHub (https://github.com/peterstadler/Emigrant-Letters). This work has greatly influenced the TEI Correspondence Special Interest Group, which is currently in the process of finalising guidelines for the annotation of all forms of digitised correspondence.\nThe visualisation techniques discussed and developed during the course of the project will be introduced to a wider group of researchers at a workshop sponsored by the Corpus Linguistics Special Interest Group for the British Association for Applied Linguistics, to be held at Coventy University on December 6th 2014.\nSchools workshops, held in conjunction with the end-of- project exhibition in the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Coventry, introduced three classes of local primary school children to stories of migration, and led to cross-curriculum school activities relating to history, geography, creative writing and personal identity.\nThe exhibition also provided an opportunity for young refugees to display photographs on the theme of 'departure' 'journey' and 'arrival' they had made for the Some Cities project, in conjunction with the Refugee Council.

We selected the linguistic, structural, discoursal, contextual and physical properties to be annotated in these collections, and we decided how the properties should be categorised and named in conformity with standards agreed by the Text Encoding Initiative consortium. We also explored how digital technologies can be used to visualise marked-up letter collections in useful and meaningful ways, using geo-tags to visualise spaces and the movement of people, and using wordtrees and wordclouds to identify themes or phraseological patterns. The Wordtree interface (developed by Paul Stephenson, Programmer) was used to visualise a small collection of emigrant letters (the Lough Family Letters) http://wordtree.coventry.ac.uk/?LOUGH\nMetadata from the Immigration History Research Centre at the University of Minnesota and the Irish Emigration Database at the Mellon Centre for Migration Studies, Omagh was used to create visualisations of correspondence \nhttp://development.nialloleary.ie/correspondence/correspondence.php We will apply the guidelines and techniques developed for this project when working with new letter collections. For example we are now planning a 'Sent to Coventry' database of letters to and from Coventry emigrants.\nThe display boards from the end-of-project exhibition will be transferred to the Irish Emigration Database at the Mellon Centre for Migration Studies, Omagh.
