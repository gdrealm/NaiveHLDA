The series aims to build dialogues and research networks that are international and interdisciplinary, that connect academics and practitioners and that bridge divides between social sciences, humanities and design.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The premise of this programme is that light is a material through which people organize social space, constituting light as an infrastructure of everyday modern life and interaction. At the same time lighting design and technology are a rapidly developing field through which central issues of built space are being rendered visible and often controversial. This seminar series therefore affords a first opportunity to develop social science methodologies, perspectives, knowledges and theories in relation to a central feature of everyday life and the technical, regulatory and design practices through which it is configured.&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000970/1","grantId":"ES/L000970/1","fundValue":"30392","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Donald Richard Slater","coPersons":["Joanne  Entwistle"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
