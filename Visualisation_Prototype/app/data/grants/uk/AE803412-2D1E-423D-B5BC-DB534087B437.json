Zinc, in its ionised form Zn2+, is an essential metal ion in mammals and performs a wide range of important physiological functions by allowing many vital chemical reactions to occur. Zinc is known to play roles in fertility and development, the immune system, ageing, and major diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer. Unfortunately however, the molecular mechanisms that enable zinc to get to where it is needed after it enters the bloodstream, following sequestration from the diet, are not fully understood.\n\nIt is known that a particular protein called serum albumin (that is highly abundant in the blood) plays an important role in transporting zinc (and other metals including calcium and magnesium) in the blood. Serum albumin not only carries zinc through the circulatory system but also mediates its uptake into cells. The molecular mechanisms that control the interaction between zinc and serum albumin and its uptake into cells are largely unknown. It is important that these interactions are understood. Albumin also transports other types of molecules (e.g. fatty acids, hormones) and binding of one particular molecule can affect binding of another at a separate site. For example, we previously identified a zinc site that is perturbed by fatty acid-binding elsewhere on the molecule. Physiological events that alter the small molecule composition of blood can therefore alter metal transport processes. Such events may be short-term (e.g. fasting, eating, infection, stroke) or long-term (obesity, disease). Long-term alterations in blood chemistry are particularly likely to have serious consequences due to the knock-on effects caused by altered metal binding/delivery.\n\nWe have identified three regions on the molecule that are likely to form novel metal binding sites. We will examine whether these regions that are involved in or impact upon zinc transport by synthesising mutant serum albumin proteins with chemical alterations at each site. These alterations will remove important chemical groups that are likely to participate in metal binding. The ability of each &quot;altered protein&quot; to bind zinc and other relevant metals will be examined and compared to the native (or &quot;normal&quot;) protein using complementary approaches. We will also examine whether binding of molecules (including metals) at other sites alters the binding properties of each site.\n\nThe importance of known and newly identified zinc-binding sites in mediating zinc uptake into cultured vascular endothelial cells (a particular type of cell that lines the blood vessels) will be determined by incubating these cells with albumins that contain alterations at each zinc site and physiological levels of zinc. The amount of zinc taken up by the cells will then be measured. \n\nThe outcome of these experiments will allow a better understanding of how metal ions are transported in the circulatory system. Particularly with regard to the events that can alter this process and the importance of albumin in mediating cellular zinc uptake. This provides important physiological information that will help us to understand a variety of physiological and disease processes that involve metals and will aid in their study.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J006467/1","grantId":"BB/J006467/1","fundValue":"507321","fundStart":"2012-04-09","fundEnd":"2015-04-08","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have not been used by others as yet - the majority of the results which have arisen from this grant are still to be published.

Serum albumin is the main protein in blood plasma and is involved in trasporting a wide range of metabolites and essential nutrients in the circulation including zinc. As part of this work we have identified and are in the process of structurally characterising physiologically relevant zinc binding sites on albumin. We have also examined the impact that other plasma molecules, which are also transported by albumin (such as fatty acids and metals such as calcium and magnesium) on albumin's ability to bind zinc. We have shown that these molecules perturb albumin's ability to bind zinc either directly or allosterically. In addition, we examined albumin's abililty to transport zinc into endothelial cells (these are the cells that line our blood vessells). Our results indicated that albumin does enter these cells but this process does not influence total zinc levels inside the cell. Suggesting that this process is not essential for zinc uptake into such cells. The work provides detailed and reliable qualitative and quantitative data relating to zinc handling in the circulation. This includes the binding properties of serum albumin toward zinc (and other metals) in various physiologically relevant states and the significance of this interaction in mediating the cellular uptake of zinc. As well as the considerable academic benefits provided by this research at the systems level, this work will deliver positive economic and societal impacts on animal health and agriculture, as well as human health (including reproduction and development). The relevance of zinc for all aspects of biology remains greatly under-appreciated; hence, generating a raised awareness of the importance of zinc biology for these areas is expected to have long-term impacts on the livestock farming industry and veterinary practitioners.\n\nThe outcomes of this work may also be exploited directly within the commercial private sector, primarily by biotechnology, biomanufacturing and biopharmaceutical companies. The development of albumin mutants with altered metal-binding properties may be used to develop new in vitro cell systems, for the development of serum replacement media for clinical use, and/or for the formulation of vaccines and other drugs. It is also possible that albumin could be engineered to provide a first generation of selective biocompatible protein-based chelation agents. Recombinant serum albumin is currently used clinically and its manufacture is a vibrant global industry with key players in Europe, USA and Asia.
