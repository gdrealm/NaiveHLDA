{"id":"7A09CAAB-97BC-477F-B6B1-9E761AB3F944","title":"Use of the tetracycline-regulated transactivator system to study the role played by galanin in sensory neuron survival","abstractText":"Galanin is a small protein that is widely expressed in the pain-sensing nerves (DRG) of the body. The levels of galanin in these nerves increase by a least 100 fold after an injury or cut to the nervous system. To find out more about the galanin protein we have used the techniques of genetic engineering to generate mice in which galanin has been deleted in the pain sensing nerves. This causes a complete reversal of neuropathic pain in a number of different animal models. We have now shown that galanin is necessary for the survival of some pain sensing neurons and in its absence they die shortly after birth.\n\nThis application is a direct continuation of our previous MRC-funded studies and we will use the latest techniques in genetic engineering to separate and further study the roles played by galanin and its receptor subtypes in the pain sensing nerves during development and in the adult, with specific reference to neuropathic pain behaviour.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000863","grantId":"G1000863","fundValue":"701358","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Wynick","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
