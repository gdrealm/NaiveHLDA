{"id":"66E5F37F-BC35-4AA2-BD1D-44847770EB68","title":"SKA preconstruction phase at UCL","abstractText":"The Square Kilometre Array will be the largest radio facility every built. It will cost all the member countries 650MEuros to build in its first incarnation. It will be able to provide the most accurate radio images every taken and will touch several areas of physics including Cosmology, Galaxy Formation, Galaxy Evolution, The Cradle of Live, Fundamental tests of General Relativity via Pulsars as well as tests of Cosmic Magnetism. \n\nIn order to build such an instrument the participating countries are funding a large effort to design such an array by outlining algorithms and pipelines which will be sufficient to solve the data reduction issues which will be faced by this enormous project. The aim of this project will be to contribute to this design phase and perform the necessary tasks which will enable the SKA to start its construction phase in 2016.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M001946/1","grantId":"ST/M001946/1","fundValue":"296716","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Filipe Batoni Abdalla","coPersons":["Jeremy Andrew Yates","Jason  McEwen"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
