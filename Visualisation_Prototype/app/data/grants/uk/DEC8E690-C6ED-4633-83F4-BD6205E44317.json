{"id":"DEC8E690-C6ED-4633-83F4-BD6205E44317","title":"A universal pipeline for genetically-encoded fluorescent biosensor production","abstractText":"Advances in high-resolution bio-imaging have revolutionised research in the life sciences and medicine allowing the localisation and movement of proteins within living cells to be visualised and quantified. However, in addition to proteins, there are many other important biomolecules such as metabolites and signal molecules which have not proved so easy to quantify in the same way. The problem is that one has to design a fluorescent sensor protein for each biomolecule. The fluorescence properties of these proteins change when they bind the target molecule, providing a readout of its concentration in the cell. These fluorescent sensors are difficult to make, partly because they rely on identifying a suitable protein that both binds the target molecule and, upon doing so, changes shape substantially - it is this shape change that causes the detectable change in properties of a linked fluorescent protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP).\n\nWe have devised an alternative method of constructing fluorescent sensor proteins that does not require the receptor protein to undergo a large shape-change. This massively increases the range of potentially useful receptor proteins and also allows receptor proteins to be identified from antibody libraries. This proposal is to assess the new sensor design by making two test sensors, one for a peptide and one for the hormone estrogen. If successful, our design would represent a universal platform from which biosensors for any molecule could be constructed. We would make this platform available to academic researchers and anticipate that it would dramatically speed up the collecting of critically important data about small molecule dynamics in living organisms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K01353X/1","grantId":"BB/K01353X/1","fundValue":"119636","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Ultimately this high-risk project did not fully provide proof of principle for the biosensor design.

The idea is that a receptor for the small molecule of interest will be placed next to a CFY and a peptide that interacts with the receptor ligand binding site will be placed next to a YFP. In the absence of the small molecule, the peptide will interact with the receptor, bringing the CFP and YFP together and leading to FRET. The presence of the small molecule will disrupt this interaction and reduce FRET.\n\nIn this pump-priming project (funded for 1 year under the tools and resources development fund) we demonstrated that the FRET-sensitive peptide-receptor interaction occurred and was dependent on the nature of the peptide.\n\nHowever, we were unable to demonstrate sensitivity of the FRET signal to the target small molecule. This was because of two unforseen problems: first there was a high level of basal FRET caused by the nature of the linker between the FRET pair. We demonstrated that lengthening the linker reduced basal FRET but further optimisation will be required to completely solve this problem. Secondly, we tested an antibody-receptor interaction but this failed as a sensor because the single-chain antibody fragment was prone to homo-dimerisation leading to inter-molecular FRET that was independent of the presence of exogenous peptide. more optimisation is required to fully develop the concept and this is currently underway through a DTP-funded PhD student. In addition to being used as biosensors, we envisage developing metabolite sensitive transcriptional switches that would be invaluable in synthetic biology. We hope to exploit such switches to design synthetic interactions between plant roots and beneficial bacteria. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
