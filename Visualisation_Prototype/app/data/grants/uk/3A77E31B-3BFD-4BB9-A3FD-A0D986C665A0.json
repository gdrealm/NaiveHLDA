Leaving aside Sub-Saharan Africa (where fertility is mostly still high), the total fertility rate for the developing world is 2.3 children per woman.This marks a spectacular decline from values of 5-6 that were common only a few decades ago. Moreover, fertility is still falling in most developing countries.</p>\n\n<p>The most widely used model of population change is that of the &quot;demographic transition&quot;. In terms of this model, much of the developing world is, or soon will be, &quot;post-transitional&quot;. Unfortunately, the determinants of post-transitional fertility are far from being well understood. Moreover, the existing literature on both the causes and the implications of very low fertility is almost exclusively concerned with developed countries.This leaves us facing two fundamental and unanswered questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>How far will fertility fall in the developing world?</li>\n\n <li>How can individuals, families, societies and governments in the developing world best adapt to this new fertility regime? </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>This seminar will be a pioneering enterprise, with the scope for making a significant contribution to policy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0858","grantId":"RES-451-26-0858","fundValue":"17431","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Overall, the most important impact of the Seminar Series was to simulate primary research and theorising low fertility in developing country contexts. The Seminar Series have opened a new territory within demography. The Seminar Series attracted 40 papers (both developing and developed countries) which given the current scope of the topic area is a very significant number. These papers have provided a significant contribution to the understanding of low fertility in developing country contexts and identified the areas for further research and theorising. Thus, the Seminar Series have helped to advance our understanding of low fertility in developing countries.

The objective of the seminar series was to understand the causes and implications of emerging low fertility in developing countries. Each seminar had specially invited senior speakers, mid and early career fellows, policy planners and members of governments and non-governmental organisations. About 100 people from various academic and professional backgrounds from across the globe participated in the Seminar Series (SS) and about 40 presentations were made. The first seminar examined fertility change in the global context and focused on Asia and Africa region. The seminar highlighted the need for theoretical advancement in understanding post-transition fertility in developing countries. The second seminar examined national, regional, state and district level fertility in India and noted existing below-replacement level fertility in Southern India and pockets of high fertility states. It recommended the need for research into low fertility, particularly, the implications of this on women, families and society. The final seminar examined post-transition fertility in developing countries within the context of European fertility. In sum, the SS highlighted emerging low fertility in developing countries and the need to undertake further research to inform policy so that programmes can be developed in order to fully utilise the opportunities offered by low fertility and mitigate any negative consequences. The papers presented at the Seminar Series are deposited at the Research Councils' Research Outcomes System and edited volume is currently under preparation. 1. Academic community: The Seminar Series helped academic community to appreciate and undertake collaborative research in the area of low fertility in developing countries. \n2. Population conferences: Population organising committees (e.g IUSSP, PAA) had session on low fertility. \n3. Journals: Journal are taking interest to publish low fertility issues in developing countries \n4. Post graduate students: We think that the Seminar Series presentations, Advertisement for Seminar, Call for papers for the special Journal of Biosocial Sciences volume in Economic and Political Weekly generated interest among post graduate to take up issues within low fertility in their research.
