On such markets, bidding and auction mechanisms have replaced or complemented traditional fixed price allocation mechanisms. </p>\n\n<p>This project will assess the implications of the selected mechanism for capacity choices and welfare. It will determine under which conditions on production costs and customer valuations auctions dominate fixed price mechanisms in terms of capacity choices and expected surplus, and vice versa. This is particularly relevant when allocation mechanisms are instituted with the aim of delivering signals guiding capacity investments, as eg in the case of long term system entry capacity to the UK gas transmission network. </p>\n\n<p>Empirical analyses of the UK LTSEC, UK electricity generation and US sulphur dioxide emission markets will evaluate these markets in terms of implemented allocation mechanisms and capacity in light of the theoretical model predictions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1608","grantId":"RES-000-22-1608","fundValue":"44494","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The methodological and applied work on micro-econometric demand analysis outlined here has been repeatedly used by the UK Competition Commission (since 2002) and the Co-operation &amp; Competition Panel (now Monitor) of the UK Department of Health (since 2009) in their respective competition analyses, and also by the Hong Kong Consumer Council in its Public Estate Supermarket Study (since 2011).
