Without major advances in production, food shortages will become more frequent across the globe, including developed parts of the world. It is therefore essential that we ensure sufficient food is available, in other words to establish &quot;global food security&quot;. The world population currently stands at 7 billion but is predicted to increase to 9 billion by 2050. This is a major threat to food security, but there are also other exacerbating pressures. There is a need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reduce global warming and climate change, while land and crops are being increasingly used to produce alternative energy sources to fossil fuels (coal, gas and oil). This leads to competition for land, water, energy and the sources of food themselves. To produce more food requires either more land (which isn't available) or an improvement in the efficiency of production. Increases in personal wealth in developing countries is predicted to increase the demand for meat and animal products, which consumers associate with a higher quality diet and social status. However, meat requires significantly more resource to produce than other foods. Meat producing animals, such as pigs and poultry, commonly require grain-based feeds which will become an increasingly limited resource, due to competition from human diets and the biofuels industry. These pressures make it important to reduce the quantity of feed required per unit meat produced, thereby improving &quot;feed efficiency&quot;. To do this, use of technologies will be required including those not currently deemed acceptable to the consumer (in the EU at least), although threats to food security may change consumers values and ethical stances.\n\nFor efficient production of meat, the goal is to maximize the deposition of nutrients (particularly protein) into skeletal muscle and repartition nutrients (particularly those for energy) away from fat. The liver is critical as it processes nutrients and plays a major role in coordinating whole body protein and energy metabolism. Animal growth promoters are used legally in some countries (Australia, Brazil and USA), but not the EU, and have the effect of increasing lean while decreasing body fat. The objective of this project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which these agents affect these tissues. Pigs will be given either a beta agonist (BA) or growth hormone (GH), and compared to a control group over a time course (28 days) during which these agents are known to increase feed efficiency. Skeletal muscle, liver and fat tissues will be collected at 5 fixed time points (1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days). Three of these time points will be subsequently selected for more &quot;in-depth&quot; measurements, based on the growth data and expression of some key genes. Using a technique called &quot;deep sequencing&quot; all the genes expressed in these 3 tissues at these 3 timepoints will be identified along with other genetic material called microRNA, which is involved in determining which proteins are produced. Deep sequencing produces a large quantity of information, which will identify the genes and microRNAs produced by these pig tissues; information which by itself will enhance our understanding. Secondly, by comparison between the treatment groups, those genes and microRNAs influenced by the growth promoters will be identified. Finally, the relationships and interactions (so called networks) between the expressed genes and tissues will be identified, to determine common processes influenced by these growth promoters. The expectation is that specific &quot;key&quot; genes and processes (i.e. networks) will be identified in these tissues, which could be manipulated in the future to enhance the efficiency of animal growth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J005320/1","grantId":"BB/J005320/1","fundValue":"294493","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which anabolic agents enhance feed efficiency and lean tissue deposition in pigs, through an examination of their effects on coordinated changes in gene expression across skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver. \nOur work has identified specific genes and associated signalling pathways which appear to be an integral part of the growth response to the anabolic agents. From this research we have identified an number of gene products that are currently being investigated by our pharmaceutical industry collaborators (Zoetis) as potential targets for manipulation. The initial approach is a proof-of-principle analysis of gene products which will then enable more specific gene products to be identified which could be developed as so-called drugable targets. Our work is still ongoing and it is hoped that other gene targets will be identified which are direct involved in enhanced muscle growth and improved feed utilisation efficiency.\nIn addition our research work is discovering some of the fundamental molecular mechanisms which appear to be responsible for muscle hypertrophy. Through presentation and publication of our findings we are current disseminating our research to the general scientific community, especially those involved the health implications of the loss of muscle mass.

An examination of gene expression has involved a variety of methodologies. This has included the adaptation of computer programs that examine time course data to allow the data-centred grouping of genes changing expression with a similar profile. This has allowed us to identify that induction of muscle hypertrophy by these agents is associated in some very early co-ordinated changes in gene expression of specific metabolic pathways. A novel aspect of our findings is that the anabolic agents appear cause an induction of the capacity of the muscle to synthesize specific amino acids, which under certain circumstances, such as rapid growth, are known to become limiting. Some of the products of these genes are being currently investigated by our pharmaceutical industry collaborators as potential targets for manipulation to increase the efficiency of pig growth. This approach to improve animal growth efficiency is being considered as a potential way of achieving the global food security target of sustainable intensification of food production. \n\nAs the project is still within its funding period a significant amount of the research is ongoing. We believe that the project has met the expected objectives to date. Data is still currently being analysed to identify changes in the expression of other genes, particular within liver and fat, which may be involved in the nutrient repartitioning effect of anabolic agents, which results in lean tissue deposition and the decline in body fat. Although this project is identifying the mechanisms by which muscle growth can be increased in production animals, the findings can be translated to inform healthcare research. The reduction of muscle mass, particulalry in aging, has significant health implications. It is very likley that the genes we identify that are involved in muscle growth are important in processes which could maintain muscle mass in humans, and thereby maintain health.
