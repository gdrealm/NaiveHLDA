One of its jobs is to transfer nutrients and oxygen from maternal to fetal blood. Blood flow is normally controlled by squeezing or relaxing the elastic walls of blood vessels, so that they become narrower or wider as required. In pregnancy however, the walls of the maternal vessels in the womb are invaded, broken down and rebuilt by placental cells, called trophoblast, to make the vessels constantly wide. This ensures that the placenta is supplied with sufficient blood to provide the developing baby with all the building blocks it needs to grow properly. Evidence from previously published work suggests that the normal invasion of the mother's womb is deficient in pregnancy diseases such as pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction. If the blood vessels aren't altered properly, the mother can become seriously ill and the baby can be born too small or too early. There's also a life-long impact on health as infants from such pregnancies have an increased chance of developing obesity, cardiovascular disease or diabetes in adulthood.\nCurrently, there is no way to correct these defects in placental development. Drug companies shy away from making drugs for use in pregnancy because they are fearful of harming unborn babies with their new products, and want to avoid expensive lawsuits. Instead, they invest in other areas of research, leaving doctors with few alternatives for treating pregnant women. One potential solution to this problem is to exploit compounds, such as hormones, that are naturally synthesized by the body, or to utilize drugs that target relevant pathways but have been developed for other diseases. \nIn this proposal we plan to investigate how trophoblast invasion and transformation of maternal blood vessels are affected by a lipid known as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is known to control the movement of cells in other organ systems and animal models, but little is known about its role during early pregnancy. So far, our experiments, using models of the cells at the maternal-fetal interface, suggest that the chemical machinery needed to respond to this lipid is present and that S1P stops the trophoblast from moving. We also have data from pilot studies to suggest that it might be possible to alter the chemical machinery, and therefore prevent the negative effects of S1P, using vitamin D. These preliminary findings are interesting because recent work by other investigators has revealed that the women with pre-eclampsia and / or fetal growth restriction often have low levels of vitamin D.\nHere we want to use human and animal tissue to create better models for studying the effect of S1P on trophoblast transformation of blood vessels. We will then test what happens to the breakdown of the vessels from the womb when the activity of S1P is altered by vitamin D and other potential regulators of the S1P machinery; such compounds have been developed as therapies for cancer and neurological disease. If our results are good, we would apply for further funding for a clinical trial to test the drugs in women whose pregnancies are complicated by pre-eclampsia or fetal growth restriction.\nNovel approaches to tackling the sub-optimal fetal growth caused by pregnancy disease are desperately needed; not only do fetal growth abnormalities have devastating consequences for individual families, they contribute to the significant societal and economic burden associated with obstetric/neonatal care and the management of adult chronic disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M02296X/1","grantId":"MR/M02296X/1","fundValue":"531794","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  Johnstone","coPersons":["Melissa  Westwood","Mark Robert Dilworth","John  Aplin","Martin  Hewison"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
