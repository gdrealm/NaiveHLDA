Each time a cell divides into two, it must first duplicate its genetic material by a process known as DNA replication. For DNA replication to begin, the two DNA strands that make up the familiar coil of the DNA double helix must be separated. Central to this process of DNA unwinding is a &quot;molecular machine&quot; called the MCM complex. The MCM complex is indispensable for DNA unwinding during DNA replication and is composed of six individual protein sub-components called Mcm2, Mcm3, Mcm4, Mcm5, Mcm6 and Mcm7. The importance of MCM function for health is highlighted by the fact that impaired or perturbed MCM function can lead to the developmental defects and tumour formation. Indeed, MCM protein levels are already an important clinical marker for certain types of cancer. Understanding precisely how the MCM complex performs its function is a major focus of research worldwide. \nThe work proposed in this application focuses not on the well-known MCM complex, but on a little-studied alternative form of the complex, one in which one of the six MCM sub-components (Mcm2) is substituted by a different protein altogether (MCM-BP), and aims to address several key questions, specifically, what is the actual structure of this new, variant MCM complex, precisely what function does it perform in the cell, and crucially, how does it contribute to the maintenance of chromosome integrity and disease avoidance? To address these questions, a simple model system will be used: a single-celled yeast that is easy to grow in the lab and which is ideally suited to the type of experimental work that will be used to determine the structure and cellular function of the new complex. The results obtained from analysis of the yeast complex will shed considerable light on the function of the corresponding complex in human cells and provide insights into the likely impact on human health when the function of the complex is impaired. In the longer term, the results of this study could lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases including cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M000648/1","grantId":"MR/M000648/1","fundValue":"371327","fundStart":"2014-10-31","fundEnd":"2017-10-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart Andrew MacNeill","coPersons":["Laura  Spagnolo"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
