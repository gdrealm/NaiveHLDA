{"id":"64DDB6D7-AE25-4A6F-B0F5-EEE587D4A852","title":"A sustained vaccine-vehicle for cattle pathogens","abstractText":"Infectious diseases of cattle have an enormous financial and welfare impact world-wide. High incidence pathogens with importance either through cattle disease (with associated loss of productivity) or the potential for human zoonosis include salmonella, E.coli O157, tuberculosis and Campylobacter, to name but a few. With a world cattle population in excess of 1.3 billion, the potential market for bovine vaccine products is enormous (currently estimated at 1 billion US$). Most cattle harbour the non-pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma theileri. This protozoan is sustained at low-levels without affecting productivity in beef and dairy herds. By utilising the genetic tractability of trypanosomatid parasites, we have developed T. theileri as a potential delivery system for antigens in cattle. Importantly, the vehicle is expected to persist at a low-level in cattle for long periods enabling sustained antigen delivery. Our prior work has overcome the major hurdles to development of the vehicle: namely, long-term in vitro culture, production of the stably-engineered vehicle and the expression of heterologous proteins. By optimisation and validation of the delivery system, we now wish to widen the technology to a stage suitable for evaluation of its commerical viability. Significantly, the process and production costs of the proposed vaccine-vehicle are likely to be low in comparison to existing vaccine strategies. By providing prolonged release of recombinant protein, T. theileri has the potential to afford a novel and flexible expression vehicle for immunogens from cattle pathogens. Our aims in this development phase are to: -optimise expression of exogenous proteins by the engineered parasite; -develop and validate a biological containment strategy for the vaccine-vehicle, and -examine maintenance and protein expression of the vaccine-vehicle in cattle and to assay the resulting antigen-specific immune responses. This application represents a partnership between UK academics (based at the University of Edinburgh and Moredun Research Institute) and Industry (Intervet). This provides a unique skills base to maximise the potential for ultimate commericalisation. The Industrial Partner, Intervet, is among the three most prominent animal health companies in the world and the leading company for animal vaccines. As such, their involvement brings a strong focus to the industrial applications of the project providing expertise in vaccinology, disease knowledge, and reagents to prove practicality of the system. In addition to their direct financial commitment to the proposal, the Industrial Partner also will contribute to ongoing IP protection and extensive provision of specialist contained facilities for animal trials. Combined, this represents an 'in-kind' contribution in excess of &pound;100,000, this equating to an approximately 20% financial contribution over-and above the 10% direct cash contribution required for an Industrial Partnership Application.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F00057X/1","grantId":"BB/F00057X/1","fundValue":"428088","fundStart":"2008-05-05","fundEnd":"2011-10-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project successfully developed a novel cattle vaccination approach based on a commensal protozoan antigen delivery vehicle. The technology, developed collaboratively with Intervet MSD has been patented, this being held by the Universty of Edinburgh. This research also made practical use of the extensive investment in the basic biology of trypanosomatid parasite. These are a model for ancient eukaryotic orgasisms and also important pathogens of the tropics.

However, there are also many species of trypanosomatids that do not cause disease and are distributed globally. One example is Trypanosoma (Megatrypanum) theileri, which is restricted to bovids and ubiquitous in cattle herds worldwide. This organism is maintained extracellularly in the blood and tissues long-term without any observed ill effects on host health or productivity. Using knowledge of gene expression and protein trafficking in pathogenic trypanosomatids, we successfully developed, from first principles, Trypanosoma theileri as a delivery system for vaccine antigens and therapeutics. Procedures for the growth, transfection and heterologous gene expression of T. theileri were developed, and the delivery of a vaccine antigen derived from Babesia divergens evaluated in vivo. Our results demonstrated the ability of T. theileri to be used as a flexible and easily manipulated protein delivery system suitable for the control of cattle pathogens and cattle-borne zoonoses. In one notable application, we proposed that the system could allow the expression of serum trypanolytic factors in cattle, with the potential to alleviate poverty in Africa through the killing of pathogenic trypanosomatids in livestock.
