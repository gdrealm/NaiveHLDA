{"id":"9E0D02AE-5F0F-4644-BD72-6084C1A11665","title":"The Geography of Digital Inequality","abstractText":"<p>Little is known about the geography of Internet use and online participation in Britain, although there is evidence of major geographic inequalities in access and use (eg Internet use in Scotland is 20 percentage points below the East Midlands).</p>\n\n<p>This research will produce the first detailed geographic estimates of Internet use. Specifically it will combine the Oxford Internet Survey (OxIS) with the census and several special-purpose datasets on important metrics of Internet use and participation (eg tweets, Wikipedia articles, photo uploads).</p>\n\n<p>The project will investigate the geography of several types of use. First is simple use or non-use of the Internet. There are many ways of interacting with, using, and communicating through the Internet, so the project will also examine online buying and selling, social networking, banking and finance, information and entertainment seeking, politics and communication.</p>\n\n<p>The Internet is a unique medium in that it allows ordinary users to create and distribute content. The project will thus explore online content production in the form of blogs, personal websites, uploading music or videos, and others.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The project will use maps of the geographic distribution of use as well as multivariate, inferential studies that predict the geographic inequalities in digital Britain.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00283X/1","grantId":"ES/K00283X/1","fundValue":"159105","fundStart":"2013-06-17","fundEnd":"2014-12-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  --Ofcom has used our findings to inform its research into digital media literacy. \n--Ofcom has also used our data to inform its policy on broadband regulation.\n--Government Digital Services has used out findings to inform its work on the government's Digital Inclusion Strategy\n--Government Digital Services has used our findings to inform its work on measurement of digital inclusion.

Some places where conventional wisdom suggests should have low levels of Internet use like Cornwall, Wales and Scotland, are not unusually low. Cornwall is actually above the UK average. The lowest levels of Internet use are in the Northeast region. Cities typically have higher levels of Internet use than the surrounding countryside, but this is not true in the Northeast. We have created a dataset containing estimates of Internet use at the level of the Census Output Area. This can be aggregated up to any higher level of administrative geography. It could be used by London Boroughs, or Metropolitan Districts in Glasgow to assess their level of Internet use, in comparison to neighboring areas. Since high levels of Internet use are closely tied to the availability of well-paying jobs and economic growth, this would give administrators insight into the economic prospects for their area.
