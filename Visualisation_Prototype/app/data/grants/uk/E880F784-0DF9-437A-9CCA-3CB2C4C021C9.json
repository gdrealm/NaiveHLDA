{"id":"E880F784-0DF9-437A-9CCA-3CB2C4C021C9","title":"Molecular mechanisms of TDP-43 mediated neurodegeneration","abstractText":"Tar DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) has been identified as the major disease protein in cellular aggregates found in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD). TDP-43 positive aggregates are also found in other neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, thereby defining a novel proteinopathy. Mutations in the encoding TARDBP gene characterise heritable and sporadic cases of ALS and FTLD and recent studies in flies, fish and mice reveal that too much or not enough available TDP-43 protein can both contribute to disease onset and progression. TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with faulty communication between nerve cells, which precede behavioural defects and progressive age-related degeneration of these nerve cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration remain elusive. Our hypothesis is, and our preliminary data suggest, that TDP-43 regulates dSarm/Sarm1 and Hiw/mycBP2, as target proteins that have been shown to mediate an active autodestruction program. Our hypothesis predicts that TDP-43 mediated deregulation of these proteins causes degeneration of nerve cells starting with destruction of their contact points and axonal extensions and proceeding to the cell body itself, thereby causing &quot;dying back-like&quot; neurodegeneration. Here we propose to use animal and cell culture models to test this hypothesis and to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 regulates dSarm/Sarm1 and Hiw/mycBP2. We also aim to identify ways to rescue disease formation in a fly model of TDP-43 related neurodegeneration, and to translate these findings into the human disease condition by detecting changes in RNA and protein expression levels of human dSarm/Sarm1 and Hiw/mycBP2 homologues. Given that TDP-43 proteinopathy characterises several neurodegenerative disorders, including dementia, the expected findings will be of general relevance and application as they likely identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for TDP-43 related neurodegeneration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L010666/1","grantId":"MR/L010666/1","fundValue":"319091","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Hirth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
