Currently the diagnosis can only be made by kidney biopsy, and a single biopsy provides limited information about the future risk of kidney failure. In addition, since this disease can run in families, there is a need for a test to predict whether relatives of patients might develop the disease. We aim to use genetic analysis, together with clinical measurements and disease markers, such as deglycosylated IgA to develop a way of predicting which patients are at risk of progression and which relatives are at risk of developing the disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K01353X/1","grantId":"MR/K01353X/1","fundValue":"878723","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mario  Falchi","coPersons":["Herbert Terence Cook","Charles D Pusey","Philippe  Froguel","Matthew Caleb Pickering"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
