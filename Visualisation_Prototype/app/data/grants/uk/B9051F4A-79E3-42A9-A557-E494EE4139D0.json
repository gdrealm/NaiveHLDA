Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, focus groups and observations. \n\n\n\nWomen's reasons for reducing food-related activities included changes in health, loss of a partner or a caring role and new patterns of socialising. Disengagement from cooking and shopping was not found to entail predominantly negative feelings, passive acceptance or searching for forms of support to re-enable more cooking from scratch. Accounts evidenced the dynamic adaptability of older women in actively managing changed relationships with food. In exploring new meal options, older women were not simply disengaging from their environments. CAFE findings linked women's engagement with their environments to how they were using formal services and, even more, to the value they placed on social engagement and being out and about. Through the connections they fostered with friends, family and community, older women actively enabled their continued involvement in their social, public and family spheres. \n\n\n\nReduced contact with preparing and cooking meals from scratch, therefore, did not induce or imply passivity or debility in the CAFE cohort. By contrast, it involved their exploring new means of retaining what was important to them about food in the context of their lived situation and social connections with friends, family, the community and public spheres. The dataset is available through the UK data archive and are being used by other researchers. We have used the results of CAFE to publish academic papers, teach medical and occupational therapy students, inform local policymaking on provision of meals on wheels and day centre meals, inform the local population (through local press and radio) and talk at national and international conferences.
