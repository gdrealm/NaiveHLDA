This is achieved through recognition of information contained within, or attached to, the cargo protein by molecular machinery that specifies delivery from one location to another. The function of many cells in the body require proteins to change location under different circumstances, e.g. in response to an external signal, or during different stages of development. This is achieved through regulated protein trafficking, a process central to many physiological processes including hormone secretion, antigen presentation, cell division and whole body glucose homeostasis. Protein trafficking defects have been identified in many disease states where these processes are perturbed. These include cancer, autoimmune diseases and diabetes. Understanding regulated protein traffic will therefore better arm us against these diseases.\n\nIn many examples of regulated trafficking, the signals that specify which trafficking step a protein is sorted into are often added to the protein in response to an external cue and can then be rapidly removed when no longer required. One example of this is the addition of the small protein ubiquitin to other proteins. The addition of ubiquitin (ubiquitination) has long been known to target proteins for degradation by delivering them into a pathway which leads to the lysosome - a compartment within the cell which functions to degrade proteins. E.g. many cell surface receptors that transmit information from outside to inside the cell are ubiquitinated following stimulation. This leads to their internalization and lysosomal delivery and serves to attenuate signaling events. The activity of de-ubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that remove ubiquitin has been shown to rescue some receptors from this pathway allowing recycling back to the cell surface, allowing the cell to fine-tune signaling responses. As well as signaling delivery of proteins from the cell surface to the lysosome, ubiquitin can also direct newly synthesized proteins there from the biosynthetic pathway.\n\nThis proposal is directed towards understanding the role of ubiquitin in regulated protein traffic, using sorting of the glucose transporter GLUT4 as a paradigm. Insulin stimulates glucose transport into fat and muscle cells by promoting delivery of a glucose transport protein (GLUT4) from a specialized internal store to the cell surface. In this way insulin increases the rate of glucose transport into fat and muscle, and thus controls whole body glucose homeostasis. Insulin-dependent delivery of GLUT4 to the cell surface is an example of regulated membrane traffic and is impaired in the disease states of insulin-resistance and Type-2 diabetes. We have recently demonstrated a role for ubiquitin in the delivery of GLUT4 into its specialized internal store. We have also identified a role for a DUB in GLUT4 traffic. We now aim to test our working model that describes how ubiqutination of GLUT4 sorts it into a lysosomal trafficking pathway. We propose that deubiquitination of GLUT4 then rescues the transporter from lysosomal degradation and that this deubiquitination is critical for sorting GLUT4 into the store from where it is mobilized to the cell surface in response to insulin. \n\nOur working model represents the first example of a DUB rescuing a ubiquitinated protein from lysosomal delivery via the biosynthetic pathway and thus introduces a new paradigm into the field. This study also has the potential to serve as a model for other regulated trafficking systems such as those mentioned above, whose dysfunction can lead to disease states and hence our work may lead to therapeutic interventions for a wide range of diseases including cancer and diabetes. In addition, many parasites and viruses hijack the host cell's trafficking machinery and therefore understanding this process may arm us in battle against such infectious agents.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J000221/1","grantId":"MR/J000221/1","fundValue":"426145","fundStart":"2012-06-11","fundEnd":"2015-06-10","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nia  Bryant","coPersons":["Gwyn William  Gould"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
