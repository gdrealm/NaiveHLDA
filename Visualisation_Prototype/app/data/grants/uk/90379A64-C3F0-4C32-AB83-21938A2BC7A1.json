{"id":"90379A64-C3F0-4C32-AB83-21938A2BC7A1","title":"Conservation, Markets and Justice: a comparative study of local and global conceptions","abstractText":"<p>This research project will contribute to the challenge to reconcile forest conservation with social justice for local people in developing countries. To do so, the project will generate new empirical data about what social justice means to these local people and work with donors, NGOs and policy-makers to bring this new knowledge into practice.</p>\n\n<p>The project will conduct research in three countries, China, Tanzania and Venezuela. In each site we will research local conceptions of environmental justice, for example what different groups of local people consider to be the fairest way of making decisions about forest management options, and what they consider to be the fairest way of distributing the costs and benefits associated with any intervention. We will test for the presence of some well known principles of justice using surveys and experimental economic games. But we will also employ more open, ethnographic methods for a more inductive approach to identifying justice norms. In addition to comparisons across countries and across intervention type, we will compare local conceptions of justice with those that are evident in the conservation interventions in that particular site.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005812/1","grantId":"ES/K005812/1","fundValue":"630240","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2016-09-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Not yet.
