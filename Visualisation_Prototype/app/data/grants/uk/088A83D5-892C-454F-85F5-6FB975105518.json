{"id":"088A83D5-892C-454F-85F5-6FB975105518","title":"Digital library of British printed images to 1700","abstractText":"This project will provide online access to some of the most vivid images that have come down to us from early modern Britain - namely, the entire collection of 16th and 17th century British prints in the British Museum. This is currently only partially catalogued and difficult to access. To this will be added a full corpus of engraved title-pages from the period. Scanned images of this material will be presented in annotated and fully searchable form on a purpose-built website. The project will also promote research on prints and their relationship to books and to the culture of the period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119202/1","grantId":"119202/1","fundValue":"312420","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Hunter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
