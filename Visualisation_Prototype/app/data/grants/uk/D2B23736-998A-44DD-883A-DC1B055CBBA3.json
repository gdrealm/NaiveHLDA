{"id":"D2B23736-998A-44DD-883A-DC1B055CBBA3","title":"Magnetic nanoparticles and the capture of influenza antigens for rapid diagnosis","abstractText":"The avian influenza situation worldwide and the possibility of a new pandemic has been of great concern for the general public and has received vocal coverage in the press. Central to the prevention of this possibility is the ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose the presence of the virus in suspect cases. This allows patient isolation to occur as soon as possible and, equally importantly, prevents mis-diagnosis which could cause panic. The applicants expertise is in the detection of virus components and in the field of nanomaterials. Together, these technologies have the potential to offer new and powerful approaches to rapid diagnosis of infections as they may be well suited to use in rural communities that have no possibility to access a regional reference centre. Both applicants are active in responding to media queries in their respective fields and take in interest in applying leading edge technology to significant real-world problems. The applicants will make every effort to be as open as possible about what is being achieved during the course of this award.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600503","grantId":"G0600503","fundValue":"508459","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Martin Jones","coPersons":["SCE  Tsang"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
