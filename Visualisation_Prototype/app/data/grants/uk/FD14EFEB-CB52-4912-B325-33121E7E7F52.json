{"id":"FD14EFEB-CB52-4912-B325-33121E7E7F52","title":"Financial Contagion: An Experimental Analysis","abstractText":"<p>This is an experimental analysis of contagion in financial markets. The theoretical literature has illustrated several channels of financial contagion: informational spillovers, herd behaviour, liquidity shocks, portfolio rebalancing, etc. </p>\n\n<p>The empirical analysis has found it difficult to gauge the relative importance of these channels. The problem for the empiricist is the lack of data on the private information available to traders and on shocks buffeting the economy. This problem can be overcome in an experimental study, where one can observe variables not available for actual financial markets. </p>\n\n<p>This study consists of a series of experiments where informed subjects trade financial assets in different markets. The study aims at estimating the relative importance of the various channels of transmission of shocks across markets. The experiments will test the predictions of the theoretical models of contagion, creating a bridge between the empirical and the theoretical literatures. They will also identify behavioural trading rules that are not discussed in the theoretical models, but used by decision makers. Such rules may exacerbate or limit the transmission of shocks across markets. Experimental results will also help to understand the field data, by shedding light on decision makersâ€™ reaction to different shocks.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-165-25-0008","grantId":"RES-165-25-0008","fundValue":"114171","fundStart":"2006-06-10","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Antonio  Guarino","coPersons":["Steffen  Huck"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
