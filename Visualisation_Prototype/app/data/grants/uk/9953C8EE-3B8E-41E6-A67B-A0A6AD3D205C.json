Such relationshipscan be used to predict the behavior and properties of each object. Forinstance, if a particular news article cites several sport articles,this is evidence that the particular article is likely to be aboutsports. We propose novel ways of exploring this relationalinformation. The first task is precisely how to predict the propertiesof an object (e.g., the class of a news article) based on otherobjects that that share a relationship with it (e.g., the otherarticles that are cited by or cite our target). We show that thereare important forms of relationship that are not properly treated bycurrent methods, and propose a new methodology to account for suchrelations. The second task focuses on ways to measure similarity ofrelational structures. For instance, if we know that two proteinsphysically interact inside a yeast cell, can we infer which otherpairs of proteins are linked in a similar way? We show how toformulate problems like this using probabilistic models, and developnovel ways of discovering patterns in relational data withapplications to a variety of real-world problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F026641/1","grantId":"EP/F026641/1","fundValue":"190576","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Due to the widespread availability of relational data, our work can be directly used in a variety of domains. For instance, companies that want to automatically generate metadocuments\nbased on classifying groups of text files (e.g., the pages generated automatically by Google News) will benefit from a new approach to classify relational objects: in their case, objects are text documents, and relationships are citations or hyperlinks between documents. Biologists that want to unveil new patterns of protein-protein interactions will benefit from new tools that measure similarity of relational structures. Moreover, our\nwork has also had a direct impact in theoretical machine learning. We developed new families of graphical models and inference algorithms which solve problems that cannot be treated with current machine learning methods.

The second task is how to measure similarity of relational structures. For instance, if two proteins are physically interacting inside a yeast cell, which other pairs of proteins are linked in a similar way? We showed which probabilistic models correspond to this question, and developed novel ways of discovering patterns in relational data with applications in molecular biology. We also explored aspects of causal learning, and how to combine large databases of relational data. Relational data are ubiquitous. Our methods can be used in many areas of Data Science to understand and predict the relations between objects. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
