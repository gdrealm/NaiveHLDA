Technological ingenuity has made life easy by replacing heavy manual work with powered tools and machines, but this has resulted in 'unwanted' vibration of the hand, causing injury (e.g. loss of tactile sensation due to vibration exposure), discomfort, annoyance, and fatigue. More than one million workers in the UK are estimated to be at risk of injury from hand-transmitted vibration (Palmer et al., 2000). Even so, some vibration can be made into 'wanted vibration', providing useful tactile feedback and assisting some tasks (e.g. vibration of mobile phones, vibration of steering wheels, vibration of guide canes). The optimum reduction of 'unwanted' vibration and the optimum production of 'wanted' vibration require an understanding of the sensations perceived in the human hand.There are four types of tactile channels responsible for the perception of mechanical stimuli in the non-hairy skin of the hand (i.e. P, NP I, NP II and NP III). These channels mediate sensations of vibration at threshold levels, with varying sensitivities and distinctive characteristics. The question is: How do these tactile channels combine to contribute to the sensations produced by vibration (such as varying degrees of discomfort, and the perception of changes in intensity)? The proposed research seeks to identify and model the tactile channels that are responsible for the sensation of supra-threshold vibration at the hand (i.e. vibration at magnitudes greater than the threshold of perception). A series of psychophysical studies will yield the response of an individual tactile channel to vibration stimuli while masking the response of another channel. The proposed multi-disciplinary research builds on recently acquired knowledge and techniques developed by the principal investigator (see, Morioka and Griffin, 2005a; 2005b; 2006a; 2006b).The effects on vibration perception of primary factors (i.e. vibration frequency, magnitude, direction and duration) and secondary factors (e.g. contact area, stimulus duration, skin temperature, stimulus gradient and age / all known to influence the sensitivity of tactile channels) will be examined to test specific hypotheses. The proposed project goes beyond the mere establishment of metrics for evaluating the subjective severity of vibration exposures. This research employs a unique approach to modelling tactile channels responsible for mediating the perception of supra-threshold vibration. The model will allow quantification of the subjective severity of vibration exposures by identifying the tactile channels responsible for perception in different skin-contact conditions. The model may also be used to identify the tactile channels that are likely to be damaged by occupational exposures to hand-transmitted vibration. The main applications of the research include: (i) predicting and reducing harmful vibration on tools and machines, and (ii) enhancing tactile feedback (and tactile communication) with appropriate artificial vibration. The major beneficiaries will be governments, health professions, industries, tool manufacturers, and employers who must consider minimising the discomfort and hazard caused by vibration. Consequently, the public will benefit from optimised hand-held tools and devices that provide them with an improved quality of life. The research will also have impact by advancing fundamental understanding of the tactile mechanisms. This fundamental research will benefit from the support of the EPSRC and has potential applications in areas where this is existing collaboration with industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G014108/1","grantId":"EP/G014108/1","fundValue":"136993","fundStart":"2009-03-16","fundEnd":"2012-08-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings from the research enabled to contribute towards consideration for revision of guidance (standards) for evaluating hand-transmitted vibration, and for diagnosing hand-and-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS).

Experiments were designed and conducted to investigate perception of vibration at threshold levels and supra-threshold levels using psychophysical measurement techniques. The main findings are:\n\n\n\nPerception thresholds:\n\n(a) Vibrotactile thresholds are lower at the thenar eminence (i.e., more sensitive) than at the volar forearm for all frequencies (8-250 Hz), consistent with greater density of tactile receptors in the glabrous skin of the hand. At the thenar eminence with frequencies greater than 20 Hz, larger contactors (e.g., 10-mm diameter) produce lower thresholds than smaller contactors (e.g., 6-mm diameter), showing the Pacinian channel (having spatial summation) mediated perception at threshold. With frequencies less than 20 Hz, the absence of an influence of contact area, and a threshold slope about -6 dB/octave indicated the involvement of the NP I channel in perception at threshold levels (Morrison, 2010 - MSc thesis).\n\n\n\nSupra-threshold perception:\n\n(b) A magnitude-dependence was found in equivalent sensation contours (i.e., vibration magnitudes producing similar degrees of sensation across frequencies), particularly at frequencies greater than 80 Hz. The varying shapes of the contours indicated more than one tactile channel was involved in the perception of vibration intensity over the frequencies (4 to 250 Hz) and magnitudes investigated (Morioka and Griffin, 2009; Wilson and Morioka, 2009).\n\n(c) At low frequencies (2 to 12.5 Hz), equivalent sensation contours did not differ between magnitudes investigated, and were similar to absolute thresholds, suggesting the same tactile channels are involved in perceiving vibration at threshold and supra-threshold levels (Pamouktsoglou and Morioka, 2009).\n\n(d) The effect of contact area on the subjective intensity of vibration was investigated over the frequency range 4 to 300 Hz. Spatial summation (i.e., vibration producing greater subjective intensity when presented over greater areas) depended on the frequency and the magnitude of vibration, consistent with the Pacinian channel contributing to subjective intensity with 63 and 125-Hz vibration at low magnitudes and also contributing to subjective intensity of 16 and 31.5 Hz vibration at high magnitudes (but not 16 and 31.5 Hz vibration at low magnitudes). In addition, there was evidence suggesting non-Pacinian channels mediate the subjective intensity of high frequency vibration at high magnitudes, as well as the subjective intensity of low frequency vibration at low magnitudes (Browne and Morioka, 2011). \n\n(e) Vibration of one hand (at 16 and 125 Hz) did not mask the perception of 125-Hz vibration in the other hand, suggesting bilateral in-channel masking does not occur (Morioka et al., 2011).\n\n\n\nThe findings allow quantitative predictions of sensations from hand-transmitted vibration and are consistent with a four-channel model proposed by Gescheider et al. (2001). \n\n\n\nThe work generated the following further research:\n\n(1) Steering-wheel vibration in automobiles - Research in progress with automobile industry;\n\n(2) Development of diagnostic methods for detecting sensorineural disorders, and the relation between vibration thresholds and vibration-induced vasoconstriction - Collaboration with Prof M.J. Griffin and Ying Ye.\n\n(3) Enhancing tactile feedback with artificial vibration (e.g., tactile hearing aids) - Collaboration with Dr S. Bell. The reduction of unwanted vibration is beneficial to all. It benefits tool users at risk of injuries associated with vibration and it reduces discomfort, thereby improving the quality of life. Initially, the beneficiaries will be governments, health professions, industries, tool manufacturers, and employers concerned with minimising the discomfort and hazard caused by vibration. People who experience vibration (e.g. drivers, tool users, and employees) should benefit from improved quality of life and reduced risk of injuries. In the longer term, the public (especially handicapped people) should benefit by tactile feedback, enhancing their performance and tactile communication. The following summarises the potential use from the research:\n\n\n\nGovernments and health professions: \n\n(i) Improved standards to minimise injury caused by hand-transmitted vibration\n\n(ii) Improved neurological diagnostic methods\n\n(iii) Methods of assessing the handicap caused by tactile sensory impairments.\n\n\n\nIndustries and manufacturers:\n\n(i) Prediction of vibration discomfort caused by vibratory hand-held tools\n\n(ii) Reduction of harmful vibration on tools and machines.\n\n\n\nUsers (including the handicapped):\n\n(i) Improved comfort and quality of life\n\n(ii) Enhanced tactile communication Major routes for exploiting the results from this research were/will be through publication in peer-reviewed international journals (e.g. Perception and Psychophysics, Somatosensory and Motor Research, International Archives of Occupational Environmental Health, Journal of Sound and Vibration, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Experimental Psychology, IEEE Transactions on Haptics, etc.), presentations at conferences and on the internet. \n\nThe results has been/will be disseminated to relevant standardisation committees (e.g. ISO TC 108 SC4 responsible for ISO13091-1 [2001] and ISO 5349-1, [2001]) and to industries through the involvement in other collaborative projects within the ISVR.
