Longer term impact will focus on activity and outcomes relating to grant applications, collaborations and publications.</p>\n\n<p>The partners have been chosen to allow for a variety of practice and policy contexts and to build on and strengthen existing academic and practice relationships.<br />The research focus will be to improve our understanding of relationships after a diagnosis of dementia. Knowing more about how relationships work will help dementia researchers, people developing national policy, people providing support and care services, and for people with dementia themselves.</p>\n\n<p>The UK now has guidance and national policy on diagnosis sharing and post diagnostic support. More globally, findings from the 10/66 Dementia Research Group show a more mixed picture. In India and Taiwan person centred care is a more recent development.<br />The project will support established and early career dementia researchers from UK, India and Taiwan to work together.<br /><br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J019550/1","grantId":"ES/J019550/1","fundValue":"22844","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Heather Ann Wilkinson","coPersons":["Karen  Watchman"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
