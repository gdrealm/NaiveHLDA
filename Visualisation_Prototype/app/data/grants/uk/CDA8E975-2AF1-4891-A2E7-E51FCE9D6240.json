The central aim of this two year study is to discover what motivates people with dementia to campaign. A further aim is to determine what impact such actions have on an individual, particularly in regard to their sense of&nbsp;citizenship. The study will take an ethnographic approach and use diary-interview method. Qualitative data will be collected from approximately twenty-five UK based&nbsp;campaigners in three phases. Phase one will involve talking to participants either individually or in groups about campaigning; phase two will involve asking participants to keep either a written, audio or photo diary about their campaign activities, during this phase the researcher will observe and photograph participants 'in action' at campaign events; the third phase will involve the researcher revisiting and talking to individuals about their diary entries.&nbsp; Findings from the research will be fedback to participants and other invited guests at a public event. In addition, three academic papers will be written with a view to contributing to knowledge and public policy on civic participation. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0270","grantId":"RES-061-25-0270","fundValue":"136234","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ruth Louise Bartlett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bradford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
