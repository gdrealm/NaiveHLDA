The concept of trust is particularly relevant these days, as some economists have attributed the ebbs and flows of the economy to irrational fluctuations in our confidence in others. Trust will be defined as the subjective expectation that others will not harm or disadvantage us in instances when they have an opportunity to do so. Accordingly, trust decisions will be defined as the decisions that give others such an opportunity. Why do people differ in the ways and degrees in which they trust familiar or unfamiliar others in given interpersonal situations? What dynamic interplay of parameters determines trust decisions in interpersonal interactions? Can such decisions be facilitated or inhibited by some intervention and how? These questions are at the heart of this project. To answer these questions we will design experiments that entail 'on-line' interpersonal exchanges and will model the complexity of human behaviour in these interactions using advanced methods. We will measure the dynamic influence of various individual traits and social signals (e.g. 'trustworthy' behaviour by others) on people's decisions to trust others. In this endeavour, we will use the oxytocin system as a tool. \n\nThe oxytocin system in the brain may be one of the main mechanisms driving individual differences in the expression of interpersonal trust. In animal studies, scientists have discovered that this neural system, which uses the hormone oxytocin to communicate with other brain areas, plays a key role in inter-species differences in social behaviour, as well as in differences between members of the same species. For example, the oxytocin system has been shown to influence the formation of lasting attachments with one's offspring or peers, the display of caring behaviour towards offspring or partners, social play, the recognition of one's partner's or offspring's by their odour, or the display of distress by offspring when abandoned. While there is also accumulating evidence that the function of the oxytocin system also influences social behaviour in humans, almost nothing is known regarding how the oxytocin system is organised in the human brain. We also know next to nothing about the possible existence of gender differences (as is the case with other species), about how this system is linked with differences in human social preferences, including decisions to trust, and about how this system can exert a dynamic influence on the processes underlying judgements of trustworthiness and decisions to trust. \n\nIn this project, we will use state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques and innovative data modelling and analysis methods to try and shed some light on these questions. We hope to generate new findings that will make a significant contribution to understanding the processes driving trust behaviour, as well as to generate new evidence about the oxytocin system in the human brain, which will be of direct interest across a range of disciplines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009400/1","grantId":"ES/K009400/1","fundValue":"254072","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Yannis  Paloyelis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":" The following text described what we have achieved in the first few months of this grant. \n\nEvidence has started to accumulate demonstrating the role of the oxytocin system in the human brain in the regulation of social behaviour and cognition and showing that the administration of exogenous oxytocin might provide a promising pharmacological agent to regulate social behaviour and target social impairment in psychiatric disorders. The effects of exogenous oxytocin are achieved by altering the function of the underlying neural circuitries. Almost all studies administer OT intranasally as it is assumed that in this way it can directly enter the brain and change brain function. However, an important obstacle in this research endeavour has been a gap in basic knowledge regarding (i) how the OT system is organised in the living, typically developing, human brain; (ii) how best to deliver OT to the brain and, importantly, (iii) the time course of the effects of intranasal OT in the human brain. \n\nSo far we have completed the necessary groundwork that will allow us to address the main objectives of this grant. Specifically, we: (a) mapped the brain areas responding to OT and we obtained a functional signature of the response to OT using pattern recognition; (b) we generated a roadmap regarding the optimal timing of experimental and clinical interventions using intranasal oxytocin. This work will provide us a much needed biomarker for the organisation of the oxytocin system in the human brain and will allow us to link individual differences in the oxytocin system with individual differences in performance. As research has shown, it is the distribution and density of oxytocin receptors in the brain (that is reflected in the functional response of one's brain to the administration of exogenous oxytocin) that underlies individual differences in social behaviour and cognition. In these initial months of the grant our work has provided a much needed roadmap to guide experimental and clinical studies applying intranasal oxytocin to influence human behaviour and treat psychiatric symptoms.
