{"id":"48012FD0-FB5E-4A6D-AB57-0E248AA3C065","title":"Integrating upstream host cell line selection and development with improved downstream bioprocessing","abstractText":"Many of the new drugs currently under development are based upon proteins rather than traditional small molecules (e.g. antibiotics). One of the type of protein molecules that is particularly challenging to make are antibodies e.g. herceptin. These protein drugs are produced for the treatment of diseases such as cancer by mammalian cells kept in culture under defined conditions. One problem with this is that the cells we use to make such proteins secrete not only the target protein into the medium in which the cells grow, but other proteins from the cell as well, called host cell proteins (HCPs). Further, cell breakage during fermentation or downstream handling (e.g. centrifugation) can result in the release of intracellular protein material. To complicate things further, what these HCPs are (the contaminants) and how they change throughout cell fermentation and with target products is not known. What this means is that the target drug must be purified from the rest of the material in the medium before it is deemed safe for use and this is referred to as downstream bioprocessing. Downstream bioprocessing is now a major part (&gt;40%) of the total cost of manufacturing such drugs and as such improvements in this area would be of major benefit to both manufacturers and the end patient. We aim to begin addressing this lack of knowledge with respect to the HCPs in the medium during the culturing of Chinese hamster ovary cells engineered to express a recombinant monoclonal antibody. Specifically, we will determine the HCP profile throughout culture and throughout a standard template purification procedure for a monoclonal antibody. We intend to use this information to then remove the most troublesome HCPs by cell engineering approaches and determine what effect this has on product yield, cell growth and subsequent purification procedures. Ultimately we envisage that this information will allow us to redesign downstream purification procedures either to remove or to integrate better current chromatographic steps which are expensive and time consuming. This information is of high industrial relevance since the production of commercially valuable proteins (e.g. antibodies) can be hindered, and the cost dramatically escalated, as a result of the multiple chromatographic steps currently required to purify the target protein to acceptable levels. A better understanding of the HCP profile and how this influences downstream processing is very important as it is expected that with an increasing number of protein 'drugs' being developed we will lack the capability of producing large enough amounts to meet the required demand at a cost which can be affordable for the majority. Hence these products remain prohibitively expensive to many, but very effective, medicines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G010307/1","grantId":"BB/G010307/1","fundValue":"320391","fundStart":"2009-03-16","fundEnd":"2012-09-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Smales has been in contact with Dr Nadine Ritter (Senior CMC Consultant, Biologics Consulting Group, USA) who has advised the FDA on host cell proteins and assays. Via this contact we have had direct input into discussion around future policy and analytical methodologies for analysing HCPs as determined and set by the FDA. We have provided information/ideas on approaches to both measure and define potential critical HCPs (those likely to be most problematic) and how in the future it may be possible to develop models that allow the prediction of HCP and general cell content (e.g. DNA/lipids etc) from specific cell lines and products. \n\nIn addition to outputs directly related to industry, at both UCL and Kent the findings from this programme of work are being fed into our teaching programmes on cell line development, chromatography and analytics for the biopharmaceutical industry.

In DSP, removal of host cell protein (HCP) is a major goal, however there have been few public reports focussed upon identifying the HCP complement from industrially relevant cells. This is surprising as the rational application/manipulation of DSP approaches would be enhanced by knowledge of the principal contaminants, whether these change/accumulate during fermentation/recovery, which HCPs specific steps remove and, if specific types of product influence the HCP profile. Such insights would aid the design of novel/improved DSP approaches and inform upstream strategies for improved DSP. Here we will test the hypothesis that identification/characterization of the major CHO HCPs will allow the design of more efficient, or alternative, purification strategies and the rational selection and/or engineering of hosts to limit HCP levels. We will characterise the links between fermentation length and HCP accumulation in null and producer cell lines. Any interactions between HCPs and the target protein and the influence this has on product yield/ease of DSP, the fate of HCPs throughout DSP, and the effect removal of specific HCPs by RNAi has on DSP will be assessed. The direct outcomes will be (1) a CHO HCP profile for a model antibody and an understanding of how this changes/accumulates during fermentation, (2) knowledge as to whether the target protein changes the HCP profile and the ease with which these contaminants are removed, (3) an understanding of the HCPs removed throughout the template DSP, (4) methods of monitoring/measuring HCPs, (5) determination of the effects of eliminating specific HCPs on cell phenotype and subsequent DSP, and (6) the design of alternative processes to remove HCPs via either up- or down-stream approaches.\n\nEssential to this project was the development of methods for the measurement of host cells proteins (HCPs) at low levels in the background of high levels of the antibody product. We successfully developed several approaches; 2D-gel, mass spectrometry and radiolabel based. These were vital to the research that followed and will be important for the future.\nApplication of these methods enabled new understanding of how the HCP profile changes with culture time and of the classes of proteins present in this culture environment. The approach was\nextended into the downstream process using ultra scale-down methods to reveal the interactions between the primary recovery operations of centrifugation and filtration. This has highlighted the difficulty in coping with process variation at this point in the sequence. Finally we studied the protein A capture chromatography showing two classes of HCP interactions; those with the resin backbone and those with the antibody product.\n\n1. We have developed new analytical methodologies to complement the gold standard ELISA assay to monitor and measure host cell proteins (HCPs) throughout culture, at harvest and during subsequent downstream processing steps. These methodologies have been developed specifically for HCP analysis and include the use of mass spectrometry only approaches (SELDI-ToF and iTRAQ), 2D-PAGE and novel radiolabelling and spiking experiments. We have also developed a list of host cell proteins and their abundance during cell line development and bioprocessing. We have defined the CHO cell HCP proteome, a first.\n\n2. We have established knockdown via RNAi of lactate dehydrogenase and BiP in particular and begun to evaluated further targets in mammalian cells. We have developed stable knockdown cell lines of several targets with stable shRNA plasmid based approaches and characterised the influence upon cell growth and recombinant protein productivity.\n\n3. We have generated a number of new vector/constructs with different elements for controlling gene expression. We have defined new methodologies for the measurement of host cell proteins during upstream and downstream manufacturing of recombinant biopharmaceuticals manufactured using Chinese hamster ovary cells cultured under defined conditions. These allow an unprecedented ability to monitor and actually define what impurities arising from the host at the protein level are in biotherapeutic preparations destined for the clinic throughout manufacturer. We expect these findings to be taken forward by industry and regulatory agencies to define new specifications and standards for the monitoring and measurement of host cell proteins in such preparations.
