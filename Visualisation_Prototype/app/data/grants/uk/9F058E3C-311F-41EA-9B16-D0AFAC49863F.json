To process this vast array of information brains have evolved specialized regions dedicated to specific types of sensory modalities. In mammals including humans we know when this information reaches the brain it is placed in context through multimodal integration within and between these different regions. The success of this kind of integration is highlighted, for example, by our ability to compute the location of an auditory or visual stimulus relative to head position. Vestibular information, the so-called sixth sense has perhaps the most dramatic and yet underappreciated influence throughout the central nervous system, contributing to functions such as vision, hearing, movement, cognition, sleep, digestion and even learning and memory. More specifically it is presumed to underlie an internal gravity model in humans as well as an intrinsic spatial coordinate system. Defects of the vestibular system result in impaired spatial perception and memory as well as failure to perceive self-motion. In fact disequilibrium affects almost half of the population by age 60 and is as prevalent as hypertension and angina. Recent clinical studies have reported that isolated cortical lesions in humans can cause recurrent episodes of vertigo and imbalance that are consistent with extracellular electrophysiological studies in primates and cats showing vestibular contributions to cortical activity. In this project we will elucidate the neural mechanisms of vestibular representation in the cerebellum- the primary structure know to be involved in maintaining balance, posture and the control of movement. We will combine cellular studies in brain slices that allow us to examine the microscopic mechanisms involved in regulating single cell excitability with a systems approach that uses natural stimulation in the intact animal. Computer simulations will allow us to explore the mechanisms of vestibular signalling on the large scale that the cerebellum is known to operate on. Findings from this provide an understanding of the neural basis of balance and movement and shed light on the underlying causes of disequilibrium and vertigo.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F005490/1","grantId":"BB/F005490/1","fundValue":"651884","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The aim of this award was to increase our understanding of how synapses, neurons and networks represent and process information. The main outcomes are therefore scientific discoveries that extend our knowledges of brain function. Although, at present, they do not have direct application outside neuroscience research they revealed several fundamental properties that are likely to be important for understanding network dysfunction during neurological disorders and disease states. Also, by improving standardization and the tools for modelling brain function this work is also contributing to future research in this area.

We studied how sensory information about head position and movement is processed, allowing us to maintain posture and balance. To do this we combined experiments with sophisticated computer models of networks of neurons. The scientific discoveries in this project have lead to a better understanding of how the brain represents sensory information, and how networks of neurons coordinate their electrical activity. Understanding how information about the body and the surrounding world is represented in electrical signals flowing through complex networks of neurons in the brain, is one of the most exciting and challenging problems in science. This project provided a number of fundamental new insights into information processing in the brain. This knowledge provides a foundation of basic knowledge and concepts with which to understand what goes wrong during neurological disorders.
