The predictions of models using this assumption are at odds with empirical observations. Reservation wages of unemployed workers decline in the duration of the unemployment spell; prices of houses fall with time on the market; research projects are sometimes started and later abandoned. </p>\n\n<p>This project develops a simple model of optimal stopping where the economic environment changes as a result of learning. From a methodological point of view, the main contribution will be the development of a framework that captures essential features of the learning problem and yet is analytically tractable. </p>\n\n<p>The model will be general enough to accommodate a number of applications as special cases; but also simple enough to yield qualitative comparative statics results that shed light on the key economic forces that result from the dynamic linkage between decision periods. </p>\n\n<p>This will provide analytical foundations for the empirical study of eg unemployment duration, or the timing of property sales; and the dynamics of reservation wages or property prices.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0925-A","grantId":"RES-062-23-0925-A","fundValue":"16909","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin Anthony Mason","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
