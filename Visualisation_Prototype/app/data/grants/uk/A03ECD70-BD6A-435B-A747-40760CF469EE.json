These phenomena (temperature, mass transport) can be directly measured and quantified in electrochemical experiments employing nanoelectrodes. At very small electrodes turbulence can be suppressed and unusually fast convective flow can be achieved (driven by microwave induced thermal gradients) giving high currents and beneficial effects e.g. kinetic resolution in analytical applications (sulphide, thiol, arsenite, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.). More importantly, the adsorption of microwaves into the double layer of interfaces with sufficiently fast RC time constant (e.g. at nanoelectrodes) has never been reported and may again lead to novel chemical phenomena (e.g. for processes involving H2, CO2, or CO adsorbates on Pt, Pd, or Au). These kinds of processes (which occur only at nanoelectrodes or nanoparticles) could be important for sensor and fuel cell processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F025505/1","grantId":"EP/F025505/1","fundValue":"88956","fundStart":"2008-07-16","fundEnd":"2012-01-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Papers resultant from this grant have produced significant follow up research.

This allowed us to observed discharge effects for the first time. A new model of the processes under high intensity microwaves in liquid electrolyte has been proposed.\n\no The observation and enhancement of superheating effects are electrode surfaces under microwave conditions. This work allowed us to operate under extremely high temperatures without applying external pressure. The research has realised (a) new analytical procedures and (b) fundamental insights into heated electrodes and processes occurring on them. The former will be exploited by analytical chemists and the latter both by fundamental electrochmists and electroanalysts.
