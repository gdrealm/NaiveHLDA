The monument is an enduring testament of past values of heroism, but more ephemeral practices of pilgrimage, public display and socialising also suggest changing valuation processes at the site. Culture here is an interaction of traditions, symbols, experiences, emotion, and memories as expressed by descendants, local residents, ethnic organisations, officials, and individuals performing a variety of identity roles. This &quot;thick&quot; site, enlivened by ritual and affective experiences, presents a confluence of factors for analysis: what values are remembered and displayed, but also reshaped and remixed, in material and immaterial forms. \n\nThe project will:\n- document the many facets of cultural production and consumption at work within memorialisation here, on several temporal and social scales, using historical methods and ethnographic techniques that engage participants\n- analyse material and immaterial forms and practices using objective/subjective insights offered by Critical Discourse Analysis\n- theorise the changing nature of 'value' implied in themes that emerge within a matrix of historical, positional, textual, processual and pedagogical factors","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L005859/1","grantId":"AH/L005859/1","fundValue":"23661","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-10","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  There has been no obvious 'use' at present.

The research foregrounded the symbolic and spiritual realm of culture, and how a self-reflective form of public communicative action is embodied through memorialisation at this site. The activities at the Chattri clearly fall within the 'Reflective Individuals and Engaged Citizens' dimension of the Cultural Value project.\n\nThe nature of Chattri's valuation changed over the years as the memorial moved from political war monument to sacred centre for the Indian community. These differences highlight how memorialising serves political and social values, but also how people derive wellbeing from experiences in the spiritual realm. Three cultural values emerged as important in this study, all emphasising cultural experiences as processes of meaning-making: 'An Embodied Presence', 'A Mutual Recognition' and 'A Higher Good'.\n\n'A Higher Good' places value on the intangible realm of morality and spirituality. This valuation is about Goodness not Utility. Moral and spiritual activities hold intrinsic value for some people: the Sikh concept of 'sewa', a physical, embodied act of selflessness resulting in a gain for others, has a higher order of cultural value. The value 'A Higher Good' depends on the infinite connectedness of all things to all other things.\n\n'An Embodied Presence' accentuates the human need for material, embodied encounters with place and with others through cultural activities. 'Presence' requires active not passive exchanges, solidarity, a sense of occasion and purposeful meaning-making. \n\n'A Mutual Recognition' reflects the value of witnessing and recognising the Other as different but equal. It rejects tendencies to equate 'cultural values' with 'white values'. Cultural experiences that value mutual recognition can lead to cross-cultural negotiation, difference, hybridity and/or transformation. The findings could be taken forward in two major areas, research and policy. Both areas are linked to the three Cultural Value themes delineated in question 1. Thus, both further research to understand, but also new policy/funding strategies that further these 'values' of cultural activity would be important and useful.
