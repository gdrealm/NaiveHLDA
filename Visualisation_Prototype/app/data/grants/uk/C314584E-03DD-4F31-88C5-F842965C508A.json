The molecular envelope technology (MET) delivery platform allows their use as nano-enabled 'Peptide Pills'. The multi-disciplinary 'Peptide Pill' consortium, comprising drug delivery scientists, neuroscientists, physicists, chemical engineers and clinicians, will develop the pain peptide pill METDoloron. It is estimated that 20% of European adults suffer from chronic pain, which is often inadequately controlled by opioids. Additionally opioids can sometimes cause life threatening side effects. METDoloron avoids these problems by targeting a different receptor to currently used opioids, using an endogenous peptide derivative\nand is therefore expected to have a significant impact on the large (US$ 50 billion), fragmented, and growing global market for pain therapeutics. The project partners will confirm METDoloron pharmacology, investigate nanoparticle transport mechanisms, establish scale-up and manufacturing processes, and confirm product (GLP) safety thus creating know-how in biophotonics, pain therapy, flow reactor design and nanoparticle processing techniques. First in man clinical trials will commence on conclusion of this project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K502340/1","grantId":"EP/K502340/1","fundValue":"586898","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ijeoma  Uchegbu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Pharmacy","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
