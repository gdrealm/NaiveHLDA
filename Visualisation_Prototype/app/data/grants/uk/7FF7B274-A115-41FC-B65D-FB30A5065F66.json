{"id":"7FF7B274-A115-41FC-B65D-FB30A5065F66","title":"Designing High-Quality Research for Maximum Impact: The University of Liverpool and National Museums Liverpool","abstractText":"This series of workshops will bring together arts and humanities researchers from the University of Liverpool (UoL) with curators, educators and managers from National Museums Liverpool (NML). Our main aim is to have a dialogue and develop a partnership between the university and the museums on how best to design high quality research for maximum impact among the wider community.\\n\\nMerseyside has a higher concentration of museums than any other region in the UK ouside London. At NML, some 100 curatorial staff care for outstanding collections and galleries of international, national and local importance. These range from fine art and ethnographic galleries and a maritime museum to a new National Slavery Museum to be opened in 2007.\\n\\nFor many years, individual curators and university scholars from, among others, the departments of History, Archaeology, Modern Languages, Music, and Architecture, have been collaborating on a range of exhibitions and publications. Now - with Liverpool's Heritage Year (marking the 800th anniversary of its charter) and the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade in 2007, and with the city becoming European Capital of Culture in 2008 - is the time for our two organisations to put our collaboration on a more systematic and strategic footing. Our local focus makes this collaboration practically manageable. At the same time, the wide range and high quality of participating local institutions and individuals, the multiple collaborations existing already at a peer-to-peer level, and teh advice of nationally and internationally leading experts from museums and universtities, will allow us to develop a more general model for collaborative practice. Operating from a local base, we thus seek to have a genuine (inter)national impact.\\n\\nBy sharing the complementary expertise and experience of staff involved in different projects we will develop best practice in how to design research for maximum impact through museums. We will hold six thematic workshops to discuss key aspects involved in research collaboration between universities and museums. The workshops will consider the nature, objectives and audiences of research in both universities and museums. How to ensure the widest possible dissemination of high quality research to the community? What should be the interaction between museum curators, local communities and university researchers? And how best jointly to attract external funding for collaborative museum-related research.\\n\\nAt each workshop, all participants will first discuss such key issues in a general way. Specialised sessions designed around three thematic clusters which we have identified will then allow us to test some of the implications of the general discussion for specific projects. The thematic areas are: 1. Black History and Culture, including slavery. 2. The History of Collections and Collecting. 3 Liverpool History and Culture. \\nFinally, the break out sessions will report their results back to the plenum.\\n\\nThe workshops will serve a number of more specific purposes. They will act as a catalyst of already widespread commitment across Arts and Humanities at UoL to collaborate with museums across NML. They will allow staff who are already collaborating to reflect on their practice and identify further areas for joint research, and staff new to such an approach to identify projects for immediate, medium and long-term collaboration. The workshops will enable NML to engage with university-based researchers both in UoL and beyond. NML and UoL will be able to develop more formal collaborative approaches to bid for external funding for research, publications, and exhibitions. Finally, as a result of the workshops we hope to create sustainable networks of researchers in both institutions, and a forum for future university-museum collaboration.
