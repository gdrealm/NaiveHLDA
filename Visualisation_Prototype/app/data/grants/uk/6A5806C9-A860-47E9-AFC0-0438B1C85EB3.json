Because of computer run time constraints, RANS approaches will remain the principal method for representing the effects of turbulence for engineering application for the foreseeable future. However, the turbulence models embodied within such approaches are still dependent on the flow configuration being examined, requiring the use of experimental data in their specification, and case-by-case adjustment to accurately predict particular types of flow. Turbulent shear flows with free boundaries display an intermittent character, such that the fluctuations of velocity rapidly change from rotational to irrotational, and vice versa. Intermittency is important in many practical flows, for example, in boundary layer transition which remains a major challenge because of its relevance to the design of modern compressors and turbines, and airfoils. Intermittency is also important in the safe and efficient operation of many combustion devices, which are dependent on ignition occurring in flows with significant intermittency, as well as in hazard and risk assessments concerning the potential ignition of flammable releases on chemical and process plant. In all these applications, the enhanced performance of these devices, and improved safety, relies on a detailed understanding of turbulent flow and ignition processes, and hence intermittency. The majority of engineering turbulence models in use today were derived for fully developed flows, and hence cannot be expected to accurately predict free shear flows where the outer regions are contaminated with irrotational flow. The development of turbulence models that accommodate intermittency effects is therefore also of fundamental importance. Additionally, the inclusion of such effects helps to generalize existing turbulence models, and provide more accurate predictions of the velocity and scalar fields of interest to the applications noted above. The necessity for such work has also been identified by both the EROFTAC Special Interest Group on Transition Modelling, and the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences Programme on Turbulence, particularly in relation to the need for greater universality in engineering models of turbulence, and the improved modelling of the influence of intermittency, particularly on scalar fields. This proposal concerns the use of an hierarchical approach to the development of more accurate engineering models of intermittent turbulent flows through the co-ordinated application of direct numerical simulation and large eddy simulation to inform the formulation and validation of second-moment turbulence closures that are more fundamentally based that existing approaches. The work proposed will also improve our overall understanding of such flows, the universality of engineering models of turbulence, and will validate the models developed for application to a wide range of practical flows.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E03005X/1","grantId":"EP/E03005X/1","fundValue":"275650","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A previous EPSRC grant GR/S29942/01 developed a novel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method for solving the transported probability density function equation used in modelling turbulent flows. Unlike alternative approaches, it is compatible with conventional/commercial computational fluid dynamic software and provides an alternative with improved accuracy and computer run time. Although originally at the proof-of-concept stage, the present collaborative grant (EP/E03005X/1) further developed a novel physical and compositional AMR approach which was used as the basis of work on the EC FP7 CCS projects CO2PipeHaz (www.co2pipehaz.eu) and CO2QUEST (www.co2quest.eu), and the National Grid CCS project COOLTRANS. The techniques developed on these grants are now being used in support of consequence and risk assessments for the deployment of CCS transportation pipelines.

Significant differences were observed between predictions of the two techniques, indicating a requirement for improved sub-grid scale modelling for use with LES and, potentially, separate intermittency scaling allowance for the scalar and velocity fields. At high Reynolds number, LES of round jets showed good agreement with experimental data, with predicted intermittencies in close accord. Nevertheless, improvements are warranted, and the use of improved sub-grid scale modelling could again be beneficial. A finite-volume method coupled to a novel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) numerical solution technique was also used (Leeds) as the basis of a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model of intermittent flows, based on solutions of the transported probability density function equation for scalar variables obtained using AMR applied in both physical and compositional space. Comparisons with data and LES for high Reynolds number round jet flows demonstrated good agreement, with the inclusion of intermittency effects improving the accuracy of predictions obtained over standard turbulence modelling approaches, thereby broadening the applicability and improving the generality of these models. Overall, the project delivered an improved understanding of intermittency in turbulent flows, and more accurate, validated engineering models of such flows for use in practical application. The understanding and techniques developed are of strategic value to others working in the UK academic sector in the fields of chemical, mechanical and process engineering, and combustion equipment, turbo-machinery, gas turbine and aircraft design, and at a more generic level to those concerned with turbulence and turbulent reacting flow modelling for a wide range of applications.
