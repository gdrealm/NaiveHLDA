Now, the audacious goal of contemporary cell biology is to understand how the billion proteins in an average cell allow them to move, multiply, create a brain or defend us against viruses and bacteria. Imaging where and when proteins interact with each other has a major role to play at this frontier. Recent imaging of just a few types of proteins has already led to important new concepts in how immune cells communicate with each other and how they recognize signs of disease. Images of immune cells contacting other cells have revealed temporary membrane structures, often called immune synapses, similar to the synapses that nerve cells make with one another for communication. It has been postulated that one function for such an immune synapse is to assemble a 'gasket' that to some extent isolates the synaptic cleft from the bulk extracellular environment. However, the precise extent as to which the synapse acts as a gasket has not been studied. This fundamental knowledge can have a major importance for the design of novel drugs, because understanding to what extent and how the immune synapse is shielded from the bulk extracellular environment could, in the longer term, facilitate the rational design of drugs that penetrate the immune synapse to work more effectively, e.g. for blocking proteins secreted across the synapse. It may also be useful to note that to realize the proposed experiments we will exploit new imaging technologies which will be of broad interest across several biological research fields. Patents may be sought upon development of specific applications. In addition to the specific hypotheses to be studied here, the application of high-resolution microscopy to study immune cell interactions is also to some extent explorative and hypothesis-forming; this is still a very young field and more surprises are surely in store.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I013407/1","grantId":"BB/I013407/1","fundValue":"363095","fundStart":"2012-04-16","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings are used in two ways.

Their research has been published in Nature Communications.\n\nProfessor Davis says: &quot;We study the immune system and then stumbled across something that may explain why some drugs don't work as well as hoped. We found that immune cells secrete molecules to other cells across a very small gap. This happens when immune cells talk to each other and also, when they kill diseased cells. But crucially, some types of drugs aren't able to penetrate the gap between the cells. So they can't easily reach targets within the gap, to work effectively.&quot;\n\nThe researchers took molecules of different sizes and colours and used microscopic imaging to see which size of molecule could get into the gap between an immune cell and another cell. They found that only the smaller molecules could penetrate the gap.\n\nThey even found that when an immune cell attaches to another cell it clears out all but the smallest molecules between them.\n\nProfessor Davis explains the significance of their findings: &quot;Our research demonstrates that any drugs targeting immune cells need to be very small. Antibody proteins, for example, are too big and aren't able to get into the gap between the cells - they're even cleared away when cells meet. To make them more effective they must be smaller - something that GlaxoSmithKline is working on.&quot; \n\nThis research leads to new ideas for making drugs that, for example switch off immune activity in auto-immune diseases like diabetes or increasing immune reactivity to cancer. &quot;A lot of important things that drugs could target are in the very small gap between cells. This research demonstrates why we need drug molecules to be especially small to work effectively. \n\nPhD student Adam Cartwright played a key role in the research, spending time at GlaxoSmithKline as well as in Davis's lab at the University of Manchester.\n\nHe says: &quot;Being able to test out our theory with drugs that GSK has designed was fantastic. The idea that something I had found out can be used to develop treatments to help patients is incredibly exciting.&quot; \n\nProfessor Davis, author of the popular Penguin paperback The Compatibility Gene, concludes: &quot;The practical application of this basic research comes from bouncing around our ideas with scientists working on drug design. The interaction between academia and pharma is hugely beneficial and we hope it will lead to more effective drug treatments.&quot; GSK use these findings in drug design Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
