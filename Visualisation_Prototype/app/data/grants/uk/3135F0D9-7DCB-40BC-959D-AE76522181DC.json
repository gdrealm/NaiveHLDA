{"id":"3135F0D9-7DCB-40BC-959D-AE76522181DC","title":"Formal Representation and Proof for Cooperative Games: A Foundation for Complex Social Behaviour","abstractText":"This research applies methods and tools from mathematical knowledge\nmanagement and theorem proving to theoretical economics, by working\nwith a class of cooperative games called pillage games. Pillage\ngames, introduced by Jordan in 2006, provide a formal way of\nthinking about the ability of powerful coalitions to take resources\nfrom less powerful ones. While their name suggests primitive,\nviolent interactions, pillage games are more applicable to advanced\ndemocracies, in which coalitions seek to form governments to alter\nthe distribution of society's resources in their favour. If, for\nsome allocation of society's resources, the coalition preferring\nanother allocation is stronger than that preferring the status quo,\nthe other allocation `dominates' the status quo.\n\nThe most conceptually intriguing, and the most computationally\nintractable solution concept for cooperative games is the `stable\nset'. A stable set, has two features: no allocation in the set\ndominates another; each allocation outside the set is dominated by an\nallocation in the set. For pillage games with three agents under a few\nadditional conditions, we have determined when stable sets exist, that\nthey are unique and contain no more than 15 allocations, and how to\ndetermine them for a given power function.\n\nIn this research, we first formally represent the mathematical\nknowledge developed in Jordan's and our work using sTeX, a\nmathematical knowledge management tool. This allows, e.g., automatic\nidentification of how various results depend on each other.\n\nWe then use two modern automated theorem provers (ATPs), Isabelle and\nTheorema, to formally prove these results. Theorem proving is a hard\ntask and if not provided with domain specific knowledge ATPs have to\nsearch through big search spaces in order to find proofs. To increase\ntheir reasoning power, we shall seek to identify recurring patterns in\nproofs, and extract proof tactics, reducing the interactions necessary\nto prove the theorems interactively. As important results in pillage\ngames can be summarised in pseudo-algorithms, containing both\ncomputational and non-computational steps, we shall study such\npseudo-algorithms, seeking to push them towards the much more\nefficient computational steps. Finally, we shall use the identified\nproof tactics to help the ATPs prove new results in order evaluate\ntheir true value.\n\nThe research seeks to make a number of contributions. For theorem\nproving, pillage games form a new set of challenge problems. As the\nstudy of pillage games is new, and the canon of applicable knowledge\nsmall, this gives an unprecedented opportunity to encode most of\nit. The research will expand the tractable problem domain for ATPs;\nand - by identifying successful tactics - increase both the efficiency\nwith which ATPs search for proofs, and - ideally - their ability to\nestablish new results.\n\nFor economics, this is the first major application of formal knowledge\nmanagement and theorem proving techniques. The few previous\napplications of ATP to economics have formalised isolated results\nwithout engaging economists and have thus largely gone unnoticed by\nthe discipline. As cooperative games are a known hard class of\neconomic problems, and pillage games known to be tractable, this\nresearch therefore presents a strong `proof of concept' for the use of\nATP within economics. Cooperative game theory is formally similar\nto graph theory, the techniques and insights developed may be\napplicable to matching problems, network economics, operations\nresearch, and combinatorial optimisation more generally.\nAdditionally, the researchers will introduce ATP techniques to the\nleading PhD summer school in computational economics, and are working\nin collaboration with economic theorists with strong computational\nbackgrounds. Thus, the research seeks to form a focal point for formal\nknowledge management and theorem proving efforts in economics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J007498/1","grantId":"EP/J007498/1","fundValue":"389557","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have actively approached economists and have found interest there, but up to now the results have not been used (to our knowledge).

We have applied the method in the area of auction design. The approach consists of formalising an auction in the formal language of the Isabelle theorem prover, proving its properties within the system and using the code extraction mechanism to generate the code automatically. Up to now the approach has been used to give a proof of principle. The next step will be to apply it to one (or some) of the most recently developed auction schemas.
