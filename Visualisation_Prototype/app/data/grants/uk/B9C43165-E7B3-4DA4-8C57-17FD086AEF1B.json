{"id":"B9C43165-E7B3-4DA4-8C57-17FD086AEF1B","title":"Sudden Death Brain and Tissue Bank","abstractText":"Brain banking has a long tradition of supporting research by providing human tissue samples for investigation of human brain disorders. Recent organ retention crises and the resulting public disquiet have accelerated the generally declining autopsy rate of consented post mortem examinations. This poses a threat to post mortem tissue collections and consequently for future research. Acquisition of control cases in different age groups and with no significant CNS pathology has been particularly difficult. This application proposes to respond to the present situation by seeking familiesâ€™ authorisation for research use of brains examined in the setting of the forensic post mortem service. The purpose of this proposal is to collect not only control cases but also CNS disorders mainly encountered in the forensic setting by virtue of sudden death, eg head injury, drug overdose, suicide. This will fulfill a need for the general research community by providing control cases for whom review of the clinical history and examination of the brain exclude the presence of any CNS disorder. This application sets out a two year feasibility project to study the logistics and acceptability of establishing this service in Edinburgh. The applicants trust that this proposal would help to redress the difficulties encountered in recent years by many brain banks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600969","grantId":"G0600969","fundValue":"619425","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Smith","coPersons":["David  Harrison","James Wilson Ironside","Jeanne  Bell","Juan-Carlos  Arango"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
