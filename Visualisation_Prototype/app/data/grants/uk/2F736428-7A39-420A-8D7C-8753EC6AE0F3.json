The key challenges addressed in this project cover the fields of material science and manufacturing. \n\nThe material science challenges include (1) the vast range of materials which can be processed using this method where each material requires different treatment techniques or operational parameters, (2) the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the photosynthesis within the light harvesting complexes, (3) the determination of the optimal material formulation for this reduction processes and (4) the understanding of the interdependent factors (wavelength, intensity, etc) acting in this multi-dimensional design space to target the for optimum metallisation process. \n\nThe manufacturing challenges cover (1) the interplay between processes and manufacturing techniques (and equipment) to deliver these processes (2) the novel spray coating process using aerosol jetting and (3) the industrial need for high speed, high resolution and low cost photo-patterning techniques. Particular high impact applications of prosthetics and encoders will be used to demonstrate the manufacturing capabilities developed during this research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N018222/1","grantId":"EP/N018222/1","fundValue":"351844","fundStart":"2015-11-01","fundEnd":"2018-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Marc  Desmulliez","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
