{"id":"62038CE2-21F6-4AB8-A2C6-E4669B31DACC","title":"Low Cost Arsenite Sensors","abstractText":"Arsenic contamination of drinking water is a global problem, affecting 14% of the world's population (WHO Figures) particularly in resource poor regions where access to adequate testing facilities is either limited or non-existent. A simple to use low cost method to measure arsenic at WHO levels would allow contaminated sources to be identified and avoided. Moreover as the arsenic levels are changing dynamically the regular retesting of sources such as tube wells would allow previously identified wells to be bought back into use if levels had fallen sufficiently. Using a disposable strip that plugs into a simple battery powered meter provides a robust route to such decentralised testing. In addition to refining the technical aspects of this device we will also be engaging with potential stakeholders to ensure effective distribution through a variety of channels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021431/1","grantId":"BB/J021431/1","fundValue":"147121","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Edward Cass","coPersons":["Joanne  Santini"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
