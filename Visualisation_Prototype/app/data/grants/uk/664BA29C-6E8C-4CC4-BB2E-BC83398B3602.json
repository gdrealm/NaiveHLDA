{"id":"664BA29C-6E8C-4CC4-BB2E-BC83398B3602","title":"Clerical Celibacy in the West, 1100-1700","abstractText":"My book presents an analysis of historical debates over clerical marriage and celibacy, focusing on the moments in the history of the church that were most crucial in the development of theology and practice of celibacy.The primary chronological focus of this project is the period c.1100-1700, but the discussion of medieval and early modern attitudes to clerical celibacy will be greatly facilitated by an understanding of clerical celibacy and marriage in the early church. \\nOne of the clearest demonstrations of the influence of past debates and controversies in the present day is the ongoing and vigorous discussions over the place of a celibate priesthood in the church.This debate, which had its origins as early as the fourth century, has profound implications for the modern church; decisions taken in Catholic Christendom in the period c.1100-1700 are of crucial importance to our understanding of this issue.A preoccupation with celibacy in the church today has perhaps worked to the detriment of a historical understanding of the subject, with little effort being made to set modern debates against the backdrop of the crucial debates and deliberations of the church through the centuries.My study will make significant strides towards filling this lacuna in knowledge and understanding of the history of the celibate priesthood, and make an important contribution to an ongoing and vital debate. \\nThe precedents provided by the early church were hotly contested in later debates, particularly during the Reformation when the ecclesiastical past became a vital part of the ammunition of Catholic and evangelical polemicists.A careful overview of the most important developments of the patristic period will provide a useful foundation for later analysis.However the bulk of the volume will be devoted to an analysis of debates over clerical celibacy and marriage in the period c.1100-1700.The eleventh century reform movement included among its objectives the creation of a celibate priesthood.The centrality of this period to later debates warrants a careful consideration of the issues and personalities here, but recent research has reinforced the belief that this was, in its own right, a crucial period in the history of the priesthood, not just the papacy.With the split between the priesthood and monastic movement, the legacy of the early church was ambivalent.Monastic chastity was highly prized, but ecclesiastical reformers frequently encountered openly married priests. Both critics and defenders of clerical marriage attempted to claim support from the example of the early church; debate was vigorous and its outcome contested.\\nThe era of the Reformation saw this debate reach a much broader audience; for many of the laity the marriage of their priest would have been one of the most visible aspects of the Protestant reformation, giving the issue prominence at all levels of the church.The printing press facilitated the rapid and immediate dissemination of evangelical literature, and helped to provide a link between the ideological controversies and the practical experience of clerical celibacy and marriage in the parishes.I will examine the evangelical challenge to the disciplines and traditions of the Catholic church, both in the open practice of clerical marriage in the reformed churches, and in the vigorous polemical debate that was spawned by the question of clerical celibacy, and perceptions of contemporary clerical morality.This will be accompanied by a discussion of the Catholic response to this challenge to ecclesiastical discipline, and an analysis of the influence of precedents from the history of the Greek and Latin churches on the debates of the Reformation period. Finally, I will offer some concluding comments on the legacy left to the western church by the upheavals of the period 1100-1700, and the intellectual, pastoral, political, and moral pressures that have shaped debates over celibacy throughout the history of the church.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F003102/1","grantId":"AH/F003102/1","fundValue":"20455","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Parish","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
