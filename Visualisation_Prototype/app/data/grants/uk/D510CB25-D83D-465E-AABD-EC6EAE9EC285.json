{"id":"D510CB25-D83D-465E-AABD-EC6EAE9EC285","title":"Visible and Invisible Genders: Photography and the Self-Visualisation of Transsexual People","abstractText":"'Visible and Invisible Genders' is a photography research project carried out in collaboration with transsexual people. While the widely held view is that there are two sexes and two genders, the research participants self-identify through a range of gender descriptions that extend the boundaries of the female/male binary categories. \\n\\nDespite the increasing public face of transsexuality generated by the media, the lived experiences of individuals' identifying beyond the sex and gender dichotomies are almost invisible in the social domain, the general view being that transsexual people continually shift from one socially-sanctioned gender to the other. Furthermore, everyday life re-enforces the binary sex/gender model recognised in Western society, thus few images explore beyond these polarised categories. Consequently the visual articulation of these categories defines and perpetuates this binary model, controlling and reproducing gender 'norms' to the exclusion of non-binary definitions. \\n\\nIn light of these concerns, my research explores the notions of transsexual visibility and invisibility. It analyses the differences between the participants' private and public gender manifestations and it investigates the capacity for photographs of transsexual people, undertaken in the social domain, to reveal the visual practices of gender and gender performativity in everyday life. \\n\\nThe photography takes a phenomenological approach, following the work of anthropologist Michael Jackson, who applies Maurice Merleau-Ponty's concept of 'being-in-the-world'. Nonetheless, Jacques Lacan and Judith Butler's perspectives provide insights into the process of perception and embodiment in relation to gender and self-visualisation. Judith Halberstam's concept of flexible gender boundaries is also important here. In different ways, these perspectives foreground the mediation process that takes place between inner and outer worlds in self-visualisation. \\n\\nFollowing this, my enquiry provides new insights into the experiences of transsexual people, specifically with regard to the relationship between gender and self-visualisation, in the broader context of everyday life. \\n\\nOutputs will make the findings accessible to an international audience. The research will be exhibited in 'Art as Somatechnic' Sydney, 2009 and 'Beyond Woman and Man' at the Bibliotheque Nationale de France, Paris, 2009. Textual analysis of the research will form the basis for conference papers to be given at the 'Fifth International Somatechnics Conference', Macquarie University, Sydney, 2009 and 'Conference on Transgender', Sorbonne Nouvelle University, Paris, 2009. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G016429/1","grantId":"AH/G016429/1","fundValue":"8438","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  My research findings have had a very positive impact on the communities within which the research was carried out - UK transgender and gender-variant communities. This is important because although media interest in transgender and gender-variant lives has increased over the past ten years and as a consequence of this there has been an increase in the knowledge that transgender and gender variant people exist. However, the media tends to portray a very narrow view of what it means to be transgender or gender-variant. This results in widely held misconceptions about transgender and gender-variant lives and experiences. These communities continue to be under-represented, marginalized communities and large numbers of transgender and gender-variant people continue to find the negotiation of everyday life highly problematic.\n\nThe response to research outputs from transgender and gender-variant communities was extremely positive. The most common response to the research was that it allowed for self-representation and identification in a way that was rarely encountered. The collaborative photography and interview method that I developed during the course of my research, which extends photo-elicitation methods, allows participants to present their accounts on their own terms and a strong personal 'voice' becomes a part of the work. This approach has since been taken up by UK transgender and gender-variant community members and is now being taken forward in community-based projects. In this way, the research is continuing to enhance quality of life and creative output.

Specifically, building upon the work of Judith Butler and Michel Foucault, Queer Theory has developed as a collection of foci on the relations between sex, gender and desire in relation to stereotypical heterosexual norms. In some academic arenas, Queer Theory's popularity appears to have led to an assumption that these advancements have influenced mainstream beliefs to such an extent that atypical genders, including transgender and gender-variant, are now widely accepted.\n\nHowever, my research provides substantial evidence that contravenes this supposition. My research demonstrates that the negotiation of everyday life for transgender and gender-variant people continues to be highly problematic. Despite the use of hormone treatment and surgery, some transgender and gender-variant people are unable to hide their gendered history. My research involves taking photographs with participants in public spaces. Detailed research was carried out with a group of eight participants.The photographs taken with participants who are recognizable as transgender or gender-variant demonstrate that they are unable to move through public spaces without being persistently and overtly stared at. Further, one instance that was highly confrontational was recorded. Additionally, participants' accounts highlight the fact that interacting in the public domain when one does not conform to the expected appearances for the binary genders may result in verbal abuse or physical violence. Six out of eight transgender and gender-variant participants recorded experiencing verbal or physical abuse in public spaces.\n\nNevertheless, four of the participants, while self-identifying as being atypically gendered, are now consistently perceived by others in the public domain to be either a biological female or male in accordance with the predominance of stereotypical femininity or masculinity in their appearance. This enables the person to adopt a corresponding gender role, thus allowing relative ease of interaction in public spaces. Nonetheless, participants' accounts reveal that being perceived by others to be a gender that is not in accord with how one 'sees' oneself can result in the feeling that the person is not 'seen'. In other words, the person becomes invisible. \n\nTo the best of my knowledge, these issues have not been examined in this particular way before. While providing evidence pertaining to the impact of transgender and gender-variant peoples' interactions in the public domain, the visual methods that underpin this inquiry also reflect the centrality of the visual realm in the discursive formation of gender identities and the negotiation of everyday life. Through research outputs my research has come to the attention of peers and leaders in the fields of gender studies, cultural studies, transgender studies, history and the broader social sciences. It is perhaps a measure of the significance of this research that, not only have the outputs generated considerable interest, but I have been invited to collaborate with international leaders in the field including Prof. (Judith) Jack Halberstam, Assoc. Prof. Nikki Sullivan, Prof. Elspeth Brown and Prof. Chantal Zabus. \n\nThese collaborations will take forward my research findings and applications of my research methods in new contexts and to new international audiences.\n\nThe collaborative photography and interview methods that I developed during the course of the Fellowship, which extend photo-elicitation methods, allows participants to present their accounts on their own terms and a strong personal 'voice' to become a part of the work. This approach has since been taken up by UK transgender and gender-variant community members and is now being taken forward in community-based projects.
