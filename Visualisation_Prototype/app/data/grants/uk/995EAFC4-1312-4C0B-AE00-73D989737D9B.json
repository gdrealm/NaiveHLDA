The project entails six UK academics with long standing interest in logistics and manufacturing supply chains to visit leading Chinese institutions at the fore-front of research in China. The UK academics are from the Universities of Liverpool, Cardiff, Huddersfield, Hull, Leeds Met, Loughborough, and Staffordshire, Nottingham whilst the Chinese academics are from Tsinghua University, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiaotong University. The China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing will also be host to the UK delegation. It is planned to explore areas for potential collaboration with Chinese counterparts while in China and also to give seminars to audiences in there and hold workshops in Beijing and Shanghai. On return to the UK, the outcomes of the visit will be publicised via the EPSRC website, Programme newsletter Connect ; and seminars will be held under the auspices of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport - Dr Yusuf and Prof Pawar are members of the Institute - and summary of the seminar will be published in the Institute's trade magazine, Logistics &amp; Transport focus .
