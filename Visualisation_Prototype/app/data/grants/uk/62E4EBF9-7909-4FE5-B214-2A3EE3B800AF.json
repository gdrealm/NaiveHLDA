This research aims to -</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Document the extent of such salary discrepancies; </li> \n <li>Explore their consequences for work performance, and </li> \n <li>Determine the potential for salary alignment and harmonisation to boost cooperative work performance, build capacity and more effectively address poverty reduction challenges. </li>\n</ul> \n<p>The research spans low-income, aid-dependent states that are landlocked (Malawi, Zambia), Island economies (Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea), and also transition economies (China, India). Cross-country comparisons will help to gauge the robustness of our findings.&nbsp;A combination of quantitative (survey) and qualitative (critical incident) techniques focuses on how to enhance organizational justice and boost work performance.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>Because injustice is a motivation for much aid itself, perceptions of unfairness in aid work may have an inherent salience and undermine its necessary constituents, especially cooperation and capacity building. It is therefore important to identify under what conditions, precisely, salary discrepancies are counter-productive versus productive. The projectâ€™s ethos is multidisciplinary and inter-disciplinary, working through in-country teams to foster mutual organizational learning and mutual research capacity development.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E013651/1","grantId":"ES/E013651/1","fundValue":"257903","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart Colin Carr","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Massey University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
