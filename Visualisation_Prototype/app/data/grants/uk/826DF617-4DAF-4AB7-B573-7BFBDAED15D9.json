{"id":"826DF617-4DAF-4AB7-B573-7BFBDAED15D9","title":"Extending The Value of Nematode Genomic Data with WormBase","abstractText":"Many developments in modern medicine are based on the enormous progress made over the last 50 years in our understanding of how our genes work. For example, drugs interact with genes to change how biological systems function. Much of the research that has led to this progress is hard or impossible to do in humans. Because all animals share evolutionary origins, study of simple animals helps to understand human biology. Certain key model organisms have been the focus of intensive study, and some of the most important progress has been made with extremely simple animals. One of these is the tiny roundworm, or nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans research has been strategically supported by the MRC for over 40 years, leading to two Nobel prizes in the last five years, and is a key contributor to our understanding of basic processes such as cell death and aging.\n\nGenetic research has been revolutionized in the last few years by obtaining the complete DNA sequence (the genome) of the organism being studied, which contains all the gene sequences. C. elegans was the first animal to have its genome sequenced. To use genome sequences and all the new information about genes requires information resources that tie together DNA information with experimental data, and relate corresponding genes across animals. This application will enable continued support and development of WormBase, the reference information resource for all genomic and biological data for C. elegans. Wormbase is essential for research using C. elegans, and for relating the results of that research to human biology and medicine.\n\nIn addition to its relevance for understanding animal biology, research on C. elegans is particularly important to our understanding of the biology of other nematodes. There are many human nematode parasites, such as those causing river blindness in Africa, which cause an enormous disease burden in the developing world. Major programmes are now collecting genome sequences for these organisms, to enable modern genomic biology to address these diseases. The proposed research also supports the application of the information, experience and technology developed for C. elegans to ensure the most effective exploitation of the new genome data from parasites.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701197","grantId":"G0701197","fundValue":"805154","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Durbin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Wellcome Trust  Sanger Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
