Rice assimilates much more arsenic from soils that other grain crops as it is cultivated anaerobically, rather than aerobically. Anaerobic cultivation leads to much greater arsenic mobilization, and thus greater plant availability. Even at background levels of arsenic in rice, rice contributes considerably to human dietary exposure of this carcinogenic element. Unfortunately, extensive areas of land in rice producing regions have been contaminated through irrigation of paddy fields with groundwaters elevated in arsenic and through contamination from wastewater from base and precious metal activities. For example, irrigation water contamination has resulted in the contamination of rice of around 40 million Bangladeshis, whilst 20 million Chinese are dependent on arsenic contaminated paddies as a result of pollution from mining. On these contaminated soils, levels of arsenic can rise considerably in rice grain, greatly increasing dietary exposure to arsenic. The extent and nature of the soil contamination mean that it is not possible to remove arsenic from these soils, and also, given the high population densities supported by these agroecosystems, the contaminated soils must still be kept in rice production. Through initial trials we have revealed that there is considerable genetic variation in arsenic uptake, transport and metabolism in rice. This project will identify the genes responsible for this variation and locate them on the rice genome to enable rice to be bred that has low grain arsenic levels, with a high proportion of this grain arsenic being present as less toxic organic species. Field experiments will be conducted in Bangladesh, West Bengal and China to determine the variation in arsenic grain uptake and metabolism that exists in locally adapted species for plants grown both on groundwater and mine contaminated soils, to enable selection for further breeding. These trials will include mapping populations whose parents differ in arsenic uptake and metabolism, and through genetic analysis, the genes responsible for traits leading to low grain arsenic with more desirable metabolites will be identified and characterised. This genetic information will also enable breeding of rice with characteristics that make it suitable for use on arsenic contaminated soils. Soil factors affecting arsenic uptake by rice will also be investigated to determine if management practices can also lower the arsenic accumulation into rice grain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F004087/1","grantId":"BB/F004087/1","fundValue":"215333","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Besides finding that arsenic was a problem in rice per se, we have shown that it also has major impacts on grain nutrition, and this has had a major impact on how rice must be managed, leading for it being a reason d'etre in new field based approaches such as Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD).\nOur research has shown that the paddy soils in the Bengal delta irrigated with contaminated groundwater have a higher arsenic bioavailability than soils contaminated by other sources of arsenic.

This has direct implications for what cultivars to use for low arsenic (about 30% lower) in the field, and research that has been directly fed back into rice breeders and those implementing rice breeding policy in the Bay of Bengal. A molecular breeding programme has been initiated in West Bengal under EU funding in which a local landrace with generally high grain arsenic has been crossed with tropical japonica cultivars with generally low grain arsenic. Genetic mapping of grain arsenic and further breeding are being conducted now. \n\n\n\n3)The work has directly contributed to the WHO convening a meeting to set arsenic standards in food stuffs, a step that will have global implications for the health of the poor. The WHO has already suspended it Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake (MTDI) following our findings, and is now under obligation to replace this. This will provide an impetus and a framework for breeding and changes in paddy field management globally.\n\n\n\n4)Besides finding that arsenic was a problem in rice per se, we have shown that it also has major impacts on grain nutrition, and this has had a major impact on how rice must be managed, leading for it being a reason raison d'etre in new field based approaches such as Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD).\n\n\n\n5)The rice Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) analysis, as well as illuminating plant arsenic regulation, also yielded quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield and key mineral nutrients.

The information to be mined from these data sets is considerable (we have concentrated on arsenic issues to date) and will provide impetus to improving the quality and productivity of rice across a range of key traits. For example, QTLs have been detected for grain element composition including grain arsenic using existing mapping populations. In addition, grain element composition has been assessed in an association mapping population (developed by Cornell University) and the data are being analysed now for grain arsenic and other grain element QTLs thought collaboration with Cornell.
