You make a mirror from a piece of glass by coating it with metal - which reflects light. But if you drill a series of tiny holes, much smaller than the wavelength of light, in a metal film, then, magically, the light goes through the metal. This remarkable behaviour is driven by plasmons - the oscillations of the electron gas in a metal. Plasmons can be created by the absorption of light and can decay by the emission of light: in other words, they provide a new way to transmit optical information. There is more than one kind of plasmon - small particles (clusters) have local plasmon modes but on an extended metal surface you get propagating modes, which show dispersion. This means that the frequency of the surface plasmon depends on the wavelength. We can imagine that if we place a metal cluster on top of a metal surface, the two different kinds of plasmon mode will couple together, and that at a special wavelength this coupling could be very strong. Effects like this could be exploited in novel optical devices, photonic circuits or biosensors. The aim of this project is to use a technique called electron energy loss spectroscopy to measure the plasmon dispersion on surfaces decorated with atomic clusters of selected size and shape, and to explore the phenomena of localisation and coupling of the plasmons in these systems. We need to design systems in which the frequency of the cluster mode is not far away from that of the surface mode. Silver clusters on a gold surface make a good choice, especially if the silver cluster is distorted in shape from spherical to ellipsoidal, which lowers its plasmon frequency. Then we may see a resonant coupling of the two modes at a specific wavelength. We can also envisage coupling other kinds of local excitation mode to the surface plasmons, such as so-called electron-hole pair excitations in semiconductor clusters or molecules. The experiment works the same way. But there is also a completely different type of measurement we want to attempt, where we measure the field of the plasmon in real space, on the nanometre scale, around and between the individual clusters. This is complementary way to explore the effects of the couping between the plasmons of the cluster and the surface, and exploits a new technique we have invented, called Scanning Probe Energy Loss Spectroscopy (SPELS). Like the plasmons, it's magic!","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D049245/1","grantId":"EP/D049245/1","fundValue":"246340","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The technology to produce size-selected clusters has been utilised by the spin-out company, Inanovate, which focuses on biochips for screening and analysing proteins.

Our findings provided the first report of a new surface plasmon mode, the so-called acoustic plasmon, arising from a 2D electron gas on a gold surface. We also achieved the first demonstration of modulating the plasmon energy dispersion through the attachment of a self-assembled monolayer. Additionally, we demonstrated coupling between plasmons from size-selected clusters and the supporting substrate or film or other nanostructures. Plasmon resonance effects in metal nanoparticles, such as size-selected clusters, are now being extensively investigated for light absorption (over a range of frequencies) and trapping in photovoltaic solar cells, in order to enhance the conversion efficiency of light into generated photocurrent (electricity). In particular, our findings on continuous, nanoscale gold films (and clusters) demonstrate that the acoustic plasmons cover the infra-red to visible range, indicating that the effect may be harnessed to achieve high efficiency conversion of infra-red radiation into electricity in solar cells. This would mean, for instance, solar cells that work even in cloudy weather! Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
