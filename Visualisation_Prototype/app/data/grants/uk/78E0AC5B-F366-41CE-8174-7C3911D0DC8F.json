{"id":"78E0AC5B-F366-41CE-8174-7C3911D0DC8F","title":"Empirical Analysis of Dynamic Graph Layout","abstractText":"Information about relationships between objects can be shown visually in a network diagram (a static graph drawing ) by representing objects as shapes ( nodes ), and relationships between the objects as lines joining the nodes ( edges ). As the relationships change over time (for example, nodes are added or deleted), the changing graph can be depicted as an animation (a dynamic graph drawing ), showing how the information changes over all the time-slices.Several existing systems display changing relational information as dynamic graph drawings. An important yet understudied area is that of assessing these systems with respect to the extent to which they assist users in information tasks (their usability ). While some promising work has been done in the area of evaluating the usability of static graph drawings, no work has yet been done in investigating the usability of dynamic graph drawings. This project will be the first to consider this area of research.In designing these dynamic graph drawing systems, assumptions have been made as to the best way the information should be presented: depending on the assumptions made, different systems will produce different dynamic graph drawings of the same information. The design choices made by the system designers alter the way in which the dynamic changes are displayed: these design decisions are here called 'principles'. A principle may be represented by a value range for a parameter (for example, the maximum distance a node may move between time-slices), or as an unalterable decision (for example, the animation method used for moving the nodes between time-slices). Not only has no work been performed on identifying relevant principles for dynamic graph layout, no human empirical work has been undertaken to investigate the effect of these different principles on human understanding.This one-year project will therefore:* identify appropriate existing dynamic graph drawing systems for investigation;* identify important and interesting principles for investigation; define these principles clearly, and state them in terms of experimental conditions;* define an appropriate experimental methodology for dynamic graph layout systems, including investigating the most appropriate experimental tasks and developing a new experimental framework for studies of this kind;* perform experiments according to this methodology, using both abstract graphs (i.e. embodying no meaning), and graphs with semantic content;* present the results in appropriate publications (journals, conferences, workshops).Although modest in size, the results of this project will have significant implications for people who are designing graph dynamic graph layout systems, people who currently rely on intuition and ad-hoc assumptions. The research will produce new design guidelines that are likely to be of use both to academics working in information visualisation and empirical research, as well as industrial graph visualisation tool developers and users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D077982/1","grantId":"EP/D077982/1","fundValue":"79875","fundStart":"2006-09-18","fundEnd":"2008-03-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Purchase","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
