{"id":"4ACE1F01-DC81-4955-A192-BD0DD679644C","title":"Electromagnetic tensor imaging for in-process welding inspection","abstractText":"Welding is one of the most commonly practiced fabrication techniques within manufacturing today. In particular, the manufacture of heavy 5 vessels such as in the nuclear industry from ferritic and austenitic steels is dependent on high quality welding of seams and joints to ensure component integrity and safety.\n\nThe development of in-process welding Non-Destructive Testing and Evaluation (NDT/E) technologies is vital to underpin the safety of such components, but also provide a significant improvement in nuclear manufacturing productivity. Currently, in order to minimise the need for rework of the welded seams and joints, costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous mid-manufacture radiography in a dedicated NDT/E bay is used for NDT/E. Mid-manufacture inspection suffers from the need to allow the welded components to cool down, typically up to 4 hours, before transferring to a dedicated NDT/E bay.\nIn-process weld inspection would be able to provide real time indication of defects or abnormalities with the weld permitting immediate further investigation and if necessary corrective actions to be taken. This would have positive impact on facility operation efficiency, avoid costly remedy actions at a later stage, and consequently deliver a reduction in overall testing &amp; rework costs and increased productivity. Currently, there are no such commercial techniques available.\nThe instrument proposed in this project if successful would make a step change in this area andwould have significant impact on the UK manufacturers' productivity for heavy nuclear vessels and their competiveness in the global market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M020835/1","grantId":"EP/M020835/1","fundValue":"341090","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2018-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Wuliang  Yin","coPersons":["Anthony Joseph Peyton"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
