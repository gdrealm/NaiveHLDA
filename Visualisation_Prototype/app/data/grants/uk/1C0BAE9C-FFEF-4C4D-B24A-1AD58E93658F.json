{"id":"1C0BAE9C-FFEF-4C4D-B24A-1AD58E93658F","title":"MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling Renewal","abstractText":"The threat from new infectious diseases has been highlighted in recent years by the 2003 SARS epidemic, H5N1 'bird flu' and the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic. Preparing for such eventualities is a priority for public health agencies and governments worldwide. Also, as scientific research delivers new approaches to controlling existing infectious diseases such as malaria, HIV and polio, there is a need to determine what interventions are likely to work best to limit the disease and illness caused by a specific disease in a particular setting.\n\nIn this context, computer modelling of the spread of diseases in populations coupled with scientifically rigorous data analysis have proven themselves as powerful tools for giving insight into how diseases spread and what can be done to limit that control that spread. The Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling undertakes research on these scientific methods and applies them to disease threats of concern. \n\nA key feature of the Centre is the close links it has made with with public health agencies - such as the UK Health Protection Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) - organisations which have to formulate and implement strategies to control infectious diseases. \n\nThe senior scientists in the Centre are world-leaders in infectious disease modelling and analysis. They have broad experience in responding to real epidemics (e.g. BSE/vCJD, SARS, H5N1 bird flu and the 2009 flu pandemic), and undertaking epidemiological research on endemic diseases (such as malaria, HIV and polio). Their work directly influences disease control policy through the many interactions the Centre has with public health organisations and governments. \n\nThe funding provided by MRC and Imperial College have allowed dedicated investment into the development of close collaborative partnerships with HPA, CDC and WHO - as well as with other important organisations who work on improving health in developing countries (notably the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). With each, we are working on a large number of research projects which have both scientific interest to Centre researchers and are contributing to the evidence base needed for public health decisions. Centre funding supports a core technical capacity available to all projects, and pays for dedicated postdoctoral research staff who spend substantial time at WHO (Geneva) and CDC (Atlanta) undertaking epidemiological research with the staff of those agencies and facilitating collaboration with other Centre staff. \n\nMRC funding has also facilitated a greater focus on collaboration, training and career development within the Centre - training the next generation of quantitative infectious disease epidemiologists. We are also involved in increasing knowledge of advanced modelling methods in public health institutions and the wider infectious disease research community, and so have run a number of introductory vocational short courses, both at Imperial College, but also on partner sites in Geneva and London.\n\nAll of this applied activity depends on the more fundamental research undertaken in the Centre on the epidemic dynamics of different diseases, how diseases evolve genetically over time, and on analysing new approaches to control or treat diseases. Much of this research is multidisciplinary, involving Centre researchers working with leading clinical and experimental scientists around the world.\n\nContinued funding for the Centre will allow the collaborative partnerships established in the last 4 years to be sustained and enhanced, and new collaborations with researchers and health agencies in countries such as China and India to be developed. It will also fund new priority research areas, including work to implement the analysis and modelling methods developed by Centre staff as user-friendly computer programs that can be used by public health professionals around the world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K010174/1","grantId":"MR/K010174/1","fundValue":"2325410","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Ferguson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
