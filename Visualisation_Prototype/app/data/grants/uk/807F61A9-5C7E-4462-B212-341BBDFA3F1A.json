Comparisons may be 'developmental', helping organisations reflect on their strengths and weaknesses, or a means of facilitating consumer choice, or of creating incentives/sanctions for managers. Their impact may be to stimulate performance improvements, but in other circumstances may lead to ‘gaming’ aimed at improving indicator scores rather than the values they are intended to represent, or to fatalist attitudes amongst of actors who perceive PI scores to be outside their control.</p> \n<p>The research examines the history, usage and broad impact of health PIs in England and The Netherlands at different times and in different circumstances. It also aims to characterise different PI packages and to explain how and why they were introduced,&nbsp;and in particular how far they were official responses to the impact of earlier PI sets. The study consists of two longitudinal national case studies of the period since about 1982. Data will be collected from official documents (including PI sets and scores), interviews with policymakers, academic advisers and former NHS managers, and specialist and generalist news media reportage.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-166-25-0051","grantId":"RES-166-25-0051","fundValue":"133006","fundStart":"2006-09-04","fundEnd":"2008-03-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Robert Harrison","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
