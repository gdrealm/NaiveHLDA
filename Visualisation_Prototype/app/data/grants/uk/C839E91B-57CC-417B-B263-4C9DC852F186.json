The Welsh-English experiences of North America will be compared with the Welsh-Spanish experiences of South America, making use of conceptual approaches from a variety of disciplines and comparisons with other migrant groups in the USA. The focus will be the ways in which immigrants and their descendants employed a variety of linguistic, cultural and religious resources as part of the process of constructing and negotiating identity in the diaspora.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119567/1","grantId":"119567/1","fundValue":"20445","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jerry  Hunter","coPersons":["Margaret  Deuchar","Densil  Morgan"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
