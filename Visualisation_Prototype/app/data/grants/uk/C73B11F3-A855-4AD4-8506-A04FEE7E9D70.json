{"id":"C73B11F3-A855-4AD4-8506-A04FEE7E9D70","title":"Cultural Rights and Kenya's New Constitution","abstractText":"The research will be the first to document and analyse the impact of cultural rights provisions in Kenya's new constitution on Kenyan society and its heritage sector, producing analysis, policy recommendations and empirical data that will be of use locally and internationally. The constitution, approved in a public referendum in August 2010, enshrines rights to cultural, indigenous and minority heritage which Kenyans have never previously enjoyed. It is currently being implemented, and different groups are bringing or planning claims to cultural rights, which have far-reaching implications for peace and social unification. The constitution will potentially democratise and decentralise heritage management by devolving powers to 47 new county governments, which has major consequences for National Museums of Kenya (a research contact involved in the PI's previous study). The proposed research will, as implementation proceeds, examine connections among the ways in which citizens exercise these particular rights, social cohesion and national peace prospects. Civil society groups that include established contacts are planning to use the constitution to assert rights and make a variety of claims, for example for the return of 'ancestral land', access to sacred sites, intellectual property, and protection for endangered languages. This positioning process began as soon as the constitution was passed, and is increasing day by day. Hence the research is highly topical and urgently needed. \n\nWhile positive in some respects, since culture can be a tool for development and peace building, there are dangers that claims to cultural rights could lead to the further concretisation of 'tribe' and essentialised ethnic identity, the promotion of sub-nationalist ('tribal') identities, a clash between human rights and cultural rights, a retreat into deeper ethnic enclaves and the hardening of ethnicised territorial boundaries. Any of these may exacerbate social tensions and sabotage peace and unification efforts. Yet the aim of the constitution is the exact opposite: to unite the nation. This fundamental contradiction, and the potential pitfalls, have not been recognised yet by the state and other key players. The research will examine and analyse these processes and the public debates and discourses around them, mapping the impact as constitutional provisions are both implemented and interpreted. It will produce timely information for policy makers, heritage managers, heritage stakeholders (who include civil society groups and individual citizens), donors, NGOs, law implementers and bodies delivering civic education. This will have practical uses at a crucial time for Kenya, as constitutional change transforms the country. \n\nCase studies in different communities will track the 'social life' of claims over time. They have been chosen for their ethnic, geographical and subject variation; their potential for yielding rich data that answers our research questions; and because our existing familiarity with contacts and issues secures access. A fourth may be added or substituted if opportunity arises. The cases are:\n\n1. Efforts by the indigenous Yaaku community of Mukogodo Forest, Laikipia, to save an endangered language, and gain political prominence at local county level in order to redress historical marginalisation.\n2. A campaign by people living around the Yala Swamp, western Kenya, mobilised by a local NGO, for recognition of their rights to land that has been 'grabbed' and turned into a rice farm by a US evangelist. (This is a non-ethnicised, non-indigenous claim, in counterpoint to many others.)\n3. Maasai claims for redress for historical injustices including land and resource alienation (multi-sited). The PI has substantial knowledge of these, since activists plan to use her historical evidence of colonial land alienation (Hughes 2006, based on 2002 D.Phil.).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L011603/1","grantId":"ES/L011603/1","fundValue":"628157","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lotte  HUGHES","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
