Around the world there is increasing interest in understanding how universities can train students to become more engaged and globally-minded citizens. The premise here is that higher education today can contribute to the public good by training more global citizens with cultural awareness, a strong sense of civic responsibility and skills to participate in a knowledge-based global economy.&nbsp; Universities commonly acknowledge the importance of this endeavour, but in practise how are they embedding this into undergraduate curriculum?</p>\n\n<p>This project provides a unique opportunity for a diverse group of international researchers and practitioners to investigate:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>How is global citizenship conceptualised in universities and how can the curriculum foster the development of citizen scholars?</li>\n\n <li>How do existing pedagogical theories and models promote global citizenship and how can their effectiveness be measured?</li>\n\n <li>What further research is needed to inform future higher education policy-making?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Culminating with a symposium in Hong Kong, this project will produce a coherent and meaningful agenda for future comparative research on global citizenship policy and practise and in doing so developing new international networks of scholars to undertake this work.&nbsp; </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J019615/1","grantId":"ES/J019615/1","fundValue":"24608","fundStart":"2012-08-21","fundEnd":"2014-08-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The Symposium Proceedings are available on the project website and so are available to practitioners as well as researchers. \n\nSome collaborations have developed as a result of the project. For example, co-PI Robin Shields is the lead editor for a proposed book entitled, Global Citizenship in Higher Education: Cross-cultural Perspectives and Practices (currently under review by Bloomsbury). Many of the contributors were participants in the symposium. \n\nAs well, Dr. David Mendez, Associate Vice President for International Affairs at the Ana G. Mendez University System and is the new host of the United Nations Academic Hub on Global Citizenship, participated in the symposium as a means to help develop his knowledge base in the field: http://www.unaiglobalcitizen.org/.

The Global Citizenship Symposium held in December 2013 in Hong Kong provided a number of thought-provoking perspectives on global citizenship practices in higher education and ideas for future directions in research. \n\nIt was evident that universities would benefit from more comparative research on global citizenship practices. The symposium brought together a diverse group of scholars to discuss future directions for research and areas of overlapping interest where collaboration might be possible. Two main proposals for future research were (1) developing longitudinal studies to understand both the long and shorter-term impact of global citizenship curriculum on graduates and (2) developing studies that place global citizenship into a framework tied to national economic and social development goals - which would help make global citizenship curriculum more meaningful to policymakers. \n\nBoth of these directions for future research would benefit from being undertaken on an international multi-site basis. The Symposium proceeding (referenced in the outcomes section), provide a number of ideas for future research directions. As well, many of the participants would likely be interested in collaborative projects. Education,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
