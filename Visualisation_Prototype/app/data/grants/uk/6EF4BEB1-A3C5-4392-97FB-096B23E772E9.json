How does this process work? Actually very little is known about how the biological clock, present in most cells of the body, can regulate cell division, in healthy cells as well as in tumours. This project combines the efforts of 7 groups across Europe to use a variety of approaches to explore this problem. A great deal of information is available about each process alone, clock and cell division, but little is understood about how they work together. We will create mathematical models of these processes, which will make predictions of how and when they interact. In addition, these models will make critical prediction of how drugs, as well as light, may impact upon their function. The group at UCL will provide essential raw data to help construct these models, and explicitly test the actions of drugs on healthy living cells to see if the results fit with the mathematical predictions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I004823/1","grantId":"BB/I004823/1","fundValue":"327147","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Whitmore","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" A very successful grant, in which we isolate a new cell cycle regulator that controls S-phase, and show how its regulation determines cell cycle timing. A demonstration of the impact of light on this process in zebrafish, and a demonstration of the phenomena in a differentiate adult tissue. These results have led to several additional grant applications. They have clear relevance to a clinical audience with potential long-term translational significance.
