These genes could potentially be involved in important biological cell functions and could represent important targets for diagnostic and pharmacogenomics studies and be of industrial and agronomical importance. A major undertaking for biology is therefore that of identifying the function of these uncharacterized genes on a genomic scale. The challenge for bioinformatics is then to devise algorithmic methods that, given a gene, can predict a hypothesis for its function that can then be validated by wet-lab assays. Luckily, new experimental techniques have become available, producing data which offer clues about protein function and can therefore be employed for function prediction, e.g. protein interaction data, gene expression data. Some experimental and computational data have a natural representation as networks (e.g. protein interaction data), others are inherently 'one-dimensional' (e.g. sequence patterns). Three facts have recently become clear: while each data type contains important information that can help in determining the function of a protein, no single data type by itself suffices; large-scale functional inference greatly improves by integrating evidence from different sources; for those data types which can be represented as networks, the best results are obtained by algorithms that take advantage of the networks' topologies. So far, methods that make functional inferences on networks are very limited in the type of data they can integrate, while methods that can integrate a greater variety of data do not take advantage of the networks' topologies. I intend to investigate a general method that can integrate essentially any data type currently available taking into account its intrinsic structure: it takes advantage of the graph topology for network data, and it can integrate this evidence together with one-dimensional information. I shall develop graph-theoretical methods that use the diffusion of information over graphs to generate functional evidence from network data. This evidence is then combined with other one-dimensional information using machine learning techniques. The strength of the methodology lies in its ability to use diverse sets of noisy data, and to combine them to obtain sound statistical inferences; the weak signals contained in each dataset is enhanced by integrating the data. The methodology will be first developed on Yeast, and I shall then transfer this approach to higher organisms such as C. elegans, D. melanogaster, A. thaliana, and H. sapiens. For all these organisms the performance of the algorithms will then be evaluated 'in silico' by means of test sets; that is I shall verify the accuracy of the methods at predicting the function for genes whose annotation is known. The approach will then be tested 'in vivo' on a sub-network of genes that form signalling pathways (MAPK signalling) and function to transmit information from receptors to gene expression. MAPK pathway components are highly diversified in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, with 123 components. For many of these we do not know how they connect up and what their biological functions are. These will be predicted by the algorithms and then functionally tested by silencing their expression using RNA interference and in mutant lines. I shall also design and implement stand-alone and web-based software tools incorporating the algorithms developed. The applications will enable the biologist to easily apply the algorithms through a user-friendly interface; to visualize the relevant biological networks thus making the inference process transparent and providing an explanation for the functional annotation predicted by the system. A web tool will also be created. All these tools will be made freely available to the scientific community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F00964X/1","grantId":"BB/F00964X/1","fundValue":"419814","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are in contact with two research groups who have been using the output of S2F for organisms of high practical interest for crop production and for biofuel production.\n\n1) Pablo Sotelo, from the Universidad Nacional de Asuncion (Paraguay) is working with the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina, a plant pathogen affecting more than 500 plant species (many crops among them, including soya). S2F has been used to produce a functional annotation for the proteome of this fungus, which is the first step for its characterization. This work is aimed at finding better and more targeted mechanisms for pest-control. Paraguay is one of the largest producers of soya in the world, and this work has important economic implications for the country.\n\n2) Matteo Pellegrini (University of California, Los Angeles) leads a lab with a high interest in algal genomics. The lab is currently sequencing the genome of the unicellular alga Cyclotella cryptica, a model organism for lipid accumulation. This work has application in the biofuel production industry. The Pellegrini lab has been using the functional predictions provided by S2F to annotate this algal genome.\n\nImportantly, the algorithms we developed for specific biological networks can be applied to other types of networks. Therefore, some of our algorithms have impact not only on those problems for which we originally developed them, but also on different problems in Systems Biology as well as in other disciplines such as Pharmacology, Medicine or even Social Networks.\n\nFor example, we originally developed ClusterONE for detecting protein complexes from protein interaction networks. However, ClusterONE is a general algorithm for overlapping clustering on weighted large scale networks. Therefore other research groups have successfully applied ClusterONE and proved its usefulness in several different domains. Some examples include: \n\n1. Medicine: Clustering a genome-scale network obtained by integrating SNP array, gene expression microarray, array-CGH, CGH, GWAS and gene mutation data. This study was aimed at identifying key functional modules in lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n2. Pharmacology: Associating drugs with protein domains in the context of myocardial infarction.\n\n3. Pharmacology: Studying the mechanisms of adverse side effects of Torcetrapib, a drug being developed to treat hypercholesterolemia (elevated cholesterol levels) and prevent cardiovascular disease (its development was halted in 2006).\n\n4. Social Networks: Detecting communities in Social Networks.\n\n\nOur research on diffusion methods for protein function prediction led to the development of methods for inference and structure discovery in biological networks. We applied some of these methods within a collaboration project with the labs of Andrew Emili (University of Toronto) and Edward Marcotte (Universty of Texas, Austin) which was aimed at detecting human protein complexes. \nIn particular, for this project we deployed: ClusterONE, our algorithm for detecting overlapping protein complexes from PPI networks; GOSSTO, our method for calculating semantic similarities on the Gene Ontology; an information diffusion method we developed for denoising protein interaction data. \nThe protein interaction networks identified experimentally in Emili's lab were enriched with networks generated using comparative genomics approaches in Marcotte's lab. Then, in our lab, we integrated this network with a semantic similarity graph (obtained using GOSSTO), applied our denoising procedure, and finally clustered the resulting graph using ClusterONE.\nWe thus obtained the largest catalogue to date of human protein complexes from cell culture.\nThe human protein complexes repository contains all the data generated in this study in an easily navigable format. These include all the pairwise protein interactions obtained through integration of the experimental data with public genomic evidence and the subunit composition of the 622 putative protein complexes obtained by clustering using ClusterONE.\n\nIn our group, we have used S2F to participate in the second CAFA challenge, a competition of protein function prediction. Although this activity is within the academic domain, we think it has been important for acquiring visibility and engaging further collaborations.\n\nFinally, GFam was successfully used on Arabidopsis and the family groupings it provided were included in the TAIR10 genome release.

The challenge for bioinformatics is then to devise algorithmic methods that, given a gene, can predict a hypothesis for its function that can then be validated by wet-lab assays.\n\nIn this grant we focused our attention to the problem of protein function for organisms for which little or no experimental data is available and the only available information is the set of protein sequences. This is a relevant problem with important implications for both industry and human health - it is the case, for example, of newly sequenced bacterial genomes. We successfully developed a new method for solving this problem based on a recent development in computer science: the diffusion of information over graphs. These methods emulate the way in which heat diffuses on a metal bar.\n\nWe also developed two further methods that predict protein function by grouping proteins into families. The first method, called GFam (Gene Family Annotation and Maintenance) groups proteins in a way that proteins in the same group share common domain architecture, and hence function. SCPS (Spectral Clustering of Protein Sequences) groups proteins according to their sequence similarity - similar proteins are likely to have evolved from a common ancestor and therefore are likely to share a similar function.\n\nOur research in protein function prediction also led to the development of novel methods for inference and structure discovery in biological networks. This included ClusterONE, an algorithm for detecting protein complexes from experimental data, and GOSSTO, a method for quantifying the functional similarity between two genes. \n\nImportantly, we applied these methods within a collaboration project with the labs of Andrew Emili (University of Toronto) and Edward Marcotte (Universty of Texas, Austin) which was aimed at detecting human protein complexes - the fundamental molecular machineries in the cell. \nWe were able to obtain the largest catalogue to date of human protein complexes from cell culture. In total, we detected 622 complexes encompassing 2,634 distinct\nproteins. Notably, the majority (62%; 385/622) of the complexes were previously unknown (i.e., only 237 were already present in curated public databases). This catalogue constitutes a first draft of human protein complexes and therefore it provides a glimpse into the global physical molecular organization of human cells.\n\nAn important output of this project is constituted by user-friendly and reliable software packages implementing the algorithms that we developed. We have created a piece of software for every algorithm developed in this project, namely: S2F, GFam, SCPS, ClusterONE, GOSSTO. These tools allow biologists and bioinformaticians to easily deploy our methods, without the need of re-implementing our algorithms. All our software packages are freely available for the scientific community as downloadable applications from the lab website. Some of our tools are also available as web applications hosted on our servers. The high number of downloads of our tools testifies their importance for the scientific community; for example ClusterONE has already been downloaded 4801 times. The problem of protein function prediction is central in today's biology. Possible beneficiaries include:\n\n1. The biological community at large, interested in comprehensive annotation of genomes.\n\n2. The medical community, since elucidating human gene function can help us associate genes with certain human diseases.\n\n3. Agriculture: predicting function for plant genes should enable us to design genetic methods to improve plant performance. Particularly, the signaling pathways on which we worked in this grant are important for plant adaptation to environmental changes.\n\n4. Pharmaceutical companies looking to attack specific pathways.\n\n5. New sequencing efforts: our software enables scientists to rapidly assign putative function to new genes in freshly sequenced organisms without conducting expensive functional assays.
