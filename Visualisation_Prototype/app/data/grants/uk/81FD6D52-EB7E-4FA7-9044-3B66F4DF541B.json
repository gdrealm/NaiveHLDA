The data are widely reported and are generally believed to be a piece of information which the Bank of England takes into account in setting interest rates.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, the data themselves are difficult to assess except in the panel context provided by the British Household Panel Survey. This allows us to study in detail the information content of questions about financial circumstances as predictors of future changes to income and possibly consumption.&nbsp;We will look at the two separate questions whether the expectations variables have the power to predict future income growth and whether, taking into account the past behaviour of income they have predictive power.&nbsp;We can then use our findings to provide a means of interpreting the aggregated monthly data collected by commercial surveys of consumer expectations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1390","grantId":"RES-000-22-1390","fundValue":"45663","fundStart":"2006-01-03","fundEnd":"2007-01-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Thsi work has led into the development of a panel element in the NMG consumer survey at the Bank of England Other Economic","person":"Martin  Weale","coPersons":[],"organisation":"National Institute of Economic & Soc Res","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
