Understanding stresses on joints and muscles and their effect on performing tasks is difficult to comprehend by the range of disciplines involved in the care and rehabilitation of older people, and in designing for their needs. Much data acquired through scientific testing is not easy to understand or share amongst these disciplines. Consequently, this may limit optimum rehabilitation, care, or design strategies and practice. This research was concerned with gaining benefit from scientific data obtained from older adults during daily living tasks and visualised in an innovative format. The goal was to use visualisations to enable cross-disciplinary discussion in which older adults were empowered to participate on an equal basis with specialist disciplines. The aim was to influence care and rehabilitation strategies, the design of the built environment, furniture, products and technological devices, and the quality and extent of work and living activities in later life. During this project the researchers used 3D animations from visualised data as the basis for cross-disciplinary consultations, including older people throughout in interview and focus-group sessions, culminating in a national seminar and ageing research workshop. Data from previous research was able to be presented in the innovative visual format allowing a good selection of the most appropriate animations for focus group\nviewings and follow-up discussions and publications, a process which has generated a rich resource of animations, which have potential to be used in the training of healthcare and design practitioners. The quality of responses from the older participants during the focus groups was high: this tool facilitated a new level of discourse between them and the professionals. The quality of responses from professionals was also high revealing deepened professional insight and understanding, and enabling cross-disciplinary discussion. We were able to verify that our 'proof of concept' has the potential for a greater range of healthcare applications than first envisaged. We have already taken forward these findings in a subsequent collaborative study, funded by the MRC's LLHW programme: http://www.envisagerehab.co.uk&gt; where visualisations were used in a series of feasibility RCTs.
