{"id":"820FAFB4-1CC1-4CCB-8DD0-B6878DB02C44","title":"Consolidated Support for EPSRC-LMS Durham Symposia","abstractText":"The LMS Durham Symposia have long and glorious history and are among the most important regular international mathematical events, reflecting and initiating developments in cutting edge modern mathematics. These 10-day meetings have run since 1974, and their highest international reputation and prestige are widely known. They are widely associated with the excellence of British mathematics. The programme activity of the Durham Symposia is fully controlled by the London Mathematical Society, and takes place only during the summer period which fits well into the academic diary of mathematicians worldwide. This proposal seeks support for a continuation of the programme of Symposia for a further four years. The Symposia bring together the top UK and international researchers in an informal atmosphere, with the aim of finding common ground and discussing exciting recent developments. This, and the fact that virtually all the participants reside in the same accommodation block, gives the opportunity for the exchange of ideas and cross-fertilization of research expertise. We are confident that exciting new international collaborations will be continue to be realised if this proposal comes to fruition. The results of the meetings are distributed initially via an actively-managed and easily accessible website (http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/events/Meetings/LMS/), which contains a list of all 88 previous Durham Symposia. Following the link for any symposium leads to much information, including a list of participants, and other relevant information. The main talks of each symposium are recorded (with permission of the speakers) with a camcorder, and are placed on the website within a few days of the finish of the meeting. Lecture notes and/or slides are also on the site, and all this material is made freely available to all. A more detailed record of the meeting is provided by the publication in research journals of cutting-edge articles inspired by the subjects covered in the meeting. The outcomes from the Symposia impart a large impetus to already dynamic research areas. The UK and international symposium participants are the immediate beneficiaries, but the timely appearance of videos and lecture notes on the Durham Symposium website also informs the research of many other mathematical scientists working in the area. This in turn adds considerably to our understanding of the various research topics studied.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G066736/1","grantId":"EP/G066736/1","fundValue":"631431","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The grant was to support the LMS-EPSRC Durham Symposia series of conferences.

The conferences have been running since 1974 and in 2013 we will have the 100th conference in this series. The aims of the symposia are to bring leading mathematicians from around the world to the UK in order to (a) give UK based mathematicians access to the current leaders in a particular sub-discipline and (b) to set a research agenda for the medium term. While most of the symposia are aimed at the academic community, there have been several very successful meetings involving either the public sector or the business world. Examples include the 2011 symposium Mathematics of Data Assimilation, which involved scientists from the Met Office working on weather and climate prediction. The main benefit is the face to face contact that UK mathematicians can have with current world leaders in their area. Furthermore, the talks at each symposium are recorded on video and available via the conference website, enabling them to be of benefit to a wider audience. Many of the symposia have published proceedings, some of which have become important milestones in the development of the subject. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
