To achieve our aims we construct a series of closed- and open-economy macroeconomic models occupied by economic agents interacting in competitive and non-competitive goods, labour and asset markets.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis has helped to shed light on important policy questions regarding the distribution of the tax burden. Under heterogeneity in labour skill and asset holdings and a production structure where capital and low-skilled workers are close substitutes, we find that progressive taxation can be optimal. In contrast, under heterogeneity in asset ownership only, we find that all agents can benefit from policy which shifts the relative tax burden away from capital. However this shift increases inequality. In addition to the structure of production, other factors which have an important influence on policy outcomes include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>whether markets are competitive</li>\n\n <li>whether the government can credibly commit to its stated policy</li>\n\n <li>government preferences over the income distribution</li>\n\n <li>the voting system and the time horizon of the analysis</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H021140/1","grantId":"ES/H021140/1","fundValue":"118464","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Malley","coPersons":["Konstantinos  Angelopoulos"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
