{"id":"736BF32C-5ECF-405D-B712-C3FBB6A0DFEE","title":"ACTIFCare: ACces to Timely Formal Care","abstractText":"<p>Timely access to services, such as home care, is widely recognised as important for quality of life for people with dementia and their supporters and for reducing health care costs, for example by postponing nursing home placement. However, in practice, individuals are often not receiving services of the type, quality and timing needed.</p>\n\n<p>The ACTIFCare project aims to better understand the reasons for inequalities in access to care services. Access to home care by paid workers (‘formal care’) will be assessed and compared across Europe using literature review, expert consultation and focus groups, providing an overview of policies, services and systems.</p>\n\n<p>The access to and use of formal care services by a cohort of 400 people with dementia and their carers in 8 EU countries will be evaluated in relation to their (un)met needs and quality of life over a 12 month period. Costs, consequences and novel specific outcome measures will be evaluated. This will lead to the identification of best-practice pathways to formal care, in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness, at an important stage of the dementia care pathway where there is great potential to impact positively upon quality of life in the short and long term.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L008831/1","grantId":"ES/L008831/1","fundValue":"244737","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Thomas Woods","coPersons":["Martin William Orrell"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
