{"id":"83AE78CB-CE87-4787-AD57-951F34B55412","title":"Developing deep critical information behaviour","abstractText":"There is evidence that a 'surface' form of information behaviour (information seeking, evaluation and use) is widespread amongst young people at both school and university level. This is characterised by relatively unsophisticated and ineffective information seeking based on a 'least effort' principle, and a relatively uncritical approach to evaluating information in terms of its authority and appropriateness in relation to task needs. Young people often display an over-reliance on the relatively uncritical use of major search engines, in particular Google; poor understanding of their own information needs and poor search strategies lacking an analytic approach; little time spent on assessing the accuracy, authority or relevance of sources before using information for academic work; inability to reduce large volumes of information; and satisfaction with poor quality information.\\n\\nThis is problematic in that a deeper (i.e. more reflective and critical) approach to information seeking, evaluation and use has been linked to academic performance, and is key to the development of the independent evidence-based learning and problem solving required to participate fully in work and personal life in modern society.\\n\\nThe aim of this research is to contribute to the improvement of young people's ability to develop and engage in deep critical information behaviour - to seek, find, evaluate and use information effectively. The research seeks to discover the nature, extent and pattern of occurrence of relatively deep and surface information behaviours amongst young people at pre-university and undergraduate levels. It also seeks to establish the pattern of development of information behaviour from relatively surface to deeper levels of information behaviour, and the the effects of surface information behaviour, as perceived by young people and those who teach them. The research will also focus on the extent to which - and how - the development of deep information behaviour be enabled and fostered.\\n\\nThe research will be conducted in 3 strands and will use a blend of qualitative and quantitative research methods. Strand 1 will employ a qualitative interpretive research approach, appropriate to building deep explanatory models based on data relating to participants' inner perspectives, which ultimately drive behaviour. Strand 2 will use a quantitative approach to explore the statistical generalisability of key aspects of the qualitative model developed in Strand 1. It will also provide a statistical picture of the pattern of occurrence of different information behaviours across a large representative sample of school and university students. It will generate a similar quantitative mapping of the perceptions of key stakeholders (teachers, lecturers and librarians) relating to the causes and effects of surface information behaviour, and the drivers and inhibitors to the development of deeper approaches. Strand 3 will entail the generation of a model integrating the deep qualitative understanding (Strand 1) with the complementary statistical evidence based on a large representative sample (Strand 2). \\n\\nThis mix of complementary types of evidence is intended to enhance the potential impact on practitioners and policy makers - the target audience for a conference planned at the end of the project. This conference will be held for invited teachers, lecturers, librarians, and those influencing school and university teaching and learning policy (Local Education Authority representatives; University Directors of Teaching and Learning). Its purpose will be to integrate the findings of the research within the broader knowledge base of researchers and practitioners, and to discuss strategies for improving the development and engagement in deep critical information behaviour by young people at school and university. The deliverable of this strand of the research will be a report focusing on strategies for achieving this.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H03661X/1","grantId":"AH/H03661X/1","fundValue":"216115","fundStart":"2010-08-16","fundEnd":"2012-03-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Ford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
