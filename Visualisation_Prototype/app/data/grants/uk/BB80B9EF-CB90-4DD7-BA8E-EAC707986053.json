{"id":"BB80B9EF-CB90-4DD7-BA8E-EAC707986053","title":"Compositional Security Analysis for Binaries","abstractText":"Binaries are routinely inspected by the intelligence community, military organisations and security \nengineers in their search for vulnerabilities. Binaries are often huge and therefore verification and \nprogram analysis techniques should be scalable.\n\nThis project will pioneer compositional analyses for binary code. This will result in analyses \nthat are both modular and scalable.\nThe scientific challenge in compositional reasoning is how to separate intricate interactions, avoid\nexpensive operations such as quantifier elimination, and derive procedure summaries that are compact.\n\nThe project team will develop foundational techniques for the compositional analysis of binaries, testing \ntheir viability with a running case study: the data santisation problem. Confidential data is sanitised when \nits memory is zeroed before it is deallocated, preventing an attacker retrieving the sensitive information.\nData santisation is scientifically fascinating because of the need to track how secrets are passed\nfrom one procedure to another and, in addition, how secrets are embedded into compound data-structures.\nThe problem is exacerbated by up-casting and down-casting, and the need to track the size\nof a data object to ensure, for example, that all the elements of a buffer are properly zeroed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031929/1","grantId":"EP/K031929/1","fundValue":"228823","fundStart":"2013-08-30","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andy  King","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
