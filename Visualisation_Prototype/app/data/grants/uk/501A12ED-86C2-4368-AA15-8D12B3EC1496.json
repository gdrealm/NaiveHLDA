Within such cavities, increased field intensity gives access to a variety of nonlinear optical phenomena, and increased interaction length allows detection of even trace amounts of gases. For large numbers of atoms in small enough cavities, the system enters a regime of collective strong coupling. In this case the atoms and cavity field behave cooperatively, giving rise to a rich nonlinear dynamics.\n\nThe simplest resonator design comprises a pair of parallel mirrors, but ring geometries involving three or more mirrors are used in a number of important applications. Ring laser gyroscopes form the basis of rotation sensing in navigation systems, and passive ring resonators have been used to measure optical activity in chiral liquids. Here we propose experiments with ultracold gases in an optical ring cavity, operating in the regime of collective strong coupling of atoms and light. This system has applications to laser cooling of molecules, self-organisation, quantum simulation, and precision metrology. \n\nThe first phase of the experiment aims to understand cavity-enhanced cooling as a way to generalise laser cooling for use with molecules. Preliminary work in this field suggests that spatial self-organisation of atoms plays a crucial role in enhancing the coherent scattering into the cavity mode. Although the majority of theoretical work on this topic has been carried out within the ring geometry, the few existing cavity cooling experiments have utilised standing wave resonators. We will therefore be perfectly placed to investigate proposed advantages of the ring geometry, related to translational invariance and the coherent exchange of momentum between degenerate cavity eigenmodes.\n\nIn the second phase of the experiment we will perform direct quantum simulation of condensed matter systems. There has been phenomenal success using quantum gases in optical lattice potentials to mimic a variety of solid-state crystalline systems. However one ingredient missing in most of this work is any atomic backaction onto the lattice potential. In typical experiments, the underlying optical lattice is unaffected by the position or motion of the atoms, in contrast with solids and with optical lattices in resonators. Recent experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates in high-finesse cavities have begun to study cavity optomechanics, and a quantum phase transition to a supersolid has been demonstrated. We will exploit the ring geometry to study systems with moving lattices in a regime where atom density modifies the optical potential. This will provide a key testing ground for condensed matter systems where lattice excitations play an important role.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J016985/1","grantId":"EP/J016985/1","fundValue":"89063","fundStart":"2012-05-30","fundEnd":"2014-05-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This work has dovetailed into the UK-wide ?270M investment in Quantum Technologies.

When the number of atoms in the cavity is large enough, the collective light-matter interactions become so strong that the cavity transmission spectrum is split into a doublet. Under these conditions the coherent interactions begin to outpace the dissipation and damping due to spontaneous emission and losses and transmission at the cavity mirrors. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time this has been achieved with potassium-39 atoms. Furthermore we have presented a theoretical discovery concerning the tunneling dynamics of matter waves in a similar system when the cavity finesse becomes much higher than what we use in our current design. We have shown that it is possible in this regime for atoms to move uphill under the action of gravity, passing through classically forbidden regions of space. A group in Hamburg is applying our theoretical discovery to understand the tunneling dynamics of atomic matter waves in extremely high-finesse cavities. Our own experiment is now aiming to create novel cold atoms-based lasers for a variety of fundamental tests and applications in rotation sensing and underground mapping.
