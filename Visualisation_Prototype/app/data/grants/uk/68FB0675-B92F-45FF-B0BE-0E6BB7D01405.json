This project will i) produce novelbiocomposite food packaging using plant-based materials; cereal/ oilseedstraws/ and others agri-residues, optimising process variables to obtainultrathin materials ii) confirm use of Innovative farm-basedtechnologies to convert these materials into retail food packages, atcosts competitive with concurent non-renewable products. Preliminaryinvestigations show that these biocomposites are more resource efficientthan plastics, biopolymers &amp; starch-based alternatives currentlyavailable on the market. The packaging products will be biodegradable/compostable &amp; post-use for making medical disposable products such askidney trays, urinals delivering a very efficient life cycle and alsoleading to reduction in landfill.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G001065/1","grantId":"TS/G001065/1","fundValue":"151260","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Keshavan  Niranjan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
