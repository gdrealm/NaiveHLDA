This will be the first meeting on the arithmetic of function fields held in the UK and one of its main aims is to popularise this highly developed and prestigious area of modern number theory, which is still rapidly evolving, to the UK mathematical community. The arithmetic of function fields centres around the concepts of Drinfeld modules and t-motives. They proved to be an immensely powerful tool in resolving several central conjectures in Pure Mathematics, namely the global and local Langlands conjectures, the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture, the Jaquet-Langlands correspondence, and the Carayol-Deligne conjecture. On the other hand although their study were originally undertaken in order to make advance on the above-mentioned conjectures, now it is a discipline on its own, an extremely rich theory which have a counterpart for every object which is studied by classical number theory, including modular varieties and modular forms, L- and Gamma-functions, Galois representations and Hodge theory, Bernoulli numbers and transcendence results and which often closely mirrors, but sometimes tantalising diverges from the arithmetic of number fields. Moreover very often the state of art in the arithmetic of function fields is far more advanced than in the case of number fields, hence the area still serves its role as an important testing ground for the major conjectures of number theory. The area also has deep connections to representation theory, algebraic and arithmetic geometry, group theory and even combinatorics. It is very natural to expect that many major results in this area are still to be discovered. Some of the leading experts have already accepted to speak and attending Ph. D. students will be exposed to the latest methods spanning a large selection of topics. The other aim of the workshop is to stimulate discussion among its participants and further research in this exciting area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I030948/1","grantId":"EP/I030948/1","fundValue":"19617","fundStart":"2011-06-08","fundEnd":"2011-10-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The workshop's aim was to communicate results and popularise the subject, and in this respect it was very successful.

This event was the first meeting on the arithmetic of function fields held in the UK and one of its main aims was to popularise this highly developed and prestigious area of modern number theory, and to stimulate further research in the area. Judged by every criteria, the workshop was a large success. It attracted a large number of participants both from the UK and from overseas, and became one of the major events in number theory in the UK this year. It covered the whole spectrum of current research in the area, and gave opportunity to British participants to communicate their (sometimes very significant) results, as well as to engage in mutually beneficial interaction with participants from overseas. This was a workshop, for communicating results, so findings is not an appropriate word here. The research presented was international, so it did help the present researchers to get informed about others' research. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
