{"id":"5C3F2A04-4DCD-446A-B2AA-B924352C4DC3","title":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis capsular alpha-glucan biosynthesis and characterisation of host-pathogen interactions","abstractText":"Like many bacterial species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes TB, is covered with an outer capsule composed of sugar polymers. These so called sugar capsules have been shown to be important for bacterial virulence by undermining the host immune response. Although, the composition of the M. tuberculosis capsule is\nrelatively well studied, the mechanism underlying its production and its functional role have only been poorly defined. The aim of this project is to obtain an insight into these two important issues. Firstly, we will address, in detail, the route by which the capsule is produced, and secondly, we will study the capsule?s functional role under various\nexperimental conditions. Together, the data will provide valuable insight into the nature and function of this long neglected structure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901690","grantId":"G0901690","fundValue":"396721","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gurdyal Singh  Besra","coPersons":["David Anthony Lammas","Apoorva  Bhatt"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
