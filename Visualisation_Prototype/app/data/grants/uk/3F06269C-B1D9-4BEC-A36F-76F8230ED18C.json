Many of these chemical messengers are normally stored in membrane-enclosed vesicles inside cells and can only be released by fusion of these vesicles with the cell membrane in the process known as exocytosis. The importance of this mechanism is illustrated by the fatal paralysis caused by botulism, which works by blocking the exocytosis of neurotransmitter from nerve cells. Exactly how exocytosis occurs was mysterious until the last decade, when it emerged that a set of similar proteins - the 'SNARE proteins' - controlled this process in all cells. The SNARE proteins are believed to directly drive membrane fusion during exocytosis, but other nerve cell proteins regulate the activity of the SNAREs, enabling sophisticated control of neurotransmitter release. A good candidate for one such regulatory protein in mammals is Munc18. Indeed, Munc18 binds tightly to the SNARE protein, syntaxin, and is essential for neurotransmitter release in vivo. Munc18 was named after a similar protein called unc-18 that was discovered years earlier in worms. Like the mammalian protein, unc-18 binds to syntaxin and is important for neurotransmission in vivo. It therefore seems likely that the critical function of unc-18/Munc18 in nerve cells involves binding to syntaxin. However, Munc18 also binds to different nerve cell proteins, so it is not clear which interactions are most important for exocytosis. Furthermore, Munc18 affects multiple stages of the exocytosis process and some of these do not appear to require syntaxin binding. We aim to shed light on this issue by engineering mutant versions of unc-18 that bind to some binding partners of unc-18, but not others. Analysis of worms containing these mutant proteins in nerve cells will identify which unc-18 interactions are important for exocytosis. As these mutants should also change the amount of neurotransmitter released from nerve cells, we will study how this contributes to behaviour in the living animal. As the proteins being studied are similar to those in our own nerve cells, the results of this study will illuminate the molecular basis of human brain function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D01073X/1","grantId":"BB/D01073X/1","fundValue":"196415","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Morgan","coPersons":["Robert D Burgoyne"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
