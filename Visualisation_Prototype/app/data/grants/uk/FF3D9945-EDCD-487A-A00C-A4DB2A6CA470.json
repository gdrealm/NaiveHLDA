The incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight has increased over the last decade in industrialised countries, and preterm delivery has a higher prevalence among the unemployed, poorly educated and the politically disenfranchised. The burden of impairment is considerable: half of all surviving infants born at 25 weeks or less show neurodevelopmental impairment at 30 months of age, and these problems persist into later life.

For this purpose we will develop a spatio-temporal model of the human cerebral cortex during the early phase of brain development up to and including birth. This will enable us to detect differences in cortical development in-utero and ex-utero and to correlate cortical development with neuro-cognitive outcome data. This project is a collaboration between computer scientists, physicists and clinicians, and the research will lead a deeper understanding of the early phase of human brain development. It will also provide metrics and biomarkers for therapeutic interventions in the vulnerable population of infants born prematurely.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F011830/1","grantId":"EP/F011830/1","fundValue":"573086","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project has led to the development of improved atlases of brain development.

These tools may also be useful for other neurological disorders such as dementia. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
