This will allow for an assessment of the feasibility of future interdisciplinary work based around a sub-sample of the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) and of the 1958 British Birth Cohort Study, known as the National Child Development Study (NCDS).</p>\n\n<p>The aim is to use the exploratory network to develop an interdisciplinary research proposal. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G033560/1","grantId":"ES/G033560/1","fundValue":"142235","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Elliott","coPersons":["Barbara  Maughan","Robert  Plomin","Trevor William Robbins"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
