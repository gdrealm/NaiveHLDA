However, most language tests are inappropriate for very young children. One helpful research tool is parent-completed Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs) - checklists of children’s speech and gesture abilities. CDI norms are now used worldwide in child language and development research.</p>\n\n<p>However, no standardised CDIs exist for UK English, which has limited UK researchers in the types of questions they can answer and the scale of studies.</p>\n\n<p>This project will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>create the first standardised UK-CDI - the UK-CDI (Words and Gestures). This can then be used to establish norms for UK children aged 8-18 months&nbsp;</li>\n\n <li>use these data for two large-scale studies, on the effect of socio-economic factors, risk and resilience on children’s language development; and examining differences between children learning UK English, and other languages/dialects</li>\n\n <li>study best practice in using the UK-CDI, especially with children at risk of language delay</li>\n\n <li>make UK data freely available via a web-based Child Language Database.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The study will make a major contribution to language development research and increase effectiveness of public services and policy making.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J007692/1","grantId":"ES/J007692/1","fundValue":"287594","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Katherine  Alcock","coPersons":["Caroline Frances Rowland","Kerstin  Meints"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
