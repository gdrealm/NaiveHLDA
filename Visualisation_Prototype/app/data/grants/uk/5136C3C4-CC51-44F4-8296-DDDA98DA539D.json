Sugarcane (grown in Brazil) is a very similar crop, bred for its sugar content. \n\nBoth plants have bacteria called endophytes living in their roots. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with these bacteria; some of the bacteria help the plant fix nitrogen, others may help the plant tolerate drought stress. \n\nThis project aims to exchange knowledge and expertise on these endophytes including what types of endophytes are present and how they function. In the long term, this could lead to us being able to innoculate plants with specific beneficial bacteria, thereby making them more tolerant to drought, and to increase their growth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M029271/1","grantId":"BB/M029271/1","fundValue":"48020","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kerrie  Farrar","coPersons":["Matthew  Hegarty"],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
