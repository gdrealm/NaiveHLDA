We are frequently exposed to the infections that cause these diseases, however, most of the time we remain healthy. This is because our body?s immune system is able to control these infections and thus we do not become ill. The reason why this happens is poorly understood. If we understood more about how this part of the immune system worked then it may be possible to develop new therapies against lung diseases. \n\nI have been carrying out research into the immune response two important causes of lung infections one of the viruses responsible for influenza, the influenza A virus and the bacterium responsible for the most common cause of pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumonia. However, as the immune system is very complicated it can be difficult to understand fully what is happening in experimental systems. It is possible to develop computer models that have behaviours that closely resemble biological systems. We are able to change conditions in these models that would not be possible using traditional experimental approaches. Such computer models can be simple which can be useful to look at the behaviour of simple biological systems, but for complex biological systems there are models, called agent based models, which are able to model the unpredictable behaviour of more complex systems. I plan to learn how to use and develop both of these types of computer model and I will then use these models to help answer important questions about the immune system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902354","grantId":"G0902354","fundValue":"98289","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen Maria Marriott","coPersons":["Rodney Harris Smallwood","David H Dockrell"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
