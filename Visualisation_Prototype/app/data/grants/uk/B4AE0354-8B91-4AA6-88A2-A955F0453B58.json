The knowledge hub will use networking and exchanges to further advance European agricultural research capacity in modelling the impacts of climate change on agriculture and food security. State-of-the-art climate change risk assessments will be developed for farming and food security at European and regional case study levels. MACSUR2 will build upon the strong links established by networking in MACSUR1 to address the following core objectives: \n1. Further advancement of European agricultural research capacity, using networking and exchanges to bring together modelling groups and to link modellers more effectively with experimental researchers.\n2. To maintain up-to-date results on climate impacts on agriculture and food security in line with selected core global socioeconomic and climate scenarios until 2050.\n3. To develop a new state-of-the art Europe-wide climate change risk assessment for farming and food security\n4. To build on the work of MACSUR1 in extending and developing training for 'integrated modellers' able to work across modelling disciplines and to provide integrated, stakeholder-relevant interpretations of modelling outcomes.\n5. To develop additional regional integrated case studies for addressing region-specific climate and socioeconomic impacts, needs and chances for adaptation and mitigation. \n6. To continue to engage with stakeholders including policy-makers and agro-food-chain representatives to ensure the relevance and impact of modelling approaches and outputs\nGiven the scientific excellence of the Knowledge Hub, MACSUR2 will address to a greater extent on the interests of policymakers and the agro-food chain, especially farmers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N004922/1","grantId":"BB/N004922/1","fundValue":"53257","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
