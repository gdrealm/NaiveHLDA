This can often lead to products different from those obtained using usual chemical reagents and heat. Unfortunately, photochemistry is no easier to control than thermal chemistry and often a mixture of producs are obtained. Coherent control aims to use the electric field generated by a laser to direct a chemical reaction. This can be done by using a specially shaped pulse of laser light. How to shape the pulse is a technically difficult problem. How this pulse brings about the control is a theoretically difficult problem. The proposed research is to set up a network of researchers to discuss and solve these problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D069912/1","grantId":"EP/D069912/1","fundValue":"48685","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  No findings - network to strengthen academic ties between UK groups in laser control.

In addition they have the potential to influence the outcome of a reaction. This network supported the UK groups involved in these state-of-art experiments and theoretical calculations by aiding interaction. Many members of the network are still active and communicate their findings to other scientists. Laser control has become a useful tool in helping to explore the possible behaviour of molecules in a light field. Chemicals,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
