A limitless variety of features can be made using the 'Surfi-Scupt' technique. These include high aspect ratio spikes, burr-free holes, blades, channels and swirls. Typical surface features are in the height range 200 micron / 2 mm with maximum diameter of protrusions being 0.25 mm. Due to the distinctive features generated from the 'Surfi-Sculpt' process, innovative quality assessment methods need to be investigated to measure and analyse the three-dimensional structures produced. This proposal will aim to develop:1. Measurement Methodology / techniques that are rapid, offer suitable height tolerances and optimised procedures for sculpted surfaces. 2. Hardware: Bespoke measurement rigs and/or modifications to existing measuring hardware and instrumentation.3. Software: Modifications to existing software maybe be recommended to generate new parameters or to manipulate the data sets in different ways to allow rough surface feature recognition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D062373/1","grantId":"EP/D062373/1","fundValue":"144456","fundStart":"2006-07-20","fundEnd":"2009-07-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert James Knoyle  Wood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
