In addition, the Network examines the extent to which informal bodies such as the G8 and G20 should continue to play a large role in reshaping the mandates and governance of international financial institutions. </p>\n\n<p>The Network will produce a special issue of International Affairs, titled 'Global Economic Governance in a World of Crisis' to be published in May 2010 and an edited volume to be submitted at the end of 2010. </p>\n\n<p>The results will be fed into the policy loop through the publication of policy briefings and opinion pieces in UK as well as international newspapers. Workshops will also be held with opinion-makers and their advisors, business leaders and scholars to stimulate discussions on shared agendas. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H032843/1","grantId":"ES/H032843/1","fundValue":"48584","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paola  Subacchi","coPersons":["Mui Pong  Goh","Andrew F.
