{"id":"C7D162B0-A666-48BD-8E09-83A0E559FEC8","title":"Design of HIV vaccines that stimulate T cell and NK cell immunity","abstractText":"Around 34 million people worldwide are currently infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the virus that causes AIDS, and 1.8 million people died of AIDS in 2010. Despite advances in the treatment and prevention of HIV infection, ~2.7 million people became newly-infected with HIV in 2010. A vaccine is therefore urgently needed to combat HIV spread. The goal of this research programme is to contribute to the development of an effective HIV vaccine. The studies below will synergise with complementary HIV vaccine research being carried out by a US-funded international consortium of which the applicants are part.\nDevelopment of effective HIV vaccines is very challenging. Most vaccines for other virus infections work by inducing the production of antibodies (Abs), proteins that bind specifically to the virus and block the establishment of infection. It is likely that a vaccine that induced Abs capable of neutralising all the circulating strains of HIV (termed broadly-neutralising (bN)Abs ) would be very effective. However HIV is a highly variable virus, which makes it difficult for vaccines to stimulate the production of Abs capable of recognising all HIV variants. Even more importantly, very few of the Abs that bind to HIV are actually able to neutralise the virus and block infection. Recent studies have shown that HIV-1 bNAbs are very difficult for Ab-producing cells (B cells) to make. Specialised helper T cells, termed follicular helper T cells (TFH), provide help to B cells for Ab production. We hypothesise that HIV-specific TFH may therefore be very important for the generation of HIV-1 bNAbs. The first aim of the proposed research will be to test this hypothesis, and to compare the ability of different vaccination strategies to induce TFH activity.\nEven bNAbs are not likely to be able to block HIV infection in all cases, so it is also important for HIV vaccines to elicit other immune responses that can control virus replication after infection. HIV-specific CD8 T cells play an important role in HIV control, and vaccine-elicited CD8 T cell responses have been shown to contain HIV replication efficaciously in animal models. However the HIV-specific T cell responses elicited in human vaccine trials to date have not been adequate to control virus replication; furthermore HIV was rapidly able to mutate to escape from these responses. The second aim of the proposed research will be to develop strategies to elicit optimally-protective HIV-specific CD8 T cell responses. We will study why the first CD8 T cell responses made in natural HIV infection are often focused on just 1-2 sites in the virus (which is detrimental, as it is much easier for the virus to mutate at 1-2 sites than to escape from responses targeted to many sites), to understand how this can be overcome by vaccination. We will also study the CD8 T cell responses elicited by a new T cell-inducing vaccine developed in Oxford, which has been designed to elicit strong HIV-specific CD8 T cell responses targeted to sites in the virus where HIV is less likely to be able to mutate. We will investigate how specific aspects of the responses induced by this vaccine may enhance or reduce vaccine efficacy, and if required, will design improved T cell vaccines based on our results. \n\nOur third aim will be to explore the novel idea of harnessing the activity of natural killer (NK) cells (rapidly-responding cells that form part of the first line of defence against infection) in HIV vaccine design. NK cells contribute to HIV control, but until recently NK cells were not thought to share the ability of B and T cells to mount a more protective response on second exposure to a particular infection, which forms the basis of vaccination. We plan to study whether vaccines can induce long-lasting changes in NK cell responses in humans. We will also analyse how NK cell receptors recognise HIV, so that we can design NK-stimulatory vaccines to combat HIV infection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K012037/1","grantId":"MR/K012037/1","fundValue":"1805900","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew J McMichael","coPersons":["Persephone  Borrow"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
