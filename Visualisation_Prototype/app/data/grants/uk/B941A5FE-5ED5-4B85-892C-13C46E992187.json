Research in Cognitive Psychology (eg Rosch 1978) and Cognitive Linguistics (eg Lakoff 1987) has shown that categorisation is a mental process by which humans organise entities and their experience. Such mental categorisation is reflected in some languages by grouping nouns (names of entities) into classes.</p>\n\n<p>Serge Sagna’s research aims at showing that Eegimaa also has unusual strategies for categorising actions, event and states in speakers’ lives, by grouping nonfinite verbs (the equivalent of English infinitives) into classes.</p>\n\n<p>To investigate the categorisation strategies with verbs and their correlations with noun categorisations in Eegimaa, Serge will carry out fieldwork during which he will collaborate with speakers to collect data through experiments, elicitation (asking questions to speakers), participant observation, and by examining language material from dirge songs, narratives and conversations.</p>\n\n<p>Serge will also use material from his research to produce manuals on health issues to contribute to the on-going literacy programme, and translate school material for children, to contribute to the revitalisation of the Eegimaa language.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001922/1","grantId":"ES/K001922/1","fundValue":"151467","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The impact of my findings is still in progress.

The grammatical patterns discovered are unique, but the conceptual features found are to some extend comparable to those found in languages from other parts of the World. This suggests that there could be similarities in the way humans from different parts of the world think about the actions, events, and states in their lives. The available findings are discoveries which are mainly usable by academics in their research in African languages.\nHowever, the impact still in progress will be available for researchers in other academic areas as well as speakers of the language and also educational and health professionals.
