However, little is known about the effect of DI on the interaction between interviewers and respondents or how variation in this interaction might affect data quality.</p>\n\n<p>Focusing on this gap in understanding, we will examine transcripts derived from a pilot for Wave 16 of the British Household Panel Study.&nbsp;Applying a technique known as sequence analysis, we will disentangle the effect of dependent interviewing on survey respondents, interviewers and the dynamic between them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will also investigate the associations between any problematic interview dynamics and the characteristics of interviewers and respondents. We will further analyse the associations between any problematic dynamics and indicators of data quality.&nbsp;Our overarching aim is to help inform better questionnaire design and ultimately the quality of data collected.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E016480/1","grantId":"ES/E016480/1","fundValue":"80897","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emanuela  Sala","coPersons":["Peter  Lynn","SC Noah  Uhrig"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
