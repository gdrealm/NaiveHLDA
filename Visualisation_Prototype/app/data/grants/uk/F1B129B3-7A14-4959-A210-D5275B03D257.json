{"id":"F1B129B3-7A14-4959-A210-D5275B03D257","title":"Children as Decision Makers","abstractText":"<p>This seminar series aims to provide a forum to share ways of involving children in decision-making in education. It will break new ground by enabling educators and researchers working in countries in the South and North to develop new approaches to children's decision-making, based on experiences from a wide range of contexts. The seminar series is concerned with how children can actively participate in decision-making in schools and other educational contexts. The series builds upon previous UK-based research into student voice and decision-making, citizenship education in the school curriculum and work with children as researchers. In an international context, there is an increasing focus on child rights and promoting children’s involvement in decision-making. Starting from the position that children’s participation in decision-making is problematic, the series will focus on:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>methodological issues around practices, policies, structures and forms of communication intended to enable children to participate in decision-making</li> \n <li>ethical and political questions around the transformation of power relationships between adults and children</li>\n</ul> \n<p>The seminar series will be multi-disciplinary, bringing together Schools of Education (University of East Anglia; Birmingham) with the Centre for Development Studies (Leeds) and NGOs working in development.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4228","grantId":"RES-451-25-4228","fundValue":"11444","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Patricia Cox","coPersons":["Michele  Schweisfurth","Chris  Williams","Caroline  Dyer","C  Richards","Anna  Robinson-Pant"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
