In this project we investigate in a series of laboratory experiments how the two most basic elements of competition - selection of trading partners and price setting - impact on trust relations. Imagine a buyer who wants to buy a product that may be of good or bad quality. Unfortunately, the quality of the product is only revealed after the purchase (by using it for a while). In such a situation, the purchase of the good becomes an act of trust. Depending on the the specific parameters it may well be that a rational buyer refrains from buying since a rational seller would always supply low quality. Previous research has analysed various institutional features that may help to ease this problem. However, so far there have been no investigations into how competition may overcome lack of trust. This project aims at filling this gap.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1835","grantId":"RES-000-22-1835","fundValue":"79750","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Steffen  Huck","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
