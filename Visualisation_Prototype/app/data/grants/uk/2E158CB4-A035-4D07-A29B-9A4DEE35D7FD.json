KIRs are expressed predominantly on natural killer cells where they play an important role in innate immunity. There are few studies elucidating the impact of KIRs on the T cell response in human disease.\n\nWORK WHICH HAS LED UP TO THIS PROJECT \nOur research has revealed a novel and unexpected way in which immunity can be enhanced. We have found that a particular KIR (KIR2DL2) enhances both protective and detrimental HLA class I disease associations in two chronic virus infections (hepatitis C virus and human T lymphotropic virus) and is an important determinant of clinical outcome. Strikingly, although KIRs are primarily associated with innate immunity, we believe our observations suggest that they also have a major impact on the adaptive immune response. \n\nA NEW ROLE FOR KIR? \nMany associations between disease outcome and pairs of KIR-HLA genes have been reported. In every case the KIR-HLA pair consisted of a KIR and the HLA molecule that it binds and the effect was attributed to direct NK killing; i.e. NK cells express the KIR which binds its HLA ligand, this modulates the NK killing of virus-infected cells and thus affects disease outcome. \n\nWhat we have observed is quite different. \n\nWe report that associations between HLA class I molecules and disease outcome are weak in the absence of KIR2DL2 but are enhanced in the presence of KIRDL2, more so if there are two copies of the KIR2DL2 gene. This is true for multiple HLA-A, B and C alleles, most of which do not bind KIR2DL2. We see this effect for two different virus infections and for both protective and detrimental HLA associations. Both clinical outcome and, independently, viral burden are affected. Additionally, the protective effect of HLA binding of many different viral peptides is also enhanced by KIR2DL2. In contrast KIR2DL2 with its C1 ligand (not in the context of protective or detrimental HLA molecules) has absolutely no detectable impact on any measure for either virus. We think that this KIR2DL2-enhancement of HLA class I associations cannot be explained by NK killing of virus-infected cells. Instead we postulate a novel interaction between KIRs and adaptive immunity that is having a significant impact on clinical outcome.\n\nHYPOTHESIS \nWe suggest KIR2DL2 enhances adaptive immunity by increasing T cell survival during chronic infection and thus enhances the strength of the CD8+ T cell response. If the CD8+ T cell is restricted by a protective HLA class I molecule then, in a KIR2DL2+ person, the CD8+ T cell response will be stronger and protective associations will be enhanced, but equally if CD8+ T cells are restricted by a detrimental HLA molecule then the detrimental associations will be enhanced. \n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nWe will test the hypothesis that KIR2DL2 enhances adaptive immunity and investigate how general this effect is. Specifically, we will test if the CD8+ T cell response to hepatitis C virus and human T lymphotropic virus is stronger in individuals with KIR2DL2 and we will investigate if KIR2DL2 also impacts on the risk of developing virus-associated leukemia.\n\nIMPORTANCE\nOur data are consistent with an unexpected and clinically important interaction between innate and adaptive immunity. Understanding how the CD8+ T cell response can be enhanced would represent a significant advance in our basic knowledge and would be a major step towards combating the dysfunctions associated with weakened immunity. \n\nAPPROACH \nWe take a multidisciplinary systems approach in which we combine mathematical modelling and sequencing of the host and pathogen genomes with more &quot;traditional&quot; cellular immunology. Investigating the human immune response is challenging; by using this combined approach we gain unique insight.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J007439/1","grantId":"MR/J007439/1","fundValue":"361088","fundStart":"2013-01-02","fundEnd":"2016-01-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Becca  Asquith","coPersons":["Charles R M Bangham","Mary  Carrington","Salim  Khakoo"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
