{"id":"0E345206-9C5B-4F26-A8CB-EAD1E94BF4AE","title":"Robust Incremental Semantic Resources for Dialogue","abstractText":"When humans process language, they do so incrementally, understanding and producing sentences on a word-by-word basis. In conversation, we easily switch roles between speaker and hearer mid-sentence, taking turns speaking and listening to show attention, clarify information or add detail when needed, interactively contributing to a shared, emerging picture of what we mean. If we want human-computer dialogue systems to be natural, efficient and easy to use, they must behave as incrementally as humans do: understanding and reacting interactively on a word-by-word basis rather than insisting on fully-formed sentences. We would prefer a system which behaves as in (1) below to the more familiar but annoying (2), or even the more patient but less interactive (3):\n\n(1)\nUsr: I'd like er [pause] . . .\nSys: Yes?\nUsr: a ticket to Paris from, hang on . . . \nSys: Paris, France? \nUsr: right, from London please. \nSys: OK, checking for Paris to London.\n\n(2)\nUsr: I'd like er [pause] . . .\nSys: I'm sorry, I don't understand. Please state your destination.\n\n(3)\nUsr: I'd like er [pause] . . .\nUsr: a ticket to Paris from, hang on . . . \nUsr: from London please. \nSys: OK. Do you mean Paris, France?\n\nPrevious research has developed computational models of dialogue which can behave incrementally, allowing the kind of interaction shown in (1); but they currently rely on hand-written rules or statistical models to relate words to actions and concepts. These lack the ability to express the complex meanings that human language is so good at conveying, and are time-consuming to create for any new system, domain or task. Instead, they need incremental models which deal with semantics, updating some representation of meaning as each word is heard or spoken, and which can be automatically learned from data; but general methods for doing this are currently lacking. This project will bridge this gap, providing a linguistically-based, learnable framework for incremental semantic interpretation and generation, which can be used to improve and extend existing dialogue systems.\n\nThe project will start from recent work in theoretical linguistics and dialogue modelling which has produced the incremental semantic processing framework Dynamic Syntax (Kempson et al., 2001). This shows promise in modelling complex incremental dialogue, but is currently under-developed from a practical point of view, needing time-consuming expert hand-crafting, and missing a link between action planning and language generation. This project will address these issues. First, we will develop methods for automatically learning Dynamic Syntax grammars from data, allowing other researchers to easily produce and use their own versions in their own systems. Second, we will develop its methods for generating language so that it can be integrated with the way dialogue systems plan their actions on the fly. These new capabilities will be implemented computationally and evaluated on real data. Together, they will then be used to build a demonstration dialogue system which can behave incrementally, and will be packaged into a publicly available toolkit for researchers to develop their own incremental, semantic dialogue systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J010383/1","grantId":"EP/J010383/1","fundValue":"96230","fundStart":"2012-01-11","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The main outputs of the project were new methods for incremental language processing, and induction from weakly labelled data.

By combining and extending the existing frameworks of Dynamic Syntax (DS) and Type Theory with Records (TTR), this new model can produce meaning representations fully incrementally, and generate language from them in the same way.\n\nThe adaptation and integration of DS and TTR have allowed the framework to work with structured representations of meaning, compatible with current state-of-the-art information-state-based dialogue systems. The use of TTR type relations now allows the generation of natural language sentences from purely semantic meaning representations (rather than linguistically informed trees as in earlier DS frameworks), permitting its use with standard dialogue system managers. The addition of a graph-based representation of the language parsing process and context has also provided a model of the disfluencies and self-repairs common in natural conversation.\n\nThe project also developed a method for learning grammars (specific instantiations within the general framework) from data, allowing researchers to produce incremental semantic grammars for any domain without needing expert linguistic insight. This has been tested by learning a grammar from real adult-child conversation data, simulating the language acquisition process of a child; the grammar learned was then able to interpret unseen data with semantic accuracy of 80%. Dialogue systems (both text- and speech-based) are becoming widely used in industry (telephone answering and routing systems, computer games, web interfaces, mobile phone assistants e.g. Siri). Improvements in the human-like quality of conversation available can be of direct benefit to these applications.\n\nUse of the DYLAN framework and software produced on the RISER project is currently being investigated at Heriot-Watt University within the EU FP7 SpaceBook project building a practical personal spoken dialogue system of this kind.
