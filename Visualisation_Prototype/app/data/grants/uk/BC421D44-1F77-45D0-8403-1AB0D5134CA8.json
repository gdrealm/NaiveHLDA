The survey will be carried out in conjunction with researchers from Chongqing University, and a further aim is to establish a longer-term research collaboration with Chongqing and other Chinese Universities in the field of earthquake risk mitigation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G036365/1","grantId":"EP/G036365/1","fundValue":"15946","fundStart":"2008-10-08","fundEnd":"2009-04-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Hector Ramage","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The M7.9Wenchuan earthquake on May 12th, 2008 was the most destructive in\n\nChina since 1976. The event caused huge damage and loss of life and exposed weaknesses\n\nboth in the formulation and implementation of the regulations governing building in the\n\naffected provinces. Following the earthquake a massive relief and recovery operation was\n\nmounted by the Chinese government. The authors took part in field studies in the affected\n\narea which took place 5 and 11 months after the event, at which time recovery operations were\n\nwell-advanced. The aims of the study were to assess the effects caused by the earthquake\n\nto the built environment and society, to collect information on the ongoing recovery efforts\n\nand future plans, and to demonstrate the use of tools that allow the collection of spatially\n\nreferenced damage and recovery data. Based on available satellite imagery supplemented\n\nby ground observation, geodatabases were constructed containing information on damage\n\nand recovery in several parts of the affected area. The paper gives an overview of the recovery\n\nprocess, describes the methods used to construct these geodatabases, and offers some\n\nanalysis of the data obtained. It is argued that such databases have great potential for the\n\nmanagement of post-disaster recovery and for creating a permanent record of the recovery\n\nprocess. Aid agencies and international donors may find this research and its applications useful This research is important in post-disaster recovery monitoring and evaluation, and has since been put to use in Haiti following the Earthquake there.
