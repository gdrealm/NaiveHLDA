The angiosperm radiation, diversification and rise to dominance occurred over a very short period of geological time. During this radiation the angiosperms to moved away from there ancestral aquatic/ moist habitat to more arid environments. Explaining the underpinng mechanisms behind this event remains one of the key unanswered questions in the palaeobotanical research. \n\nAdvances in our understanding of the genome of living plants shows that many angiosperms may have undergone several episodes of genome duplication (polyploidy) during their history. Duplication of the genome leads to an increase in plant vigour and fitness, when compared to their ancestors. A well known example of this phenomenon is the hybrid vigour of modern crop plants when compared to their wild relatives. Dating of genome duplication events in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana shows one of these events occurred during the initial angiosperms radiation. This suggests that changes in genome size may have played an important role in driving this diversification. However, to date this hypothesis has only been tested using the genome of one extant plant, furthermore no direct measure of the size of the genome of fossil plants exists. Consequently, although fascinating, this idea remains speculative. \n\nRecent work has shown the length of guard cells (specialised cell on the leaf surface that control gas exchange) are a strong positive predictor of genome size of living plants. Leaves have an excellent fossil record and obtaining the length of guard cells from fossil specimens is straight forward. This suggests that guard cell length could be used as a proxy measure of genome size on fossil plants. I plan to use this relationship to test the hypothesis that increase in genome size accompanied the diversification of the early angiosperms. \n\nA suite of experiments are designed to run along side this fossil plant investigation to assess how polyploidy impacts on plant health when grown in drought conditions at elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations relevant to when the angiosperms originated. This work is relevance and importance to the wider scientific community given that a large proportion of crop plant are polyploids.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J004855/1","grantId":"NE/J004855/1","fundValue":"78028","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-01","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Data has been used by academic colleges Environment ","person":"Barry Harvey  Lomax","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" The project has delivered a series of genome estimate for the earliest flowering plants through exploring the relationship between stomatal size and genome size. To achieve this two trips to Texas State University were undertaken to analyse archived samples. Data on fossil plant anatomy (guard cell lengths GCL) was used to determine the genome size of the earliest angiosperms by using the positive relationship between GCL and genome size (GS) previously determined on living plants. This data on the earliest Angiosperms (~120 million years before present) has been supplemented by an extensive literature survey to expand the database on GCL and hence GS to cover the remainder of the Cretaceous. \n\n\n\nThe data is currently being worked up for publication and phylogenetic analysis is currently on-going. This will be completed before the submission of the financial report. Preliminary analysis shows that the earliest angiosperms had a very small genome size when compared to living gymnosperms and the average genome size of living angiosperms. Initial data analysis also suggests an increase in GS accompanied the radiation of the angiosperms. \n\n\n\nAnalysis of the relationships between GCL and GS in living gymnosperms is currently on-going and will be completed before the submission of the financial report. A database of ~90 gymnosperms covering a broad range of families with a known GS has been collected. This database represents approximately 10% of gymnosperm diversity and this data is currently being worked on to determine the relationship between GCL and GS in living gymnosperms. \n\n\n\nExperimental work to determine the functional significance of polyploidy at geologically elevated levels of CO2 relevant to the evolutionary history of angiosperms has shifted from work on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the development of synthetic polyploids to working on natural polyploids of Ranunculus (buttercups) which are a basal living group of angiosperms with a relatively good fossil record stretching back ~125 million years. This research is aimed at understanding the radiation and rise to dominance of the flowering plants. As such the main beneficiary is an academic audience. However there is considerable interest from the wider public in all aspects of fossil record. Data from this project has been communicated to the wider public via the Nottingham branch of the British Science Association (Talk entitled &quot;Where have all the flowers come from?&quot;) \n Data on how ployploidy impacts on plant fitness at elevated CO2 may be of interest to the wider plant science community given that most crop plants are polyploids.
