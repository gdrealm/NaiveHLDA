These molecules could either be lipids or detergent molecules, that were used to isolate the proteins from their membranes. Unfortunately though, it is usually the case that only parts of these molecules are 'seen', due to disorder, and so it is not possible to decide which ones are which. We are going to use a novel method which will allow us to unambiguously resolve this identification issue. We will synthesise heavy atom tagged lipids and detergents and add these to the crystals. The extra X-ray scattering power of these heavy atoms will allow us to clearly distinguish which is which. The results of this study will be very useful in helping to understand the molecular details of how membrane proteins interact with lipids. In many cases these interactions are actually essential for the protein to function correctly. In X-ray crystallography in order to solve 3D structures the diffraction data must be combined with the 'phase' information. These heavy atoms 'tagged' lipids and detergents will be tested to see if they can provide a new general method for 'phasing' diffraction data with crystals of membrane proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E008720/1","grantId":"BB/E008720/1","fundValue":"577946","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard John  Cogdell","coPersons":["Neil William  Isaacs","Pavel  Kocovsky","Andrei  Malkov"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
