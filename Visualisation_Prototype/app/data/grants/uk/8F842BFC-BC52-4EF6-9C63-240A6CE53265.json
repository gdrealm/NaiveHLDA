{"id":"8F842BFC-BC52-4EF6-9C63-240A6CE53265","title":"The evolutionary genomics of sexual recombination","abstractText":"The puzzling predominance of sexual reproduction amongst animals has been repeatedly identified as one of the major outstanding questions in biology and has received an enormous amount of study. Meiotic recombination is one of the fundamental forces of evolution and plays a very significant role in both generating and mixing the genetic diversity present in sexual organisms. Recombination is also suggested to be instrumental in shaping the content of eukaryotic genomes. \n\nHere we propose to study the role of breeding system and recombination in shaping the content and diversity of animal genomes using an exceptionally powerful natural system- the Root Knot Nematodes. We will, for the first time, be able to take a comparative genomic view of radically different reproductive modes in a phylogenetic design. Together these studies will give us a novel and powerful understanding of the role sexual reproduction plays in shaping genome content.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J009423/1","grantId":"NE/J009423/1","fundValue":"212104","fundStart":"2013-02-04","fundEnd":"2016-02-03","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  It is early in our research programme.

We have investigated the origins of this group using genomics. We have shown that some of the key RKN species are double hybrids, with very complex matings between ‘parental’ species. This double hybridisation was likely the origin of highly diverse genomes of the pathogenic RKN. \nIn addition we have begun a program to better characterise the genomes of nematodes more broadly. Our characterisation of transposons, a major component of all genomes, has revealed that the diversity of nematode genomes is best understood by broad sampling of species, and that relying on single species in the past has lead to misleading conclusions. We have three major research directions:\n1. The characterisation of diversity in plant parasitic nematode genomes\n2. Understanding the origins of plant parasitic nematode species\n3. Understanding the way in which reproductive mode influences genome content and diversity\nThe first and second will have direct relevance to understanding and ultimately control of a major global crop threat. The third is a biologically fundamental question, of relevance to all biologists interested in basic questions such as 'what is in a genome and why?' Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
