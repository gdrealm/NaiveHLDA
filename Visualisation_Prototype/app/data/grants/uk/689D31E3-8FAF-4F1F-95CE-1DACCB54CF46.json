For example, Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of late blight on potato and tomato, continues to cause hardship throughout the world with multibillion pound losses each year. In the past decade, the rapid emergence of P. ramorum and P. kernoviae as devastating diseases of many tree and shrub species has brought to attention the economic and ecological significance of broad-host-range pathogens. Importantly, P. capsici, an economically important pathogen of tomato, (chili) pepper and cucurbits (squash, melon etc), has recently caused disease outbreaks on legumes and Fraser fir, and is thus another emerging pathogen with a host range that spans over 20 plant species. The rising demand for sustainable food supplies, coupled with the continued threat of Phytophthora-incited crop losses and environmental damage, require effective measures to protect crop production and the environment. Understanding the molecular processes that Phytophthora spp. employ to promote disease is therefore central to developing durable and sustainable control practices. Cell-biological studies on Phytophthora-host interactions reveal that, in the early infection stages, specialized pathogen structures called haustoria are formed when filamentous hyphae breach the cell wall barrier and interface with the plant cell membrane. Integrity of the penetrated host cell in susceptible plants is not affected, however, suggesting that Phytophthora prevents perception of hyphae as foreign bodies, or suppresses subsequent plant immune responses. It has now been shown that Phytophthora suppresses immune responses through secretion of effector proteins that collectively manipulate host cells. Efforts aimed at understanding effectors have identified RXLR proteins that are secreted at the host-pathogen interface and are translocated into plant cells where they manipulate the host. We propose that an understanding of the molecular components mediating effector delivery will provide key targets for control strategies, as their disruption may prevent disease development. Recently, a new set of intracellular effector proteins was identified. The Crinklers (CRNs) form a large and diverse family of secreted modular proteins that have been identified in a wide range of sequenced oomycete genomes. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that CRN effectors are translocated into plant cells during Phytophthora infection, where they may interfere with cellular processes. Early aims of this work are therefore to define the exact sites of CRN effector secretion during infection, to develop novel approaches to report on and to visualize translocation inside host cells; and to use these assays to determine the amino acids within the N-terminus of CRN effectors that are required for host targeting and translocation. Delivery of effectors to and across the host-pathogen interface must integrate pathogen growth and development with protein secretion and delivery, processes that are likely to require complex protein-protein interactions. A key aim is thus to identify and characterize proteins from pathogen and/or host that physically interact with critical CRN N-terminal amino acids involved in effector delivery. The contribution of these proteins to translocation will be tested by silencing the corresponding genes and investigating effector delivery using the reporter systems developed earlier in the project. For this work, we will use P. capsici which is emerging not only as an increasingly significant pathogen worldwide, but also as a key model oomycete for detailed investigation of basic processes that underpin virulence, due to the availability of its genome sequence combined with the recent development of an efficient and rapid transformation system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I00386X/1","grantId":"BB/I00386X/1","fundValue":"350442","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2014-07-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Gene expression analyses in P. capsici and tomato was performed to assess changes in gene expression in both organisms. This has allowed us to (i) Publish on the interaction on tomato and P. capsici (ii) attract further interest (Syngenta) and investment for studies in P. capsici (BB/J017817/1) gene regulation and has allowed us to characterise the CRN gene family (see publication outputs). \n\nProteomics work funded by this grant has allowed us to generate preliminary data that allowed successful application for an ERC starter grant that is now aiming to further study nuclear (effector) biology.\n\nWe are currently continuing work on the characterisation of CRN HT target genes in plants. we hope to identify factors that are required for translocation in this way and will continue to pursue this line in the future.

We have discovered that when P. capsici infects its host tomato, there is coordinate changes in host and pathogen gene expression that drive infection and disease symptom development (Jupe et al., 2013)\n\n2. We enhanced a CRN identification pipeline and re-annotated CRN proteins from P. capsici. we functionally characterised these which led to the conclusion that (i) CRN proteins are diverse on the sequence level and have diverse functions in plants. Furthermore we showed that CRN coding gene expression is regulated. genes can be divided into two classes based on expression.\n\n3. We have identified candidate translocation components in host plants. Further work however is required to firmly implicate these genes in CRN translocation. this is currently ongoing. We have and will try to take forward our studies on HT factors. we submitted a Marie Curie fellowship grant application based on our preliminary data, but unfortunately, this was not successful. We hope to use the information we now have on CRN candidate HT factors to disrupt translocation in the near future. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy","dataset":"gtr"}
