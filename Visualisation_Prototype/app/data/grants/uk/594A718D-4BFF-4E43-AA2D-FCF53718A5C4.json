Such conditions are typically caused by many different factors (genetic, physiological, behavioural, infectious and environmental), which may be occur at different times of life (including developmental factors as well as those that may occur much later; e.g. cigarette smoking, alcohol, co-morbidity, and treatment). Furthermore the effects may manifest over a range of timescales (immediate to many decades) and time courses (acute, chronic stable, progressive, relapsing/remitting). \n\nVision: The University of Oxford Big Data Institute (BDI) sets out to be an international centre of excellence for the analysis of very large and complex biomedical data sets. The Institute will combine world-class academic leadership with a core infrastructure of cutting-edge technology and high calibre scientists. Built upon Oxford's internationally leading expertise in epidemiology, genomics, imaging, computer science, and infectious disease surveillance, the BDI will be a national resource for the development of new analytical methods to facilitate the generation, storage, analysis and sharing of data in very large clinical studies. This work will provide transformative advances in the speed and range of research into the causes and consequences, prevention and treatment of disease, and will be particularly relevant to understanding the role of genetic and environmental influences on common life-threatening and disabling diseases such as cancer, cardiac disease, stroke, and dementia.\n\nKnowledge Transfer: In addition to primary research, the BDI will play a major role in capacity building through training, dissemination of research methods, and stakeholder engagement:\n- A new MRC Big Data Training Academy will deliver an extensive, flexible and outward-looking portfolio of training and career development opportunities accessible to researchers of all levels within and outside Oxford, including a new doctoral training programme, support for post-doctoral training fellows, visitor and exchange programmes, and a broad range of short courses suitable for graduate training and continuing professional development.\n- Effective collaboration with local, national and international experts (including partnerships with academia, healthcare, and pharmaceutical and IT industries) will enhance the development, evaluation and adoption of new research methods and tools.\n- The Institute will work with regulators and other key stakeholders to develop standards for data storage, sharing and analysis; and to promote appropriate and proportionate regulatory and governance approaches that are fit-for-purpose in areas such as privacy, consent, information security, data access and sharing, intellectual property, and the intersection between research and routine practice.\n- Public engagement activities will promote understanding, address concerns, and develop trust in &quot;Big Data&quot; approaches to biomedical research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L016265/1","grantId":"MR/L016265/1","fundValue":"7000000","fundStart":"2014-05-31","fundEnd":"2019-05-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Donnelly","coPersons":["Martin J Landray","Christopher  Holmes","Rory  Collins","Stephen Mark Smith","Gil  McVean","Jim  Davies"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
