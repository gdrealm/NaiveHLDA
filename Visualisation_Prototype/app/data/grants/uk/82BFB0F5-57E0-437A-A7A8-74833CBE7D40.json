Estimates of standard error should allow for the rotating structure of the repeated survey and allow for the effect of non-response. A rotation means that at each wave, new units are selected to replace old units that have been in the survey for a specified number of waves. For example, rotation is commonly used for Labour Force Surveys. The non-response errors can have a large contribution to the variance. Rotation, non-response, temporal stratification and multilevel structure are common features of many social repeated surveys. With repeated surveys, theoretical results on how to estimate the standard error of a change taking the rotation into account are lacking. This leads to underestimation of the variance, and possibly unreliable conclusion being drawn.</p>\n\n<p>In this project, we propose to improve existing methods used for variance estimation. We will evaluate and compare the properties of the proposed estimators of standard error via theory, simulation and empirical comparison.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G009163/1","grantId":"ES/G009163/1","fundValue":"78334","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Yves Guy Berger","coPersons":["Pedro Luis Nascimento Silva"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
