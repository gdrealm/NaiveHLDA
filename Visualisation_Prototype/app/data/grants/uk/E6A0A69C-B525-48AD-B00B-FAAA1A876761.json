The cells get activated when the body is infected and divide so that they can mount an immune response to eliminate the pathogen. Once the pathogen is gone, the excess pathogen-specific cells die off and the remainder revert to a resting state ready for a subsequent infection with the same pathogen. Occasionally the cells fail to die off and/or fail to rest in which case inflammation and autoimmunity may result. We are trying to understand at the molecular level how the cells move from resting to activated state and back again. A molecule called Caveolin 1 has been shown regulate activation, growth and division of skin cells and endothelial cells and we have recently found this molecule is expressed in T cells. Our research asks how Caveolin influences the activation and regulation of T cells so that we can better understand these processes. With this knowledge we can devise strategies for influencing T cell activation which has impact for vaccination strategies and the control of autoimmune disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100116","grantId":"G1100116","fundValue":"542978","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rose  Zamoyska","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
