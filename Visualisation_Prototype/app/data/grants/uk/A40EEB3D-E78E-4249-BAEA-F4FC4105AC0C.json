{"id":"A40EEB3D-E78E-4249-BAEA-F4FC4105AC0C","title":"The Logic of Analogy by Structural Similarity","abstractText":"Traditionally the Western conception of reasoning has been dominated by ideas originating with the ancient Greeks, the identification of consequence being the transfer of truth, with conclusions logically inheriting truth from premises. Eastern logics however, and much of our own everyday reasoning, commonly appeal to analogy by structural similarity and the transfer not of truth but merely of qualified belief. \nFor example if I know that my 10 year old nephew enjoyed a Christmas party in the local swimming pool I might recommend this possibility to a colleague who wishes to arrange a birthday party for her 9 year old daughter.\n\nWhilst such reasoning is clearly not foolproof, recent results of the PI, proposed RA and A.Hill, have shown that one can supply a solid theoretical foundation for the RATIONALITY of reasoning by such analogical similarity within the framework of Pure Inductive Logic. These results suggest three further questions: What are the boundaries on analogy by structural similarity as a rationally justified mode of reasoning? Can we develop a logic of analogical reasoning by structural similarity? To what extent can the roles be reversed and Western, Aristotelian, Logic be explained as derived from this alternative logic of analogy? \n\nThese are the main questions that the proposed research intends to pursue.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L023989/1","grantId":"EP/L023989/1","fundValue":"301846","fundStart":"2014-08-30","fundEnd":"2017-08-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeff  Paris","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
