It is clear that the precise carbohydrate structure attached to a glycoprotein peptide backbone can have a crucial biological role. The project aims to access a range of enzymes which are known to specifically cleave N-glycan structures from glycoproteins, and by using basic molecular biology techniques to create a variety of efficient catalysts which will allow the synthesis of particular defined glycoprotein structures. This is a particularly important area of research as glycoproteins are expressed as heterogeneous mixtures of structures, which are very difficult to separate, and so delineation of the role of particular carbohydrate structures on protein function is non-trivial. For example many glycoprotein therapeutics are currently administered as complex mixtures in which only a small fraction of the active material is present, or which contain particular carbohydrate structures which may result in toxic side effects. The project requires expertise in both molecular biology and synthetic carbohydrate chemistry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D009251/1","grantId":"BB/D009251/1","fundValue":"247357","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Antony John Fairbanks","coPersons":["Neil  Bruce","James William Moir"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
