It begins by deriving a rudimentary model of Pompeian society from recent research on its housing. It then modifies this to provide social models, first, for Pauline churches in general, then for mid-first-century apartment-churches in Rome. Four methods are used to test this model as an interpretative tool for studying Paul's letter: consideration of issues in relation to social diversity among the hearers; contextualisation of identity language about holiness, and consideration of the relationship of this to holiness in the letter's theology; contextualisation of moral exhortations; contextualisation of rhetoric on unity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F013191/1","grantId":"AH/F013191/1","fundValue":"20214","fundStart":"2008-09-25","fundEnd":"2009-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Oakes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
