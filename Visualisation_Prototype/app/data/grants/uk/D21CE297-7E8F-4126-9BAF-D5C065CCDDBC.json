Less appreciated is the fact that each of the individual DNA molecules that are a crucial part of our chromosomes must be folded in space in a manner that enables them to fit within the nucleus, be transcribed under control of distant regulatory elements, be replicated and repaired, and in the case of sister DNAs be segregated to opposite sides of the cell during mitosis. The past decade has witnessed the discovery of a set of related molecular machines concerned exclusively with regulating chromosome topology. At the heart of these machines are a pair of rod-shaped Smc proteins whose association creates V shaped molecules whose vertices are connected by a third subunit called kleisin, forming a gigantic tripartite ring. While topo-isomerases alter the supercoiling or inter-catenation of DNAs, they cannot physically tie them together or organize them in space. This seems to be the function of Smc/kleisin ring complexes. Because they also regulate chromosome morphology in eu- and arche-bacteria, Smc/kleisin complexes are amongst the most conserved molecular machines concerned with controlling the physics and chemistry of DNA. Work on the cohesin complex suggests that its triparatite rings hold DNAs together by entrapping them. If true, it is likely that the condensin complex uses a similar principle. The long term goal of our research is to elucidate the mechanism by which cohesin rings entrap and subsequently release DNAs. This goal cannot be achieved without knowing more about the structure of cohesin's subunits and how they interact, which is the more immediate aim of this proposal. There are few if any aspects of chromosome biology that would not benefit from a better understanding of how Smc/kleisin complexes function at a molecular level. More specifically, cohesin dysfunction during meiosis in oocytes has been implicated in the genesis of aneuploidy, which in addition to causing Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) is the leading cause of age-related infertility. Meanwhile, defects in the loading of cohesin onto chromosomes is thought to be the cause of Cornelia de Lange syndrome, a genetic disease associated with multi-system developmental defects. Genomic instability due to replication, repair, or segregation defects plays an important part during the genesis of many tumours. Cohesin has roles in all three of these fundamental processes and mutations affecting cohesin are frequently identified in tumours. Our work will therefore have important biomedical implications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L018047/1","grantId":"MR/L018047/1","fundValue":"316670","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kim  Nasmyth","coPersons":["Jan  Lowe"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
