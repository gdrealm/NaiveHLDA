{"id":"E01F246C-B5A9-42AF-9E5A-4597AF41C415","title":"Small is Beautiful","abstractText":"The aim of the this project is to introduce the concept of &quot;small is beautiful&quot; into a conservative relatively low technology manufacturing sector where the &quot;economies of scale&quot; argument has been used for the last decade to build ever more so-called efficient process lines. This will be a major challenge. The new philosophy, &quot;small is beautiful&quot;, starts by encouraging the use of high quality feedstock, only melting what is required and only when it is required. Recycling of internal scrap is not necessarily acceptable but an aim for higher yields is. Applying counter gravity casting methods to improve yield and give enhanced quality is encouraged as is the recovery low grade heat from solidification.\nThe project will achieve this by the development of a software tool incorporating a new philosophy/methodology and metric for the handling of materials and energy throughout the process in foundries using computer numerical process simulation to support the decision making. The project would also look at the full energy chain from charge materials through to waste heat and energy in the process and identify the opportunities for scavenging waste heat and the costs associated with the whole process. This will therefore enable cost/benefit analysis to be undertaken so that companies will be able to make informed decisions about design, material and process at a very early stage.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M013863/1","grantId":"EP/M013863/1","fundValue":"233012","fundStart":"2015-03-27","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Jolly","coPersons":["Fiona  Charnley","Peter David Ball","Konstantinos  Salonitis"],"organisation":"Cranfield University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
