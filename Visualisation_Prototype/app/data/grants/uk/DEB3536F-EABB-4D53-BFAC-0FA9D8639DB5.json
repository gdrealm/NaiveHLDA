For this reason it is widely considered to have made a significant contribution to the evolutionary success of the flowering plants. SI utilizes cell-cell recognition to prevent self-fertilization. This involves a highly specific interaction between a pistil expressed protein and a cognate pollen component that results in recognition and inhibition of self- (incompatible), but not cross- pollen. In poppy, the female part of the flower (pistil) secretes a protein (PrsS) which acts as a signalling 'ligand'. This interacts specifically with a 'self' pollen receptor (PrpS), allowing pollen to distinguish between 'self' and 'non-self' partners, through interactions analogous to a lock and key mechanism. This interaction is the critical step in determining cell-cell recognition and rejection, so the nature of the pollen S-component is of considerable interest. We know a lot about the signals and events triggered by the interaction, but only recently identified the 'missing' crucial component: the pollen S-receptor, named PrpS. SI provides an excellent model system to investigate the molecular basis of cell-cell recognition and intracellular signalling in plant cells for many reasons. The nature of S allele specificity at a highly polymorphic S-locus, containing ~60 alleles, is of considerable general interest to population and evolutionary biologists. SI systems are comparable to the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with respect to the level of their polymorphism. How allele specificity is encoded, and how pollen and pistil components co-evolved, are long-standing questions. Moreover, receptor-ligand interactions in plants are poorly understood. Despite genomic studies revealing the existence of several hundred putative transmembrane receptors, their biological function and, in particular, the nature of the ligands with which they interact, remains largely unknown with the exception of a few examples. Our identification of PrpS provides a system where we know a lot about the signalling network and events triggered by the interaction; now we have both ligand and receptor this opens up the field for studies in this area. And as PrpS is a novel protein, its nature is of interest in its own right. Finally, on a practical and applied note, an understanding of SI could help plant breeders develop F1 hybrids more efficiently and economically than currently. Thus we could potentially not only understand basic processes involved in plant cells, but also perhaps eventually exploit these systems. Thus, one of the attractions of studying SI is the possibility of transferring S locus genes to non-SI species to create a functional SI system. This could be of immense benefit to plant breeders in the production of F1 hybrids. Preliminary data arising from BBSRC-funded studies involving transferring the SI system to the model plant, Arabidopsis. This has provided the first experimental evidence indicating this is possible, indicating that the transferred Papaver SI system is functional in other species. This discovery has been filed for a patent. We anticipate that plant breeders will be extremely excited and interested in this technology. Currently plant breeders have had to use hand-emasculation to produce F1 hybrids, which is very tedious, time-consuming and expensive, as it involves a lot of labour costs. If a crop species is self-incompatible it can be crossed without any emasculation, as no self-pollen can fertilize these plants. Thus, all crosses will result in cross seed. Excitingly, a company is interested in marketing our poppy PrpS-PrsS SI system as a useful tool for plant breeders to make improved crops.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H012133/1","grantId":"BB/H012133/1","fundValue":"416339","fundStart":"2010-07-20","fundEnd":"2014-07-19","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vernonica E.
