If we are to reverse the increasing number of new cases and the rise of cases unable to be treated with the standard drugs we need new drugs and vaccines. The clinical studies in which drugs are tested are time consuming to perform because the treatment of tuberculosis takes a long time and patients may relapse for at least a year after they have finished their drugs. In addition large numbers of patients are required to provide a convincing result. \n\nIn the past few years a number of new potential drugs for tuberculosis have been discovered and in order for these to be developed into medicines that can be used in the clinic soon it will be necessary to find new and quicker ways of testing them safely. A biomarker is a measure of a response to treatment which permits a reliable result to be predicted and this reduces the time taken to perform studies and the number of patients required in clinical trials. In this study we will use an international clinical study of tuberculosis treatment that we are performing to test potential biomarkers. These are different ways of measuring the burden of bacteria in the patient?s body and the patient?s immune response to the invading bacteria. Thus, we expect that this study will result in better ways to measure the response to treatment that will be used in all future clinical trials and will prove useful to health care workers treating tuberculosis across the world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601466","grantId":"G0601466","fundValue":"710936","fundStart":"2007-11-12","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Henry Gillespie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
