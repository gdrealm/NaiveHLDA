{"id":"1D867015-6446-4887-ACC0-6A19B1BAFE8D","title":"Galaxy feedback throughout the cosmic epochs: An extensive observational investigation","abstractText":"Feedback, associated with both star formation and black hole accretion, is\ninvoked by any theoretical model of galaxy evolution to suppress star formation\nin galaxies across the cosmic epochs. The energy injected into the\ninterstellar, or intracluster medium, by supernovae or by Active Galactic\nNuclei is expected to expel or heat the gas, therefore reducing the efficiency\nof star formation and, in the most extreme cases, abruptly quenching star\nformation. This process is thought to account for the very small fraction (5%)\nof baryons converted into stars in the local Universe, as well as for several\nof the fundamental properties of local galaxies (e.g. stellar populations, gas\ncontent, mass function). Observational evidence for prominent outflows driven\nby starbursts and quasars has been obtained in the past, and the PI of this\nproposal has contributed to some of the most recent seminal discoveries in this\nfield.\nHowever, these observations are still far from proving the numerous theoretical\nmodels invoking feedback. So far, the observational investigation, both in\nlocal and high-z galaxies, has been limited to a handful of objects and to a\nfew feedback tracers, which are generally unable to capture the complexity of\nthis mechanism and its impact on galaxy evolution. We propose to exploit\nextensive (new and archival) multi-wavelength observational data to investigate\nthe impact of star formation and AGN feedback on galaxy evolution and, in\nparticular, test cosmological models invoking feedback to explain the\nproperties of galaxies over the cosmic epochs. By using some of the major\nobserving facilities and extensive data sets, this project will allow a detailed\ncharacterization of galactic outflows, will identify the different feedback\nmechanisms in different classes of sources at different redshifts, and will\nreveal whether these processes are actually suppressing star formation in\ngalaxies, with the efficiency and timescales expected by models, or not.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K003119/1","grantId":"ST/K003119/1","fundValue":"342318","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The findings of this grant have been used by models of galaxy evolution and to plan new observing campaign and new observing facilities.
