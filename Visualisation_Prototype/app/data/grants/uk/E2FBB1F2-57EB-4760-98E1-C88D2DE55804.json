The Centre's administrative functions are co-located at Imperial College, UCL and the University of Leeds; the research projects are open to all leading UK university departments. </p>\n\n<p>The first phase of the research programme comprises major studies on the impacts of transport investment on labour markets and on agglomeration economies; the consequences of IT developments across the economy on future demand for transport; and the effects of new governance structures on policy formulation and implementation. Five shorter scanning exercises cover areas such as health, social impacts and climate change; DfT is also funding short-term analyses through UKTRC from its consultancy budgets.&nbsp; The Centre has funds to support a further series of projects to commence around two years after launch, and will actively be seeking additional funding.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G033404/1","grantId":"ES/G033404/1","fundValue":"5119730","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John William Polak","coPersons":["Peter Malcolm Jones","Roger  Mackett","Gregory Richard Marsden","Peter John Mackie"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
