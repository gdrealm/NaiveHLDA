It will potentially provide very practical evidence for both health professionals and the general public about who is at risk - and who is not at risk - for one of the commonest conditions experienced in the general population. Applying this evidence in clinical practice could then potentially make a difference in the management for millions of people, and help in the understanding of both rare outcomes, risk management, and the importance of preserving the precious resource of antibiotics. In the UK alone the clinical rule can potentially be used in 6 million face to face consultations a year , and a similar number of consultation with NHS direct each year for URTIs ? and thus provide an excellent vehicle for the public understanding of and engagement with science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500977","grantId":"G0500977","fundValue":"773102","fundStart":"2006-08-07","fundEnd":"2010-02-06","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Little","coPersons":["Frederick David Hobbs","Alastair  Hay","Ian George Williamson","Mark  Mullee","Michael  Moore","David  Mant","Brendan  Delaney","John  Campbell","Christopher C Butler"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
