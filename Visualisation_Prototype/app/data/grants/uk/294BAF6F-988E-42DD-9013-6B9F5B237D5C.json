A further application is in the ensuring that scrap metal is free from radioactive contamination before melting. Existing neutron detectors utilize helium-3 proportional tubes. Helium-3 is no longer available due \nto an international shortage followed by a ban on further usage for this application. The proposed detectors are intended as a low cost replacement for helium-3 proportional tubes. They use natural boron compounds in forms manufactured for other industrial uses. A general approach of using only materials easily and cheaply available has been taken with the intention that the design is immune from future market shortages or reliance on specific suppliers. Prototype detectors exist and it is the aim of this project to explore their operational characteristics in realistic harsh environments. The designs will be enlarged and considerable effort spent on developing and improving the fabrication of detector components. Pre-manufacturing prototypes will be assessed and calibrated by internationally approved validation laboratories. It is intended that at the end of the project, a mass produceable version of the design will be available for the partner to manufacture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K000179/1","grantId":"ST/K000179/1","fundValue":"195279","fundStart":"2013-01-14","fundEnd":"2015-07-12","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"John Eric McMillan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
