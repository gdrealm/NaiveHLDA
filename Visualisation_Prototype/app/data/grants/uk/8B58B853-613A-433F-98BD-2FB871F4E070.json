Santos","abstractText":"In seeking a deeper understanding of Einstein's theory of general relativity, it is important to clarify the physical interpretation of certain families of exact solutions which represent cylindrically or axially symmetric space-times. Three cases will be investigated: (1) A vacuum cylindrically symmetric space-time with differential rotation or translation. (2) A family of singular stationary axially symmetric space-times that includes the Schwarzschild space-time in a particular limit. (3) A compound space-time for which the interior is a cylinder of rotating fluid described by the Godel solution, and the exterior contains a negative cosmological constant. In all cases, the aim of the project is to investigate the physical properties of these families of solutions and the meaning of the parameters they contain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F068271/1","grantId":"EP/F068271/1","fundValue":"16406","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jerry  Griffiths","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
