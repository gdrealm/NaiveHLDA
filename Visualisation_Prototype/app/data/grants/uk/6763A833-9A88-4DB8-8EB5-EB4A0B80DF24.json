{"id":"6763A833-9A88-4DB8-8EB5-EB4A0B80DF24","title":"Flat panel technology for XFEL","abstractText":"Recent experience with assembling our existing Xchip for a high volume scanning application has demonstrated the ability to 'TAB' (Tape Automated Bonding) our ASICs to kapton interconnect ~50microns thick. Using this approach a number of MCMD solutions have been considered. In one possible arrangement the IO signalling of the readout ASIC are TAB connected to a kapton strip extension from the readout PCB. The ASICs are then tested as the module is assembled prior to sensor bonding. The sensor then connects using a relatively thick interconnect method / e.g. stacks of gold balls for small volume or indium for larger volumes etc. Alternatives where the sensor connections are tabbed directly to kapton ribbons to rows of pads on the ASIC are also being considered. These approaches are considered quite novel by the designers and is something that we wish to decouple from the critical path / hence we have included it as a 'proof of concept' development rather than rely on it for the delivery of our complete prototype. Note that this scheme still uses the same ASIC design, it is simply reversed (rotated 180 degrees) so that it is completely 'behind' the sensor.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G000948/1","grantId":"ST/G000948/1","fundValue":"309691","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Valentine  O'Shea","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
