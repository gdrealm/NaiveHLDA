{"id":"3AC2109F-C238-41D8-BADD-E4FFDBC27BFC","title":"Liver-directed non-viral gene therapy for Wilson s disease","abstractText":"Gene therapy is a novel and powerful approach to healthcare. Many \ninherited disorders will be cured by providing a normal copy of the \ndefective gene. Gene therapy also has potential for treating complex conditions, e.g. chronic viral infections and autoimmune diseases.\n\nBasic research must provide efficient and safe gene delivery techniques, \nand gene constructs which enable life-long expression of the therapeutic gene. \n\nThis project involves Wilson’s disease, a hereditary disorder of copper metabolism. Patients are unable to excrete copper into bile, with con-\nsequent copper accumulation in the liver, and liver disease. The LEC \nrat has a disorder identical to Wilson’s disease, due to a spontaneous mutation in the same gene as patients.\n\nThis project aims to define DNA constructs which will provide long-term expression of the Wilson’s gene in the livers of LEC rats. The effects of replacing the defective gene, especially normalisation of copper meta-\nbolism and progression of liver scarring, will be carefully monitored.\n\nThis work would represent a major step forward towards the cure of Wilson’s disease, and act as a prototype for gene therapy of many other single gene disorders of the liver. It would also define gene therapy systems capable of broad application in liver disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400866","grantId":"G0400866","fundValue":"314194","fundStart":"2005-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John William Fabre","coPersons":["Helen  Collins","Bernard  Portman","Hans-Joachim  Lipps","Michael  Antoniou"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
