Dark matter accounts for 85% of the mass of the Universe yet we do not know what it is since it has never been observed, and although we do know neutrinos have mass we do not know precisely how much nor if they are their own anti-particles. If they are it could explain the tiny imbalance between matter and antimatter shortly after the Big Bang. These questions have profound impact on our understanding of the Universe and its evolution - answering them is amongst the highest priorities in science.\n\nExperiments that hope to observe dark matter particle interactions or neutrinoless double beta decay events that will tell us about the neutrino share a common requirement. Since both of these processes are extremely rare the detectors need to be shielded from all sources of background radiation that might mask the signal. The first line of defence is to place the detectors deep underground in mines or under mountains - this reduces the rate of cosmic rays from space that bombard the surface of the Earth. Next the detectors are surrounded with copper, lead, plastics and water to block the radiation emitted by the underground rock. Although this is natural low-level radiation that causes no harm to humans, it is catastrophic for our extremely sensitive rare-event searches! The final and most difficult step is to construct the detectors themselves from only the purest materials that are exceptionally 'clean' in terms of trace contaminants that may emit radiation.\n\nThe UK has a very strong track record and international standing in rare-event underground physics, going back several decades, and we continue to take leading roles in the most advanced experiments. We now stand on the edge of discovery with the next generation of dark matter and neutrino experiments. Unfortunately, here in the UK, our capability to screen materials to check their radio-purity before using them to build detectors is no longer sufficient. As detectors have become ever more sensitive, so has the requirement for the materials to be ever cleaner and free from even the smallest amount of radiation. Whereas previously we could rely on a germanium detector located at the Boulby Underground Laboratory to perform our screenings, it can no longer keep up with the sensitivity requirements of the dark matter and neutrino-less double beta decay experiments. This is doubly problematic because in addition to vetting material before accepting it in detector construction, we must also understand precisely the amount of radiation expected from each and every component. Only if we know what we expect from all of these materials can we hope to observe an excess and claim discovery of an exceptional signal. Very few facilities exist worldwide with germanium detectors with sufficient sensitivity to satisfy these needs.\n\nWe will install a new facility at Boulby with a state-of-the art germanium detector that will be used by 15 institutes across the UK in their low background screening campaigns for the leading dark matter and neutrino-less double beta decay experiments. With this much needed capability to deliver amongst the world's most sensitive material screening tests, the Boulby facility will be reinstated as a leader in the field, and we will be able to construct the next generation of experiments that will help unravel the mysteries of the Universe.\n\nSuch a facility would be very useful to a wide variety of applications well beyond particle physics and cosmology. It would significantly improve environmental radioactivity studies already in progress at Boulby, and would provide capability for studying the climate with aerosol growth and cloud formation, and next generation electronics. Internationally there is an industrial and commercial demand for such instruments with the sensitivity we would provide.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L003228/1","grantId":"ST/L003228/1","fundValue":"85565","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Chamkaur  Ghag","coPersons":["Ruben  Saakyan"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
