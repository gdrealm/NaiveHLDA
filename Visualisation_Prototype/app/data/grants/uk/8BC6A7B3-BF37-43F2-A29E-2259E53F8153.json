{"id":"8BC6A7B3-BF37-43F2-A29E-2259E53F8153","title":"Supergen Marine - Core","abstractText":"The UK Engineering and Physical Science Council (EPSRC) funded research consortium, Supergen Marine (1), which consisted of the University of Edinburgh; Heriot-Watt University; The University of Lancaster; The University of Strathclyde and the Robert Gordon University, has, since October 2003, been undertaking cutting edge research in support of the developing marine renewables industry. The consortium, which has been modified to include The Queen's University Belfast and the move of key members of the Robert Gordon University Marine Energy Group to the University of Edinburgh, is now bidding for continued support from the research council. The aims of the original Supergen marine research programme primarily related to enhancing understanding of the location, extent and characteristics of the marine energy resources. This was on a 3-10 year horizon, and is still valid. However, research priorities have evolved to recognise experiences and questions arising from early tests, the deployment of prototype devices and the outcomes of the original work programme. The overall aim, while still generic, has evolved and is now directed, in the revised research programme, towards increasing understanding of the device-sea interactions of energy converters from model-scale in the laboratory to full size in the open sea. The programme includes work on: device arrays and how these will influence local and regional environmental conditions; radical design approaches, which take into account new philosophies of design guidance; ensuring that numerical and physical design support is consistent and robust; the challenges posed by design in mixed tidal and wave environments; system control in complex non linear and evolving environments; the complex challenges posed by fixing, mooring and recovery of marine systems; the economic challenges posed by the variable and intermittent nature of the marine resource; the sparse information available to predict and assess the long term reliability of marine energy systems and how an increased understanding of all of these issues can be best disseminated within the stakeholder community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E040136/1","grantId":"EP/E040136/1","fundValue":"5453300","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings of this project have influenced policy, standards, regulation and practice in the marine energy sector.
