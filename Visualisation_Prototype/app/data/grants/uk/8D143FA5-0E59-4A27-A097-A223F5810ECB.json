","person":"David  Colclough","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" The research was directed towards the production of a critical edition of one of Francis Bacon's (1561-1626) last works: the utopian fable New Atlantis. This is the first scholarly edition of the work since the nineteenth century, and the first to be produced in line with modern bibliographical standards. As well as providing an accurate text of the work, and noting textual variants, it contains a lengthy general introduction, an account of the book as a material object and of its passage through the printing house, and extensive commentaries which trace Bacon's allusions and sources, gloss unfamiliar or archaic words, and supply cross-references to the work which was published alongside New Atlantis: Sylva Sylvarum. My research on the edition established closer links between these two than have hitherto been acknowledged, both in terms of content and of print history. As well as explaining the text's place in Bacon's wider scientific projects, it engages with traditions of scholarship that have treated it as part of the utopian genre. It thus both sets a new standard for the textual state of New Atlantis (in common with the approach taken by volumes in the Oxford Francis Bacon) and provides resources for further study of this work, of Bacon's works more generally, and of early modern scientific prose. (1) By drawing on the approach to textual bibliography and the analysis of an early printed book's passage through a printing house\n(2) By developing more extensive historical or critical interpretations of this text, or of other texts by Bacon\n(3) By using its findings (at textual or interpretive levels) for research at UG, PGT, or PGR level.
