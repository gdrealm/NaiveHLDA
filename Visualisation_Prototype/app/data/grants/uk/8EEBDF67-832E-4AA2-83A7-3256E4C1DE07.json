{"id":"8EEBDF67-832E-4AA2-83A7-3256E4C1DE07","title":"Layered Extrusion of Metal Alloys (LEMA)","abstractText":"Additive Manufacturing technologies are viewed as viable alternatives to conventional manufacturing processes, capable of creating geometrically efficient structures with low material waste. Commercial laser and electron beam metallic Additive Manufacturing systems are increasingly being used in high value aerospace and medical industries to directly manufacture metallic end-use parts. To manufacture components with full densities, these processes must completely melt the feedstock material, this subsequently generates large thermal stresses within formed components. Further to this, the hardware used within these high power laser/electron systems are inherently expensive and energy inefficient. This creates technical challenges and economic barriers that subsequently restrict new markets and industries from embracing this highly promising and disruptive manufacturing technology.\n\nThis proposal will develop a novel low thermal stress inducing, low cost metallic Additive Manufacturing process, Layered Extrusion of engineering Metal Alloys (LEMA). A specially created metallic feedstock will be extruded using a developed system designed to create layered 3D structures. A combination of unique feedstock chemistry and careful process control will allow efficient deposition of materials with a reduction in thermal gradients compared to conventional laser/electron based Additive Manufacturing systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M022218/1","grantId":"EP/M022218/1","fundValue":"98456","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kamran  MUMTAZ","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
