{"id":"BB0F97AD-AEF2-43B2-A4EC-58CE967D72BE","title":"Sustainable Carbon Counters","abstractText":"<p>The objective of this project is to use expertise from Computer Science, Economics, Carbon Profiling and Sociology to develop a sustainable mobile phone application to facilitate the empirical exploration of everyday activities - especially food shopping - surrounding carbon emissions (particularly, food choices) and thereby provide opportunities to impact on individual and family choice to reduce our carbon footprint. There is currently a lack of robust tools and data about the carbon impact of our lifestyles and more widely available generic knowledge is often hard to apply to the specifics of our own lives.</p>\n\n<p>Our intention is to develop a mobile app that tracks user choice to build a `rich profile' of the impact of their lives in terms of carbon externality which can also be deployed for identifying and informing users of `critical moments that have impact' -acting as both a 'technology probe' to engage users in a dialogue to raise awareness and offer resources for understanding their carbon profile; and as a form of 'nudge' to facilitate informed choice.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J009989/1","grantId":"ES/J009989/1","fundValue":"39414","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Francis Rouncefield","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
