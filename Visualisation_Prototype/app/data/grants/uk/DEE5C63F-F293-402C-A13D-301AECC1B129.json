{"id":"DEE5C63F-F293-402C-A13D-301AECC1B129","title":"The Controlled Synthesis of Nanostructured Polymers Using Molecular Machines","abstractText":"Nature makes extensive use of co-polymers to create well-defined nanostructures. These polymers such as proteins and nucleic acid are produced, manipulated and maintained by complex but highly efficient molecular machines. Mankind too\nhas begun to take advantage of the self-assembly properties of co-polymers to produce nanostructures and these are now beginning to find applications in health care, and the electronics and energy industries. However, our ability to make\nnanostructured polymers lags significantly behind natural systems.\n\nGiven the significant benefits nature has found in using molecular machines to produce nanostructured co-polymers it seems reasonable to suggest that we could do the same for non-natural materials. Here we propose a simple molecular\nmachine that does just that: it uses controlled molecular motion to measure the length of a growing polymer chain and produce blocks of monomers of a fixed length (L). By application of external stimuli (light, pH) it can be operated repetitively to produce multiple blocks of length L with a variety of monomers in order to build up a nanostructured polymer with extremely well defined features and properties.\n\nEach molecular machine can be used to make multiple copies of the product in much the same way as biological machines make multiple copies of their target. Further, as the machine control is provided by external stimuli and addition of\nmonomers, a single generic device can be used to make many different products simply by varying the monomers provided. These factors combine to make the proposed machine potentially applicable to real-world problems and suggests\nthey may find industrial applications.\n\nOur unusual, bio-inspired approach to polymer synthesis will revolutionize access to nanostructured block co-polymers and could thus prove transformative across a range of nanotechnology applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L016621/2","grantId":"EP/L016621/2","fundValue":"167342","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Michael Goldup","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
