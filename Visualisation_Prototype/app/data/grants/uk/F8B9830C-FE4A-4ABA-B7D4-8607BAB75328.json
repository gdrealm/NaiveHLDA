{"id":"F8B9830C-FE4A-4ABA-B7D4-8607BAB75328","title":"Nonlinear hydroelastic waves with applications to ice sheets","abstractText":"Free boundary problems are challenging mathematical problems which involve solving nonlinear problems in domains whose shapes have to be found as part of the solution. They occur in many industrial, environmental and biological applications. Examples are coating problems, ocean waves and tumors. In this proposal we concentrate on hydroelastic waves and in particular on applications to ice sheets. The research is motivated by the understanding of man-made large floating structures (especially airports) and by Antarctic exploration where often heavy equipment will travel over roads on floating ice and aircraft will operate on floating ice-sheet runways. Waves under ice sheets have also recently attracted attention because they are one of the many factors that need to be considered as having an impact in climate change. \nThe mathematical formulation of hydroelastic waves involve complicated systems of nonlinear integro-differential equations for which most studies have been restricted to linear models. Although linear approximations are often adequate, there are many situations in which nonlinearities and large defections of the ice sheet cannot be neglected. Therefore we propose to develop fully nonlinear numerical theories and weakly nonlinear asymptotic models to tackle these problems. Solitary waves, dark solitons, internal waves and three dimensional waves are among the topics to be studied. The previous experience of the PI, CIs and visiting researcher with nonlinear waves will be very instrumental for the success of the project. \n\nThe intended RA is Dr Leonardo Xavier Epsin. His strong background in modelling, asymptotics and numerical simulations\nmakes him very well suited to work on the proposed problems. In case he were not able to take the position, other qualified candidates are known to the Pi and CIs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J019321/1","grantId":"EP/J019321/1","fundValue":"53722","fundStart":"2012-11-12","fundEnd":"2016-05-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have greatly expanded fundamental knowledge on nonlinear hydroelastic waves. These waves model, for example, ocean waves travelling under a floating ice layer and our work therefore has implications into the dynamics and breakup of floating ice sheets.  ","person":"Paul Antoine Milewski","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":" Some of our main discoveries are (1) The depth of the fluid has a large impact on the nonlinear behaviour of the waves. Localised travelling waves can be found in shallow water at any amplitude but in deep water only large waves exist. (2) The waves can be violently unstable and nonlinearly self-focus in some situations. In the ice-sheet application, this would lead to a violent breakup of the ice. (3) The waves can be coupled with internal waves due to density differences in the fluid below. This has applications to detecting internal waves in polar regions. The findings can be taken forward by oceanographers and incorporated into models for ice sheets in the ocean. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
