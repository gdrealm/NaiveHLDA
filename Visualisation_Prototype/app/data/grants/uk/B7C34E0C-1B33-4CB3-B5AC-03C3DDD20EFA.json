{"id":"B7C34E0C-1B33-4CB3-B5AC-03C3DDD20EFA","title":"Life After Crime and Punishment: Developing Theories, Connecting to Practice","abstractText":"<p>There is on-going research within criminology about the effectiveness of various criminal justice interventions (such as custodial sentences or the numerous community-based punishments). A similar strand of research has explored why it is that people stop offending without help from official agencies. Whilst some work has attempted to integrate these bodies of research, there has been little systematic consideration of how these two bodies of work can be used to inform both specific interventions and strategic approaches to the reform of those found guilty of criminal offences.</p> \n<p>The aim of the seminar series, therefore, is to create a forum in which discussions about how best to facilitate the reform and reintegration of ex-offenders into the community following punishment can be held. This, naturally, will include an evaluation of radical approaches to the topic at hand, including, for example, decarceration policies.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4078","grantId":"RES-451-25-4078","fundValue":"9036","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Farrall","coPersons":["Shadd  Maruna","Richard  Sparks","Mike  Hough"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
