An understanding of the detailed functioning of bacterial cells is critical if we are to control them and manipulate them to our advantage. Microscopes are a crucial component of the range of experimental tools that we used to study bacteria. Because the cells are extremely small we need exceptionally high sensitivity and magnification to be able to resolve details of their structure. The purpose of this proposal is to provide the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology, which is one of the premier sites for research on the fundamentals of bacterial cells, with advanced imaging equipment. The new instruments will allow us to look more deeply than ever before into these tiny cells and understand the mechanisms that take place inside them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F01127X/1","grantId":"BB/F01127X/1","fundValue":"240133","fundStart":"2008-03-31","fundEnd":"2009-03-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeffery  Errington","coPersons":["Kenn  Gerdes","Richard Adrian Daniel","Phillip  Aldridge","Leendert  Hamoen"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
