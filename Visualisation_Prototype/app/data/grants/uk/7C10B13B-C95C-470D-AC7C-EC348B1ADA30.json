For over 80 years, the Earth's core has been considered to consist of an iron-nickel alloy; more recently it has been suggested that it must also contain a few percent of light alloying elements such as silicon or sulphur. The pressure range in the core is ~135","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H003541/1","grantId":"NE/H003541/1","fundValue":"15876","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Walter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" Earth core is predominantly composed of iron. However, based on cosmochemical arguments it likely contains about 5% Ni, and this can have important implications for its physical and chemical properties. In this project we have determined the effects of Ni on the phase equilibria, equations of state, and melting curves of Ni and Ni alloys in order to develop an understanding of the end member Ni alloys, so that the data can be incorporated into models for Earth's core. Through utilization of published outputs. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
