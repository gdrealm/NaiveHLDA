{"id":"F139E441-27D3-483A-A4C7-33CEE98BD68E","title":"Artists' Moving Image Research Network","abstractText":"The moving image medium has become ubiquitous in contemporary art. It is difficult nowadays to find an exhibition or art event that does not, in some way, feature moving images. Although artists have been making films at least since the 1920s, the medium was long considered marginal relative to painting and sculpture. What is new in contemporary art is the predominance of dynamic screen-based media, often eclipsing by scale and degree more traditional forms in the gallery. \\n\\nRecent works, in combination with historical precedents, now constitute such a large body of practice as to deserve extensive study. The Artists' Moving Image Research Network will examine this proliferation of screen art and lay the groundwork for the launch of MIRAJ: Moving Image Research &amp; Art Journal, the world's first peer-reviewed publication on the subject. \\n\\nThe network gathers together an international and cross-generational group of leading theorists, artists, curators and archivists to discuss pressing questions that will go forward for elaboration in the pages of MIRAJ, and thus set the terms of debate. Meetings held across two years will be devoted to raising key questions: How can we account for the explosion of screen-based works? How do the contemporary works relate to historical precedents? In what ways do artists' works replicate the ubiquitous spectacle of visual media in the wider culture? What can we learn from productive tensions in cross-disciplinary practices? \\n\\nThe turn to the moving image in contemporary art is a global trend and the network will be sensitive to local differences and geographical disjunctures between the metropole and the periphery. \\n\\nOver the years, the moving image has been used by artists for myriad creative projects and the network will consider two currently distinctive applications. Firstly, the adoption of ethnographic and documentary techniques; secondly, the forging of identity though an active engagement with place, ecology and the aesthetic dimensions of landscape. \\n\\nThe broad reach of our network themes requires input from practitioners and scholars representing a range of approaches and academic disciplines. By its nature, the study of moving image art straddles two principal disciplines-fine art and the field of film and media studies. The network will engage these two disciplines in the first instance but it will also draw in participants from anthropology and geography in order to illuminate particular trends in recent moving image art. A wide range of cultural practices will be represented in the network by leading academics from across the globe such as Thomas Elsaesser (Amsterdam), Sean Cubitt (Melbourne), Maeve Connolly (Dublin), Catherine Russell (Montreal) and A.L. Rees (London); curators from major galleries such as Stuart Comer (Tate Modern) and Elisabetta Fabrizi (BFI), writers and distributors such as Mike Sperlinger (LUX) and Steven Bode (Film &amp; Video Umbrella) as well as international artists such as Shirin Neshat and Isaac Julien. The network will also include younger researchers from all fields working in the UK and Europe.\\n\\nMIRAJ is the principal means of disseminating the network's research. Our commitment to making research widely available to the public is also reflected in the dedicated interactive network website. Individual members of the network are involved in the journal and other participants will make major contributions over the years. MIRAJ will provide legacy for the research undertaken by the network, to be sustained and developed well into the future.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I00078X/1","grantId":"AH/I00078X/1","fundValue":"37093","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine  Elwes","coPersons":["Pratap  Rughani"],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
