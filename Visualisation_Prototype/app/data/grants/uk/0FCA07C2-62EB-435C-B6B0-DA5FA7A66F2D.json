{"id":"0FCA07C2-62EB-435C-B6B0-DA5FA7A66F2D","title":"Preferences for Truth-telling","abstractText":"<p>When a person has private information and tells another person or institution about it, economists usually assume that this person says whatever lies in their immediate interest â€“ which is mostly not the truth. In contrast, morality and religion teach us to be honest. Surprisingly little is known about how people actually behave in this dilemma of economic incentives and moral values. This lack of knowledge is partly due to the difficulty of identifying whether a specific individual lies.</p>\n\n<p>This project will investigate how people report their private information from a different angle: by analysing reporting patterns in a group of people. This is sufficient to answer many important questions, eg regarding which circumstances reduce lying, the impact of socio-economic variables, or the relationship of honesty with other moral values that people might hold.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the project is to develop an empirically validated theory which explains the current experimental data on reporting behaviour and delivers novel predictions on how institutions can encourage truth-telling. This project will combine economic theory with laboratory experiments and representative experiments, ie experiments using a representative sample of the population, outside the laboratory.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001558/1","grantId":"ES/K001558/1","fundValue":"165429","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Johannes  Abeler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
