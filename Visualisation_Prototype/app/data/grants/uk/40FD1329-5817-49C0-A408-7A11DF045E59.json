One form of prejudice that is still acceptable is stereotype-based humour, for example, jokes about women being unintelligent are deemed 'acceptable' by society, as they are not perceived to be malicious expressions of stereotype- they are &quot;just a joke&quot;. However, it is possible that such stereotype-based humour has detrimental effects for the social perceiver.</p>\n\n<p>This research will investigate the effects that such stereotype-based humour about women (eg, implying that women are less intelligent) can have on women's subsequent perceptions and behaviour:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Does it make women more likely to perform better/worse on a measure of intelligence? </li>\n\n <li>Will women see themselves more negatively (lowered self-esteem) or in more stereotypical terms, eg, motherly, bad at parking, illogical and will women be more likely to report wanting to pursue a more typically feminine career such as nursing? </li>\n\n <li>Furthermore, does the extent to which the female perceiver values her identity as a woman moderate their subsequent responses? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These questions will be addressed in a series of experimental studies where female perceivers will be exposed to stereotypes, stereotypical jokes or control jokes and their subsequent responses recorded.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2848","grantId":"RES-000-22-2848","fundValue":"79151","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Natalie Rebecca Hall","coPersons":["Russell  Spears"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
