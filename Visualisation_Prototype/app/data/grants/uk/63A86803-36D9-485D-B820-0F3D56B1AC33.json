These linkages pose a significant challenge to both macroeconomists and financial economists.</p>\n\n<p>Macro models often summarize the entire financial sector by a few interest rates and finance models typically include only a few macroeconomic indicators to capture a minimum set of information about the macroeconomic environment. However, the recent crises uncovered that bond prices respond to a large set of shocks, and that monetary policy reacts to financial conditions in an attempt to stabilise the economy. In addition, as the short rates hit the zero-lower bound, Central Banks acted on long-term government bonds to provide additional stimulus to the economy. This evidence calls for government bond models that include information about the entire economy allowing for the presence of a large number of macroeconomic, financial and international indicators. <br /><br />The aim of this project is to develop and apply models for large datasets to the context of government bonds focussing on the investigation of the government bond risk premium and on the predictive power of government bonds for economic activity.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001345/1","grantId":"ES/K001345/1","fundValue":"159992","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The paper Unspanned macroeconomic factors in the yield curve has been published as a Federal Reserve Board Working Paper.

The funded research can be used by:\n1) Central Banks: the analysis of the government bond risk premium improves Central Banks ability to assess inflation expectations, which is an important determinant in their policy making decisions.\n3) HM Treasury and Finance Ministries in other countries: understanding the bond risk premium helps Finance Ministries to determine the best mix of securities to issue in order to minimise their funding costs.\n4) Pension funds, insurance companies and other financial organisation: properly measuring the government\nbond risk premium helps to determine their optimal asset allocation policies and maximize their performance.\n5) Economic agents: understanding the type of monetary policy conducted by the central bank allows any economic agent to form better expectations of the future paths of short term interest rates and inflation, which are key determinants in long term decision making.
