{"id":"44CB26AB-538F-4E04-ABF3-64EEC4F3D736","title":"Queen's University Belfast Plasma Physics","abstractText":"This is a proposal to create a coherent, critical-mass research group of nine academics with strength in experimental, theoretical and computational plasma physics which will provide innovation, leadership and training. We would appoint two plasma theorists and one low temperature plasma experimentalist/modeler. The theorists are expected to be involved in the development of cutting edge kinetic modeling capabilities able to follow laser-interaction and plasma dynamics on experimentally relevant scales, hybrid codes (e.g. PIC-fluid) able to describe charged particle propagation through dense matter, computational and analytical models able to treat emerging issues in warm dense matter and high energy density physics and new analytical and computational tools to treat the ultrahigh intensity interaction regimes. The experimentalist will work across the interfaces of plasma physics, chemistry and surface science, combining sophisticated diagnostics with advanced computational modelling capabilities. A significant element of this bid is the proposal to coordinate a UK-wide, web and module-based teaching programme in Plasma Physics in partnership with other universities, laboratories and industry. Individual modules can be taken as stand-alone courses by PhD students and those in full time employment or aggregated to obtain an MSc.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D06337X/1","grantId":"EP/D06337X/1","fundValue":"2598610","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"William (Bill) George Graham","coPersons":["Marco  Borghesi","Ciaran  Lewis","David  Riley","K Matthew Zepf"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
