{"id":"7360CCBC-D26A-4039-B437-DB7EB851858F","title":"Malaria Adenoviral Vaccine","abstractText":"Malaria is one of the greatest causes of infectious mortality globally but no vaccine is available. For over ten years it has been known that a particular type of immune response can impart strong protection against malaria. This entails a cellular immune response by killer T cells against the malaria parasite growing in liver cells. A new type of attenuated safe virus that can carry malaria genes has been developed as a vaccine that can induce these killer cells very strongly and protect against rodent malaria. We shall generate a vaccine of this type and test its ability to protect vaccinated individuals against malaria infection. If successful this approach could help develop vaccines of a similar type against a variety of other diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0502018","grantId":"G0502018","fundValue":"647586","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Adrian Vivian Hill","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
