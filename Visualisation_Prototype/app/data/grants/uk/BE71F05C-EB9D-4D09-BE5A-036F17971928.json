Introducing the first microfluidic method for protein stability testing will reduce sample use and cost of analysis by up to 108-fold over microwell-based analysis. Combined expertise from biochemical engineering and the London Centre for Nanotechnology will enable this analysis with parallelism for up to 1000 samples per day. The new generation of protein-based medicines has rapidly become a $30billion-a-year industry addressing previously untreatable diseases. They have the potential for much further growth but a principal constraint is the high cost of the manufacturing methods required to preserve the structural integrity of proteins with limited stability. The ability to perform rapid and parallel protein stability characterisation experiments, at the microfluidic scale, is essential to enable: a) the rapid optimisation of therapeutic protein formulations; and b) the real-time monitoring of protein product quality in process-, microwell- and microfluidic scale bioprocess development experiments. Our preliminary research has demonstrated protein stability determination using fluorescence measurements at the microwell scale (Aucamp et al., 2005). The aims of this proposal are to a) explore the fundamentals that impact on measurement accuracy and sensitivity at the microfluidic scale, so as to significantly decrease the sample volumes required for protein stability measurement; b) establish a microfluidic denaturation technique; c) overcome the challenges that will enable broad application to bioprocessing and formulation of biopharmaceutical protein products.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E005942/1","grantId":"BB/E005942/1","fundValue":"424203","fundStart":"2007-01-08","fundEnd":"2010-01-07","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The device has been further improved via BBSRC Follow-on-funding, as well as a subsequent PhD project, to enable full feedback control on the IR-induced temperature gradient.

Improvements were obtained through exploration of both physical factors (laser type/power, lenses, gratings, filters, dichroic mirrors, collimators, PMT type, capillary type), and signal processing algorithms. A working optical bench and investigation of fundamentals on measurement sensitivity and accuracy was delivered on time using BSA and FKBP proteins.\n\n\n\nA new confocal stage mounting for accurate alignment of an IR laser to induce heating of buffers within a microfluidic channel was created and a time-dependent 3D temperature profile determined by confocal microscopy using a temperature sensitive fluorescent dye. This provided accurate information on the temperature gradients, rate of thermal diffusion and the effective beam width of the IR laser in the channel. Various configurations of IR power and capillary flow rates have been investigated to control heating rate, create temperature gradients, and constant temperature profiles within the channel. The system was simulated in Comsol to improve fundamental understanding and to assist the design of improved microfluidic chips with integrated IR induced heating at single or multiple points along the channel. Temperature gradients with a 70?C range across 0.1-1 mm channel lengths were obtained, as well as constant temperatures of 20-98?C across 0.5mm, which can be established in ms timescales. \n\nThroughput of data collection and processing was significantly improved with emissions for each laser pulse (at 1kHz) collected to a PC at 10E8 datapoints per second and processed in Labview. We developed signal processing algorithms to remove time-dependent variation of the laser pulse and to reduce the prompt scattered light signal. The detection limits for fluorescence intensity in the capillary (10E5 molecules) were compared to our microplate-based method (10E11 molecules). Equilibrium urea denaturation with the new technique was applied to BSA, FKBP-12 wt and an FL99 mutant to demonstrate application to different protein types and to an engineered variant with lower stability. The latter two were tested also in the presence of the drug rapamycin which binds to FKBP-12. These gave accurate unfolding dG and rapamycin Kd values consistent with literature measurements. This work has now been submitted for publication. This technique has great potential for both high-throughput drug screening in addition to biopharmaceutical formulation. The technology has potential application in healthcare diagnostics, particularly for point-of-care devices. The technology has been patented in the UK and US, with an EU filing made in Jan 2012. Licensing opportunities are being explored with various companies under milestone agreements. Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
