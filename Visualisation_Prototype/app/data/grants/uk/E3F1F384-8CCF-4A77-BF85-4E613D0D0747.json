She finalised her PhD on shoplifting at Middlesex University in 1999 and a spin off book from it, Gone Shopping - the Story of Shirley Pitts, Queen of Thieves, was published by Penguin Books in 1996 reissued (with a new afterword) in 2012 by Bloomsbury. \nIn 1999 Gamman founded the practice-led Design Against Crime Research initiative (see www.designagainstcrime.com) at CSM, a world-renowned college for innovative art and design practice. The project was validated as a Research Centre at UAL in 2005, which she continues to direct. Her work with the Design Against Crime Research Centre (DACRC) has won several awards for design innovation and recognition for delivery of impact. Together with Adam Thorpe she has delivered numerous academic outputs and co-curated over 15 art and design exhibitions as well as catalysing a number of DAC product ranges including Stop Thief chairs, Karrysafe bags and Bikeoff anti-theft bike stands, all of which have incorporated offender knowledge into the design process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M504105/1","grantId":"AH/M504105/1","fundValue":"4800","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The expert workshop featured a strong account by Sarah Colvin about the demonstrable contribution that the arts make to society and the economy, as well as the research that has already been published by the National Alliance for Arts in Criminal Justice and it was indicated that the design of control trials described by Adam Thorpe of CSM and Yvonne Harris from the Design Council during the expert workshop could be of value to the National Alliance for Arts in Criminal Justice too to show impact. Such methods could provide a missing jigsaw piece of strong evidence, that is currently absent from the evidence library. https://www.artsincriminaljustice.org.uk/evidence-library\n\nThis expert workshop discussion has clearly informed the future of Arts Alliance research. The Alliance will work with innovative researchers who will help capture the transformations engendered by the arts and their mechanisms, perhaps in partnership with the Arts Humanities Research Council.

And while there is some good evidence that indicates the impact of arts on offenders, such as Anderson, Colvin et al.'s Inspiring Change report (2010), the success of the participatory arts in this regard is still not as valued as it might be. The National Offender Management Services (NOMS) recently commissioned an independent rapid evidence assessment of arts and criminal justice work, which also concludes: \n&quot;There is a lack of good quality research evidence that explores the impact of arts projects with offenders. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether or not arts projects have a measureable impact on re-offending&quot; \n(RAND Europe, Arcs Ltd and University of Glamorgan, 2012) \nNot all offenders get access to participatory arts, and nearly three quarters (73%) of under 18 year olds are reconvicted within a year of release , with 47% of adults being reconvicted within one year. There is clearly much more to be achieved. The Culture Value on Arts in the Criminal Justice report concluded we need:\n\n(a) to highlight the comparatively low cost of participatory arts education, which has been shown to reduce reoffending (see the Unlocking Value report by the Arts Alliance and New Philanthropy Capital);\n(b) to get better at making the case about the different ways participatory arts has value to individuals, society, government and to commissioners;\n(c) to devise more effective, larger scale, cross-disciplinary evaluative theories and mechanisms to deliver robust evidence; \n(d) to explore more fully the impact of offender art on audiences (the general public, prison officers, and prisoners' families) to bring about changes in public perception and hence another form of cultural value.\nThe expert workshop and the subsequent report demonstrated that, to make progress in demonstrating the diverse cultural value of the arts in the criminal justice system, we need a multidisciplinary and multi-methodological approach to reflect the range and complexity of what the arts are and do. We may also need to further explore the institutional value of arts and in criminal justice (both in prison and probation setting and in galleries and museums). Also that arts in the criminal justice sector have so far focused on how arts and culture impacts on individual (offenders). How this work contributes significant value to prison culture and to the broader cultural and social spheres &quot;outside&quot; also needs consideration, and perhaps should be the subject of further research. Our report introduced new theoretical concepts (about &quot;proxy processes&quot; and &quot;de-risked&quot; spaces), as well as further discussion of evaluation issues, that may well be taken up by other researchers.
