{"id":"F23C7D2C-B5A9-4073-B800-410207B5C9EA","title":"Inequality, Social Science and History Research Network","abstractText":"In recent years, inequality has become a central concern of policy makers and social scientists in economics, sociology and political science. Evidence is mounting regarding the negative consequences of high inequality for social, well-being and political outcomes, not just for those who find themselves in the lower strata of society, but for countries as a whole (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009). With questions of fairness and distribution high on the agenda and continued debate on how to best address ensure them, there is a noted absence of a long-term perspective on the causes and consequences of inequality.\\n\\nAn historical perspective on these problems is invaluable in order to assess and understand contemporary patterns of inequality, their origins and consequences. How are inequalities created and reproduced? Can we look beyond market mechanisms to understand how cultural, social and international processes contribute to stratification? How have patterns of inequality changed in the past and what caused them to do so?\\n\\nTaking an historical perspective on the subject of inequality can make a contribution to current concerns in a number of ways: (a) go beyond diagnosis to explore the variety of processes and mechanisms through which inequalities are created, reproduced and transformed; (b) analyse the short and long-term consequences of inequalities and of interventions designed to alter them, and; (c) by providing evidence that clarifies, qualifies or corrects current research and discussion.\\n\\nIn recent decades, Historians have tended to shy away from an engagement with the kinds of questions central to the theme of inequality, but an increasing number are returning to these issues and seeking to reach beyond their field and sustain a productive exchange with other disciplines and beyond academia. This network will bring together historians, social scientists, economists, third sector researchers and policy makers concerned who work on the topic of inequality. Through a series of high profile, international events, the Inequality, Social Science and History Research network aims to develop new ways of questioning the subject and contribute to critical contemporary debates.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J001600/2","grantId":"AH/J001600/2","fundValue":"22934","fundStart":"2013-10-30","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Pedro  Ramos Pinto","coPersons":["William  O'Reilly"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
