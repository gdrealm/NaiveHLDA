Insight into the relationship between the carbon microstructure on the removal of middle molecules (uraemic toxins) and the influence of the carbon's surface chemistry on the interaction of larger blood proteins (influencing the material's biocompatibility) will result in the development of effective and more economic adsorbents for blood purification. The research seeks to minimize any adverse inflammatory responses upon contact between the carbon adsorbent surface and blood. This will lead not only to new knowledge but also to new and better treatment therapies of direct benefit to patients suffering from renal and liver failure, sepsis and other clinical conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D033837/1","grantId":"EP/D033837/1","fundValue":"17211","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2006-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Danish Javed Malik","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
