The approach will bring considerably more interactivity into the process, so that the engineer/designer is continuously interacting with the analysis and receiving immediate feedback of solutions from which he/she can assess the durability, life and fatigue resistance of the component being designed. The reader is asked to imagine a computer showing contours of stresses on the surface of a solid body, and next imagine the engineer making some geometric change to the design, e.g. increasing a fillet radius. Such an operation might normally be performed by a click-and-drag mouse operation. Next, imagine the stress contours updating on the screen in real time as the mouse is dragged and the geometry is being deformed. Further geometric changes using different dynamic operations also cause stresses to update in real time. Thus the stress analysis evolves along with the geometry, and guides the design rather than validates it after its completion. This is the vision for the output of the proposed work.This level of interactivity is no longer a vision, but instead a reality, for 2D simulations. Previous work at Durham has led to the development of a system Concept Analyst, and readers are invited to view the web site http://www.conceptanalyst.com to view screen captures of typical interactive design analysis sessions. It is the aim of the proposed work to bring the same level of interactivity to 3D simulations. This will present several technical challenges, but promises to have considerable impact.We request funding from EPSRC to support a post-doctoral research associate and a postgraduate student, to provide for appropriate computational facilities, and to fund collaboration and dissemination through conferences and academic publications. The duration of the proposed project is three years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H000046/1","grantId":"EP/H000046/1","fundValue":"358964","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-12","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The software has been delivered to our industrial partners, BAE Systems and Jesmond Engineering.

For example, imagine an engineer has done a stress ananlysis of a component, and has an image on the screen of the object with stress contours superimposed. Now he/she wants to change the design by, for example, moving a hole. Our system is the only one available in which the stress contours update in real-time as the hole is dragged across the screen.\n\nIn this project these ideas were extended to 3D. We used the OpenCascade solid modelling libraries, and wrote our own BEM solver. The two were coupled successfully. A key part of the problem is the design of an automatic mesher, to convert the geometric model into one ready and suitable for analysis, and particularly with remeshing capabilities to efficiently update the analysis model when a change happens. This was implemented successfully and real-time simulations achieved. It was found that with current technology we can achieve real-time only for small problems, but identified ways this could be extended to larger problems with future increases in computer power. The next step would be implementation in a commercial code and testing on industrially relevant problems.
