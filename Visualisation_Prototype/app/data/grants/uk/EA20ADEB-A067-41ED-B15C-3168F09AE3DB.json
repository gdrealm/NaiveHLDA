Several cancer therapies such as radioactive and chemotherapy have been developed to overcome the cancer or tumour. However, the treatment itself is dangerous to the patients because the chemicals for the chemotherapy are quite toxic when it is overdosed. Generally, when we treat the patients with the toxic anticancer agents, less than 5% of the chemicals can effectively influence on the cancer cells and the other 95% of the agents are unintentionally exposed to the healthy organs. In this reason, most of the cancer patients are more suffering during the cancer treatments by chemotherapy. If we can reduce the amount of the anticancer agents to 5% and expose the agents only in cancer cells, the patients are more safe and comfortable during the treatments. In this reason, we suggest the some method to solve these critical problems based on nanotechnology. In this work, we can make some kind of very small size of the nanocapsule that can carry the anticancer agents. This capsules also include a magnetic nanoparticles, thus we can move the nanocapsule to the cancer or tumour cell by external magnet. These nanocapsules will attach to the cancer cells and start to release the anticancer agent only to the target cells. Moreover, we can program the releasing time from a month to year, thus patient doesn't need to visit hospital too frequently. By combing these several functions, we can create novel carriers so called intelligent smart biomaterials (ISB).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E016944/1","grantId":"EP/E016944/1","fundValue":"207072","fundStart":"2007-07-30","fundEnd":"2010-01-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Do Kyung  Kim","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
