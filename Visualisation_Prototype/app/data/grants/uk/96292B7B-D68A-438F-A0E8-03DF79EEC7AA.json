{"id":"96292B7B-D68A-438F-A0E8-03DF79EEC7AA","title":"The songs of Gabriel Faur&eacute;: New critical edition","abstractText":"The songs of Gabriel Faur&eacute; (over 100 in total) form a major body of work that crucially shaped the French art song tradition and today form a staple of song recitals and study. However, no comprehensive critical edition of them is available, and the piecemeal nature of their original publications has left some of them in obscurity. The present aim is to produce a complete critical edition. These volumes have been commissioned by London Peters Edition as a core item of their Faur&eacute; critical editions by Roy Howat. The project submitted here comprises all but the four late cycles, in three volumes (each to be published for high and low voice), plus Faur&eacute;'s chamber ensemble version of the cycle 'La bonne chanson' and a volume of 45 Vocalises composed by Faur&eacute; for exam purposes while Director of the Paris Conservatoire.\\n\\nA major work of documentary and musical scholarship, the edition will be a vital resource for scholars and performers. Its development and research will be supported and communicated by engagement with students, teachers, professionals and the wider community, through a wide-ranging programme of performance and research events. Related outcomes will include scholarly articles dealing with the specialised challenges and discoveries, along with articles for singers' journals.\\n\\nThe large volume of data involved demands a comprehensive understanding of Faur&eacute;'s life, work and musical practices. Roy Howat's extensive experience of Faur&eacute; editing has made him more familiar than anyone with these issues, including the composer's sometimes idiosyncratic treatment of his own texts. Ambiguities of tempo indication, phrasing, dynamics and articulation are inherent in Faur&eacute; sources (and thus generate performing issues), and often call for a judicious blend of editorial delicacy and boldness. The editorial norm of giving priority to the composer's final readings will be taken as a general basis but treated with flexibility to allow the resolution of some intr source problems. This will match the principles established in Dr Howat's highly regarded editions of Faur&eacute; piano and chamber music.\\n\\nRoy Howat's career has been devoted to integrating scholarly research with active performance. His editions are internationally regarded as having set new standards in that regard, and in having positively influenced performance practice through blending scholarly integrity with musical and practical insight. The new edition will develop his commitment to interactive performance and scholarship. The edition will crucially (and authentically) reflect the composer's own declared practice of basing editions directly on performing experience.\\n\\nThe programmes and principles of the Royal Academy of Music in particular will be central to this research. The Academy's research environment, in which Dr Howat has been a core participant for six years, offer open events and presentations based on interactive workshops, concerts and seminars, providing a perfect forum for exploration and experimentation in performance with students, teachers and scholars. Through Dr Howat's international profile as the Royal Academy of Music's Keyboard Research Fellow, and his strong links with many other musical and academic institutions, these activities can be shared worldwide.\\n\\nThe compelling motivation of this project is one of accessibility. As such, it will:\\n Adopt a communicative and consultative approach to the development of the edition, involving students, teachers, performers and the listening public\\n\\n Make widely available songs and vocalises available that have been unpublished, out of print or difficult to access\\n\\n Publish the songs in a comprehensive edition, issued by a leading international publishing house, on sale worldwide at a moderate and very competitive price\\n\\n Disseminate the findings and the benefits of the research to the wider community through performance, seminars, lectures, recordings, broadcast and published articles","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H038744/1","grantId":"AH/H038744/1","fundValue":"242458","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Roy  Howat","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Academy of Music","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
