{"id":"D20D29BC-F60A-43A4-9F4A-78FD921EB88A","title":"Performing Romani Identities: Strategy and Critique","abstractText":"Performing Romani Identities: Strategy and Critique will constitute a network of performers, activists, stakeholders and academics to map current Romani performance practices in Europe through a series of site based workshops. These workshops will examine the particular challenges facing performers working with and within Romani communities in each area and consider how performance might be harnessed and consolidated to greater effect. \n\nRomani culture is marked by a history of critical performance and performativity. Romani survival in Europe, over the course of a millennium, has been contingent upon the adoption and practice of a number of performance strategies, including oral history, storytelling, music, dance and theatre, as well as upon everyday narratives that perform intelligible Romani identities for both the community itself and for non-Roma. What is the relationship between Romani performance, Romani iterations of performativity and hegemonic knowledge production? What are the slippages between the two? What is the potential in these slippages and iterations for different practices of agency, especially in light of the current violence confronting Romani subjects across Europe?\n\nThere is a multiplicity of performance and performative practice by and for Romani communities across Europe; to date, however, there has been neither a consolidated approach nor a platform to share best practice across these communities. In this network, we look to address this need. In particular, we will examine the potential for social change produced from within this multiplicity. As well as mapping how such performance strategies are currently being used, through the workshops themselves, we will establish new possibilities for Romani performance as political strategy.\n\nThe workshops will be organised around three key themes: \n\nStereotypes and dominant practices of representation\n\nDiversity and the concomitant invisibility of local specificity, inherent in transnationalism\n\nCollaboration and the negotiation of methodologies that make effective engagement possible\n\nThe workshops will be approached and inflected differently according to the historical and current contexts and varying challenges faced by Romani communities in each site, and constructed in consultation with the key participants. Each workshop will include an opening address by the host outlining the position in their area with a framing of the project by the PI and Co-I laying out the aims of the network. The workshops will be multilingual with local translators provided by the hosts where required. We will pay careful attention to the specifics of each locale, drawing upon local knowledge and expertise. In this way, the workshops will draw upon the arts, activist, scholarly and performance expertise of participants in order to generate a sustained response in light of the dangers of the current moment, opening up new forms of knowledge production through Romani performance practice.\n\nThe workshops will be conducted in partnership with academic institutions and stake holders in Istanbul, Bucharest, Lyon and Alicante with a final symposium in London to disseminate findings and develop a strategy to secure future funding.\n \nThese workshops will map best practice, including the use of technology. A key focus will be on the commonalities and differences between, within and among Romani communities from diverse sites. We are especially interested in the technological possibilities for linking communities through performance. In view of the urgency of the current crisis facing Roma, we will explore the opportunities afforded by the integration of multimedia and live performance. Particularly, how this integration might be utilised most effectively for an engaged social practice within and across Romani neighbourhoods, communities, and national borders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M000044/1","grantId":"AH/M000044/1","fundValue":"35954","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Collins","coPersons":["Ethel Carolyn Brooks"],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
