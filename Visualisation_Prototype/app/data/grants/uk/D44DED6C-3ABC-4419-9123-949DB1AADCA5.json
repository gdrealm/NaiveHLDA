{"id":"D44DED6C-3ABC-4419-9123-949DB1AADCA5","title":"Exploratory Study Of Novel Oxide Conductors","abstractText":"Metal oxides offer a host of important properties such as photocatalysts, semiconductors, superconductors, battery and fuel cell components, magnetic , ferroelectrics, piezoelectrics and catalysts. Here we have observed important new phenomena utilising a previously unexplored doping strategy. The purpose of this project is to validate these findings and if successful to establish an important new strand of oxide materials research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J02094X/1","grantId":"EP/J02094X/1","fundValue":"99991","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Irvine","coPersons":["Stephen  Lee"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
