In-situ radiotherapy, on the other hand, is performed by directly injecting the radionuclides in the blood vessels supplying the tumour, thus delivering a high, localized dose of radiation, where the surrounding tissues are not significantly affected. In order for this task to be performed effectively, a suitable carrier is needed to transport the radionuclide to the tumour target site and lock it there; the carrier should have long enough durability in the physiological environment, so that it will not dissolve, releasing the active ions, before their radiation decay. At the same time, the carrier should have high biocompatibility, do not release any harmful element in the physiological environment, and should possess physical and mechanical properties suitable to be suspended and transported in the blood stream, up to the target site.In this project, we will focus on yttrium-containing alumino-silicate (YAS) and bioactive (YB) glasses, and investigate their structure, dynamics and surface reactivity, in order to probe and understand their potential as carriers for radiotherapeutic applications. Aluminosilicate glass microspheres containing radioactive yttrium are currently employed with success to treat liver cancer; another exciting possibility is to employ bioactive glasses as yttrium carriers. The latter have the potential to improve the long-term biodegradability of the microspheres, while keeping the very slow yttrium release rate necessary for radiotherapy applications. Computer simulations will be used to provide an accurate microscopic picture of these materials, with particular focus on the features concerning the yttrium ions: their local coordination, the way they are incorporated in the glass network and their mobility are key properties which affect the ability of the glass carrier to lock them at the tumour site for a time long enough to deliver their radiation dose. We will model and compare different glass compositions, in order to highlight the effect of compositional changes on the above properties, and on other physical properties of the glasses relevant for these applications: this information will directly support the optimization of bioactive glasses for radiotherapy.Since radiotherapy, as many other medical applications of glasses, involve glass particles in direct contact with a physiological environment, the final aim of the project is to extend the (bulk) studies described above to model the active glass/water interface. We will use Molecular Dynamics techniques to build a reliable model of the hydrated glass surface, providing a detailed dynamical picture of the processes occurring on the surface upon hydration, which have a central role in the partial dissolution of the glass network. The outcome of this research will be a rather complete description of structural, dynamical and surface effects relevant to the applications of YAS and YB glasses as carriers of radionuclide ions.The investigations will focus on yttrium but many general aspects should be common to the incorporation of other radionuclides, such as rhenium. The simulations will ultimately indicate whether and how the glass composition can be fine-tuned to improve the properties of the glass crucial for its radiotherapeutic use, such as solubility. Understanding key composition-structure-properties relationships of these materials at an atomistic level will be an important step towards a more rational design of biomaterials for these applications, and will answer recent calls within the biomaterials community for more fundamental approaches to technological developments in this field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F020066/1","grantId":"EP/F020066/1","fundValue":"265573","fundStart":"2008-10-30","fundEnd":"2012-01-10","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Antonio  Tilocca","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" In-situ radiotherapy of cancer involves injecting vectors carrying the activated radioisotopes in the bloodstream, to attack a tumour with a higher localised dose of radiation than in external-beam therapy. The key requirements for the vector are high chemical stability, to avoid releasing any radioactive elements in the bloodstream until their radioactive decay, and good biocompatibility, with no toxic dissolution products. Yttrium alumino silicate (YAS) glass microparticles fulfill these requirements but they have some intrinsic limitations, namely their lack of specific favourable interaction with living tissues and the lack of long-term biodegradability. These limitations could be removed using bioactive glasses (BGs) as radioisotope vectors: Y-BGs would supplement the radioisotope carrier functionality with superior biodegradability and the ability to stimulate growth of new tissues, replacing the healthy ones destroyed in the treatment.\n\nThe main purpose of this project was to identify and understand composition-structure-properties correlations for these materials, in order to provide direct insights into how the glass composition affect their stability, durability and dissolution behaviour, and support with this fundamental knowledge more rational technological advances in this field.\n\nThis task was performed through atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both YAS and YBGs. The initial YAS simulations have allowed us to identify specific features of the most stable YAS composition, which lead to its good performances in current applications. These data represent a key reference for building and interpreting our models of YBGs, for which much less information is available. Based on these results , we selected a range of potentially interesting YBG compositions, and modelled them through classical MD simulations. Ab-initio MD simulations were used to verify and validate the classical MD models.\n\nThe analysis of the YBG models have highlighted the way in which incorporation of yttrium radioisotopes in the BG matrix alters the structural properties of the latter relevant for these applications, such as the degree of inter-tetrahedral crosslinking. We have devised several novel structural descriptors of the glass structure, beyond the network connectivity, which can be directly estimated from a subset of properties extracted from the MD models, and used to measure the strength of the glass and its resistance to dissolution. These new descriptors have been successfully tested to predict the performance of YAS glasses (using the experimental dissolution rates as reference) and then applied to characterise the set of new YBG compositions, for which no experimental data are available.\n\nThe predictive models produced by this project represent an important reference to screen potential BG compositions for radiotherapy, enabling biomedical researchers to tailor the composition of the glass vectors towards the most suitable balance of low dissolution of the radioisotope ions in the short-term, and sufficiently high biological activity and biodegradability in the long term. \n\nThe new structural descriptors of dissolution that we developed in this project, such as the degree of inter-tetrahedral cross-linking mediated by a central modifier cation, have subsequently been employed by other research groups to characterise the dissolution properties of different glasses for biomedical applications.
