Various risk prediction models are used to summarise levels of several risk markers simultaneously and are used to classify patients into high/medium or low risk groups. All CVD risk prediction models are based on single measures of risk factors. \n\nWHAT IS THE HEALTH SERVICE ALREADY DOING?\nIn 2008, the UK government announced a national initiative to conduct CVD risk assessment in people aged 40-74 years with no history of CVD. The checks are being done in general practices and pharmacies. \n\nWHY IS RESEARCH NEEDED?\nAlthough experts generally agree that CVD risk assessment has the potential to prevent disease, there is uncertainty about:\n- do past measures of risk factors or changes in risk factors yield useful information in addition to current measures of risk factors?\n- how can past and current measures of risk factors be incorporated into a statistical model?\n- how should information on risk, when incorporating past and current measures of risk factors, best be summarised?\n\nWHAT IS THE PROPOSED RESEARCH?\nAn interdisciplinary team of internationally recognised statisticians and epidemiologists will:\n1. analyse detailed scientific databases with information on CVD risk factors measured more than once in patients with and without heart attacks or strokes in a total of about 4 million participants, thereby reliably determining the use of repeated measures of risk factors for CVD risk assessment;\n\n2. use these databases to identify which CVD risk factors provide useful extra information when measured on more than one occasion for CVD risk assessment; \n\n3. determine suitable statistical models that combine information from past and current measures of risk factors in order to provide up-to-date relevant CVD risk assessments for patients;\n\n4. investigate the use of interactive technology to provide graphical displays of individual CVD risk over time.\n\n\nWHAT DATA SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THIS RESEARCH?\nWe have two large databases for our investigations: \n\nEmerging risk factors collaboration\nThe Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration has collated individual data on up to 500 characteristics in over 1.8 million participants in over 120 long-term studies. Within these data, approximately 280,000 participants have at least two measurements of the main CVD risk factors. \n\nThe Health Improvement Network \nThe Health Improvement Network (THIN) is a primary care database with anonymised clinical records entered by general practices on their computer computer system for patient management (ViSion). THIN now includes records from around 4 million people with repeat measures of risk factors from over 450 practices across the UK. Patients are included from when they register with a GP and contribute data until death or they leave the practice.\n\nThese two data sources, which combine observational studies and electronic health records, have the power and generalisability to help clarify the added value of using repeat measures of risk factors for CVD risk prediction.\n\nHOW WILL HEALTH USERS AND THE PUBLIC BENEFIT?\nFindings from this research will help to inform and optimise current (and future) government initiatives in CVD risk assessment. This should lead to use of accurate risk assessment methods. Although the proposed work will focus on predictors for CVD, the methodology and strategies will also be widely applicable for the identification and added value of repeat measures of risk predictors in other diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K014811/1","grantId":"MR/K014811/1","fundValue":"410638","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Angela  Wood","coPersons":["Simon  Thompson","Irwin  Nazareth","John  Danesh","Ian  White","Irene  Petersen","Robin  Henderson"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
