In this regard, African agriculture is particularly handicapped. The dairy supply chain was selected for the project because dairy is a key investment sector for the Government of Malawi, donors such USA, Japan and Belgium have focused part of their development aid on the sector, and despite this, domestic production response is still unimpressive and large part of the population do not have access to dairy products of nutritious and safe quality. In this context, the purpose of this project is to address some of the key challenges faced by the chain through an assessment of its operation that can help boost the potential contribution of the sector to economic growth and food security. The methodology of analysis involves several stages from exploring the operation of each one of the parts of the dairy supply chain, identifying problems and proposing solutions, to integrating the different results into a model that will allow simulating the impact of different policy alternatives. The project is multidisciplinary and builds on the existing academic link between SAC and Bunda College of Agriculture in Malawi.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J009202/1","grantId":"ES/J009202/1","fundValue":"360378","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Cesar Luis Jorge  Revoredo-Giha","coPersons":[],"organisation":"SRUC","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
