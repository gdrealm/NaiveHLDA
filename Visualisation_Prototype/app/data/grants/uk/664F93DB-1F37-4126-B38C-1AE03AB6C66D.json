A central structure in these pathways is the nucleus accumbens. We already know that the accumbens receives information about external events that indicate the availability of rewards from other parts of the brain such as the cortex and amygdala, and integrates that information with another important input, from the midbrain, that uses dopamine as its chemical messenger. The role of these systems in signalling reward has been well explored. However, the nucleus accumbens itself consists almost exclusively of nerve cells that use a quite different chemical messenger, GABA. Surprisingly little is known of how these GABAergic cells function to integrate the signals from cortex and amygdala with those from dopamine systems, yet this function lies at the heart of reward signalling. We have recently discovered that GABA signalling in reward depends upon a particular subtype of GABA receptor that is found at high densities in the accumbens. However, we have no real knowledge of how this system functions. In this project we will develop new tools that will allow us to explore the function of this particular subtype of GABA receptor, and how it interacts with other GABA receptors in determining drug-seeking behaviour. A better understanding of this process may allow us to develop new drugs to treat addictions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802715","grantId":"G0802715","fundValue":"246794","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  King","coPersons":["David Norman Stephens","Delia  Belelli","Jeremy John Lambert"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
