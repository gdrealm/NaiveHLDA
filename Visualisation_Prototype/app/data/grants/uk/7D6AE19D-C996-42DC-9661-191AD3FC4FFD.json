However, the past decade has seen the rise of a number of issues which cross this boundary; from the threat of bioterrorism in the post 9/11 world which pushed security ever closer to the field of health, to the challenges of SARS and influenza pandemics, which clearly highlighted the interdependence of health and security. These developments have seen the emergence of global health security as a distinct research and policy area and this seminar series seeks to address a number of key questions which have arisen in this new research field.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of seven seminars the series will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>explore what is meant by the term global health security</li>\n\n <li>identify the principal contemporary challenges in the area</li>\n\n <li>assess who has identified these challenges</li>\n\n <li>investigate who is seeking to address them</li>\n\n <li>evaluate the implications of this in terms of both policy and practice.&nbsp;</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Moving beyond traditional subjects this seminar series takes the established literature on global health security as a starting point and sets out to advance the field through an exploration of the key existing and emerging challenges.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000326/1","grantId":"ES/L000326/1","fundValue":"29674","fundStart":"2013-11-30","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  It is too early to have impact.
