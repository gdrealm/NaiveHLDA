{"id":"80B16B93-FE48-4BAA-B455-6E774BADE0D8","title":"Challenges encountered by ethnic minority and migrant doctors, healthcare workers and related groups and the implications for performance regulation","abstractText":"There is ongoing concern about possible inequalities in how poorly performing doctors are identified and dealt with by the National Health Service and in the formal regulatory processes of the General Medical Council. This study will develop a conceptual model of the part that racial discrimination and/or migrant status might play in the chain of events that leads to the raising of concerns about doctors and how they are subsequently deal with. The model will be developed through drawing together insights from existing research and other literature in this and related fields to develop a theoretical understanding of how such links might work, using the methodology of 'critical interpretive review'. Relevant papers will be located through searching databases and websites, reference lists in identified papers and contact with experts. A subset of papers will be selected for analysis ensuring adequate coverage of the range of topics and theoretical approaches represented in the literature considered. The findings will aid understanding of how and why inequalities in the identification and handling of poorly performing doctors may come about and will also contribute to more general understanding of how experience of diversity may link to disadvantage, particularly in the context of professional work.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F039689/1","grantId":"ES/F039689/1","fundValue":"81113","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte  Humphrey","coPersons":["Debbie A Cohen","Aneez  Esmail"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
