Yet these increasingly complex and interdependent sectors face serious challenges over the next 10-50 years and beyond if they are to minimise the risk of systematic failures and disruptions and be capable of responding positively to expected demographic, environmental and technological changes. \n\nIn order to meet these challenges, decision-makers at the national, regional and local levels need the best available information and evidence from the research community in a format that can be incorporated into policy and practice. The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and, more broadly, the Living with Environmental Change partnership, have invested heavily in research to inform this decision-making process. BeXchange aims to maximise and accelerate the impacts and benefits of this research. It will provide a dynamic focussed network that will enable researchers, policymakers and practitioners to work together to ensure timely production of credible research and salient knowledge exchange outputs for use in developing a sustainable built environment. \n\nBuilding on existing achievements within the Adaptation and Resilience in a Changing Climate Coordination Network (ARCC CN, EP/G036586/1), BeXchange will work with researchers and a wide range of stakeholders to provide:\n\n- access to knowledge, data and practical tools drawing on research outputs from across the academic community;\n- opportunities for facilitated knowledge exchange to better inform and focus research, practice and evidence-gathering activities;\n- the means (enabling processes and mechanisms) to contribute to the production of targeted outputs such that the resulting knowledge can be integrated into policy and practice. \n\nExperience gained within the ARCC CN has demonstrated that facilitated networking and synthesis of results from academia that engages both researchers and other stakeholders enhances the use and ultimately the impacts of the overall research. Stakeholders benefit from the provision of coherent, timely and targeted evidence and outputs that meet their needs. Researchers benefit from engagement of a broader and informed stakeholder community and opportunities to share knowledge, resources, data and results that enhance their own individual pathways to impacts. \n\nBeXchange will be an open network targeting stakeholders from academia, business, industry, central and local government, professional institutions, voluntary organisations and related networks with an interest in fostering resilience and sustainability in the built environment and infrastructure sectors. These include those stakeholders whose remit is public engagement and international colleagues with interests relevant to the UK.\n\nBy providing a focal point for the creation of and access to information and by driving forward coordinated engagement and knowledge exchange activities, BeXchange will become the primary UK source of credible and relevant evidence from research to inform adaptation in the built environment and infrastructure sectors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L005700/1","grantId":"EP/L005700/1","fundValue":"1223980","fundStart":"2014-01-31","fundEnd":"2018-01-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger  Street","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
