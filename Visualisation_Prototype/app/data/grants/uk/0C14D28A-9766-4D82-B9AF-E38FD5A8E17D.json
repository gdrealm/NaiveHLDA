The propagation of an organism requires that the genome is copied, thereby generating offspring. This copying process is referred to as replication, and is a reaction that is carried out by specific proteins at a specific time during growth. The genome must also be protected from damage, which comes in many forms that can compromise the chemical composition of the genetic material. Protection is frequently due to reactions that repair damage that has already been inflicted, and these reactions are carried out, like replication, at specific times during growth. In fact, the two reactions can influence each other. The co-ordination of each reaction with growth is determined by a widely characterised set of enzymes, called protein kinases, which modify components of the cellular machineries that drive replication and repair. Trypanosomes are parasites that blight the health and economy of huge parts of the world and appear to have unconventional aspects of genome replication and repair. We wish to ask if we can identify the kinase enzymes that control these reactions, and thus understand if and how these reactions might be different from humans and other animals that are infected by the parasites. If we can identify these parasite protein kinases, we intend to try and find chemicals that will stop their activity and might then stop the growth of the parasites. If this is successful, we will have uncovered new strategies to treat the diseases caused by the parasites. These strategies will be robust because they target one of the most important aspects of the biology of any organism, and may be applicable to other parasites and infective organisms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K006495/1","grantId":"BB/K006495/1","fundValue":"438521","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  McCulloch","coPersons":["Jeremy Charles Mottram"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
