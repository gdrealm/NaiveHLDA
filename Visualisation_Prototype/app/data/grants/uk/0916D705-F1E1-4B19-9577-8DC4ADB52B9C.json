{"id":"0916D705-F1E1-4B19-9577-8DC4ADB52B9C","title":"Sustainable Intensification of UK plum production","abstractText":"The food retail industry is experiencing increasing demand from consumers for UK grown fresh produce and would like to substitute imports with home produce. The demand for home grown plums cannot currently be met due to unreliable and\ninefficient cropping systems. This collaborative project will develop integrated new technologies that will address the major existing production problems and limitations for fresh plums. The sustainable intensification of this horticultural crop will be achieved through integration of a high-density growing system with new rootstocks, varieties and manipulation of tree architecture for increased yield, coupled with protected cropping regimes and component technologies that will regulate crop load, fruit ripening and give significant season extension. This intensive and profitable growing system will enable UK growers to confidently invest in plum production, delivering substantial economic impact (&gt;&pound;10 m/yr) to the UK horticulture industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M028178/1","grantId":"BB/M028178/1","fundValue":"696005","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy Vincent Cross","coPersons":["Nicola  Harrison"],"organisation":"East Malling Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
