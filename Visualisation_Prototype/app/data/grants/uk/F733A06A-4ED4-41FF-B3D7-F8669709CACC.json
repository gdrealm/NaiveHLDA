The new structure is expected to be highly absorbing to light and facilitate greater device efficiency than presently possible. Successful development will increase the commercialisation prospects for OPV technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K002198/1","grantId":"ST/K002198/1","fundValue":"46227","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Clive Wright","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Glyndwr University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
