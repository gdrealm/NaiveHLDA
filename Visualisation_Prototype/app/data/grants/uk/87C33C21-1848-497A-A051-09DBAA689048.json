As the individual building blocks of the protein capsule can be modified in different ways, the capsule can be optimised on an individual basis based on patient need.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801741","grantId":"G0801741","fundValue":"516644","fundStart":"2009-05-11","fundEnd":"2012-11-10","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil R Thomas","coPersons":["Susan  Watson","Anna Maria  Grabowska","Amalia  Patane"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
