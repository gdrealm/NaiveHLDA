{"id":"3E3D0D60-36CD-413B-8340-6339BA84131F","title":"The ESRC Green Criminology Research Seminar Series","abstractText":"<p>The main aim of the series is to enhance interdisciplinary examination of environmental harm and its regulation by bringing together academics at all career stages from a range of disciplines. Crucially though, the series will also include ecological and conservation practitioners, environmental and wildlife law enforcement, and other experts. This core group of approximately 15 people will meet to exchange professional and academic knowledge and expertise, practical information, and research plans, which will further the state of Green Crime knowledge and lead to interdisciplinary research projects. The series includes five half-day seminars and one 2-day mini-conference. The series will focus primarily on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Green Criminology Theories and Concepts</li>\n\n <li>Wildlife and Timber Trafficking</li>\n\n <li>Animal Abuse and Wildlife Crime</li>\n\n <li>Hazardous Waste and Pollution</li>\n\n <li>Environmental Law and Regulation. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The mini-conference will have sessions on each of these themes and those aspects of Green Criminology not covered elsewhere, such as methodological challenges, environmental conflict, and bio-piracy. The mini-conference will also have a session devoted to plans for future collaborative research, publications, and an annual conference. The series will have wide international dissemination because it will be webcast through a dedicated website and advertised using the Green Criminology list serve.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J022551/1","grantId":"ES/J022551/1","fundValue":"18022","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tanya  Wyatt","coPersons":["Nigel  South","Matthew Peter Hall","Gary Richard Potter","Angus  Nurse"],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":" We met our aim of increasing our green criminology network as is evident by the 70+ people from 20 countries that attended the final seminar in London. Each seminar had at least 30 people - undergraduates, postgraduates, early career researchers, established academics and practitioners. Our Youtube channel has received nearly 1,700 views and will be transferred to the 'greencriminology.org' website that is supported and maintained by its members and sustainable in the long term.\nThere will be numerous events springboarding from the seminar series. Applications are being submitted to the Higher Education Innovation Fund for impact, to the Socio-legal Studies Association seminar fund and the Modern Law Review seminar fund. A second seminar series bid is also planned to expand our network to the wider UK, Europe and in particular to increase participation of students and practitioners.\nCollaborative bids from partnerships made during the series are also beginning to take place, such as for the AHRC Transformations Scheme. Our findings are already of interest to intra-governmental agencies. Professor Lorraine Elliott who spoke at the 4th seminar was asked after her presentation to speak about her research to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime. We expect that other research presented will also be picked up by policy makers and other academics. This should increase as the publications from the series are more widely available.
