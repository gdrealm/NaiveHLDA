{"id":"3E2A8B4A-6535-462F-AAD3-3933E37D9B2E","title":"SUPERGEN Energy Storage Hub","abstractText":"Energy storage is more important today than at any time in human history. It has a vital role to play in storing electricity from renewable sources (wind, wave, solar) and is key to the electrification of transport. However, current energy storage technologies are not fit for purpose. No single energy storage technology can meet the needs of all applications, but many of the research challenges to improve performance and reduce costs are common across electrochemical, mechanical and thermal devices: new materials need to be developed and tested, thermodynamic processes have to be optimized, and lab-based prototypes must be suitable for scale-up. These technologies have to be integrated into robust and cost effective systems. In response to the situation, especially within the UK context, we propose to establish a SUPERGEN Energy Storage Hub. The consortium will bring together investigators with strong international and national reputations in energy storage research and spanning the entire value chain from the energy storage technologies themselves, through manufacturing, integration, and evaluation of the whole system in which the energy storage would be embedded. The consortium will address a number of the critical barriers that face progress towards the commercialisation of energy storage and its widespread exploitation in the UK and elsewhere. Members of the consortium cover areas in which the UK has both the scientific capability and an energy system need. The activities will embrace energy policy, as well as a roadmap and a vision for energy storage research in the UK stretching into the future, thus setting the agenda for UK energy storage. Through extensive networking, including strong engagement with all stakeholders in industry, NGOs and government the hub will not only remain informed and inform others about the latest developments in energy storage it will also bring the energy storage community in the UK as a whole closer together and through wide dissemination engage the public. Through the strength of the Hub and its links will come more effective pathways for the exploitation of new research and new ideas in commercial products.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L019469/1","grantId":"EP/L019469/1","fundValue":"3906420","fundStart":"2014-06-30","fundEnd":"2019-06-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"P  Bruce","coPersons":["Patrick  Grant","Nigel Peter Brandon","Andrew  Cruden","Yulong  Ding","Clare P.
