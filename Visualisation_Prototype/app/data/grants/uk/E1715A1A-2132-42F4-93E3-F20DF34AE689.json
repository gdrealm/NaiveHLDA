However, this useful social tool can lead to inaccurate perceptions. On meeting a person from a negatively stereotyped group, we may attempt to overcome this by 'inhibiting' or reducing one social category in favour of another. For example, when encountering a 'black doctor' we may seek to inhibit perceptions based on the 'black' stereotype, but elevate the 'doctor' stereotype. </p> \n<p>One key factor that may be part of this process is 'executive resources' which deal with (in this case) incorporating new with old information. We use this process to keep up with our ever-changing social world, helping us come to terms with new stereotypes. Indeed, during the changing social climate of the nineteen-sixties, new combined stereotypes came in to being, for example 'male nurse'. </p> \n<p>By impairing this process in perceivers, using dual task methodologies (Baddeley, 1996), this project aims to determine if executive resources really are essential when perceiving surprising social category combinations. Furthermore, this project deals with the consequences of surprising combinations and whether thinking about such combinations can offer a potential means of reducing prejudice.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1596","grantId":"RES-000-22-1596","fundValue":"48454","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Russell Robert Hutter","coPersons":["Richard John Crisp","Glyn  Humphreys"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
