This research will reveal the ways in which executive function skills are involved in learning and doing maths and help us to understand why some children find maths easy, and other children struggle.These findings will be used to raise teachersâ€™ awareness of the importance of considering executive functions skills when teaching maths.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I037474/1","grantId":"ES/I037474/1","fundValue":"306536","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Camilla Kate Gilmore","coPersons":["Lucy Elizabeth Cragg"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
