The instrument package is a joint development between Oxford and Imperial College. Oxford's role in the project is to develop a low temperature compatible, space qualified version of the electronics to drive the seismometer, to fabricate that electronics, to integrate the electronics and Imperial sensors heads into flight packages and to calibrate the SEIS-SP sub-system. This proposal is for funding until 31/3/2009, a period which covers the instrument Preliminary Design Review, partial development of the Structural Thermal Model instrument package and fabrication of test equipment for cold calibration od the seismometer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G004226/1","grantId":"ST/G004226/1","fundValue":"145938","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Calcutt","coPersons":["Nicholas Arran Teanby","Neil Edward Bowles"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
