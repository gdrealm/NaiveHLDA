More than 50% of all patients with cancer will receive radiation as part of their treatment. For reasons we do not completely understand radiation is much more effective for treating some kinds of cancer than others. We are trying to understand why it is that some cancers do not respond to treatment. If we can understand what causes some kinds of cancer to fail to respond we may be able to come up with ways to make the treatment more effective. We believe that we may be able to identify some genes that are active in resistant cancers that if we could turn the genes off, or come up with a drug that would interfere with how the gene works, that would then cause the cancer to be more easily cured with radiation. For example radiation causes damage to the DNA in cancer cells but some kinds of cancer are very good at repairing the damage that the radiation causes so they can survive high doses of radiation. If we could interfere with the way the cancer repairs the damage it might make the cancer more sensitive to radiation and would make it easier for us to cure the patient. This is an example of the kind of things this proposal will study.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700730","grantId":"G0700730","fundValue":"18457300","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"William Gillies  McKenna","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
