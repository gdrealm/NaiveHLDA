By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), for example, we can measure changes in the local blood flow that occurs with increased neural activity. This causes an increase in the signal intensity in the MR image in the part of brain that is being used. We can measure for example which parts of the brain are more active while subjects feel an object touch their index finger. One of the problems we have when studying the mechanism underlying our sense of touch is that the changes that occur in the human brain are relatively small. The visual cortex by comparison where information from they eyes is processed for 'seeing', covers an area many times the size. Until now, researchers have therefore concentrated on the visual brain in humans, and have had more limited success in studying the somatosensory cortex. In a collaboration between the Schools of Psychology and Physics at the University of Nottingham, we have started using some cutting-edge technology to measure responses to touch in the human brain.. By using a very high field magnetic resonance (MR) scanner developed by the world-class Physics group at the University of Nottingham we can detect signal changes in small brain areas much better. We can measure robust neural responses non-invasively with much higher spatial resolution than has previously been possible. The neuroscience questions in this proposal fit squarely into the remit of the BBSRC of understanding normal human function, but our proposed research also has a strong interdisciplinary component. Because imaging at very high field strengths requires a lot of technical expertise a collaborative link between researchers in neuroscience and physics is absolutely crucial. Specifically, we will use high-resolution fMRI to map carefully the detailed anatomy and function of the human somatosensory cortex by looking for an orderly map of the representation of the fingers in the brain. In pilot data we have collected during the last year we demonstrate that with very high (1mm3) resolution measurements we can indeed reveal a topographic map of the hand representation in the human brain. We also aim to map how the brain processes different frequencies of touch (for example an indentation compared to a tap). Animal models have shown that this involve different parts of the somatosensory system on the spatial scale of several millimetres. We will then study how attention modulates the perception of touch and how the responses in the brain that underlie these perceptions. While subjects are being scanned, we will ask them to attend to a specific part of the skin on their fingers. We will then test how paying attention changes the responses in the part of the brain that processes information from that region of the skin surface. From these measurements, we can then make inferences about how the brain integrates information across the different brain regions used in finger representation, and how attention acts to modulate these responses.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G008906/1","grantId":"BB/G008906/1","fundValue":"337308","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Several labs have now replicated our original findings and used the methodology we introduced to study the function of the somatosensory cortex.
