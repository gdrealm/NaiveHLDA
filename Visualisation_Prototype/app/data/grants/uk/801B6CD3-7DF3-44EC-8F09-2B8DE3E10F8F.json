{"id":"801B6CD3-7DF3-44EC-8F09-2B8DE3E10F8F","title":"GARNet 2020","abstractText":"GARNet provides leadership and coordination to UK scientists carrying out basic plant science research. A united, forward-looking and well-connected basic plant science research base underpins progress in crop science, agronomy, agriculture and the plant-based biomaterials and bioenergy industries. This role is therefore now more necessary than ever given the importance of plant science in meeting global grand challenges in the production of food, feed, fibre and fuel using diminishing resources of land and fresh water. \n\nOur main aims are to support UK plant scientists by: \n\n- Equipping them with the right skills and resources to take on new ways of working in science, including using large sequencing datasets, large-scale image analysis, and multi-scale predictive biology.\n\n- Promoting connections and collaborations between basic plant scientists and the agriculture, bioenergy and biotechnology end-user communities.\n \n- Managing and extending GARNet communication platforms to promote knowledge exchange within the community and to be a single point of contact for external parties.\n\nConcrete outcomes of the proposed work will be raised awareness of large data management, imaging technologies, and multi-scale modelling approaches to plant science, and training in these areas at workshops and conferences throughout the grant term. We expect to run other events as required by the community, which is represented to GARNet administration by the GARNet Advisory Committee. These events will be followed up with expert FAQ pages on the GARNet website. Public pages on synthetic biology, open access and next generation sequencing for plant science are also planned. \n\nActivities in the above areas will be of direct benefit to basic plant scientists, from post-graduate students to senior academic staff, who will gain access to any resources, training and connections they need to further and apply their research. GARNet will be their link to key resource providers, negotiating and simplifying access to resources including high performance computing power, microarray and sequencing services. Plant scientists from all backgrounds will also be able to use GARNet community networking platforms freely to share news and promote their work. \n\nGARNet will benefit funders of UK plant science, principally BBSRC, by adding value to the funding they put into the plant research community. GARNet events, website, mailing list and newsletter all help promote effective and efficient working across the research community and encourage knowledge exchange and collaboration. In addition, representatives from industry and publishing are connected to our social media and attend our events, increasing global exposure of UK research and promoting industry-academic collaborations and other mechanisms of maximising the impact of research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M004376/1","grantId":"BB/M004376/1","fundValue":"597908","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2020-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"James Augustus Murray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
