{"id":"E626C60A-C702-40B8-A11C-91BEE5A0A295","title":"Superspreading: self-organization on nano-scale","abstractText":"The mechanism(s) underlying the phenomenon of superspreading is somewhat mysterious and an investigation of it using a set of new and comprehensive experiments is proposed. The results will be used to formulate new physical and mathematical modelling of the process. The investigation will include studies of the self-organization on nano-scale of superspreaders at the liquid / air and solid - liquid interfaces, and nano-scale forces in thin layers, and their influence on superspreading behaviour. Using independent experiments (Fourier Transform Infra-red Spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy) the nano-scale forces will be directly measured and their influence will be incorporated into the theoretical modelling. The latter leads to predicting the way of synthesis of new superspreaders with desirable properties. The proposed research is an International effort with Professor Ramon Rubio (Universdad Complutense, Madrid, Spain) and Dr Randal Hill (DowCorning, USA).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D078814/1","grantId":"EP/D078814/1","fundValue":"228024","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nidal  Hilal","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
