Creating dialogue and networking between academic and non-academic groups (from the aforementioned organisations/groups) was a core aim that ran through the project's activities and impacts. Academic impact has been made through: seminar and confenrences papers delivered at national and intermational conferences. Academic impact has also been made through publications: Hines' monograph 'Gender. Diversity, Recognition and Citizenship: Towards a Politics of Difference (2014, Palgrave) and three articles in progress for the peer reviewed journals 'Feminist Theory'; 'Sociologyical Review'; 'Sociology'. An edited book from the project conference is in progress for the Routledge Book Series 'Critical Diversities' edited by the PI and Prof. Yvette Taylor. Impact to non-academic groups has been made through the wide dissemination of the research report and project briefings to key stakeholder groups. These have also been published on the website of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Gender Studies. The PI has given presentations to 6 stakeholder groups (Sparkle, GIRES, Trans Bare All; Scottish Transgender Alliance, FtM London, Equality and Diversity Forum). The wide use of social media has enabled impacts to be delivered via twitter and blogging sites. The use of social media has maximised the project's knowledge exchange and impact.

Using participatory action research methodology proved fruitful for sharing knowledge between and amongst these groups. Participatory action research thus allowed a two-tiered flow of knowledge exchange, through which the PI and the groups and individuals involved in the project formulated a set of recommendations for future changes to the Gender Recognition Act (GRA). These recommendations will feed into forthcoming consultations with the Government 'Cross- Parliamentary Forum on Transsexualism'. The project's scientific impacts are also evident in the strengthening of the PI's networks with cultural practitioners. In this way, the project has cemented the PI's working relationships with a number of individuals and groups within the cultural industries, working for example, as photographers, performers, writers, musicians, artists, filmmakers on themes related to gender and sexual diversity. The knowledge exchange project enabled further links between relevant academic and non-academic groups , which have been solidified through the formation of 'Sexgen'; a network of academics, activists and cultural practitioners. Additional societal impacts can be seen through the PIs involvement with events at Leeds Art Gallery and Selfridges: Findings have led to the publication of a research report, which develops recommendations for changes to gender recognition legislation and sets out best practice guidelines. This has been widely distributed to stakeholder groups. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education","dataset":"gtr"}
