Energy demand is reduced due to its potential for seamless integration of novel pervasive sensors with legacy technologies for indoor and outdoor monitoring using existing power line infrastructures. The project builds upon our expertise in communication and information technology at King's College London and the pioneering mote technology developed at the Newcastle University in the EU ASTRA, and the EPSRC MESSAGE, projects. The impact of these results will be significant at a time when UK Government acknowledges the crucial role of Intelligent Vehicle and Transport Systems, IVTS, technology to make more efficient use of existing infrastructure in the delivery of a low carbon transport systems for the future. The development of dense, pervasive, multitask sensor networks, that provide real-time traffic flow information and monitor several environmental factors (such as pollutants from vehicles) has been demonstrated in MESSAGE to facilitate the development of more efficient traffic control schemes, thus leading to a significant reduction in the energy consumption and environmental pollution. We aim to disseminate the results not only through outstanding publications but importantly through existing links in the regional transport boards, Foresight Intelligent Infrastructure Forum in UK and Europe, and ITS World Congress generating knowledge dialogue at all stages of the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I000054/1","grantId":"EP/I000054/1","fundValue":"164233","fundStart":"2010-11-17","fundEnd":"2013-02-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We published our findings of this project in the International Journals and conferences.
