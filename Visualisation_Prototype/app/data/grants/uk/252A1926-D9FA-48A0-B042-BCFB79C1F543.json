{"id":"252A1926-D9FA-48A0-B042-BCFB79C1F543","title":"Youth Mental Health and Wellbeing","abstractText":"Mental health problems typically develop at the critical age between 12 and 25 years and if left untreated can have serious social and developmental consequences leading to poorer prognosis and greater disability over the life course. This highlights the importance of providing timely treatment and developing special services for youth focusing on improving long term mental health through ensuring consistency in care. However, the current organisation of mental health services in the UK and worldwide means that young people typically attend a children's service until the age of 18 but at that point must transfer to adult care without any support to make the transition. This raises serious concerns about the quality of services offered to young people at the most vulnerable stage of their lives.\n\nThese concerns have highlighted globally the need for the reform of mental health services so that they are developmentally appropriate and responsive to the needs of youth. In response to this, various national and international associations have been established to promote the health and wellbeing of young people. However, these groups work in isolation and fail to integrate partners from diverse disciplines and organisations to exchange knowledge and best practice in this field. The proposed seminar will bridge this gap by creating a multi-disciplinary network of national and international leading experts in youth mental health to:\n1. identify the big questions around youth mental health and highlight challenges in systems change related to the development of youth friendly mental health services\n2. highlight exemplars of new and ongoing research and best practice in youth mental health\n3. generate consensus on what the gold standard of a &quot;youth mental health model&quot; should consist of \n4. promote public and professional interest and awareness around youth mental health issues and the importance of developing targeted, evidence based mental health services for young people\n5. raise awareness of the importance of stigma reduction as a way to maximise service use, treatment adherence and positive peer relationships\nThis network was initiated by a UK and Irish group of national and international academics, practitioners, researchers and service users who share the same vision of improving mental health outcomes for young people. The applicants have built upon their expertise to develop in consultation with young people a seminar programme on key themes of youth mental health including: a) youth mental health and stigma b) e-health and new technologies for youth mental health and c) the development of youth friendly mental health services. \nThe seminar will comprise nine one day events over a three year period including talks by leading experts and poster presentations by PhD students and early career researchers followed by discussion groups to promote dialogue, debate and decision making. The seminars will be held in different geographical locations in the UK and Ireland to reflect the international nature of our work and enable wider participation. \nYear 1\n1.
