{"id":"57FCD0D3-A3E7-450B-A899-854A8363C3A1","title":"Decoding French, Learner Motivation and Language Learning","abstractText":"<p>There is widespread evidence of a lack of motivation amongst adolescents for learning foreign languages in England. There is also growing research evidence that learners of French at Key Stage 3 may not be able to decode effectively from graphemes (printed letters and strings of letters), to phonemes (the sounds of the French language), so as to manage at least an approximation of the correct sounds of French words and phrases. Research also suggests that grapheme-phoneme correspondences are rarely taught in schools. </p>\n\n<p>The students’ inability to make these correspondences may present itself as a major obstacle to being able to recognize words and to read French and, consequently, may be having a negative effect on their motivation to learn the language. The proposed project will investigate the interface between motivation to learn French and students’ ability to process the written language. A representative sample of students in years 7, 8 and 9 will be asked to complete a research instrument which specifically examines this interface.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1651","grantId":"RES-000-22-1651","fundValue":"45856","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Seven workshops throughout UK attended by over 200 teachers Education Policy & public services","person":"Ernesto  Macaro","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" students' inability to decode French words (the ability to make the link between the written form and the spken form) led to demotivation and potentially a reason for giving up studying French in year 10 By teaching decoding skills explicitly Education","dataset":"gtr"}
