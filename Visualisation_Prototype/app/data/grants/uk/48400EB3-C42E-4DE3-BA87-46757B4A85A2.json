In particular the research analyses Spain's re&shy; emergence as a major power in the western Mediterranean, i.e. in north Africa and- above all- in Italy. By 1706-07, Philip V had lost control not only of most of Spanish Italy and some of its North African territories, but also of most of the Crown of Aragon (and with it of much of Spain's Mediterranean coastline). \nHowever, from 1707 Philip successfully re-asserted his authority in the Aragonese territories and from 1713 firmly re-established the Spanish hold in Africa and- more striking&shy; settled his sons in much of what had been Spanish Italy. This was a remarkable achievement, with enormous implications for Philip's Spanish subjects, for many in Italy, and for Europe in general. The proposed research will pay considerable attention to the domestic transformation in Spain which enabled Philip V to succeed, and to the attitudes and responses of those affected, above all in Spain but also in Italy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E505724/1","grantId":"AH/E505724/1","fundValue":"27198","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Storrs","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
