The development of molecular tools for species identification and classification, are argued by some to render taxonomic data production more precise, rapid and publicly accessible when coupled with simultaneous developments in informatics. This should be understood against a backdrop of public, policy and scientific concern about unprecedented rates of decline in the planetâ€™s biodiversity. The developments are gradually being laid out on a global playing field and as such, not only is access to information a burning issue, but so is access to innovatory power and technological know-how. </p>\n\n<p>The research is an interdisciplinary sociological study which will document the changing taxonomic practices, claims and material/social/natural/political implications these may have for the different global communities involved in these debates. A major part of the research will be to integrate sociological observations into a global forum of scientific collaborators and users designed especially for this research. It is anticipated that this forum will bring together sociological, scientific and policy reflections about the issues being debated in a way to encourage reflexivity and potentially inform a more socially robust and publicly accountable science.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1470","grantId":"RES-000-23-1470","fundValue":"197503","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire  Waterton","coPersons":["Brian  Wynne","Johannes Christian  Vogel"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
