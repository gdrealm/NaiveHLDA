{"id":"F749AFC5-11E2-47EF-B325-CDBBDFE1D476","title":"STFC Global Challenge Network in Battery Science and Technology","abstractText":"Battery technologies are already a part of our day-to-day lives, particularly through their application in electronic devices. Indeed, the development of Li- based batteries was driven by the consumer electronics industry. However, in the future a range of battery technologies (not limited to Li-ion) will play an increasing role in our lives with applications as diverse as automotive power trains and grid storage to micro-batteries for &quot;on micro-chip&quot; power and biomedical batteries to power pacemakers.\n\nIn order to extend and optimise and the application of these devices in a range of environments, fundamental improvements to our understanding of the fundamental processes occurring in batteries are essential. Large-scale facilities research is essential to achieve this, using a range of techniques at neutron, synchrotron and high performance computing facilities.\n\nUtilising a range of neutron, x-ray or HPC techniques in isolation provides opportunities to improve understanding of batteries - by combining the strengths of world leading practitioners across a range of complementary techniques and facilities we will have a unique opportunity to rapidly advance the field of battery science, and thorough our partnerships with industry translate this leading research into commercial reality.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K00171X/1","grantId":"ST/K00171X/1","fundValue":"253672","fundStart":"2013-02-04","fundEnd":"2016-02-03","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Shearing","coPersons":["Daniel  Brett"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
