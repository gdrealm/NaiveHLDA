Existing ionisation techniques for the mass spectrometric analysis of labile molecules (electrospray, matrix-assisted lased desorptio/ionisation) depend on the presence of charge-accepthing features in the analyte. We aim to develop a carbon nanofibre-based ionisation device, which could allow field desorption/ionisation of a much wider range of compounds and, in particular, proteins, polymers and hydocarbons. The carbon nanofibres should afford high electric fields able to ionise by electron withdrawal ( field ionisation ) molecules with high ionisation potentials ; the availability of lower fields should promote ionisation by proton attachment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D057957/1","grantId":"EP/D057957/1","fundValue":"51555","fundStart":"2006-09-04","fundEnd":"2009-03-03","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"T  Drewello","coPersons":["Peter  Scott","David Mark Haddleton","Peter Robert Taylor","Andrew  Clark"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
