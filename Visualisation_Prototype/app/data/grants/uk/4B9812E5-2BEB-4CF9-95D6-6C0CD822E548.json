They are also important for the economic prosperity of the UK as carbohydrates are major components of most foods and beverages. A principal way in which we develop new medicines, therapies, materials or other scientific advances in biology is by understanding the structure of molecules and how this structure determines their stability and interactions with other molecules. This approach has underpinned the last 50 years of developments in genetics, medicines, biomaterials etc., mainly through development of the tools for studying the structure of proteins and nucleic acids. Our understanding of the roles of carbohydrates in biology is much poorer than that of proteins, not because carbohydrates are less common than proteins or aren't involved in critical physiological processes (they clearly are), but because the main tools used in structural biology aren't easily applicable to carbohydrates. This long standing problem has resulted in our knowing little about the behaviour or function of the great majority of carbohydrates. Obviously, in order to better develop this level of understanding we need new tools for studying carbohydrate structure. For these tools to be generally useful they should be sensitive to a large amount of structural information, they should be able to differentiate between individual sugars and their various polymers, they should be able to inform on the stability and interactions of carbohydrates, and they should be able to do all this for all, or at least most, carbohydrates under a wide range of conditions. Raman spectroscopies fulfil all of these requirements and we will develop these laser-based techniques for studying carbohydrates in both solutions and the condensed phase (the two physiological conditions in which most carbohydrates are normally found). Both experimental Raman techniques and advanced forms of data analysis will be utilised to set up a complementary tool set for characterising the structure of any carbohydrate, from the smallest sugar to the largest polymer, and their functional behaviour. We have already developed analogous tools for studying other biomolecules and our preliminary studies verify that these tools will be highly useful to biologists studying carbohydrates. This pump priming project will establish a solid foundation for future developments and projects by, firstly, generating a spectral library for interpretation of carbohydrate data and, secondly, optimising specialised forms of data analysis for understanding the mechanisms of structural changes in carbohydrate polymers relevant to physiological processes. New tools generate new science and, ultimately, applications in medicine and industry. A great advantage of the Raman spectroscopies that we will develop is their ability to be used on many different problems, and particularly their ability to collect data on carbohydrates in the condensed phase, which is relevant to many biological examples but is not amenable to conventional glycobiology techniques. Therefore, our project will be the vital and large first step in designing a range of tools that will lead to many future developments in glycobiology, medicine and agriculture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H023763/1","grantId":"BB/H023763/1","fundValue":"116431","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project helped to establish results for EP/J019623/1, and generated a key paper (Cheeseman et al, JACS (2011) 133, 4997) with 25 citations that established a new level of performance of computational modelling, attracting the great interest of colleagues (who are now following our approach) and Gaussian Inc, who produce the world's main quantum chemical software.

This approach is now being adopted by other researchers in order to understand how interactions with water molecules regulates the behaviour and activity of molecules. Through providing a clearer way to see how interactions with solvent molecules (e.g. water) control the behaviour of biomolecules, particularly carbohydrates. This opens a new way to characterising how complex carbohydrates perform their biological functions, which is currently very difficult to do. Considering that over half of the biomass on the planet is carbohydrate-based, that covers a wide range of potential impacts.
