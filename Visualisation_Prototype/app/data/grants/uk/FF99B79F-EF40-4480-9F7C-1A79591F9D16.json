Together we aim to create a research-based community of practice where positive strategies can be shared, explored and developed, then disseminated to the wider teaching and research community through the creation of teaching ideas and resources.\n<br />\n<br />Project objectives include:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li>To add to the understanding of the operation of heteronormativity (the assumption that heterosexuality is normal, so anything else is abnormal) in school contexts.</li>\n <li>To create a community of practice within which teachers can develop effective approaches to addressing sexualities equality within the broader context of inclusive education.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D00537X/1","grantId":"ES/D00537X/1","fundValue":"575436","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth Anne Atkinson","coPersons":["Michael  Reiss","Nick  Givens","Renee Dea DePalma","David  Nixon"],"organisation":"University of Sunderland","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
