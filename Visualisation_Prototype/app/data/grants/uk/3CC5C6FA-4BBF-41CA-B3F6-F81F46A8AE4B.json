This question has long captivated philosophers, educators, scientists, and yet in many ways it remains a great mystery. We do not know how ?language gets built?, although we are more confident that we know at least some of the skills that language relies on to get off the ground. We also know something about what parts of the brain seem to be particularly good at language in adults, but it is unclear how or why this happens over the course of language development. In our research programme, we intend to use several techniques to investigate the way that language develops in children?s brains, and how children?s ability to use their hearing and listening skills might help language acquisition succeed. We can measure children?s abilities by looking at the amount of time that it takes for them to respond to a particular kind of sound, word, or sentence. We can ?see? children?s brains by taking advantage of the way that tiny particles in our body line up in a strong magnetic field. This method, called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), allows us to take multiple ?pictures? of people?s brains, giving us an idea of how their brains are structured, and how they react to different types of sounds. All of our experiments are designed to be fun and interesting for the children that volunteer for them. We are also going to studying children with special language problems in order to figure out what makes them different from children who have an easier time acquiring language. We will present our research results to the public in interviews, articles, and on our lab website, and will also spend time explaining our research to the children and parents who volunteer for our studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400341","grantId":"G0400341","fundValue":"229301","fundStart":"2005-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frederic  Dick","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
