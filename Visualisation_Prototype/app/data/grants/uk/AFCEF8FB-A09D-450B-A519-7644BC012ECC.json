Sefiane will spend this period (April-June 2008) in Toronto working in the group of Prof. Charles Ward. The programme of work includes experimental work to be undertaken by Dr K. Sefiane, supported by Prof. Ward research assistants. The aim is to compare some experimental data obtained in two independent previous investigations as well as undetake new experiments in Toronto and draw conclusions about the evaporation of liquids and interfacial conditions.Professor CA Ward has visited Edinburgh twice and Dr K. Sefiane has also visited Toronto twice, the latest being in Novembre 2007 (for two weeks). The above programme of work has been agreed and the necessary equipment is in place to make the best out of the proposed visit. Prof. CA Ward and Dr K. Sefiane have recently published a substantial joint review on the topic of thermocapillary convection (K. Sefiane, CA. Ward; Recent advances on thermocapillary flows and interfacial conditions , Advances in Colloid and Interface Science, 134-135, 201-223, 2007).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F057547/1","grantId":"EP/F057547/1","fundValue":"23322","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Khellil  Sefiane","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
