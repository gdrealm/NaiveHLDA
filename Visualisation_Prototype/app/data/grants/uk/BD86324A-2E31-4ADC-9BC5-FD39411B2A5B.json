{"id":"BD86324A-2E31-4ADC-9BC5-FD39411B2A5B","title":"Holocaust Writing and Translation","abstractText":"Writing about the Holocaust, whether consisting of eyewitness testimony, autobiography, or literary works, is almost always read in translation, and critical discussion of these works almost always refers to published and unpublished translations. However, there has been very little critical discussion of issues arising from the translation of these texts. Testimonial and autobiographical writing is often discussed either in terms of the authenticity of witness and the direct and unmediated rendering of experience in language, or in terms of the impossibility of rendering the experience of the Holocaust in language and communicating it to others. Other, more philosophical approaches that draw on post-structuralist theories assume that the Holocaust as a catastrophe of civilisation has brought about a general crisis of language in which authentic signification is no longer possible without unacceptable ideological interpretations or descending into kitsch. Considering how much of this discussion is concerned with theories of language, it is striking that the issue of translation has never attracted so little significant critical attention.\\n\\nThis project proceeds from the assumption that the insights of Translation Studies have something new and significant to bring to the study of Holocaust writing. The participants will investigate the following issues: why it has taken so long for critical discussion of Holocaust writing to begin to investigate translation; how processes of translation affect the reading and reception of Holocaust writing; how translation strategies are affected by, and themselves affect, the changing status of the Holocaust in the cultures under consideration; what the study of translation can tell us about the different ways in which the Holocaust is written into national, cultural, group and individual identities.\\n\\nThe project's focus will be on texts written by 'first generation' writers, that is, those who had direct personal experience of the Holocaust; textual genres under consideration will be eyewitness accounts, autobiographical texts and fictional and poetic works that deal with the Holocaust. Also under consideration will be theoretical works that deal with the issues of Holocaust representation, and which are often read in translation. The corpus will consist of well-known and influential texts by writers such as Anne Frank, Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel, Ruth Kluger and Paul Celan, as well as works by lesser-known writers and eyewitness accounts published only in anthologies.\\n\\nThe aim of the project is to establish a network of scholars from several fields of study: Translation Studies, Holocaust Studies, and scholars of Life Writing and Holocaust Literature in a broad range of languages. The project will be managed by a core group (Peter Davies, Edinburgh; Andrea Hammel, Sussex; Piotr Kuhiwczak, Warwick; Jean Boase-Beier, UEA; Marion Winters, Heriot-Watt), who will coordinate a series of workshops and gather bibliographical resources, as well as organising public engagement events with bodies such as the Wiener Library, London. The workshops will bring together the participants in the network in order to discuss and develop a theoretical framework and a corpus of texts, and to work towards a bid for a major research project. Four workshops are planned: \\n\\nApril 2010, University of Edinburgh: 'Holocaust Writing and Translation: Introducing Issues of Terminology and Trauma'\\n\\nJuly 2010, University of Sussex: 'Autobiography, Life Writing and Translation'\\n\\nDecember 2010, UEA: 'Questions of Genre in Holocaust Writing and the Impact on Translation'\\n\\nApril 2011, Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies, London: 'Eyewitness accounts and translation'\\nThis workshop will include a public event run in conjunction with the Wiener Library.\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H033653/1","grantId":"AH/H033653/1","fundValue":"30771","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The collaborative workshops with project partners - the Wiener Library, the British Centre for Literary Translation - have led to further work.

We identified areas for future research, and the network's activities have led to the development of a more focussed, comparative project on translations of Holocaust testimonies into English and German. The work currently being done by the network participants should feed into the discussion of translation of refugee and victim testimony beyond the Holocaust.
