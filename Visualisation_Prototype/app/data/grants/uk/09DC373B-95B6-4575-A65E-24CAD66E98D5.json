{"id":"09DC373B-95B6-4575-A65E-24CAD66E98D5","title":"Interactive Newsprint 'Telling Tales'","abstractText":"The Interactive Newsprint project brought together communities, technologists, researchers and professional journalists to develop and test a new way of telling stories using paper that connects to the internet. This research addresses key challenges facing the UK's traditional news/media landscape disrupting the flow of news and information to purely online or portable web based platforms to offer a more widely accessible and sustainable series of alternatives. Alongside user testing the technology and interaction in the field the researchers and communities are exploring new forms of story-telling and advertising and new revenue and subscription models unique to interactive newsprint.\n\nThe 'Telling Tales of Engagment' grant will enable the research team to tell people from the UK and international research community, professionals in the media industry and the wider general public about the work. \n\nA small team will present prototypes to print media companies in the UK, India and America. They will link their activities to two major events presenting it at the Unbox festival in India, February 2013 and again at South-by-Southwest in Austin, Texas in March. Lead by Egglestone, the PI on the original project - the team will continue their activities to tell the story of the proect journey using social media tools like YouTube, Twitter and facebook. They will also develop further stories for mainstream TV, Radio and print publications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K037226/1","grantId":"EP/K037226/1","fundValue":"10034","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Egglestone","coPersons":["Jon  Rogers"],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
