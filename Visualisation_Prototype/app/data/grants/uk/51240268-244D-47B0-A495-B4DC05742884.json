This is a proposal to create a comprehensive electronic archiving and analysis resource for CD spectroscopy that can be used by the structural biology and bioinformatics communities. It will include the running, curation and development of the Protein Circular Dichroism Data Bank (PCDDB), a deposition and searchable data bank for circular dichroism spectra of biomacromolecules. The PCDDB will be a resource for structural molecular biology and bioinformatics, and a public archive for data sharing of spectroscopic data to parallel the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a long-existing and valuable reference data bank for protein crystal and NMR data. This project also includes the operation, upgrading and maintenance of DICHROWEB, a widely-used user-friendly online server for the analysis of circular dichroism data. Together these two bioinformatics facilities will provide a comprehensive package of enabling and supportive resources in CD spectroscopy for the Structural Biology and Bioinformatics communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F010362/1","grantId":"BB/F010362/1","fundValue":"246791","fundStart":"2008-02-15","fundEnd":"2013-02-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert W Janes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
