In this study, we have identified, from looking at families with inherited skin disease,two genes called iRHOM2 and ADAM17 generating proteins that interact with each other in skin. This was surprising as the two inherited skin conditions are quite distinct in their clinical presentation. The iRHOM2/ADAM17 interaction appears to play a very important role in the way the keratinocytes (the major cell of the top layer of skin called the epidermis) move and prevent infection after wounding. The increase in ADAM17 by iRHOM2 causes the keratinocytes to release growth factors and anti-inflammatory molecules that make the cells move quicker and prevent bacterial infection. Also it alters the way cells adhere to each other by modifying the cell adhesion machinery (in the desmosome) so they can also move and migrate over the wound much quicker. Thus we believe activation of this pathway may be an attractive target for improved chronic and acute cutaneous wound repair.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L010402/1","grantId":"MR/L010402/1","fundValue":"371619","fundStart":"2014-05-27","fundEnd":"2017-05-26","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Peter Kelsell","coPersons":["Tom  MacDonald","Edel  OToole"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
