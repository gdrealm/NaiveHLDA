This work has already shown promise not only in the particular area of anti-counterfeiting, where preliminary testing with consumer goods and pharmaceutical packaging has demonstrated a capability to discriminate between genuine and counterfeit articles, but also in areas such as forensic science, in airport security -for the identification of liquids - even in studies related to the quantitation, in the growing plant sweet wormwood, of the natirual anti-malarial compound artemesinin. The Business Idea ifor which we seek funding s that illumination of a solid or liquid surface and the detection of the reflected spectrum provides a simple, rapid, non-destructive characteristic 'signature' of that surface, when portable hardware is used in conjunction with a reference database and relatively straightforward analysis software,","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G000204/1","grantId":"ST/G000204/1","fundValue":"86037","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"George  Fraser","coPersons":["Nigel Paul Bannister"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
