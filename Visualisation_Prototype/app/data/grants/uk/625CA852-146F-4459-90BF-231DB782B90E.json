{"id":"625CA852-146F-4459-90BF-231DB782B90E","title":"ACAS: Analysis of Complex Acoustic Scenes","abstractText":"For speech recognition technology to work reliably in noisy everyday environments, solutions are needed to the more general Machine Listening problems of sound source separation and acoustic scene understanding. This proposal seeks a four week visit to LabRosa at Columbia University, one of the internationally leading research groups working in these areas, with the aim of exploiting the synergy between their research and the statistical speech recognition research conducted by the proposer's host institution. The collaboration will focus on a dataset constructed from recordings made in a noisy domestic living environment that have been recorded as part of an existing EPSRC project, CHiME, for which the proposer is PI. The proposal outlines a number of immediate research lines that will be pursued tackling the problems of voice detection, source separation and binaural source localization. Possibilities for a longer term collaboration in the development of a model-driven acoustic scene analysis framework will also be discussed during the visit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I004181/1","grantId":"EP/I004181/1","fundValue":"9978","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jon  Barker","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
