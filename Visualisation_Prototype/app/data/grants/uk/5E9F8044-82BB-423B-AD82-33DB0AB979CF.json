{"id":"5E9F8044-82BB-423B-AD82-33DB0AB979CF","title":"[ENVIRONMENT] Open Geoscience Data Models","abstractText":"Geological Survey Organisations (GSOs) are generally the principal repository of geoscience data in their respective countries and this is potentially an extremely valuable resource for economic development. However, it is also common that this resource is underutilised because of the way the data holdings are organised and because of difficulties in accessing them. These problems are most common in the GSOs of developing countries.\n\nA well managed and readily available geoscience information resource is a key component of a poverty alleviation strategy in a developing nation. This is because such information can contribute to development in the following ways: \n - Clean water supplies from unpolluted groundwater resources improve health and release the economic potential of women who no longer spend their days carrying water to meet their domestic needs;\n - Identifies primary mineral resources which can be exploited as part of a wealth generation strategy, by providing raw materials for export or indigenous production; and\n - Identification of natural hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, flooding or naturally occurring toxic substances.\n\nThe British Geological Survey (BGS) has been designing and building geosciences databases for several decades. We now have a wealth of mature and well documented designs. We have a reputation for excellence in this area and are contacted by other GSOs and industry for copies of our designs. However, this is presently an ad hoc process which requires an awareness of BGS' skills and knowledge that we do share our designs at no cost.\n\nIt is our aim to provide an initial resource of open, ready to use database designs that will be available to all on a public website. We will also build a self sustaining community which will develop these designs and add additional designs to meet the needs of the wider environmental community.\n\nIn order to achieve our goals we proposed a two year project to carry out the following activities:\n 1. Create a web based resource hosted by the BGS which contains downloadable Database Design Packages.\n 2. Build a community of interested parties to maximise the uptake of the downloadable Database Design Packages and exchange ideas on good data management practices within geoscience.\n 3. Develop a strategy to ensure community sustainability and ensure that a web based resource is maintained long after the project ends.\n\nIt is anticipated that the primary application of the data model packages would be by GSOs creating new databases to hold geoscientific data or used as templates to compare their current designs against. \n\nThe data model packages would all conform to NERC Standards, so by adopting elements of the data models end users would inherently be aligning themselves with the same high standards. The adoption of common internationally accredited standards promotes good data management practice and could facilitate future data sharing and system integration opportunities.\n\nWe expect the project to produce the following benefits:\n - More GSOs will have access to huigh quality geoscience database designs, which should lead to greater use of such designs\n - Greater opportunity for environmental modelling because improved data infrastructure\n - Greater opportunity to re-purpose data or create commercially valuable derived data products\n - Increasing the usefulness of data through centralised descriptions of the meaning and inter-relationships of the information\n - Increase the time spent on adding value to and interpreting data by making it easier and quicker to find and access data\n - New long lasting multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional partnerships will be formed which should lead to future collaborative research &amp; funding opportunities","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I022175/1","grantId":"NE/I022175/1","fundValue":"89488","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  As briefly described in the objectives section the project produced a number of downloadable database design packages. Initially these were referred to as data model downloads packages but it became apparent that the vast majority of potential users were non-database experts and therefore did not necessarily understand the specialised field of data modelling, but they did understand that databases required an underlying design. \nThe downloads were made up of relational data models in the form of entity relations (ER) diagrams, plain English documents (available in MS Word and PDF to maximise access), implementation scripts, example data and links to associated dictionary data sources.\nThe BGS staff on the project produced four full database design packages and a further three are in progress, which, will be released regardless of the knowledge exchange project formally coming to an end. \nThe BGS produced downloads were complemented by a number of designs made available by project partners and associated organisations, these were hosted on the information providers website and links provided on EarthDataModels.org model library.\n\n2011 - total downloads: 655 from 188 unique users \n2012 - total downloads: 2,531 from 620 unique users\n2013 - total downloads: 3,618 from 578 unique users Chemicals,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Garry Richard BakerJeremy Raymond GilesRICHARD ALAN HUGHES","coPersons":["Carl James Watson"],"organisation":"NERC British Geological Survey","findingsText":" The majority of time spent on the project was directly related to the technical aspects of the work, adapting existing data model designs for a wider audience, producing introductory and technical documentation and creating the websites to disseminate these outputs. Knowledge exchange communications with project partners took place regularly and has continued after the project officially ended. Special technical and community building visits helped to cement relationships between community members whilst presentations at international conferences raised awareness of the project aims and outputs.\nBy the end of the three years the project team had delivered on each of the stated objectives, had produced two separate web resources, one branded as part of the popular BGS website and another designed as an independent community website. A large amount of plain English documentation was produced and data model designs were all made available for free download via the two project websites.\nNew contacts and knowledge exchange relationships were established and have already lead to new collaborations that would not have happened without the project taking place. Lesson Learnt\n\nLL1: When working with developing countries there is a real danger that the security situation can change rapidly and travel plans which seemed reasonable in the planning phase of a long running-project may become impossible within months. Consider alternatives and have, at least high level, back up plans in place.\nLL2: Creating and maintain a new community discussion forum takes a lot of time and effort from a setup and administration point of view, if such a facility is justified then it is possibly better to create a group within an existing social media platform, such as LinkedIn or Google Groups.\nLL3: Building a community without making funds available to all parties for the travel and expenses required to carry out the necessary face to face contacts seriously limits the effectiveness of the community.\n\nConclusions:\n\nC1: Geological Surveys around the world face similar challenges and produce similar data models\nC2: Face to face communication produces better outputs and stronger relationships/networks than remote methods\nC3: Many of the experiences developed within organisations such as the BGS are directly relevant to organisations responsible for the management of spatial data, not just those involved in the geosciences.\nC4: As with C3, above, there are a few organisations, such as BGS, who could share a wealth of experience with regards to producing commercial outputs by deriving digital products from well structured data.\nC5: The project team delivered on each of the stated objectives, however, efforts to address the following objective were limited: &quot;Contribute to the ongoing efforts to ensure water security&quot;. Despite providing links to relevant existing public data models on EarthDataModels.org the project team did not contribute a new design, this was due to the priorities identified by our project partners during the mid to latter phases of the project.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nR1: Future project plans for similar initiatives should include contingency for disruption to travel plans due to security concerns, especially for countries which are identified through the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office Travel advice service as being prone to high levels of crime or potential for terrorism threats, even if the situation appears calm during the project planning phase.\nR2: Future publically funded projects which involve the creation of geoscientific databases should include adequate resources to produce public versions of the underlying data models used or produced.\nR3: There are enough organisations actively engaged in geoscience data modelling to justify a workshop or dedicated session at an international geoscience conference.\nR4: Use the most appropriate branding for dissemination of public knowledge and if necessary use more than one communication channel, tailoring each to the intended audience. The EarthDataModels.org website was deliberately 'Open' and community branded, rather than BGS branded. This worked well when attempting to encourage technically sophisticated project partners and others to contribute material as these contributors tended to have their own strong brands which they were happy to associate with a project initiative rather than appear to be part of a another 'rival' brand. However, there were certain other organisations that were encouraged to take part because the project was lead by a well respected organisation, these tended to be the less technically developed institutions such as the GSOs in sub-Saharan Africa.
