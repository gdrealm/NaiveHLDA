This is an often inevitable consequence of the overuse of antibiotics, and means that a continual new pipeline of therapeutic drugs must be produced. In the case of Mtb, targeting its complicated fatty acid metabolism pathways and cell wall structure have traditionally been very effective ways of disabling and killing the bacterium. Mtb has a dense outer layer (termed the envelope or wall) which contains a complex cross-linked mixture of carbohydrates and lipids that provide a formidable barrier around the bacterium and that help to protect it from the immune system, and to survive in the human body in the infective state. Understanding how the complicated envelope is constructed could hold the key to combating Mtb, as well as providing interesting new data on the novel biochemistry involved. In this respect, it was shown recently that two different types of drugs (benzothiazinones and dinitrobenzamides) both act on Mtb by inhibiting an enzyme system that is responsible for providing some of the key 'building blocks' for the cell envelope. This system comprises two proteins named DprE1 and DprE2, whose role is to convert a sugar-linked lipid from one conformation to another, to enable it to be used as an 'anchor' by which peculiar long chain fatty acids unique to the mycobacteria (mycolipids) can be attached to the core of the envelope. This becomes a major structural feature of the envelope that is critical for the bacteria to remain viable and to sustain an infective state. However, until recently the DprE1 and DprE2 proteins had proven almost impossible to produce in a soluble form that would be appropriate for studying their 3-dimensional structure and for interrogating their reaction mechanism. In advance of this application, we have overcome these problems by producing soluble DprE1/E2 enzymes cloned from a related bacterium (Mycobacterium smegmatis) and also by producing more stable, soluble forms of Mtb DprE1/E2 by fusing these proteins together at the genetic level. We are now able to make large amounts of the relevant proteins, and in this proposed programme of research we will exploit these breakthroughs to solve the structures of the DprE1/DprE2 proteins (using the technique of X-ray crystallography, where X-ray irradiation of crystals of the target protein produces a specific diffraction pattern that can pinpoint the locations of the component atoms and allow the structure to be built) and will also perform a careful characterization of their mechanisms and their individual roles in the generation of the key 'building blocks' for cell envelope assembly. In this way, we will provide important new information on an enzyme system crucial for the viability of the TB-causing bacterium, enabling further strategies to target this DprE1/E2 system with novel antibiotics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I020160/1","grantId":"BB/I020160/1","fundValue":"391575","fundStart":"2011-11-07","fundEnd":"2014-11-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project is nearing completion and major results involve the development of tools to quantify bindings of effective anti-TB drugs to their bacterial target enzyme.

The project involves primarily the production and characterization of the DprE1 enzyme from the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis; together with studies on its partner protein DprE2. Collectively, these enzymes catalyze an essential reaction required for the building of the M. tuberculosis cell wall - a complex structure that places a formidable barrier around the cell. DprE1 and DprE2 act in sequence to transform the substrate decaprenylphosphoryl-ß-D-ribose (DPR) into the final product decaprenylphosphoryl-ß-D-arabinose (DPA), which then goes on for use in cell wall construction. DprE1 is the target of a class of drugs called benzothiazinones (BTZs), and work in this project has helped to understand the structural and biochemical properties of the enzyme, as well as its reactivity with BTZ-type drugs. Among findings made in this project were that the interactions of various BTZ drugs result in the covalent linkage of the drugs to the DprE1 protein (which has a flavin cofactor bound), resulting from electron transfer from the flavin to the drug that enables it to form a reactive species that then binds covalently to a sulfur-containing amino acid (cysteine) close to the flavin. This irreversible binding explains the potency of these drugs, and a method for analysing the efficiency of the interactions of BTZ-type drugs with DprE1 was developed using fast reaction (stopped-flow) methods to determine drug affinity of binding to DprE1. This method was further adapted to be useful in characterizing affinity for other types of BTZ-related drugs that do not irreversibly bind to DprE1. We showed the drug binding is associated with measurable shifts in the absorbance spectrum of the flavin cofactor, and also that drug binding alters the ability of the flavin to form a 1-electron reduced form known as a semiquinone (as opposed to a 2-electron reduced species). The nature of the flavin species (a red, anionic semiquinone) was also established. Other methods were also established to monitor and measure the binding of inhibitor drugs to this important M. tuberculosis drug target enzyme, and expression of its DprE2 partner was achieved in isolation and as a fusion protein with DprE1. Data collected have important ramifications for understanding and quantifying inhibition of DprE1, and also highlight the scope for improving affinity of the BTZ-type drugs to improve their antibiotic potency. The work has provided new tools for the identification and measurement of affinity of binding of antibiotics to an important new drug target enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These methods can be applied to understand in more detail the enzyme inhibition process and in order to guide advanced drug design to produce more potent and specific drugs.
