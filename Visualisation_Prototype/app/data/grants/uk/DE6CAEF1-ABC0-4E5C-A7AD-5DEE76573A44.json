The vast majority of them are bacterial species. In exchange for food and a niche to grow, they break down some of the food we can't digest and synthesise essential compounds we don't produce, such as vitamins. They also provide a barrier against pathogens, as they train our immune system to fence them off and outgrow them in the competition for resources. Some fungal species can as well colonise different parts of the body and live harmlessly as commensals. However, we know that under certain conditions (especially those that affect the immune system) the natural balance of the human flora is broken and this allows organisms like fungi to overgrow and sometimes cause disease. Certain molecules are required to establish a successful interaction between hosts and these microorganisms. Many of these molecules are proteins (incidentally, they are the major component of any organism, they control our internal metabolic processes and also serve to 'scaffold' much of the shape of our bodies). The fungus Candida albicans is very frequently found in our bodies and it uses specific proteins on its surface to interact with our different tissues. Just like the machines we see everyday, proteins have a specific shape associated to their function. There is a specific class of proteins called chaperones, and their function is to help other proteins to maintain their shape, so they can carry on doing their own work. They attach firmly to 'deformed' or floppy parts of a target protein and with the help of external energy they slowly release it, as they recover their original form. As a nifty trick, Candida has managed to put one of these chaperones (or a protein with a chaperone-like activity) on its surface and create a new way to bind to tissues in humans and several animals. Interestingly, this protein doesn't seem to have the release mechanism displayed by the standard chaperones, which ultimately favours Candida, as it provides an efficient mechanism to look for proteins (with floppy regions) attached to an animal surface and then anchor to them permanently. The aim of this project is to use techniques that piece together the amino acids that form this 'chaperone-like adhesin' and accurately describe its shape. Knowing this structure will equip us to understand its function at the atomic level. As this is one of the tools that Candida uses for a successful association with its host, we will know more about how we interact with the microorganisms normally found in our gut, skin and other body sites.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F007566/1","grantId":"BB/F007566/1","fundValue":"356179","fundStart":"2008-04-21","fundEnd":"2011-04-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ernesto  Cota Segura","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
