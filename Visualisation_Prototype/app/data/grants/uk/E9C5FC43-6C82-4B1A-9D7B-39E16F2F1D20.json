This work has served both to exemplify and expand our understanding of general physiological principles, and to document aspects of biology unique to the insects that have then been exploited to control their reproduction and behavior. This proposal focuses on an aspect of basic insect physiology that has largely escaped attention. \n\nMost insects develop, in the embryo, appendages that differentiate uniquely as organs known as pleuropods, with the appearance of secretory or excretory structures. Old experiments from more than 40 years ago suggest that these organs are essential for the insects to hatch, but it is not clear whether they secrete a hatching enzyme, a hormone that controls the secretion of a hatching enzyme from other tissues, or have some other more general function concerning the regulation of fluid and salt balance. Because insects no longer have these organs after hatching, and because the most intensively studied species, Drosophila, belongs to a group of insects that no longer develops pleuropods, they have largely escaped the attention of insect biologists. \n\nDevelopments in genetic technology now make it to possible to study the function of pleuropods in new ways. We have used large scale sequencing of dissected pleuropods from locusts to identify the complete set of genes that these unique organs express. By comparing these genes with those expressed in other organs we will gain insight into the likely physiological role of pleuropods. We will eliminate the function of likely key genes to test these hypotheses. We will also eliminate the development of pleuropods altogether by inactivating the &quot;master control gene&quot; that specifies them, and examine the effect on the physiology of the resulting embryos. \n\nWe shall also carry out similar experiments on collembolan hexapods, representatives of an important group of soil organisms. These close relatives of the insects, colloquially known as springtails, retain throughout life a major organ, the ventral tube, that develops from the same embryonic structures as the insect pleuropods. These organs are known to be important for water and salt balance in springtails, many of which are very sensitive to the humidity of the environment. We have developed a species of collembolan as a laboratory model for gene manipulation, and have shown that we can generate collembolans that lack ventral tubes. These die a short while after hatching. We have generated a list of genes expressed in this species, and will test whether the genes expressed in the ventral tube are related to those expressed in the insect pleuropods, and so assess whether the physiology of the ventral tubes is related to that of pleuropods. We will study the effect on the organisms of removing ventral tube function. \n\nFinally, the &quot;master control gene&quot; that specifies pleuropods and ventral tubes is much better known for other well studied roles during development. It is of fundamental interest to understand how this one gene, called Ultrabithorax, can do such different things as transform the patterning of wings and legs in the thorax, and specify a secretory/excretory organ in another part of the body. We shall investigate how the different roles of this gene depend on the timing, amount and precise structure of the products that it makes, and on the combination of other genes with which it works.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K009133/1","grantId":"BB/K009133/1","fundValue":"364548","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Edwin Akam","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" To date we have developed tools to manipulate gene expression in Collembolan hexapods, and studied the role of genes controlling the specification of different segments in the abdomen of these insects.
