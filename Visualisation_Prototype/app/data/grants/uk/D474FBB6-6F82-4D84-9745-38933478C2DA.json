However, electrically conducting polymers (sometimes called molecular wires, MWs) are often unstable when operated the presence of air or moisture and can deteriorate due to interactions between the polymer chains. These drawbacks currently hinder the development of new commercial plastic electronic devices. \n\nOne approach which has been developed to help overcome these problems is to wrap the conjugated polymer in an insulating sheath, much as macroscopic wires are insulated using a rubber or plastic coating to prevent degradation and short circuits. These insulated molecular wires (IMWs) can be made by threading the conjugated polymer through the cavity of ring shaped molecules, to create a threaded structure, reminiscent of a bead on a thread, known as a poly-rotaxane (from rota, meaning wheel, and axel). This method has been shown to be extremely beneficial, dramatically improving the stability and properties of the conjugated polymer. \n\nHowever, the existing methods for the synthesis of such poly-rotaxanes are currently extremely limited, hindering the development of these exciting materials. Our proposed research will greatly increase the availability of poly-rotaxane IMWs and will in the long term allow any polymer to be insulated with any macrocycle quickly and efficiently.\n\nUltimately, as a result of the proposed work we will be able to create designer insulated molecular wires to order, potentially revolutionising the use of these novel materials for plastic electronic devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J01981X/1","grantId":"EP/J01981X/1","fundValue":"100240","fundStart":"2012-07-24","fundEnd":"2014-07-23","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Michael Goldup","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
