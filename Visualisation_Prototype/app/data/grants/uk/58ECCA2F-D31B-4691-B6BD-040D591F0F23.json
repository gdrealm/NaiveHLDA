{"id":"58ECCA2F-D31B-4691-B6BD-040D591F0F23","title":"The Politics of Prisoners of War: Britain, Germany and POW Diplomacy, 1939-1945","abstractText":"This project investigates British policy towards its prisoners of war (POW) in Germany between 1939 and 1945. It charts Britain's efforts to protect its men from maltreatment, overwork and neglect, by insisting on reciprocity in its dealings with the German government, and more particularly by promoting, where possible, German compliance with an international POW 'regime' based on the POW convention of 1929. It examines the characteristics of POW policy-making, as an area of policy particularly sensitive to the influences of public opinion and the wishes of allies and alliance partners. It also investigates the execution of policy, shedding light on the unique dynamics of 'POW diplomacy'. Finally, it argues that by focusing on POW issues, historians can gain fresh insight into the nature of Anglo-German relations over the course of the war. \\n\\nThe importance of the project lies in three areas. First of all, by examining Anglo-German attitudes towards the international POW 'regime' after 1939, the project shows how international principles and norms can effect, and in some cases constrain, policy choices of states, even when they are engaged in a struggle for national survival. Secondly, an exploration of POW diplomacy shows how the means of execution available to governments in this area, in particular their reliance on third party intermediaries, critically affects the outcome of these policies. The humanitarian agencies and officially accredited 'protecting powers' act not merely as message-carriers between the disputants, but rather as independent actors in their own right, using their privileged position between the two camps to further their interests, and shape belligerent behaviour in accordance with their own wishes. Finally, the project explores the applicability of Clausewitz's classic 19th century dictum, of 'war being the continuation of politics by other means', to the 'total war' of mid-20th century. A common interest in the fate of their respective POWs encouraged the British and German governments to engage in a dialogue with each other over the course of the war. This took place indirectly, through the use of intermediaries, but was occasionally pursued through more direct means. The insight provided into the evolution of Anglo-German political relations during the war is one of the key objectives of the project. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E00055X/1","grantId":"AH/E00055X/1","fundValue":"25214","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Neville  Wylie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
