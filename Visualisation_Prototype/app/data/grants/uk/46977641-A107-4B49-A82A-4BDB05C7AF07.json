Through the organisation of a series of seminars, featuring prominent researchers in the field of supervision, and a one day conference, our aim is to generate more interest in supervision research both in the UK and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>The supervision research network (SuPreNet) has a mission to promote high quality supervision research and the seminar series is part of the medium term strategy to do so. The seminars will bring together experienced supervision researchers from all over the world who will meet with aspiring supervision researchers to create a dialogue that will influence the future agenda for supervision research. There is a lack of research into the impact of supervision on client outcome and there is little research on supervision in the UK context. Methodological problems abound and the seminars will provide an opportunity to address them.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H001506/1","grantId":"ES/H001506/1","fundValue":"18304","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The training manual is widely used Education,Other Cultural","person":"Susan Joy Wheeler","coPersons":["Michael  Barkham"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
