Upon infection, the immune system is rapidly activated, to ensure the threat is dealt with as quickly as possible. However, in healthy individuals it is vital that the immune system is kept in a resting state to prevent tissues of the body from being attacked; a process that results in debilitating autoimmune disease. A vital area of research is concerned with understanding the pathways and molecules that control the balance between a resting and active immune system. We have recently identified a vital pathway which prevents the immune system from attacking tissues of the body. When a protein molecule called integrin alphavbeta8 is not present on the dendritic cells of the immune system, severe autoimmune disease occurs. The work proposed here aims to study this pathway in more detail, looking at which specific types of cell in the immune system are important, and to determine what happens to this pathway during active immune responses to infection. Such work will provide important insights into how animals and humans successfully deal with infection, and how the immune system is tightly regulated to prevent autoimmune disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G001103/1","grantId":"BB/G001103/1","fundValue":"412416","fundStart":"2008-10-06","fundEnd":"2011-10-05","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings in this proposal were generally of benefit at the academic level.  ","person":"Mark Andrew Travis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" The aim of the research proposal was to determine important molecular mechanisms that control immune responses in the intestine. Specifically, we aimed to determine novel pathways by which an important type of immune cell in the intestine, the dendritic cell, regulates immune responses to promote a healthy gut. During the course of the proposal, we produced two major findings. \n\nOur first finding was that a specialised type of dendritic cell is key in dampening the immune system in the intestine. Specifically, by expression of a molecule called integrin alphav beta8, these specialised dendritic cells activate an important molecule called TGF-beta, which in turn promotes the development of a cell called a regulatory T-cell. These regulatory T-cells are vital in the maintenance of health in the intestine. We have published this work in a high profile journal (Worthington JJ et al (2011), Gastroenterology, 141(5): 1802-1812), and have recently initiated studies in humans to determine whether such pathways exist and whether they are altered in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nOur second finding was that the integrin ?v?8-dendritic cell-TGF? pathway is key in regulating responses to infection. Specifically, mice lacking this pathway were completely protected from infection with the intestinal worm parasite Trichuris muris. The preliminary findings formed the basis for a successful grant application to the MRC, looking into the molecular mechanisms by which lack of the integrin ?8-DC-TGF? pathway was important in promoting chronic parasite infection in the gut. We are now taking our findings into human subjects, to determine whether similar pathways are present in the human intestine during health and inflammation. Such work will validate the potential role of the integrin ?v?8-TGF? pathway in the immune system in promoting a healthy gut. \n\nAdditionally, it is hypothesised that targeting integrin ?v?8 during the development of chronic parasite infection in the intestine may be successful in promoting parasite clearance.
