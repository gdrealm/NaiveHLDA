Many of these processes require collections of proteins to assemble together into functional biological machines, several of which are to be found in the cell membrane. The flagellar motor of bacteria is such a machine, and is an ideal example to study since we have developed several techniques which allow us to observe the individual proteins as well as monitoring the machine's functional state. We can see where the proteins are located in the cell by tagging them with a small marker which glows when we shine the right colour of light on it, and by measuring the total brightness of this glow in the motor relative to the brightness of just a single tag we can estimate how many of the tagged proteins are present. The functional state of the machine is given by the motor speed. This can be monitored both by tethering the whole cell to a surface via one of its flagellar filaments and watching the cell rotate about this point, or by sticking the cell down to a surface and detecting the position of a small tag placed on a free flagellar filament. The bacterial flagellar motor is an ingenious device which spans the cell membrane and converts some of the electrical and chemical energy of ions into rotary mechanical motion of the motor, thereby bringing about rotation of an attached helical filament and allowing the cell to swim through its liquid surroundings. Previously we discovered that individual components of the motor are rapidly replaced, which may mean that biological components wear out and need replacing just as they do in man-made machines. There is now evidence that the some of these components may be held in place by the presence of the very ions which fuel the rotation. To fully test whether proteins do indeed degrade, how the presence of the surrounding ions affects the stability of the machine and how functioning of the machine affects how and when parts are replaced, we propose to monitor the movement and number of several motor components to a precision of single protein molecules whilst simultaneously monitoring the rotation speed of the motor in varieties of modified bacterial cells in which we can precisely and dynamically control the magnitude of the ion gradient across the cell membrane.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F021224/1","grantId":"BB/F021224/1","fundValue":"796201","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith  Armitage","coPersons":["Richard Michael Berry","Mark Christian Leake"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" 1. Successfully expressing proteorhodopsin in E.coli, allowing light to be used to accurately control the proton motive force (pmf).\n\n\n\n2. Finding that in the absence of a pmf, the stators diffuse away from the flagellar rotor, moving around the membrane. On recovery of pmf, the stators return to the rotor in step-wise manner, allowing onrate to be measured.\n\n\n\n3. Discovering that at a full pmf, stator exchange depends on the load on the motor, irrespective of the direction of motor rotation. This has major implications for biofilm formation.\n\n\n\n4. Showing that rotor proteins also exchange with pools of proteins while the motor rotates, but exchange is not linked to pmf, rather it does depend on rotational direction. This suggests stator and rotor exchange are not linked and have different physiological roles.\n\n\n\n5. Finding that in species with two naturally expressed stator types, the proton stators do not compete with sodium stators for sites around the rotor, unless the sodium stators are deleted.\n\n\n\n6. Discovering that the stopping motor of R.sphaeroides does not &quot;free-run&quot; at stops, but rather locks tight, with implications for stator exchange in stopping motors. Oroteorhodopsin cloned from a marine bacterium can be used to artificially control the driving proton gradient across the membranes of bacteria, allowing a direct correlation between pmf and a specific function to be measured.\n\nStarting to characterise the interaction interface between stators and rotor proteins may identify mechanisms for controlling bacterial swimming.
