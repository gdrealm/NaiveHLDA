{"id":"F33E27E8-055F-45D5-A8A1-52CF6F50EA76","title":"Migrant identification and incorporation: Kenyan Pentecostals between home, London, and the Kingdom of God","abstractText":"<p>It is often presumed that migrants from the same country or region of origin constitute a pre-existing community. This study will challenge that presumption by examining modes of migrant identification and pathways of integration through the lens of religion. In doing so, it will explore the complex ways in which place, identity, and sociality intersect.</p>\n\n<p>Qualitative, ethnographic research will be conducted among Kenyan Pentecostal migrants and Pentecostal churches in East London. It will primarily entail semi-structured, open-ended interviews with pastors and congregants and participant observation at churches and in the lives of congregants. Key areas of interest include the social networks of Kenyan Pentecostals, their place-making practices (ie, the ways in which they make themselves and their faith visible in the urban landscape), and churches as civic institutions.</p>\n\n<p>The study will contribute to debates at the interface of migration, faith, identity, and urbanism and expand the comparative base for understanding exclusionary religious projects. In addition to its contributions to scholarly research, it will also engage with policy concerns about migrants, especially religious ones, and interest in faith institutions as key players in civil society.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K007734/1","grantId":"ES/K007734/1","fundValue":"151546","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Leslie Elyse Fesenmyer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
