However, this process occurs in a crowded environment since other equally important cellular functions must occur at the same time as DNA replication. As a result, genome duplication must occur even though the DNA is coated with many DNA binding proteins. Little is known of the effects of these DNA binding proteins upon replication even though there is much indirect evidence that such collisions lead to mutations in the DNA. We aim to use the replication machinery from a bacterium to analyse the effects of proteins bound to the DNA upon replication. We will measure the probability of DNA binding proteins halting the replication machinery, and will characterise the properties of protein-DNA complexes which lead to blockage of replication. However, cells clearly do have the ability to replicate their genomes even though the DNA is coated in a panoply of proteins. We will therefore search for enzymes that can help the replication machinery to move through DNA-protein complexes. These experiments will help us understand how all cells duplicate their genomes in a complex protein-rich environment. They may also cast light on how cells minimise the chances of their replication machinery stalling and causing potentially harmful mutations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/C008316/1","grantId":"BB/C008316/1","fundValue":"239317","fundStart":"2006-02-15","fundEnd":"2009-06-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  McGlynn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" A major reason DNA acquires mutations is that the machines that copy the DNA prior to a cell dividing break down frequently but why these copying machines break down is still unclear. This project utilised the experimentally tractable bacterium E. coli to investigate how these copying machines break down. The key findings from this project were:1) we established that proteins bound to the DNA can act as blocks to DNA copying machines. DNA in all organisms is coated with a wide variety of proteins that are essential for the utilisation and maintenance of DNA inside cells. Our work indicated therefore that proteins bound to the DNA may be a major, unavoidable source of problems for the DNA copying machinery.2) we identified two enzymes that can each promote copying of DNA that is coated with protein. These enzymes, named Rep and UvrD, are both a type of enzyme called a helicase. This type of enzyme moves along DNA and is able to displace proteins from the DNA along which the enzyme is moving. Our findings imply that either Rep or UvrD displace proteins from the DNA ahead of the copying machinery.3) we determined that E. coli cells require either Rep or UvrD for survival. Therefore cells require at least one of these enzymes to help DNA copying machines to move along protein-coated DNA. This project demonstrated for the first time how an organism replicates DNA that is bound by proteins efficiently. We have shown that in the absence of mechanisms that aid copying of protein-bound DNA, the replication machinery breaks down frequently and requires some form of repair to complete copying of the genome. Evidence is accumulating that all organisms face problems when trying to replicate their DNA because of the many proteins bound to it. Our work will inform our understanding of how DNA replication can be corrupted inside all organisms and will provide the basis for dissecting such processes in humans.
