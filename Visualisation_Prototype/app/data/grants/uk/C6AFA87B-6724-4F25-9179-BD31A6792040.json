The amount of assistance reduces with increasing speed and cuts out altogether once the rider reaches 25kmph, or if pedalling ceases.\nThe aim of this project is to understand how people engage with (smart) e-cycling and the issues for policy, design/product development and research that could lead to a higher uptake of e-bikes in the UK, and thereby potentially reduce carbon emissions. The project is positioned at the intersection of more traditional cycling research, mobile media studies and user-centred design, and aims to understand electric cycling as a unique mode of transport, with distinctive potential and challenges in the UK context. \nIn the UK, research on e-bikes is in its early stages, with pilots in this area currently commencing at a small number of locations, highlighting the timeliness of this research. In line with increased market shares of electric bikes in some European countries (e.g. Germany, Netherlands and Austria) and Asia, there have also been a small number of relevant international research projects, which can inform our approach to the UK context. \nThe project will involve a fleet of about 35 'data e-bikes', with 6 of these additionally kitted out as 'smart e-bikes'. Mobile technology such as a GPS/GPRS tracking units will be attached to the bikes in order to monitor their use. The 'smart e-bikes' will be further augmented with video cameras, mobile phones and other sensors to collect more qualitative and ethnographic data. These bikes will be distributed to trial participants through communities in Brighton, in partnership with Brighton and Hove Council. During the trial, we aim to work with 2 workplaces (focusing on the issues faced by commuters) and 4 community groups (focussing on issues relating to the aging population). Our methodology will bring together traditional transport monitoring (e.g. surveys and focus groups), qualitative and ethnographic methods from media studies (such as interviews and participant observation) and design methods (such as user-centred and inclusive design). \nWe conceptualise e-bikes as a mode of transport in their own right: as different to cycling, scooters, electric cars - yet with insights from research in all these areas. This research project will engage with the challenging context of embodied mobility, where the participant's interaction with the e-bike and the urban context has to be integrated with mobile media in safe and productive ways. There will also be insights from understanding the fleet of e-bikes as an Internet of Things - and the possibilities emerging from linking mobile technologies with a mode of transport. It will also be useful to directly develop recommendations on a range of issues (ergonomics, safety, cycle storage, on-road facilities, theft prevention, employer policies, networking) whilst working with a manufacturer, a local authority and several employers who may be interested in implementing any conclusions. \nThe research is of importance because of its potential to contribute to meeting carbon reduction and public health objectives; it offers the chance to explore the game-changing potential of an innovative transport option; and because it brings together conventional monitoring and new ways of exploring travel behaviour.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J004855/1","grantId":"EP/J004855/1","fundValue":"442845","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Impact is emerging with regards to policy, health and industry. \n\nPolicy\n\nThe project submitted a document titled 'Electrically-assisted bikes' in response to the 2014 'Call for evidence on Government measures to support uptake of ultra low emission vehicles from 2015-2020'. The team's overall contention is that OLEV should make electrically-assisted bikes a priority component of their 2015-2020 programme, and our report suggests ten potential policy measures that would support their uptake.\nThe project has been consulted by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council during the process of writing local travel strategies with major interest now growing in the potential of electrically-assisted bikes. \nA pilot 'e-cycling training module' training was developed in collaboration with Maria Robinson from M-Cycles (a local cycling business). Bikeability is 'cycling proficiency' for the 21st century, designed to give the next generation the skills and confidence to ride their bikes on today's roads. The project will influence the national Bikeability curriculum, offering an emphasis on e-bike skills and especially aimed at adults. This in turn feeds the aim of several national institutions to encourage more people taking trips by bike more often and more safely. \n&quot;We are starting to work in partnership with Frauke Behrendt from the Smart e-bikes research project to put together a CPD (continuing professional development) trainer training module to submit to the Department for Transport for possible inclusion in the Bikeability suite. This will extend our reach to adult audiences and respond to the growing public interest in e-bikes.&quot; David Dansky, Director of The Association of Bikeability Schemes CIC\n\nHealth\n\nSeveral county councils have been in touch with us to discuss the possibility of working in partnership with us on projects around the public health impact of e-bikes. Nanette Mutrie, Professor of Physical Activity for Health at the University of Edinburgh is a member of the 'smart e-bikes' project's advisory panel and states: &quot;Use of such bikes will therefore be of potential health benefit to all those who need to increase their levels of physical activity and who use them in preference to undertaking less active types of travel or activity.&quot;\n\nIndustry\n\nSeveral local companies have consulted the project researchers on their business and developing innovations, for example regarding the tracking of fleets and goods. One of them is ReCharge, with Founder Sam Keam stating: &quot;The smart e-bikes project has supported us in developing our vision for more sustainable urban logistics Brighton struggles with congestion, air pollution, lost business productivity and a reduced quality of life because there is too much traffic - a fair chunk of which is vans whizzing around delivering goods.&quot; Communities and Social Services/Policy,Transport Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Frauke  Behrendt","coPersons":["David  Raffo","Sally  Cairns"],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":" This project has involved a series of trials, lending out electrically-assisted bikes to both commuters, and community participants. Data has been collected through surveys, interviews, focus groups and the Smart e-bikes monitoring system (GPS and assistance data). \n\nDisclaimer: all findings are preliminary as publications on the findings are currently under review\n\n\nWidening the appeal of cycling: high interest in bikes, including some traditionally underrepresented groups \n\nElectrically-assisted bicycles are becoming an increasingly popular choice in countries with more mainstream cycling cultures, though they remain a minority mode in the UK. One outcome of the 'smart e-bikes' project is an assessment whether e-bikes bicycles have the potential to increase the appeal of cycling in the UK, and to encourage cycling participation by a relatively wide demographic, thereby providing a potential policy mechanism for helping to widen the appeal of cycling in terms of who cycles, not just overall cycling volume. Through a series of trials with employers in Brighton, it was possible to show that the opportunity to borrow an electrically-assisted bicycle generated relatively high levels of interest, and that this interest came from both cyclists and non-cyclists, and from some (though not all) groups which are traditionally underrepresented in conventional cyclist statistics, including women, older age groups, non-white ethnic groups, those who are currently relatively inactive, car owners/users and those living 3-10 miles from work.\n\nDeveloped Smart E-Bike Monitoring System (SEMS) for Data collection\n\nWe developed the Smart E-Bike Monitoring System (SEMS), an open-source platform for the acquisition of usage data from electrically-assisted bicycles (also called pedelecs).&nbsp; The system can monitor location, rider control data and other custom sensor input in real time. SEMS is designed to run from the e-bike battery, and requires no intervention from the rider. \nThe SEMS data feeds an online interface for (1) data analysis and (2) for riders to view their own data. The source code and hardware design are publicly available for non-commercial use under the GPL. We have open-sourced the monitor system so that it may be used by other e-bike and GPS monitoring projects.\nWe collected ride data from more than 100 participants that each had an e-bike for 6-8 weeks during 2012 and 2013, proving the robustness of the system. \n\nMore achievements are forthcoming as the analysis of the large volume of data collected through the project is ongoing while results are being written up. All key results will be disseminated through the project website (www.smart-ebikes.co.uk). Encouraging more people to cycle via the promotion of electrically-assisted bikes could have multiple public and private benefits including lowering carbon emissions, reducing congestion as well as improving health and wellbeing. E-bike innovation is therefore of key interest for policy and industry at local, regional and national level.\nOur results are of interest to the health sector, for example for future interventions or research in the of public health (see impact section). We are currently in discussion with the public health teams of two county councils for developing a small pilot study. \nThe open-source Smart E-Bike Monitoring System (SEMS) we developed could be replicated on other fleets (for data comparison) and/or extended with more sensor to collect evidence on air quality, sound mapping, heart rate, etc. \nThe SEMS could also be of interested for the fleet management of public e-bike hire fleets., private e-bike lease fleets, and for e-bike last-mile delivery of goods. Our overall research is also relevant for developing new forms of e-bike ownership, e.g. around lease and hire schemes. \nThe SEMs also highlights the importance and potential of e-bikes and fleets of them for smart cities and the Internet of Things. The smart e-bikes send data in real time to our server and bike users can access the data via a web/mobile interface. The data can also feed into dashboard interfaces and social media. Future integration could be developed with smart houses, smart/sustainable energy, charging stations, and with regards to integration with other modes of transport.
