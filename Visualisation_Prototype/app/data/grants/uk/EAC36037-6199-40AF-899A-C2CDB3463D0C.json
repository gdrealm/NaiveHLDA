{"id":"EAC36037-6199-40AF-899A-C2CDB3463D0C","title":"The neural correlates of generative reasoning in subclinical depression","abstractText":"<p>In this research, we plan to study the processes underlying the cognitive deficits in sad mood and subclinical depression, in order to further understand this pervasive problem. Subclinical depression and lasting states of sad mood are characterized by impairments in flexible, creative reasoning, and in &quot;generative thinking&quot; which means the construction of impressions, plans, and mental models out of more basic, detail information. </p> \n<p>Using brain imaging, we aim to investigate the idea of a highly specific deficit in depressed mood. Those brain areas that are known to be associated with generative thinking should be activated if someone uses this type of reasoning when learning a new set of information. If, as proposed, those with subclinical depression are not generating a mental model during learning, then this pattern of brain activation may not be seen until queried later about the learned information, reflecting a less accurate on-line reasoning strategy. A comparison between subclinically depressed versus nondepressed participants will thus provide a more direct insight into the cognitive strategies employed by participants in the two different groups.&nbsp;The findings may also help to improve the goal-setting for counselling and intervention programs directed at those with long-lasting sad mood.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D005078/1","grantId":"ES/D005078/1","fundValue":"80299","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ulrich  Von Hecker","coPersons":["Elanor Clare Hinton"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
