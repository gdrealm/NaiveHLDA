{"id":"2D8B64C5-6D61-476A-AAF1-725C34298D13","title":"The Universe in Light of Fundamental Physics","abstractText":"Particle physics and cosmology are merging. In recent years, the cross-pollination of ideas between the fields has accelerated, fueled by the availability of a wealth of new raw astrophysical data and increased realization of the intimate theoretical connection between particle physics and cosmology. Now that the LHC is online, particle physics is returning the favour with high-quality data on the building-blocks of cosmology. With the coming release of data from the PLANCK satellite and many balloon experiments, the Advanced LIGO gravitational-wave detectors, the AMS-02 space-based particle detector, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and many other experiments searching for dark matter, this cross-pollination of ideas and data is destined to continue.\n\nThe scientific programme proposed here by the Theoretical Particle Physics and Cosmology (TPPC) Group in the Physics Department of King's College London is focused on the the analysis and interpretation of data from observational cosmology and high-energy astrophysics using insights from fundamental physics.\n\nAlthough the LHC now makes possible direct studies in the laboratory of fundamental physics processes at unprecedented energies, these are eclipsed by the energies attained in the Very Early Universe and in the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays that may be produced by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), gamma-ray bursters (GRBs), supernovae, black holes and pulsars. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) and violent astrophysical events therefore provide unique laboratories for studying new fundamental physics. However, while searching for observational signatures of new physics, one must model known physics accurately, taking into account the information provided by the LHC and other accelerators. For example, the wealth of new data on the CMB and large-scale structure (LSS) necessitates the development of new analysis tools to probe and interpret possible signatures of new physics such as primordial non-Gaussianities and small neutrino masses, so as to distinguish them from more conventional phenomena. Likewise, searches for dark matter require accurate modelling of dark matter halos in order to calculate reliably density and velocity distributions as well as to probe for deviations from the usual weakly-interacting dark matter paradigm, such as self-interactions. Moreover, high-energy emissions from astrophysical sources provide unique opportunities to search for new physics that complement particle colliders and could yield striking observational signatures.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L000717/1","grantId":"ST/L000717/1","fundValue":"43210","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Not yet as it is not published.
