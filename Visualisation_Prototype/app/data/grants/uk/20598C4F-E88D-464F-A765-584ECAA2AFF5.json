{"id":"20598C4F-E88D-464F-A765-584ECAA2AFF5","title":"Home space? Public and private in new welfare settings","abstractText":"<p>This seminar series, based at the Open University, will examine how feelings of 'home' and 'belonging' might be present or not in using public services, in spaces such as schools, hospitals and sites of care for older people. As government policy changes, for example having services delivered by the private or voluntary sector, so do the spaces of these services change.Through focusing on ideas of 'home' spaces these seminars will explore wider issues around inclusion and exclusion, belonging and empowerment, and public and private lives . The objectives are:<br /><br /></p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>To investigate how far current changes in public service provision are reconfiguring experiences of ‘home’ and ‘belonging’, through a focus on ‘home spaces’ at different stages of the lifecourse and in the context of historical perspectives.</li>\n\n <li>To assess how these spaces frame new relationships and new experiences of inclusion and exclusion for different groups of users and professionals.</li>\n\n <li>To bring together analytical and methodological resources to develop new frameworks to understand these spaces which cross conventionally ‘public’ and ‘private’ spheres.</li>\n\n <li>To enable a multi-disciplinary group of researchers and practitioners, to generate new understandings across research, policy and practice, and new capacity for further projects.</li>\n\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J022403/1","grantId":"ES/J022403/1","fundValue":"16747","fundStart":"2012-10-10","fundEnd":"2014-12-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Eleanor Frances Jupp","coPersons":["Janet  Newman","Jane Margaret Franklin","Sheila Marjorie Peace","Alison  Clark"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
