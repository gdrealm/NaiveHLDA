Understanding the basic mechanisms of action of bacterial DNA replication will be essential not only to extrapolate our findings to the more complex eukaryotic organisms, but also to design new antibacterials in our fight against antibiotic resistance. The helicase-primase complex is a ubiquitous and essential bacterial complex. Our current understanding of the molecular basis of its functions is poorly understood. Recently we have solved the structure of the helicase-interacting domain of the B. stearothermophilus primase protein and we discovered that this domain is structurally homologous to the N-terminal domain of the helicase itself. This was a surprising discovery and one that led us to propose a model to try and explain how the bacterial helicase-primase complex functions. We are now seeking funding to test directly the validity of this model with a series of biochemical experiments. The results of this research will enable us to understand the molecular details of this important complex and will pave the way for the design of new antibacterial drugs that will target this complex and thus bacterial DNA replication.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E004717/1","grantId":"BB/E004717/1","fundValue":"275245","fundStart":"2006-11-06","fundEnd":"2009-11-05","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  A series of papers were published in high impact journals Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Societal,Economic","person":"Panos  Soultanas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" The objectives of the proposed work were set up as follows:\n\nProtein domains are structural modules often associated with particular functions. The C-terminal domain (P16) of the bacterial primase DnaG mediates structurally and functionally the interaction of this protein with the replicative helicase DnaB. This interaction is essential for DNA replication and bacterial viability. We have recently solved the NMR structure of P16 and found that it consists of 2 subdomains. \n\nThe C-terminal subdomain C2 forms a helix-turn-helix pin that interacts directly with DnaB but fails to modulate its function whereas the N-terminal subdomain C1 was discovered to exhibit a surprisingly structural homology to the N-terminal domain of DnaB. This similarity has led us to propose a model to explain how the primase DnaG modulates the conformation of the ring helicase DnaB. \n\n\n\nWe now seek funding to test this model directly by site-directed mutagenesis studies. We have carried out a structural comparison of P16 and the DnaB N-terminal domain and identified a number of spatially conserved identical surface residues that we speculate may be crucial in transmitting the DnaG-mediated effects on the ring helicase. We will mutate these residues and then characterise the effects of these mutations by standard biochemical assays (ATPase, helicase, general priming, gel filtration) in vitro. \n\n\n\nFinally we will construct a hybrid protein with the P16 domain of DnaG fused to the C-terminal helicase domain of DnaB to produce a protein that we predict will be a fully active helicase. We will also construct another hybrid protein with the DnaG fused to the C-terminal of DnaB to produce a protein that we predict will have both helicase and primase activities. We will then compare the activities of the hybrid proteins with the wild type DnaG and DnaB proteins. The helicase-primase interaction is a key functional interaction in DNA replication. The bacterial system has fundamental differences from the eykaryotic system and hence it is a potential target for antibiotic development. We have obtained substantial molecular details on this key bacterial interaction that can be utilized in the broad area of antibiotic development against low G+C firmicutes such as Bacilli, Streptococci, Staphylococci and Clostridia.
