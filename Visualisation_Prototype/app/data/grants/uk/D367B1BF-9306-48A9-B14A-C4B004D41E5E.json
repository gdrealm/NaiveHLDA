Noise, drugs and infections can damage hearing, and many different genes (probably several hundred) can be involved. Interactions between genes and environment are likely to contribute to progressive hearing loss. We use a genetic approach to understand the molecular basis of auditory function and pathology, using the mouse as a model. The mouse has a typical mammalian cochlea very similar to that of humans, good DNA sequence resources, and many suitable mutants available for study. Mouse mutants with hearing and/or balance problems will be investigated, as balance anomalies are simple to detect and often are associated with deafness. The mutated gene will be identified in each case, and we shall screen the human version of each mouse deafness gene for mutations in affected families. Each mouse mutant will be studied using a multidisciplinary approach including auditory electrophysiology, ultrastructural analysis, gene expression studies, and developmental investigations to link understanding of the molecular basis of the defect with cell, organ and whole animal function. An understanding of the molecular basis of deafness is an essential first step towards developing treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300212","grantId":"G0300212","fundValue":"2843160","fundStart":"2003-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen Penelope  Steel","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Wellcome Trust  Sanger Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
