{"id":"4A89DC35-FD19-473B-A9C2-FCA9B3AF1DE3","title":"Electrophysiology chip on a microfluidic platform","abstractText":"The action of the heart can be simplified by considering it as a set of large muscles, whose synchronised contractions draws blood in the chambers and forces it out again. This timing of the muscle's contractions are crucial to its correct functioning. One method for testing the activity of the heart is known as 'patch clamping', in which it is possible to measure the electrical activity of the cell. This is a technically difficult, time consuming technique which often needs to be performed by skilled scientists, and which we believe we can address by making new instruments. The project aims to create a Lab-on-a-Chip, where highly functional measurements, which collect information on both the mechanical contraction and the electrical activity of the single cell, will be implemented on such chips. These chips will either make general measurements of how well the cell contractsor more specific measurements on the flow of voltages and currents as the cell contracts, or both, at the same time. The project will benefit the scientific community by providing an easy to use instrument, that can quickly, and at low cost, measure both the mechanical and the electrical activity of the heart or muscle cell. The nature of the platform will be such that we can not only use the chip to examine intracellular signalling, but also inter-cellular signalling, between cells. In order to demonstrate the more generic nature of the chip for use with other electrically active cell types, we will also investigate the use of primary smooth muscle as well as human embryonic stem cells (hESC) derived cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle in our chip systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H013369/1","grantId":"BB/H013369/1","fundValue":"489279","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Collaboration between Prof Cooper and Godfrey Smith, Professor of Cardiovascular Physiology (Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences) at the University of Glasgow resulted in the formation of Clyde Biosciences Ltd in August 2012. In partnership with the IP Group, the University secured Scottish Enterprise Proof of Concept funding in 2011 to further develop the tools created by PDRAs during the BBSRC grant. The next stage in commercialisation saw Dr Margaret-Ann Craig secure an RSE Enterprise Fellowship to develop the Clyde Bioscieces business plan. The following year Dr Craig won the prestigious Royal Academy of Engineering ERA Foundation Entrepreneurship Award for her research into new optical instrumentation, bespoke software and microsystems technologies for evaluating new drugs validation and testing their toxicity. Clyde Biosciences Ltd, launched in 2012 has developed cell preservation technology and CellOPTIQ, a system designed to make it easier for pharmaceutical firms to assess the efficacy of new compounds as potential medicines and reduce late-stage failure of candidate drugs as they move from the lab into later stage trials. Clyde Biosciences is in the process of selling its first instrument/system to GSK.

Amongst other things, we have discovered that it is possible to create tight seals between heart cells and features in the microfliudic structure, although as yet these are not quite as tight as those that can be obtained with the best glass patch clamp methods. Work is however continuing in order to improve this, using novel lithograthic methods we have developed in this project.\nIn addition, a variety of optical platform assay methods have been developed, refined and evaluated and these are contributing to the IP associated with Clyde Biosciences spin out. As indicated on the impact page, these findings are being taken forward though our spin out Clyde Biosciences in order to develop platforms for cardiomyocyte drug testing Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
