The emergence of printing, additive processes and low temperature fabrication on flexible (or conformal) substrates challenges the cost base of incumbent technologies. The penetration of soft materials into the electronics and photonics markets has only just begun, but the potential range of applications is very diverse encompassing telecommunications, microelectronics, displays, pharmaceuticals, and structural and aesthetic engineering applications with market estimates measured in $10s of billion per annum. The mission of CIKC is to provide the business and technical expertise, and infrastructure, to enable those with new exploitable concepts to achieve commercial success. The four means by which this is being achieved are (i) by supporting product commercialisation activities and engaging in exploitation activities in close collaboration with industry, for example, developing pilot prototyping facilities (ii) by providing training for those seeking to gain understanding of specific technologies or business strategies (iii) by developing a clear understanding of the overall market needs in the future and optimum strategies for exploitation and public policy design and (iv) by building strong networks with other academic institutions, industry and the policy community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H00274X/1","grantId":"EP/H00274X/1","fundValue":"1635720","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  CIKC has had a very strong interaction with industry with 50 industrial partners involved in our projects and 31 others involved in follow-up projects.

The work of CIKC was initiated through grant EP/E023614/1 and the outputs reported here are in addition to those reported under that grant.\n\n\n\nAt the time of the instigation of the CIKC, there was a realisation that a transformation was occurring with the introduction of a wide range of new low cost, flexible materials into electronics and photonics. These materials, which encompass polymers, advanced liquid crystals, and nanostructures, including carbon and silicon nanowires, had begun to have a disruptive impact on a wide range of current products which use conventional inorganic semiconductors, not only because of their cost/performance advantages, but also because they could be manufactured in more flexible ways, suitable for a growing range of applications. Research into molecular and macromolecular materials was already fully established in Cambridge, with a range of world leading research results having been. However it was apparent that whilst much progress had been made on developing new device concepts, there was a need for complementary advanced manufacturing technologies and thus there was a lack of infrastructure suitable for the development of processes that could be scaled for production.\n\n\n\nCIKC was formed with the aim of exploiting this strategically important research work, through the establishment of a portfolio of technology platforms with a focus on the co-development of scalable manufacturing processes, improved device architectures and commercially relevant demonstrators, all in close cooperation with industry. The Centre, involving members of the Departments of Physics and the Electrical Division of the Engineering Department, the Judge Business School, the Institute for Manufacturing and the Centre for Business Research, was designed to allow embedded industrialists and academics to be co-located, and for professional knowledge transfer activities to be carried out. In short, the CIKC had four core activities: (i) a managed university/industrial interface, (ii) expert evaluation of opportunities and roadmapping, (iii) consultancy and training, and (iv) new manufacturing process development lines including some with roll-to-roll capability.\n\n\n\nCIKC funded 6 major technology projects:\n\n• a scalable manufacturing process for organic transistors using self-aligned inkjet printing.\n\n• a technology to &quot;integrate&quot; polymer waveguides, electronics and optoelectronics on a circuit board \n\n• a roll-to-roll printing process for organic photovoltaic devices \n\n• a lamination process for reflective liquid crystal displays on plastic \n\n• novel sputtering processes to deposit high quality transparent metal oxide materials at temperatures compatible with using plastic substrates for large area electronic devices.\n\n• a state of the art fabrication line for liquid crystal on silicon devices to produce phase-only holography devices for video projection and telecommunications.\n\n\n\nCIKC commercialisation research projects addressed structural issues in our sector in the UK, examined the evolution of value chains, explored metrics for technology transfer and surveyed best practice in intermediate technology transfer organisations. We also funded 16 small scale feasibility studies and engaged with a wide range of other organisations and networks to disseminate our work.\n\n\n\nCIKC has also produced high quality research outputs with CIKC researchers giving 111 invited presentations and authoring 84 peer reviewed papers, over half with industry authors. 54 post-doctoral researchers and 19 PhD students were involved in CIKC projects and 237 young researchers attended CIKC training in entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\n\n\nThe CIKC model is effective in generating economic value from academic science and technology and producing high-calibre young scientists and engineers for industry. CIKC projects have produced significant intellectual property, transferred technology to industry partners and contributed to the formation of two spin-off companies with others under consideration. The CIKC is resourced to continue in its role as a facilitator of the commercial exploitation of advanced manufacturing technologies in photonics and electronics. CIKC focused on electronic and photonic devices incorporating a broad set of advanced materials, including polymers, liquid crystals, metal oxides and nanomaterials. The devices exploit new manufacturing techniques and low temperature processing enabling, in many cases, the fabrication of electronic and photonic devices on flexible plastic substrates, as well as the processing of advanced liquid crystal materials on active substrates. The research supported by CIKC opens up new and significant market opportunities in organic photovoltaics (OPV), reflective and projection displays, smart windows, diagnostics and sensor systems, optical interconnection and distribution, anti-counterfeiting and transparent microelectronics. Industries set to benefit from distributed electronics and photonics technologies developed within the CIKC include renewable energy, construction, healthcare, advertising, packaging and security printing, automotive and ICT.\n\nThrough its close links with the Judge Business School and the Centre for Business Research in projects such as ComLab, CIKC has played a pivotal role in policy initiatives that are aimed at ensuring the UK effectively exploits its world-leading research, by establishing the foundations for industries that could be worth billions of pounds in the coming years. Working with the Institute of Manufacturing (IfM), CIKC has been able to use strategic roadmapping tools to help guide promising science towards commercial opportunities. CIKC has supported young researchers become more aware of the commercial opportunities of their research through training in entrepreneurship and innovation management.
