A core concern of this project was the idea that globalisation is an issue of the past in its relation to the present, as much as it is an issue of the present in relation to the future. As well as engaging with the substantive themes outlined above, the research network looked at the conceptual and methodological innovations necessary to address the challenges that globalisation poses for the social sciences.These innovations are captured in the methodological consideration to be given to interdisciplinary engagement and cross-cultural research and learning.The network met four times over two years in research symposia and conferences to develop these themes. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-810-21-0002","grantId":"RES-810-21-0002","fundValue":"32038","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Given that the contribution of this work is to informing the ways in which we think about knowledge production generally, it is not easy to discover how our findings have been used.

It enabled an international group of early career academics to meet regularly over two years to discuss their individual research as well as collaborate in workshops and attend international conferences. \n\nKey issues under discussion within our Network centred on questions of interdisciplinarity in the context of thinking and rethinking globalisation and the social scientific categories it produces and which also produce it as an object of research. In particular, we organised our discussions around ideas of translation as central to interdisciplinary and cross-cultural research. While drawing on the insights and developments within the field of Translation Studies, we opened up the idea of translation as a metaphor for thinking about the challenges of researching across differences more generally - linguistic, disciplinary, or cultural - and in the context of understandings of 'the global'. The perceived scale and complexity of globalisation frequently gives rise to claims that it can only be addressed by cooperative effort across disciplines and we sought to develop innovative and critical ways of looking at the issues that arise from a critical engagement with the global. In this way, we not only addressed fundamental questions of interdisciplinarity, seen as a form of translation, but did so in the context of rethinking understandings of globalisation, or perhaps more appropriately, of the global, also as a form of translation. The work on interdisciplinarity can be used to inform the general turn to interdisciplinarity - identifying the challenges, pitfalls and opportunities, for example - that has become a central aspect of many research councils funding application processes.
