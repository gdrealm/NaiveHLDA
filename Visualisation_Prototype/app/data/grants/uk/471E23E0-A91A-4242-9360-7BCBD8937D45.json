Some follow-on funding was obtained to take some of the result of the project closer to commercialisation. Following on from this a University spin-out company was formed in 2012.

During the project we developed:\no Evolutionary techniques to be used within device models to alleviate parameter fluctuation problems.\no Showed how parameter variation datasets can be best used by evolutionary techniques to improve system performance.\no Illustrated how evolutionary techniques can be used to limit the effects of parameter variations. The developments within this project showed that novel evolutionary methods can be used to give real and important improvements to microelectronics design, particularly when faced with variability. This has been exploited through a University spin-out company. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
