The Act identifies a variety of settings, including the provision of education, in which discrimination on the basis of nine ‘protected characteristics’ is deemed illegal. Of the nine, three are directly relevant to this seminar series: sexual orientation, being in a civil partnership and gender reassignment. In turn, Ofsted has responded by updating its&nbsp;handbook for the inspection of further education and skills&nbsp;(2012) by identifying Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) learners as a group whose ‘needs dispositions, aptitudes or circumstances’ may mean that they ‘require particularly perceptive and expert teaching and, in some cases, additional support.’ This changed inspection framework presents institutions and ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) practitioners with a set of challenges which are in need of exploration from a range of disciplinary, professional and policy perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>The seminar series brings together researchers in a range of relevant fields (gender and sexuality studies, sociology and migration studies, legal studies and literary studies), ESOL practitioners, LGBT activists and policy makers with the intention of identifying and scoping an agenda for ongoing research networking and collaboration, nationally and internationally.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001012/1","grantId":"ES/L001012/1","fundValue":"30260","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Gray","coPersons":["Michael John Baynham","Melanie  Cooke"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" Not applicable this year.
