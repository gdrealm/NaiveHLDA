Recent research has identified climate-induced shifts in the altitudinal and latitudinal distribution of a variety of taxa; however the interaction between these two types of distributional shifts has rarely been studied. Elevation shifts may have the capacity to mask latitudinal shifts by delaying the extinction of species at a regional scale. Although species are likely to respond individually to climate change, the overall consequences of these changes will determine changes to biodiversity as a whole. Thus, exploring the interaction between altitudinal and latitudinal shifts is fundamental to our understanding of the potential effects of climate change on regional and global biodiversity. This project will investigate altitudinal changes in dung beetle species in five mountain regions along a latitudinal transect in Europe, where previous data are available from 14 to 26 years ago. I will test whether altitudinal occurrence of species in each area has increased since the previous survey, whether these changes are as great as would be expected given the amount of warming that has taken place, and whether these changes are related to the latitudinal position of the mountain range. Finally, I will explore the consequences of individual species shifts for both local and regional species richness.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E001602/2","grantId":"NE/E001602/2","fundValue":"37969","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Maria Rosa Menendez Martinez","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":" The result of this project indicated that dung beetle species have moved towards higher elevations in mountain regions in Europe consistent with the increase in temperature observed in these regions. Northern species and those restricted to the top of the mountains have experienced range contractions while Mediterranean and low-elevation species experienced range expansions. Individual species responses had lead to a decline in local and regional species richness in mountains like the Alps, were the fauna is dominated by cold tolerant species. However, in Mediterranean mountains (where very few species are restricted to the top of the mountain) both local and regional diversity has increased. The dataset generated from this research can be used for modelling realistic biological responses of species and ecological communities to future climate change across Europe. Can be used to inform the National Park authorities of the areas where the research has been carried out on best management practices to mitigate ecological impacts of future climate change.
