The goal of this study is to understand in detail how these convert the chemical energy of ATP, the almost universal fuel of life, into mechanical work. In recent years it has become clear that genetic defects in the components of the cardiac muscle system are a frequent cause of cardiac disease but in the human body there are some 100 types of molecular motor and the repercussions of errors in these non-muscle motors is only now becoming apparent in, for example, neurodegenerative diseases. Molecular motors can not only be studied at the single molecule level, but important features critical for future drug design, can only be deduced from studies at this level. The development of optical traps, which have the ability to hold and move extremely small particles using focussed laser beams, have made such studies possible. This approach has already greatly increased our understanding of several of the myosins molecules involved in motility within the cell, and further technical developments show great promise for similar progress for the type of myosin in skeletal and cardiac muscle.\n My second major line of interest is the elastic nature of cells. The importance of this property is most apparent in the red cell, which carries oxygen from the lungs to the heart and peripheral tissues. The cell is about 8 micrometres in diameter but has to flow through capillaries as small as 1 micrometre. The forces involved in distorting such cells are small but are conveniently in the range of the optical trap. Moreover the technologies we have developed in the myosin work for measuring position at the nano level (one billionth of a metre) are also appropriate for investigating the elastic properties of the red cell. Several blood diseases, notably haemolytic anaemias, are already known to be due to the altered elastic properties of the red cell but other cell types have an underlying structure similar to the elastic protein network of the red cell. Thus a deeper understanding in this sphere has a wide biomedical relevance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300412","grantId":"G0300412","fundValue":"585987","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Sleep","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
