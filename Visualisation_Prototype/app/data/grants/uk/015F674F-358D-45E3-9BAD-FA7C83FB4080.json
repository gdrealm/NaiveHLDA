Nonetheless, global measurements of key atmospheric species have not been made directly by previous satellite missions and these species, particularly atomic oxygen and the hydroxyl radical (OH), are targets for a low Earth orbit mission operating in the multi-terahertz (THz) spectral range (3 - 5 THz). A LOw Cost Upper-Atmosphere sounder (LOCUS) has therefore been proposed to ESA, which would be able to detect a broad range of important species (O, O3, OH, NO, CO, H2O and HO2) between altitudes of 50 and 400 km.\n\nHeterodyne radiometry provides a spectral resolution that is well suited to characterising emission signatures originating from the MLT. The technique has been demonstrated and proven at sub-terahertz frequencies through a number of space flight missions over the past two decades. However, operation above 3 THz (supra-terahertz) has never been attempted from a space environment, and measurements of a number of important atmospheric species that have potential impact on climate change and related space weather effects have therefore not been made. Even systems operated from an airborne platform are rare and require large instruments that are completely unsuitable for space flight. There is therefore a need to develop compact, high-sensitivity, supra-terahertz heterodyne systems capable of undertaking global atmospheric measurements from space. To achieve this goal, technical development of the heterodyne mixer detector and its local oscillator (LO) is required.\n\nThe preferred heterodyne mixing device for Earth observation is the Schottky barrier diode. Although a well-known semiconductor device, it has not been demonstrated in a planar form beyond ~3 THz and challenges related to fabrication and circuit embedding need to be solved to allow this technical evolution. Additionally, the provision of LO power and its coupling to the mixer diode, whilst already presenting a technical barrier at sub-terahertz frequencies, is a particularly difficult problem to resolve in the supra-terahertz range. Fortunately, the advent of the quantum cascade laser (QCL) semiconductor device provides the prospect of a miniaturized, low power, supra-terahertz LO source with sufficient output power to 'pump' the mixer diode as a part of the frequency down-conversion process. Additionally, electromagnetic simulation software now permits the analysis and optimisation of QCL and Schottky diode devices and their respective electrical embedding circuits, with new and advanced micro-fabrication techniques allowing corresponding manufacture. However, technical development is required before a supra-terahertz MLT remote sounding instrument can be realised. For instance, QCL and Schottky device performance optimisation, physical integration into a common (waveguide) package, and frequency stabilisation are necessary.\n\nWe therefore propose a proof-of-concept development programme with an objective of demonstrating key component technologies (QCL and Schottky diode) to a minimum technical readiness level of TRL 3. Within this programme we will significantly advance core heterodyne technologies through a stepwise development approach, and with a goal of integrating and testing a QCL and Schottky diode in a common waveguide mount. Consideration will also be given to the scientific application and future technical development towards TRL 4 and beyond.\n\nESA has accepted the LOCUS concept as one requiring further evaluation as a prelude to a future in-orbit demonstration. Technical advancement of a terahertz frequency spectrometer through this NERC Proof of Concept Programme would provide a step-change in the progress towards this important scientific objective, as well as positioning the UK ideally for future in-orbit programmes with ESA.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L01243X/1","grantId":"NE/L01243X/1","fundValue":"75979","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander Giles Davies","coPersons":["Bruce  Swinyard","John Maurice Plane","Edmund Harold  Linfield"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" Not applicable yet this year.
