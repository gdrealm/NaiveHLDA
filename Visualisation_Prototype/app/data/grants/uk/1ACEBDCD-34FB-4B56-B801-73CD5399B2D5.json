For example, the distribution of novel articles may depend on the animacy of the accompanying noun. </p>\n\n<p>Our previous research, using simple search tasks, revealed performance disruptions when the hidden regularities are violated, even in participants who claim to have no awareness of what those regularities are. This project will investigate:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>whether there are predispositions to learn certain types of form-meaning mapping and not others, </li>\n\n <li>whether such predispositions derive from the first, or second, languages, or universal grammar,</li>\n\n <li>the processes leading to conscious insight into the target regularities in some participants.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The methodology will also be extended to investigate whether eye movement tracking can be used as a non-invasive and indirect measure of implicit learning. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G008566/1","grantId":"ES/G008566/1","fundValue":"72176","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings from this research have been taken up by other, independent research groups, leading to related publications:\nGai, S.

We have used this to expose how the nature of the first language influences the unconscious learning of structures in a novel language. Implicit learning of the same regularity may or may not occur depending on prior knowledge. This shows that implicit learning is constrained by linguistic knowledge, and not just a simple associative, or statistical learning mechanism. Williams &amp; Leung have subsequently used the same method to explore further constraints, and Williams and others have begun to model the results using computational models. Independent researchers in the USA (Laura Batterink &amp; Helen Neville (University of Oregon) have adapted the experimental procedure and items for use with EEG recording to explore the neural basis of the effects that we obtained.
