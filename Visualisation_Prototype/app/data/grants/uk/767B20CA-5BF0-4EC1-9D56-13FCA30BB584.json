As the current global crisis has demonstrated, there is a clear need and demand for longer term institutional approaches to current and future economic and social challenges that makes research in economic and social particularly valuable, so the course will also provide subject specific training in employability and maximising the economic and policy impact of research.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H023097/1","grantId":"ES/H023097/1","fundValue":"26303","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Ruth Schenk","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
