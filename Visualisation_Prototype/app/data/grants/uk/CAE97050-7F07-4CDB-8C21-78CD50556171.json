It provides valuable information about how their lives change over time covering topics including health, family life, employment, income and a range of behaviours. </p>\n\n<p>Two areas of emphasis are research on ethnicity and identity, and linkage of direct indicators of individuals' health to their behaviours and family and social environments.&nbsp; It is a major resource for understanding key issues that face societies worldwide and an important part of the evidence base used to formulate and evaluate government policies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The target sample of 40,000 households provides an unprecedented opportunity to research issues that other surveys cannot because they are too small. To represent the diversity of UK society, the sample includes additional numbers of individuals from ethnic minorities.&nbsp; Innovation and methodological development are important parts of the overall project. </p>\n\n<p>The study includes a distinct sample, the Innovation Panel which plays a significant role in improving methods of collecting survey data. This award covers data collection for waves 3-5 plus activities supporting users and promoting Understanding Society to a range of audiences. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-586-47-0002","grantId":"RES-586-47-0002","fundValue":"26590400","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michaela  BenzevalNicholas Hedley Buck","coPersons":["Lucinda  Platt","Heather  Laurie","Dieter  Wolke","Stephen  Jenkins","Jonathan  Burton","Heidi Safia Mirza","Randy  Banks","Peter  Lynn","SC Noah  Uhrig","Stephanie L.
