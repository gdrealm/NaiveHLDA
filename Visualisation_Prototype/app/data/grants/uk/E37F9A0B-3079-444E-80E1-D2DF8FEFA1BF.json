{"id":"E37F9A0B-3079-444E-80E1-D2DF8FEFA1BF","title":"Making the connections: the arts, migration and diaspora","abstractText":"'Making the Connections' regional network will examine the transformative role of arts and culture in fostering integration and belonging for new arrivals in the East Midlands at the levels of history, experience, theory and policy. The network will build upon the strong regional work of the Arts Council East Midlands, academics in regional Universities, practitioners and policy makers in the arts, public and voluntary sector and diasporic communities to create synergies/collaborations across disciplinary boundaries, multiple layers of governance and lived experience. The network will thus generate recommendations for regional and national policy in relation to issues of\nMigration, Diaspora, Identity and Belonging. More significantly, perhaps, the network will address artistic access and cultural inclusion, in ways that will enhance the lives and Well-being of recent arrivals in the English East Midlands.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119478/1","grantId":"119478/1","fundValue":"20529","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maggie  O Neill","coPersons":["Philip  Hubbard"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
