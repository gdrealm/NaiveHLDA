It will advance our understanding of the ways in which, not just Brecht, but foreign literatures in general and across the full range of genres, negotiate cultural difference. It will result in major research publications, both in articles and special issues of internationally respected journals and in significant additions to the corpus of Brecht's writings in the English language. It will also provide integrated opportunities for cultural interchange with non-academic institutions through a programme of workshops and the like.\nBrecht is, internationally, one of the most performed of all writers for the theatre, often accounted second only to Shakespeare. His work is of huge significance for the professional theatre, in Britain and elsewhere, as well as for schools and drama colleges. At the same time, his cultural theoretical writings underpin work in media and cultural studies (esp. film) and in the development of a critical cultural theory. And, thirdly, he is widely recognised as the most important German poet of the twentieth century and enjoys an international reputation as one the greatest of Modernist poets. The translation, edition and transmission of the works of such an author in the English language is as important as that of Freud or Marx, e.g., yet it has been the subject of little critical analysis and engagement. 'Brecht into English' aims to set that right, by engaging an international network of leading Brecht scholars to reflect critically on the processes of translation and cultural transmission in the English-speaking world, both in the theatre and in print, and finally to contribute key volumes to the ongoing critical edition in English of Brecht's huge and varied oeuvre.\nThe project will be coordinated by Dr Tom Kuhn who, as an editor of the 'Methuen Drama' Brecht list (some 40 titles) since 1996, has enjoyed a privileged overview of Brecht translation and reception. He is one of the leading scholars of Brecht in the English-speaking world, with numerous publications. Having, over decades, nurtured relationships, not only with Brecht scholars, but also with the Brecht heirs (the copyright holders) and with the relevant publishers, Dr Kuhn has persuaded the interested parties to embark on several important new publications: a thoroughly revised Brecht on Theatre and a further volume, Brecht on Performance (much of the material appearing in English for the first time) which together will complete the 4-vol. set of theoretical writings; an entirely new 5-vol. edition of the Collected Poems; and a critical edition of the Berliner Ensemble Adaptations, to complete the 9-vol. Collected Plays. The translators, editors and other scholars assembled in this context represent a Core Team, poised to exploit an exciting opportunity to reflect both on the pragmatics of translation and on theories of intercultural exchange.\nCentral questions about the practices of translation, adaptation and cultural hybridity will be addressed in workshops and conferences. It is expected that the project will attract the International Brecht Society's (triennial) conference to Britain in 2016 on the theme 'Recycling Brecht'. There will be an exchange with theatre practitioners, led by the director Di Trevis, which will feed directly into the planned publications and into a parallel cultural programme. The project will have outputs, not only in the critical editions enumerated above, but also in special issues of major publications, including the Brecht Yearbook, research articles in peer-reviewed journals, and, finally, workshop protocols and films.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K000578/1","grantId":"AH/K000578/1","fundValue":"420128","fundStart":"2013-05-12","fundEnd":"2018-05-11","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our work has already given rise to a string of public events of, broadly, three types:\n1. Introductions to Brecht's theory and practice of the theatre for school and college students and for the general public;\n2. Public workshops and performances with theatre practitioners (esp. directors and actors, and students of directing and acting), which have enriched both their practice and our understanding of Brecht as a theorist and man of the theatre;\n3. Poetry readings and performances (semi-staged and with music and song) for a general public, which have revealed a 'performance dimension' even to that poetry which was not written for public reading or performance, and which have at the same time introduced Brecht as a poet to a wide audience.\nThese three types are not entirely distinct, and some events have seen a mixing of these approaches.\n\nAltogether this work has stimulated further intellectual engagement with Brecht's work (both for the research team and amongst the general public) and with forms of political and socially engag? literature beyond that of Brecht alone.\n\nWe have built up a following, both in the form of a mailing list and via Facebook and the website, and have initiated an active correspondence with the interested public nationally and internationally, who pay frequent visits to the project website.\n\nWe will continue to strive to widen participation in these activities and debates, so as to reach not only the 'literary festival public', poetry readers and schools, but also an audience beyond these socially relatively narrow confines.

Here, nonetheless, are some of the areas of particular interest newly broached by our research.\nPoetry\n1. The history of the translation of Brecht's poetry reveals ways in which successive generations have adapted their own versions to accord, both with their own political and ideological interests and - more interestingly - with the fashionable currents of contemporary poetry in their own languages and countries.\n2. Brecht is revealed as a poet of Eros, almost as much as a political poet.\n3. The ambiguity of concretes and abstractions in German reveals, in the process of translation, ambiguities in Brecht's thought (esp. on the moral absolutism/relativism divide).\n4. Our investigation of the specifics of German-English poetry translation are beginning to point us towards general conclusions about the translation of metre and multi-syllable rhyme.\nTheatre and aesthetic theory\n1. The bringing together of performance theory and performance practice has uncovered some fascinating ambiguities in Brecht's writing, especially in the writings of the Messingkauf/Buying Brass.\n2. The innovative juxtaposition of the Messingkauf and Modelbooks (in Brecht on Performance) has been particularly suggestive. Performance is revealed as a category that can be critically 'read' (not just experienced) and from that study a more generalised understanding of a theatrical approach may be induced. And theory, in turn, is transformed and rendered experiential. Brecht's writings on theatre are revealed as open and non-prescriptive experiments. Our findings open up new paths for research into: Brecht's work; the translation of poetry; processes of cultural transmission; the nexus of performance and theory; theatre practice (esp. acting theory); amongst others.
