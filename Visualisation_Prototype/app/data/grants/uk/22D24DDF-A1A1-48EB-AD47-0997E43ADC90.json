In terms of human life, the risk is overwhelmingly concentrated in the developing world, and predominantly in continental interiors, with the Alpine-Himalayan region and central Asia being particularly threatened. Many communities and cities in that region are known to be vulnerable because of past earthquakes, but now have considerably larger exposed populations. \n\nA first, and essential, step in reducing that vulnerability is to improve the level of knowledge and characterization of the hazard concerned; which is far below, for example, California or Japan. That task requires the engagement of scientists in the countries concerned, but would be greatly aided by the expertise available in the international scientific community, even in countries where the local scientific base is already strong.\n\nIn particular, two geological effects contribute to continental Asia's special vulnerability. (1) Earthquakes in continental interiors typically occur on widely distributed faults that are poorly known and move relatively infrequently. By comparison, those on plate boundaries adjacent to oceans (such as Japan, Chile) occur on faults that are more localized, better known, and move more often. (2) Many human settlements in continental interiors concentrate (and then grow) in locations related to earthquake-generating faults, which control topography, water supply or trade routes. \n\nImproving knowledge and understanding of the earthquake hazard is therefore inescapably linked to the first-order scientific question of how continental tectonics works - a cutting-edge priority at the highest level in international science, which also requires the full range of observational, theoretical and technical capabilities now available to the scientific community. \n\nThe issues involved in addressing earthquake hazard and earthquake science in the Alpine-Himalayan region and central Asia are therefore best tackled by international partnerships of scientists, which can help bring an appropriate mixture of expertise, technology, man-power and training to bear in each area or country. That is the point of the Partnership proposed here. \n\nThe UK-based investigators in this proposal, principally from COMET+ *, the BGS (British Geological Survey) and Durham, are in a unique position to lead this Partnership, having been engaged on the ground or remotely in nearly all the countries concerned for a decade or more. This proposal originates from that point being made by non-UK participants at an international workshop in 2011, held specifically to address issues related to increasing resilience to earthquake hazard.\n\nThis proposal is to facilitate the functioning of the Partnership through funding meetings, workshops and training activities, including a summer school and exchange visits, principally of young scientists between the UK and participating countries. The principal Project Partners, who will also contribute substantially to the costs, are Italy, Kazakhstan and China. Supporting members include Greece, Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Others may join later. The intention is that the benefits and functioning of the Partnership continue well beyond the duration of the IOF award.\n\n*COMET+ is the Dynamic Earth and Geohazards Group of NERC's National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO): see (http://comet.nerc.ac.uk)","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J016322/1","grantId":"NE/J016322/1","fundValue":"207837","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used to inform debates about earthquake hazard in vulnerable cities in Asia. In Iran, where our engagement has already been for more than 20 years, and where there is a strong bond of trust and understanding with local scientists, we were used to help reinforce the Geological Survey of Iran's (GSI) dialogue with the mayor of Tabriz and Governor of Azerbaijan province concerning the risk to Tabriz; a major city of 2M people that was destroyed twice in the 18th century. This dialogue led to adoption by GSI of a number of hard-hitting and uncompromising (and sensible) statements on their web site about the reality of the earthquake hazard in Iran. See:\nhttp://earthquake.conference.gsi.ir/en/contents/Closing-statements/Closing.statements.htm\nIn Kazakhstan, which is far less advanced than Iran in earthquake science, a productive dialogue has started between the scientists in our partnership and the mayor of Almaty, the former capital which was destroyed in 1887, 1889 and 1911, in which the example of progress in Iran was very helpful.

Some of this work has already been published, or is in press, in international journals, and represents the first real modern state-of-the-art earthquake science in Kazakhstan since the break-up of the former Soviet Union. It therefore has had considerable local impact already, and provides an incentive and impetus that we hope will encourage further collaboration and development of local capability in the future.\n(ii) Investigation of evidence for the uplift of the Rhodes coastline, leading to the conclusion that a major tsunami-generating earthquake was responsible about 3000 years ago. Analysis of that uplift has allowed the characterization of the likely earthquake and the better definition of the probable tsunami hazard associated with such events, which are quite rare. In an earlier study we demonstrated that a similar analysis in Crete allowed us to confirm the source of a tsunami that devastated the Nile delta in AD 365.\n(iii) New insights into the relationship between surface folding and 'blind' thrust earthquakes (which fail to rupture to the surface) in the Zagros mountains of Iran. This was made possible through the creative combined use of space-based radar interferometry, land-based seismology and field work, and has consequences for oil exploration in this part of the Middle East.\n(iv) Radar interferometric investigations of post-earthquake ground motions in Iran, leading to better understanding between earthquake motions and the generation of geological structures.\n(v) Discovery of major new earthquake-generating faults within peninsula India (i.e. away from the Himalaya, which is much better known).\n(vi) Various studies that use earthquake investigations to clarify the mechanical properties of plates and continental interiors. All our work that clarifies the nature and distribution of earthquake hazard in Asia has impact when transmitted to policy- and decision-makers. In the end this improved knowledge can be turned into increased resilience (the whole point of the project) through a trusted dialogue between scientists and politicians or the public. There is no doubt that trust is won through the demonstration that we are engaged in high-quality state-of-the-art research with local partners who are also well-connected to the global scientific community. That trust can then be used to encourage scientists, politicians, the construction industry and the public to all take responsibility for actions that can be taken to increase resilience.
