The processes controlling DNA compaction, are also known to be important for the control of crucial cellular processes, such as DNA replication and gene expression. Bacteria achieve this via several mechanisms, including via the interaction of a range of proteins termed nucleoid associated proteins (NAPs). In addition to compacting DNA, NAPs are thought to be required to change the structure of/reshape the compacted DNA molecule (known as remodelling), so that the other molecules involved in important cellular processes can access the DNA. For many bacteria, and in particular those known as gram positive bacteria, the roles of such proteins and how they are linked to other fundamental cellular processes is very poorly understood. However, in recent BBSRC funded studies of proteins thought to be involved in DNA replication within a gram positive organism (B. subtilis), we have discovered that two proteins called DnaD and DnaB have novel DNA remodelling activities. Together with other new experimental data, our studies are providing increasing evidence for these proteins being the link between DNA remodelling and replication. To progress these novel findings, we now need to significantly improve our knowledge of the molecular level properties of these proteins and how they interact with DNA. This project will therefore employ microscopy approaches that are able to image and record the forces on and between single molecules of DNA, proteins and their complexes, to provide such data. These proposed studies will not only help improve our understanding of DNA remodelling processes in B.subtilis, but should also improve our understanding of the functions of remodelling proteins in many other related organisms. In the long term, such information will impact on our knowledge of the processes underpinning DNA replication and gene regulation/expression within medically relevant Gram positive bacteria (including in Bacilli, Staphylococci, Streptococci and Clostridia), and could potentially lead to the identification new antibacterial therapeutic targets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G002800/1","grantId":"BB/G002800/1","fundValue":"372868","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings have led to important fundamental understanding of the bacterial proteins involved in DNA replication.

The processes controlling DNA compaction, are also known to be important for the control of crucial cellular processes, such as DNA replication and gene expression. Bacteria acheive this via several mechanisms, including via the interaction of a range of proteins termed nucleoid associated proteins (NAPs). In addition to compacting DNA, NAPs are thought to be required to change the structure of/reshape the compacted DNA molecule (known as remodelling), so that the other molecules involved in important cellular processes can access the DNA.\n\nFor many bacteria, and in particular those known as gram positive bacteria, the roles of such proteins and how they are linked to other fundamental cellular processes is very poorly understood. However, our previous BBSRC funded studies of DNA replication proteins from the gram positive organism, B. subtilis, highlighted that two proteins called DnaD and DnaB have novel DNA remodelling activies. This project built on these findings and was focussed upon improving our knowledge of the properties of these proteins and how they interact with DNA at the molecular level. \n\nThe project employed microscopy approaches able to image and record the forces on and between single molecules of DNA, proteins and their complexes. By performing detailed concentration dependent studies to explore the DNA binding properties of the proteins DnaD and DnaB, we have revealed new mechanistic insight into how these proteins remodel DNA. For example, for DnaD we have revealed the early stages of how this protein first binds to DNA in a cooperative manner, and then gradually builds a protein scaffold to keep the plasmid in an open circular form. In contrast, for DnaB we have revealed that this protein first untwists DNA, before laterally compacting the DNA molecule. New genetic information revealed during the course of this project also suggested that these two very distinct bacterial proteins may in fact be evolutionarily related; some of their domains show a high degree of similarity. To explore this further, and also the properties of the different domains of the proteins, we created two domain swapped hybrid proteins, termed BnDc, and DnBc. Interestingly, within bacterial studies (in-vivo) it was found that the protein BnDc could perform the duties of both of the native proteins DnaD and DnaB (e.g. in strains engineered to be absent of these proteins), whereas the protein DnBc was inactive. Investigations of the structures of the complexes of these proteins formed with plasmid DNA interestingly revealed that for BnDc the complexes were reminiscent of those observed in our previous studies when complexes were formed in the presence of proteins DnaD and DnaB in combination. The complexes formed with the protein DnBc however were reminiscent of those formed with DnaB only.\n\nThese studies have therefore provided considerable new insight into DNA remodelling processes in B.subtilis and in particular how these are related to DNA replication; these studies will also improve our understanding of the functions of remodelling proteins in many other related organisms. In the long term, this in turn should impact on our knowledge of the processes underpinning DNA replication and gene regulation/expression within medically relevant Gram positive bacteria (including in Bacilli, Staphylococci, Streptococci and Clostridia), and could potentially lead to the identification new antibacterial therapeutic targets. This project obtained fundamental biophysical information on the properties of the bacterial (B.subtilis) DNA remodelling proteins DnaD and DnaB. The research findings have not only provided significant new insight into how these proteins interact with each other and with DNA, but have begun to improve our understanding of how their remodelling activities are linked to replication and other biologically important processes. \n\nThis in turn, provides new information to impact on our understanding of the processes underpinning DNA replication and gene regulation/expression within medically relevant Gram positive organisms (Bacilli, Staphylococci,Streptococci and Clostridia), which in the long term could potentially lead to the identification new antibacterial therapeutic targets. The data yielded from this project will have immediate impact on our basic knowledge of these molecules, and in particular provides a much improved insight into how they bind to and remodel DNA. Through comparison with data from current related projects, e.g. investigating the expression of dnaB and dnaD genes and the structural biology of both proteins for example, the data will also impact on our understanding of the processes underpinning DNA replication and gene regulation/expression within B.subtilis.\n\nIn a wider research context, as homologues of both proteins are found in other low G+C content gram positive bacteria (including S. aureus, E. faecalis, S. pyogenes and C. acetobutylicum), the data should significantly improve our understanding of such processes within many other organisms. Importantly as many of these organisms are also medically relevant, in the long term the research could also potentially lead to the identification new antibacterial therapeutic targets Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
