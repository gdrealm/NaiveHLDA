Theoretical and observational studies show that CS is a good tracer of dense gas. A mapping of the starburst galaxy NGC 6946 has been completed for low-J transitions of CS using IRAM-30m. These have been used to determine the properties of the dense, star-forming gas\nacross the galaxy. In order to improve these calculations, we were awarded time to observe the same\nlocations of NGC 6946 in high-J transitions. This will pave the way for a potential survey\nmapping nearby galaxies in CS. We are requesting travel and subsistence money for George Kelly to go observing at the JCMT (note that we have been scheduled in just over 1 month time and we have only been told few days ago about it - hence the requested budget for the flight is quite expensive (the quoted price from our travel agency is 1500 pounds for the dates we needed.).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N002407/1","grantId":"ST/N002407/1","fundValue":"2348","fundStart":"2015-07-20","fundEnd":"2015-10-19","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Serena  Viti","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
