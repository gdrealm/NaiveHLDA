These subjects have decreased ability to respond to respond to microorganisms that they were immune to when they were younger. We found that the immune cells in the skin were fully functional, however they were inhibited from acting by other cells in the skin.\n\nPart of this grant involves joint studies with the Drs. Bonnie Blomberg and Daniela Frasca at the University of Miami on the ageing of B cells. This collaboration has led to the application of a Welcome Trust Senior Investigator award with Akbar as the PI and Blomberg and Frasca as collaborators. Our studies suggest that when trying to boost the immune system during ageing, it would be beneficial to remove the inhibitory influences that are present in the skin , rather then to boost the activity of the immune cells.
