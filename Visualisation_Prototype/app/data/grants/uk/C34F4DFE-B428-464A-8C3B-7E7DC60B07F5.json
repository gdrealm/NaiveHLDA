It is important to stress how surprising are the Himba data. Indeed, so much is global bias the norm in the analysis of visual stimuli, that it has even been proposed as a default human characteristic. Clearly, the Himba dispute that view. The similarities in attention between the Himba and atypically developing individuals (eg, autistic children) coupled with the strikingly different social outcomes, will open up new avenues for research away from current biologically deterministic views. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1647","grantId":"RES-062-23-1647","fundValue":"400374","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jules  Davidoff","coPersons":["Karina J  Linnell","Jan Willem De Fockert","Andrew  Bremner"],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
