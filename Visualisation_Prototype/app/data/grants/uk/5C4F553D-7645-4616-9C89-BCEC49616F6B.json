The project will address two research questions.</p> \n<p>First, it will investigate whether firms locate their research and development (R&amp;D) facilities near to university research departments and whether the quality of university research matters for the extent of geographic clustering. For example, do firms in the pharmaceuticals industry locate their R&amp;D laboratories near to chemistry and medical science departments carrying out world-class frontier research? Evidence that they do might imply that close geographic proximity to universities enables firms to capitalise better on the expertise of university scientists. </p> \n<p>The research will also look at the geographic clustering of foreign-owned R&amp;D labs around universities within Great Britain. Evidence that foreign-owned firms locate in the vicinity of frontier research departments would be in line with firms sourcing technology from Higher Education Institutions internationally.</p> \n<p>The second research question examines university-business interactions more directly. It will investigate whether geographic proximity to university research departments of varying research quality is related to the likelihood that firms engage in co-operative R&amp;D arrangements with universities and use information and knowledge generated by universities to help them innovate.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-171-22-0001","grantId":"RES-171-22-0001","fundValue":"43936","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen Deborah Simpson","coPersons":["Laura  Abramovsky"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
