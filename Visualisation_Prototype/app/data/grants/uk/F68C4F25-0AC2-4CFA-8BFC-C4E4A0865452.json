{"id":"F68C4F25-0AC2-4CFA-8BFC-C4E4A0865452","title":"Primitive Micrometeorites: Opening a Window into the Early Solar System","abstractText":"The goal of this project is to perform the first high-resolution study of the mineralogy and composition of a newly discovered group of extraterrestrial dust particles, known as CU3 micrometeorites, which may be the most primitive asteroidal materials yet identified. Such materials will record the conditions within the solar nebula at 3 AU that, together with studies of Kuiper Belt materials, will provide a snapshot of the mineralogical and chemical variation through the protoplanetary disk around the young Sun. The target micrometeorites (Fig. 1) have already been identified as 'primitive' on the basis of several fundamental criteria (see background) but have, as yet, not been characterised at sufficient resolution to allow comparisons with other asteroidal and Kuiper Belt materials. Support is requested for instrument and staff time to enable a one year pilot study of these potentially very important Solar System materials to address two key STFC strategy questions 'How do planetary systems evolve' and 'How are the chemical elements created'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G002924/1","grantId":"ST/G002924/1","fundValue":"35326","fundStart":"2009-12-12","fundEnd":"2010-12-11","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew  Genge","coPersons":["David William McComb","David S McPhail"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
