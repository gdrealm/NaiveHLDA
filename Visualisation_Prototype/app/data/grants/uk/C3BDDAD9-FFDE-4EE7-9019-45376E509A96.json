{"id":"C3BDDAD9-FFDE-4EE7-9019-45376E509A96","title":"Industrial Productivity, Health Sector Performance and Policy Synergies for Inclusive Growth: A Study in Tanzania and Kenya","abstractText":"<p>This project studies the supply chains of essential medicines and medical equipment and supplies from local industries and imports into the health systems in Tanzania and Kenya. Shortages and unaffordability of these commodities are persistent causes of exclusionary and poor quality health care in low income Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The hypothesis is that better integration between industrial and health policies could contribute to higher employment, industrial upgrading, and improved health system performance and accessibility. If this is correct, improved industrial production - higher productivity, more appropriate and cheaper products, and innovative production methods - could improve health service performance while raising economic output: in other words, contribute to inclusive growth.</p>\n\n<p>The project will interview heath facilities, shops and wholesalers in all sectors, in urban and rural contexts, about their procurement practices and problems. Mapping of supply chains will be followed by data collection at firm level. Private sector businesses and policymakers, and health sector managers and policymakers, will debate the scope for more integrated policy making. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J008737/1","grantId":"ES/J008737/1","fundValue":"561721","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Maureen  Mackintosh","coPersons":["Watu  Wamae","Paula  Tibandebage","Samuel  Wangwe","Mariana  Mazzucato","Roberto  Simonetti"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
