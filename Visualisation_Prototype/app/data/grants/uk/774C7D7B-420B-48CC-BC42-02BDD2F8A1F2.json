The non-invasive nature of the PIV technique is vital for research in many flows, such as micro-fluidics, flow separation control, two-phase flows and turbulent combustions. The aim of proposed work is to investigate these challenging fluid phenomena using a flexible PIV system to be purchased on an EPSRC multi-project equipment grant.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G025150/1","grantId":"EP/G025150/1","fundValue":"623786","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Two sets of PIV systems have been purchased to use for 2-D as well as stereoscopic flow measurements, which resulted more than 10 quality publications.
