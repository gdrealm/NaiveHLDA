First, it examines the discourses at play in the relationship between qualified therapists (counsellors, counselling psychologists, psychotherapists) and their bisexual clients. It aims to identify the treatment needs of bisexual clients and the training requirements for therapists working with this group. Secondly, the research explores the role of emotion as a 'regulatory system' used to keep people within fixed gendered and sexualised categories. It examines how emotions are assigned onto and into the body and how gender and sexuality configure in this constellation.</p>\n\n<p>The research is based on 40 in-depth interviews with qualified lesbian, gay-male, bisexual and heterosexual therapists who work/have worked with bisexual clients as well as with a focus group of 12 bisexual clients and ex-clients.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>Frame Analysis and Narrative Analysis provide a new methodological approach to studying emotions, sexuality and gender and focuses upon: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the cultural construction of emotion words and scripts;</li>\n\n <li>the encounter as a place where the co-construction of meaning takes place;</li>\n\n <li>and the personal where the individual maintains a narrative of the self.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Consequently, three levels of analysis (cultural, encounter, personal) are produced.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F017693/1","grantId":"ES/F017693/1","fundValue":"74380","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lyndsey Therese Moon","coPersons":["Deborah Lynn Steinberg"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
