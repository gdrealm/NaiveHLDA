Nevertheless, some viruses and bacteria evade these defences and in this situation antibodies play a key role in protecting us from serious infection. When we have not encountered a particular infection previously there may be no pre-existing antibody that is able to control its spread. In this situation the speed of production of antibody is critical if the infection is to be limited and severe disease prevented. The proposed programme is focusing on the early production of antibody in response to infection. The studies will based on previous work in the laboratory which has shown that the cells that give rise to antibody ? B cells ? have to receive a series of signals in a succession of microenvironments as they mature to antibody producing cells. The nature of these signals varies with the type of infection and this variation affects the speed of the response as well as the amount and type of antibody produced. Suboptimal response of the B cells at any stage for genetic or environmental reasons can result in an unfavourable outcome to the infection. The programme seeks to identify how these antibody responses can be modified to secure optimal protection.\nA second part of the programme will characterise the cells in certain tissues such as the bone marrow and spleen that are required to sustain secrete antibody cells. Understanding how these cells support antibody production may suggest ways in which the levels of antibodies produced can be modified. This becomes particularly relevant when one considers that sometimes the complex mechanisms that control responses against infections fail and antibodies are made that can bind to and lead to damage of healthy tissue. Such antibodies are known as autoantibodies. The programme will investigate how autoantibody production is sustained in Sjogrens syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. There is reason to suppose that cells that sustain the production of autoantibodies in these patients show differences in location and character from those that support the production of protective antibody. Identifying the molecular basis of these differences may make it possible selectively to curtail the function of cells that support autoantibody production.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G8402371","grantId":"G8402371","fundValue":"6150030","fundStart":"1984-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Calman MacLennan","coPersons":["Christopher  Buckley","Sylvie  Freeman"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
