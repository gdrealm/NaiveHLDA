The most important types of parasitic worms live in the stomach and intestine of their animal host. Some cause diarrhoea, which can be severe, whilst others feed on blood and cause internal bleeding and anaemia. Severely affected animals may die, or have to be destroyed on welfare grounds, whilst more mildly affected animals have sub-optimal growth rates which can have serious economic implications for the farmer. Indeed, parasitic worms the most economically important disease of sheep and have been estimated to cost the sheep industry in the region of &pound;80M per annum. They are similarly important in cattle. These economic losses are directly related to the severity of infection and so by reducing the number of parasites infecting livestock, we can proportionally reduce the costs to the industry as well as improving animal welfare. Control of these parasites is heavily dependent upon the routine treatment of livestock with drugs (anthelmintics, commonly called wormers) and there are only three major types available. In many parts of the world, parasitic worms are now resistant to all of these drugs. In the UK, over 60% of sheep worms are resistant to at least one drug class and multiple resistance is increasing. Consequently, the problem of drug resistant worms is a significant threat to the sustainability of the UK sheep and cattle industries. Detection of resistance is problematic and current methods are old fashioned, labour-intensive and very insensitive, making diagnosis unreliable and early detection impossible. Consequently, there is a need to develop modern sensitive tests for routine diagnosis and surveillance and as tools to study the way in which drug resistant parasites appear and spread. An understanding of these issues is critical fr the design of parasite control regimes that are both effective and sustainable and to develop ways of using these important drugs that do not exacerbate the development of resistance This project aims to develop and apply tools to elucidate a number of key aspects of the biology and genetics of these parasites that will help us understand how drug resistance develops and how it may be combated. Sheep worms will be studied because drug resistance is the most advanced in these parasites and they are amenable to experimental work. The project will also develop a genome sequence database that will not only enable us to study the problem of resistance but will assist other researchers to develop vaccines and identify new drug targets in these parasites. The research team will be multidisciplinary and include vets and scientists with expertise in genetics, molecular biology, genomics, epidemiology, statistics, parasitology and clinical veterinary medicine. The first stage of the project will be to establish the tools needed, including DNA sequence and genetic markers from the two major parasite species of parasite to be studied. In parallel to this work, parasite samples will be collected from sheep throughout the UK and molecular-based diagnostic tests used to determine the species present. The genetic markers that have been developed will then be used to 'fingerprint' the parasite populations to investigate their genetic diversity. Parasite genes that are already known to confer resistance will be sequenced to investigate the different ways parasites are becoming resistant to these drugs and to provide information that will pave the way for the development sensitive diagnostic tests based on parasite DNA typing. Finally, a system of genetic analysis, not previously applied to parasitic worms, will be investigated that will scan the worm's genome to identify regions containing previously unknown resistance-conferring genes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E018645/1","grantId":"BB/E018645/1","fundValue":"15527","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The phenotypically ivermectin resistant fourth generation backcross strains of H. contortus have subsequently been serially passaged and selected with ivermectin treatment to allow recombination to reduce size of introgressed regions of the genome.

Genetic approaches to identify loci determining anthelmintic resistance \nIn the original application we had planned to select a sensitive isolate with ivermectin to generate iso-genic resistant and sensitive lines and identify regions of the genome under selection using several hundred microsatellite markers. As a result of the problems encountered with developing large numbers of microsatellites and the high level of intra line diversity, we redesigned the approach but retained the original objective. This approach was designed to overcome the limitations of current analyses of genes associated with ivermectin resistance by the use of genetics to associate phenotype with genotype. We have used three H.contortus lines ISE (partly inbred, sensitive), CAVR (partly inbred, resistant to ivermectin, sensitive to BZ) and WRS (resistant to ivermectin and BZ) for the genetic analysis of ivermectin resistance. Two backcrosses were made CAVR x ISE &amp; WRS x ISE by surgical introduction of 50 male (ISE) + 50 female worms (CAVR or WRS) into the abomasum of lambs to allow mating to take place. Eggs were harvested from faeces, developed to L3 in vitro, and constitute the F1. These were used to infect sheep to produce immature adults which were removed from the abomasa, then 50-100 male ISE + 50-100 female F1 were surgically transferred to sheep coupled with ivermectin selection. Backcrossing of the progeny to the male ISE line was repeated 3 times with ivermectin selection of each infection to generate progeny which represent the fourth backcross (BC4) but with selection for the alleles/regions of the genome determining resistance from the original resistant parent (CAVRS or WRS). Thus, the BC4 progeny will have genomes largely derived from the ISE sensitive parent but with the regions determining ivermectin resistance derived from the resistant parent(s). The resistance phenotype of these progeny has been determined and, interestingly, is lower than that of the parental lines. This result implies that resistance is determined by several loci and supports the results of previous analyses using a candidate gene approach. The BC4 progeny and the parental lines have been genotyped with the panel of microsatellite markers and the results show that alleles at 15 out of 16 loci are derived from ISE (ISE x CAVR) and alleles at 8 out of 9 loci are derived from ISE (WRS x ISE). Thus a maximum of ~ 6% of the genome of the BC4 progeny (CAVR x ISE) are derived from the resistant parents. The one microsatellite locus with alleles derived from the resistant parents is, interestingly, the same in both crosses and provides a marker for ivermectin resistance. Furthermore selection of the BC4 progeny with ivermectin leads to an increase in frequency of this allele confirming its association with resistance. These data show, in principal, that genome regions of the resistant parent have been selected into the sensitive background (ISE) and so this approach is feasible. Thus proof of principal has been obtained and the results are currently being written up for publication. In addition to undertaking these backcrosses, crosses between a single male and 50 females were successfully achieved, using surgical implantation, and the adult females (post mating) removed at necropsy with eggs being harvested from the adult females in vitro, with subsequent development to L3. These were shown to be the F1 by marker analysis. This development allows the collection of progeny from a single mating and so opens up the possibility of undertaking formal genetic analysis with this parasite.
