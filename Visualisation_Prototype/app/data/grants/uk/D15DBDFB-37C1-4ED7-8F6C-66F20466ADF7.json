{"id":"D15DBDFB-37C1-4ED7-8F6C-66F20466ADF7","title":"Care pathways and outcomes: The teenage years","abstractText":"Across the UK, when children enter care, they live in a range of different placements, such as foster care, kinship care (with relatives or friends), adoption or with their birth parents. However, adoptive placements are much less likely than foster or kinship placements to break down in the mid to late teenage years (Rock et al., 2013).\n\nThe proposed study is a fourth wave of a longitudinal study that has been following a population of children who entered care at a young age. This group represents all 374 children who were under five years old and in care in Northern Ireland on the 31st March 2000. The study has been tracking where these children end up living, and how they are getting on. At this stage, they are in their mid to late teenage years, when the risk of placement breakdown increases. The proposed study aims to compare how these young people are progressing in their different placement types. It also seeks to explore the levels of stability and placement breakdown that has occurred, and to identify the reasons for this. These factors will then be discussed in reports and workshops for social care and legal practitioners in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, where the systems are very similar, so as to directly impact upon policy and practice.\n\nIn order to fulfil these objectives, firstly all the children's placements will be identified on the 31st March 2015, when the young people will be between 15 and 19 years old. This will be the fifth time (2000, 2002, 2004, 2007, 2015) that the placement profile for the full population will have been specified. No other study in the world has been able to track a population of young children in care in this way.\n\nSecondly, an attempt will be made to recruit the total population of young people for data collection via two home visits. However, on the basis of previous research in this area, we anticipate that approximately 213 young people and their parents/carers will take part in direct interviews. In the first visit, the young person will complete an electronic questionnaire on a computer tablet, whilst at the same time their parents/carers will complete a manual questionnaire. This will involve the collection of purely quantitative data. In the second visit, the young person will engage in a verbal interview with researchers, facilitated by materials presented on the computer tablet, and at the same time the parents/carers will take part in a semi-structured interview. These interviews will allow for a detailed comparisons to be made between groups of young people in different types of placements (i.e. foster care, kinship care, adoption, living at home), and also between those young people who have remained within long-term stable placements and those who have experienced instability and placement breakdown. \n\nThis is a unique study and is very well placed to further our understanding of the benefits, costs, and wider impact of a range of placements provided to children who enter care at a young age, especially during the often challenging mid to late teenage years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M011674/1","grantId":"ES/M011674/1","fundValue":"773263","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2019-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Dominic Martin McSherry","coPersons":["Teresa  Rushe","Montserrat  Fargas Malet"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
