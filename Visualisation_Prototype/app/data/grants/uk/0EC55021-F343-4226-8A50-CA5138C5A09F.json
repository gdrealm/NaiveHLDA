The study will produce a politico-administrative anatomy of this core institution in its five roles: as a central department,&nbsp; ministry of finance, economics ministry, domestic policy actor, and agency of foreign economic policy.&nbsp; Its role since 1997 will be placed in historical, ideological and global contexts.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The aim is to illuminate the ways it has changed and evolved during the tenure of one of the longest serving and most influential Chancellors in the post-war era. Whilst the principal focus will be on HM Treasury, the research also assesses the changing inter-relationships between it and the rest of Whitehall, the territorial administrations, and the Bank of England; and intra-Treasury relationships between officials, advisors and Ministers.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>This will be the first contemporary and comprehensive study that combines research into materials in the public domain with discussions with participants in the policy process. It will test three hypotheses and a series of research questions. It uses a specially constructed analytical framework which synthesises a number of literatures, including core executive studies, new institutionalism and network analysis.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0369-A","grantId":"RES-062-23-0369-A","fundValue":"59385","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Thain","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
