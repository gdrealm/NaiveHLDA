{"id":"E04F26DB-395D-48A9-AB34-826A47911F67","title":"Structural Integrity of Components with Deep Compressive Residual Stresses","abstractText":"Laser peening (LP) is a relatively new surface treatment technique with tremendous potential for the mitigation of otherwise life-limiting surface cracking. Using a laser to create a plasma shock wave it is possible to introduce compressive stresses deep into metallic components. These compressive stresses can have a significant effect in increasing the fatigue life of components.Paradoxically, because of the pace of commercial interest in exploiting these techniques, a basic fundamental understanding of the processes and their effects is lacking. As a result optimisation is ad-hoc and time consuming, peening can lead to unexpected stress distributions especially for complex and thin geometries, and current lifing strategies are based solely upon large test matrices. Because the stresses introduced by the laser shock wave can be very deep, the balancing tension may be sub-surface or may arise laterally. Surprisingly the 3D distributions are unknown for thin samples and around holes and webs where greatest advantages in life prolongation are likely to be obtained. Areas of particular concern relate to:- The need to optimise peening processing conditions to ensure optimal residual stress , - The lack of understanding of geometry effects which are much more complex for deep processes than for shot peening, both in terms of compressive stress and location of tensile hot spots- The stability of the residual stresses under fatigue at room and elevated temp- The lack of a process optimisation modelling tool, - The need for a validated lifing approach. In addition, in the UK nearly all the development work has been focused on Ti-6Al-4V. The lack of a database for other materials is hindering the take up of the process by other engineering sectors. LP is most cost-effective at 'hot spot' locations. Typical locations include fastener holes, webs, the leading edges of blades, blade root fixings, etc. For this reason, within this project we will focus on thin sections vs thick as well as around holes.We will first investigate the relationship between the laser peening parameters, materials properties and sample geometry (Manchester/MIC). This data will be used to develop predictive models of the process (Oxford) so that the process can be optimised and the most advantageous stress fields introduced economically for Ti, Al and steel. Then using generic test-piece geometries typical of thin sections and samples with stress concentrators, we will examine the evolution of these stresses as well as crack growth under fatigue at room (Al) (Airbus/Manchester) and elevated temperature (Ti6246) (Manchester/Swansea/Rolls-Royce) and thereby evaluate the structural integrity implications (Swansea).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F026730/1","grantId":"EP/F026730/1","fundValue":"360204","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Withers","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" The project aimed to better understand the relationship between laser peening parameters and the resulting residual stresses (measured at Manchester and modelled at Oxford) and subsequently their effect of fatigue life (characterised at Swansea). A key outcome from a manufacturing point of view was the determination of the effect of laser energy, number of shots and pulse duration on the depth and magnitude of the compressive residual stresses for thick and thin Ti-6Al-4V and aerospace Al alloy samples. Attention was not focused solely on flat plat samples but also more complex generic component geometries including holes and webs. A key outcome was a model developed by Oxford and validated by x-ray, synchrotron, neutron and contour method measurements at Manchester that shows that although the residual stress is geometry dependent the eigenstrain generating it is largely the same whatever the geometry, simplifying modelling of complex peening treatments. Another key finding related to the residual stresses around peened holes which helped to explain why in some cases an increase in fatigue life was found and in others it wasn't. Here we studied various peening strategies including complete peening of the sample and the peening of a patch around the hole; this work was linked to the fatigue lives measured at Swansea and the location of crack initiation. Our work demonstrated the importance of engineering in an elastically constraining region, if the eigenstrain caused by peening is to deliver a significant residual stress. The principal output of the project was therefore a validated modelling tool which can be used at the design stage to enable the efficient design of components subjected to laser shock peening. Another important finding from Airbus viewpoint was the difficulty of introducing compressive stresses into thin Al plate by laser peening. The residual stress measurement lessons are being directly transferred into the stress measurement Unit at Manchester which is UKAS accredited and undertakes the laser peened fan blade root treatment assurance program for Rolls-Royce. Metal Improvement Company will incorporate the project findings relating to laser peen process parameter/residual stress relationships into their own guidelines for laser peening a range of metallic components. The work will also enable designers to understand the residual stress created by the process in better detail. The process can then be optimised, resulting in lighter and cheaper components in safety-critical and other applications. Rolls-Royce plc are undertaking an extensive program of work looking at laser peening because it is already part of their manufacturing process for fan blades. In addition a parallel EPSRC funded project has provided complementary information relating to the effect of foreign object damage (FOD) on laser peened components. A fatigue crack growth model has been developed between Manchester and Rolls-Royce to allow the prediction of the life of laser peened aerofoils subjected to FOD. The results of the project have been transferred to Airbus via a workshop at the Hamburg site in February 2012 attended by all the teams within the project. Metal Improvement company have incorporated some of the understanding to their staff via a training day in Sheffield around An Introduction to Residual Stresses, Peening and their Relationship to Fatigue Performance (19th Nov 2009). In addition Prof Withers has spoke at two Industry days run by MIC (July 22nd 2010: Developments in surface engineering for the nuclear storage and critical vessel industry, and Nov 25 2011: Developments in Surface Treatments for Enhanced Material Integrity, run by Metal Improvements Company. Wider dissemination will be through the normal routes of journal publications and conference presentations.
