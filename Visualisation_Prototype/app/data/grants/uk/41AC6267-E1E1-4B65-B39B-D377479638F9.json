Members of the family include polioviruses, foot and mouth disease virus, hepatitis A virus and the common cold viruses (rhinoviruses). Rhinovirus (RV) infections are the most common infection afflicting mankind and there are no effective therapies or vaccines. Although the symptoms of the common cold are usually mild in healthy individuals, common colds are still an enormous burden to society. In patients with asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) RV infections can provoke acute worsening of their disease. This is a major cause of serious illness and death and represents an enormous health care cost. Viruses need to hijack the host cell's biological systems in order to replicate. RV like all picornaviruses are very simple but despite years of study there is still relatively little known about how they interact with the host cell's biological systems in order to replicate themselves, or how they get around the host's defence mechanisms. Following entry of the virus into a host cell, the viral genome is translated into a single long protein that subsequently gets cut into the 4 structural coat proteins and 7 non-structural proteins that participate in viral replication. These 7 non-structural proteins perform the functions required to replicate the viral genome and to assemble new virus particles inside the host cell. In order to perform these functions, the viral proteins interact with proteins and biological systems in the host cell to turn the cell into a factory for producing virus. Understanding how these 7 viral proteins turn the host cell into a virus producing factory is crucial if we are to discover drugs that block the virus. Historically we have tried to make antiviral drugs that target the virus, but viruses are very good at mutating to escape the effects of drugs targeted at the virus itself. However some of the host proteins that the virus hijacks may be drug targets themselves. The advantage being that the virus may not easily be able to mutate to avoid the effects of drugs targeted at a host protein. The aim of the project is to find host targets to which we can make antiviral drugs.\n\nTo do this we must first define how the virus replicates on membranes inside the cell. These membranes are made of lipids (or fats) and proteins and we believe the virus changes the lipid and protein composition of these membranes for its replication. Experimentally we will infect cultured human lung cells with the virus and then extract fats from the infected cells and measure any changes in fat content using state of the art biochemistry methods. Using computational techniques we anticipate that these results will tell us about host systems essential for viral replication. We can confirm these results by knocking out these host systems or using chemical inhibitors to block them and measuring the effect on viral replication. As we are working in a hospital setting we will have the ability in future to see if these biological systems are disturbed in patients with asthma or COPD, so translating our findings from the lab to the bedside. If the results look promising, we will start drug discovery programmes based on our findings, either ourselves or by partnering with Industry. The project is a partnership between Imperial College and the Babraham Institute and will create a multi-disciplinary team across two centres of excellence tackling a challenging biological problem of major medical importance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M004821/1","grantId":"MR/M004821/1","fundValue":"568547","fundStart":"2015-01-12","fundEnd":"2018-01-11","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Wakelam","coPersons":["Roberto  Solari","Michael  Edwards","Nicolas  Le Novere"],"organisation":"Babraham Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
