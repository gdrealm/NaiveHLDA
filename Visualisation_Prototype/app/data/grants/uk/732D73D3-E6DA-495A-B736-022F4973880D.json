Of all organic matter that sinks out from the surface, &gt;90% is degraded in the mesopelagic with only a small fraction escaping into the deep ocean (&gt;1000 m). The mesopelagic thus represents an important barrier: most material falling into it is prevented from sinking further by remineralisation - the degradation process that breaks down organic matter and releases CO2 and inorganic nutrients to solution. Eventually, physical mixing or ocean circulation deliver the nutrients back to the surface to fuel phytoplankton growth. Hence, remineralisation in the mesopelagic is critical to controlling the oceanic biological pump, and can affect the ocean's ability to sequester atmospheric CO2. Nitrogen is often the limiting nutrient for biological production in global oceans, its remineralisation would thus be key to biological pump efficiency. However, the mechanisms of N-remineralisation are poorly characterized, and there are no rate measurements of this process in the mesopelagic. \n\nThe remineralisation of nitrogen (N) in the oceans encompasses ammonification: the degradation of organic N to ammonium (NH4+), and subsequently nitrification: the oxidation of NH4+ to nitrite and then nitrate. However, a recent study suggests that some nitrifiers (microorganisms conducting nitrification) can utilise organic N directly, thus presenting a possible shortcut in the N-cycle. Because the respective organisms have different feeding styles regarding carbon (CO2- fixing or producing), the relative abundance and activities of these functional groups of organisms will have different direct impacts on the CO2 balance, and the existence of the potential shortcut will likely cause a shift towards autotrophy (CO2 fixation).\n\nThis project aims to determine exactly how and how much nitrogen is remineralised in the twilight ocean, using a combination of state-of-the-art geochemical rate measurements and molecular biological analyses. In particular, we will determine whether the above-mentioned shortcut exists in the remineralisation of organic nitrogen (N) to nitrate (NO3-), and quantitatively assess its potential significance to the oceanic N-cycle relative to the conventional ammonification-nitrification pathway. Together, these planned analyses will give the most complete dataset of directly measured N-remineralisation fluxes ever attempted in the oceans.\nState-of-the-art 15N-stable-isotope-labeling experiments will be conducted to measure rates of concurrent N-conversions for a more accurate assessment of upper ocean N-budget: ammonification, nitrification, assimilation (incorporation of N into biomass) and release of dissolved organic N. We will do this by tracing 15N (the heavy stable isotope of N that is rare in nature, as opposed to the common 14N) from various amended organic substrates into different N-pools at the same time, to determine whether organic-N is directly channeled to nitrification or via ammonification. In parallel, major remineralisation pathways will be identified by elucidating the expression of biomarker enzymes key to these N-conversions at both gene transcript and protein levels, as quantifiable activity indicators for the respective processes.\n\nSampling is planned along the Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) from the north (UK) to south Atlantic (Falklands/Chile) to examine N-remineralisation in diverse nutrient regimes, while temporal variability is explored via seasonal sampling at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) site. Such spatiotemporal coverage and complementary, interdisciplinary dataset would yield a highly representative depiction of mesopelagic N-remineralisation in the oceans, and the most comprehensive assessment to date on the significance of the twilight zone in oceanic N-cycle.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N003187/1","grantId":"NE/N003187/1","fundValue":"498266","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Phyllis  Lam","coPersons":["Thomas  Bibby","Paul  Skipp"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
