Sadly this protection is not always effective and children and young people have been sexually exploited through the years. One of the methods of sexual exploitation is prostitution, where a child acts as an object of sexual gratification in return for some pecuniary benefit. Several government and non-governmental strategies have been created in order to try and stem the exploitation of children from prostitution, the most recent being the government-led document Paying the Price which, after consultation, led to the creation of a coordinated strategy to combat the exploitation of adults and children through prostitution.\n\nThe emphasis of the strategy is, however, on clearing the streets of prostitution and very little is mentioned of the fact that prostitution can be facilitated in many ways, with street-based prostitution being perhaps only the most visible. In recent years the use of Information Communication Technology (ICT), particularly the Internet, to sexually exploit children has become increasingly recognised. The use of ICT to, for example, trade abusive images of children and to 'groom' children for abuse has been detected and the government has reacted to these threats through the creation or amendment of specific laws.\n\nParallel to this knowledge has been the recognition that ICT has also been used to facilitate prostitution, with the creation of a number of websites dedicated to finding, advertising and even arranging the services of prostitutes and other sex workers. The growth of digital technology and home-based broadband connections has meant that these sites exist on two planes: the first is the facilitation of offline prostitution through arranging the work of prostitutes, booking visits etc.\nThe second is online sexual behaviour, with the use of webcams to broadcast sex acts live on the Internet. It is known\nthat the use of ICT in this context has been used to facilitate both adult and child prostitution.\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nThe primary aim of this research was to consider whether the criminal law is effective at tackling those who seek to exploit children through prostitution facilitated by ICT (either as a 'controller' or a 'customer').\n\nThe objectives of this research were:\n\na) Identify a series of case-studies that demonstrate how ICT is used to facilitate the sexual exploitation of children by prostitution.\nb) Identify the relevant legal provisions that exist to punish those who sexually exploit children through prostitution. c) Apply the legal analysis to the case-studies and assess the adequacy of the law.\nd) Recommend changes to the law.\n\nPotential application and benefits\n\nThe issue of the sexual exploitation of children is an important one and the recent government strategy document demonstrates that the issue of exploitation through prostitution is both significant and contemporary. However the absence of any coherent strategy to tackle those who facilitate prostitution via ICT is somewhat troubling.\n\nThe results of this research are likely to be of wide interest to a range of professions, including lawyers and legal scholars but also those who work to support children who are sexually exploited","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E504779/1","grantId":"AH/E504779/1","fundValue":"20005","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2007-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used to educate professionals in understanding how children can be prostituted through ICT. The study showed that law enforcement and child protection agencies should be suspicious about reported ages and instead use ageing techniques to identify the likely age of a child. It has also been used to highlight to key professionals the fact that the prostitution of children has shifted away from the streets (where the risk of detection is becoming high) to the internet.\n\nThe findings are currently being re-examined as part of a thematic review by the UN Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.

Whilst it has sometimes been thought that this could allow, for example, sex workers to work without a pimp an analysis of prostitution sites suggests that this is not necessarily true, with considerable content being so similar that it is likely it was created by a single person. \n\nThe internet is being used to facilitate the prostitution of children. Sometimes this is overtly where sites advertise children and in other instances it is covert where the age of the person purports to be over 18 but keywords suggest the opposite. Trusting age descriptions would be unwise because (a) there can be a 'premium' for young people and therefore adults will sometimes pose (or be posed) as children, and (b) some children will be described as adults to try and circumvent rules of certain sites.\n\nThe internet has also led to changes in what sex work and prostitution is. Not only are websites used to facilitate offline sexual contact but they can also be used to facilitate online sex acts for money. The research has also shown that what constitutes 'money' on the internet is more broad and will include e-money, gifts, online orders etc. The work demonstrated that the prostitution of children by others is not simply replicated online but is a distinctive type of abuse in its own right.
