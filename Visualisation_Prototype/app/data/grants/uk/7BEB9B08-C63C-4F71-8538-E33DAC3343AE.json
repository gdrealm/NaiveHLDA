{"id":"7BEB9B08-C63C-4F71-8538-E33DAC3343AE","title":"The Research and Development of an Italian 17th-Century Style Improvising Ensemble","abstractText":"Since the early 20th century there has been a fascination with pre-classical music; in the last fifty years this 'early music' movement has become incredibly popular, with a wealth of historically-informed performances on reconstructed instruments from earlier eras. Much of the pre-classical music left to us is more a framework than a literal text, similar to the kinds of sketches used in jazz, generally containing a melody in a very simple version with suggested harmonies. From this skeleton the musicians, equipped with well-honed improvisation skills, will embellish the sketch into a sophisticated and personal performance. As the standards of early music performance continue to rise and become more adventurous, performers are now ready to take their expertise to another level by refining their improvising skills to transform their sketches into virtuosic performances and realise the full potential of this rich repertoire. \\n\\nAs an AHRC Fellow in the Creative and Performing Arts, one aspect of my research project centres around the unusual and often complex forms of improvisation, particularly on chordal instruments, that were commonplace in Italy in the 17th century. Ensembles of long-necked lutes, harpsichords, violins, and 'cornetti' would participate in church feast-day celebrations where they would create group extemporisations which contemporaries described as heavenly music on earth. Through my research project I aim to revive this art by establishing an ensemble, essentially an 'early music big band', devoted to experimentation, performance and promotion of rarely-attempted forms of early improvisation. \\n\\nEarly music is one of the only areas of classical music which has a built-in element for improvisation, and yet most modern-day practitioners have only just scratched the surface of what is possible. I aim to redress the balance by creating musical experiences on the classical music platform which involve the public in the exhilaration created by the invention of music on the spot. The notion of an entire ensemble improvising simultaneously within an intricate set of boundaries is both astonishing and exciting. Our starting point will be theoretical materials on extemporization left to us from the 16th and 17th centuries coupled with analysis of early 17th-century Italian music which imitates improvised music. Our scholarly findings will be used to inspire our practical music-making. There will be no 'cross-over' or 'fusion' here: while we may take advice from modern improvisers on how to structure our practising and ensemble skills, we shall not be relying on folk, 'world', or jazz musicians to provide the improvisation for us, which can often be the case in groups which feature early extemporization. \\n\\nThis project captured the imagination of Marshall Marcus, Head of Music at London's Southbank Centre, who is devoted to promoting improvisation in classical music spheres. He has proposed an Early Music Improvisation Weekend in October 2009 which will feature more sophisticated forms of early extemporization; my ensemble will be a focal point of the weekend, presenting an open rehearsal, concert, and improvisation workshop open to the general public. The ensemble will consist of high-calibre musicians who have been hand-picked for their experience and improvisation skills. We shall undertake an extensive period of research and development to prepare for this groundbreaking event. Our rehearsals will be filmed in order to present a documentary which records our process in the foyer of the Centre during the weekend. I aim to secure other concerts and workshops for the ensemble around this time in order to reach a wider public and provide the opportunity for us to further hone our skills. I also intend to record our rehearsals and concerts professionally in the hope of producing a self-financed commercial CD of our best extemporized material over this period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G014523/1","grantId":"AH/G014523/1","fundValue":"16418","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The establishment of my ensemble The Division Lobby marks the first time, to my knowledge, that an early music ensemble has mounted a concert of sophisticated 17th-century improvisation. Several factors make this project unique. It was underpinned by scholarly research and musicological rigour and involved the vitally important dissemination of my findings to colleagues within and outside of The Division Lobby, but the most significant feature of the project was that this dissemination was also brought to the general public through a series of concerts, workshops, and radio programmes. \n\nAn important aspect of the creation of The Division Lobby and my curatorship of London Southbank Centre's 'Take the Risk' weekend of early improvisation was the opportunity to prove what I have always suspected: a project of improvised early music is not only possible, but also desirable and inspiring. Extemporization in early music concerts is often met with discouragement, disdain, or downright hostility from group directors. It was totally liberating finally to be given a proper chance to improvise unimpeded by the fears and doubts of others. This was important for our audiences to experience, especially on the classical music platform. The impact on the opinions and observations of the general public regarding improvisation was noticeable throughout the weekend, from the 'Take the Risk' weekend's first event, an open discussion forum involving key artists and the audience, to the workshop at the end of the weekend. Our concerts were attended by a high percentage of professional musicians, both early music and non-specialists (in particular jazz and contemporary improvisers), in addition to composers, students, radio and newspaper journalists, concert promoters, group directors, and amateur musicians, who attested to an experience combining informative content with musical pleasure. \n\nAs curator of 'Take the Risk' I was given free reign to choose ground-breaking programmes with first-rate international artists; this provided a unique opportunity for both established and newly-formed ensembles to introduce rarely-heard forms of extemporization to the general public. \n\nFurther evidence of the project's impact outside academia includes features on BBC Radio 3's Early Music Show and Radio 4's Front Row, articles and reviews in The Financial Times, Guardian, Early Music Today, Independent, Independent on Sunday, Telegraph, Early Music Review, and The Gig, and notices on the websites of Southbank Centre, Newcastle University, University of Birmingham, University of York, Concertgebouw Brugge, and the Avison Ensemble (YouTube).

This project was a major objective of my Fellowship project and this grant; it generated enormous interest and enthusiasm from participants, concert promoters, media, students, and both specialist and non-specialist audiences. The Division Lobby's involvement in an early improvisation weekend at London's Southbank Centre, 'Take the Risk', which I was invited to curate, and the events associated with it, were important achievements for me personally, for my ensemble, and for my career. This project brought my research to a significant audience in a non-academic environment and taught me how to use my findings to educate informally, in a performance situation. Southbank Centre's Head of Music at the time, Marshall Marcus, who invited me to mount and curate this weekend, encouraged me and the ensemble to experiment and push the boundaries of what might be included in a concert mounted on the classical music platform. This helped me to develop a concert which broke down the barriers which can exist between the artists and the audience and think imaginatively about how to present concerts of improvised music.\n\nPlanning for the group's research and development before a series of groundbreaking concerts created valuable tasks for my development as a group director and administrator. \n\nThe most important part of my development through this research was the improvement to my skills as an improviser through the time I spent with my instrument on a daily basis, becoming more and more familiar and fluent in the exercises and techniques in 17th-century manuals. This practical use of the treatises was vital to the preparation for concerts improvised music and has had a lasting effect on my extemporization skills. I am now much more comfortable with improvising in public because through my research I now understand the techniques which underpin good extemporization. It has fueled my creativity and vision. Needless to say, it has also helped me to be more fearless about improvising in public and including improvised pieces in concerts, and I have helped others overcome similar fears. All this has helped me to develop into a much more effective teacher of improvisation; I have developed and created easy-to-use materials and techniques for students to learn this art, and I now am often the person called upon to advise colleagues and run workshops. My extensive research into solo and ensemble 17th-century Italian extemporization techniques was disseminated in rehearsals with my improvising ensemble, which is information that every member has taken away and used in their own performances and teaching. Through this project they acquired 16th- and 17th-century theoretical materials on extemporization for study and audio recordings for practising purposes; these are also distributed to workshop students and those who attend my lectures on any aspect of early extemporization. \n\nThe research I did for the concerts with The Division Lobby also continues to provide me with numerous ideas for programme development for the ensemble and with the numerous singers and instrumentalists with which I collaborate in doing chamber music concerts. \n\nAmongst Division Lobby members, the violinist Pavlo Beznosiuk has since performed solo improvisations for BBC Radio 3's 'In Tune' in May 2010 and in the Oundle Festival in July 2010; his work with the group has led him to continue including improvisation in concerts and broadcasts such as these. Inspired by his work with the group the cornettist Josue Melendez has started a practice-based research project and hopes to use the ensemble to test and demonstrate some of his findings. Numerous The Division Lobby members reported to me that this project had made them much better improvisers. They now felt much more comfortable about improvising in public and on CDs; they felt they had been given many more tools to work with, and the opportunity to experiment in a sympathetic atmosphere along with other colleagues was vitally important to their growth as improvisers, and these tools would always be available to them in their future performances. \n\nAn invitation to participate in the 'Take the Risk' weekend prompted the establishment of AHRC Fellow Erin Headley's ensemble 'Atalante', which has led to CD recordings, DVD recordings, and concerts. Participants Crawford Young and Friends and The Orlando Consort developed programmes of improvised medieval music specifically for this weekend; both reported that they planned to expand and perform such programmes in the future.\n\nAs a result of the work done through this grant I have done further research on the embellished madrigal and have discussed plans with the countertenor Mark Chambers to establish a student ensemble at the University of Birmingham devoted to the lost art of improvised falsobordone singing.
