The research will involve GIS-based quantitative analysis of both published census tables derived from the US National Historical GIS (NHGIS) and custom census tabulations to be generated from the individual level records of the 1880 census, made available by the North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP), through the Minnesota Population Centre. These custom tabulations will be generated by a data warehouse system already developed by the Principal Investigator, which will be further extended and enhanced as part of this project. A data warehouse is a specialised form of database management system optimised for flexible aggregation and cross-classification of very large datasets. Since complete individual level records are only available for the 1880 census, the final phase of the project will involve pilot work on matching of individuals in this census to other non-census data sources, in an attempt to trace movements of workers forwards and backwards in time from the 1880 census year.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2420","grantId":"RES-000-22-2420","fundValue":"82405","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"R  Healey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Portsmouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
