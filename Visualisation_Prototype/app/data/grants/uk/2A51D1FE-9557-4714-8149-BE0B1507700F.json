Is there a distinctive cluster of activities, practices and values we can call 'European' or is Europe just too diverse to have a common sporting culture? There are good histories of the economy, society and politics of Europe but far less on cultural aspects such as sport or popular music. There is, for example, no authoritative general history of sport in Europe in any language. Yet sport is arguably the most important shared form of popular culture across Europe. Our research network will address this striking gap in the cultural and political history of Europe.\\nSurprisingly, even the bare bones of the remarkable story of European sport remain largely untold. There is a growing body of serious historical research on sport, but it remains firmly fixed within national frameworks. The common themes as well as the different research agendas of Scandinavian, French, German and Italian sport scholarship, for example, are not apparent. There is a critical mass of research but it has not yet been reviewed, evaluated and advanced. Histories of sport in Europe are largely histories of a particular sport in a local, regional or national context. The study of European sport is further split in two ways: (a) in terms of approach and method; this division has been largely between history and social science, notably sociology and cultural studies; (b) from the institutional perspective between those working in specialised departments of sport and physical education and those outside 'sports studies'. The network will create a forum for exchanges between different nations, different disciplinary perspectives and traditions and different institutional affiliations. The organisers have identified leading subject and area specialists covering most of Europe (including Russia) from a range of disciplinary backgrounds, and aim to explore this topic and disseminate their discussions widely in electronic and conventional published forms. \\nA core group of network members will meet regularly to steer the activities of the network throughout its three phases, and to facilitate the symposia that provide the culmination of each phase. The focus of the first phase will be to establish the broad traditions of interpretation and historiography which form the basis for the current state of knowledge. This will include considering the category of 'Europe' itself, in historical, geographical, political and economic terms, and establishing its distinctiveness with reference to the British, American and other models of sport.\\nIn its second phase, the network will consider how, from its roots in Britain, organised sport spread rapidly across Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The cultural transmission of British sport was subject to both supplementation (e.g. cycle racing, volleyball, handball) and to appropriation by the nation-states of Europe, especially in the interwar period where there was a conjuncture between the democratising of sport and the emergence of totalitarian ideologies and regimes of left and right. This second phase, and its accompanying symposium, will illuminate these patterns of diffusion and ideology in European sport, with special reference to the use of sport by Fascist regimes. \\nThe third phase examines post-war European sport in terms of the political division of Europe, the rising affluence and patterns of leisure consumption in Western Europe, the influence of European integration of sport, and the impact of global media and commercialization. In these contexts, it will explore the tension between the preservation of distinctive national cultures and pressures for convergence.\\nIn these three phases, the network will establish the foundations for the writing of a comprehensive study of sport in Europe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F019971/1","grantId":"AH/F019971/1","fundValue":"24970","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  - Essay on Cold War and Sports for BBC History Magazine (2011)\n- As a main basis for a new project on Sport and the Cold War at the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington, which has now been sponsored by the National Endowment of the Humanities (2014-16); this will include extensive coverage on the centre's award-winning website Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural","person":"Christopher John Young","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The presentations, responses and written outputs of the network initiated a very rich discussion about how to conceive, research, and eventually compose a comparative history of sport in Europe. While it was acknowledged that writing a history of sport in Europe, a continent of 49 national Olympic committees and at least that many sports, was an inherently complex undertaking, key areas for urgent investigation were identified: the exact role of government in sport, the workings of international federations, and the make-up of hegemonic sports in different nations. Beyond major countries and institutions, little is known in this area. It was evident that the main outlines of British sport, the exploitation of sport by totalitarian regimes before and after the Second World War, and the commercial motor behind football are all well understood. There are many other aspects which should be added to these dominant narratives, and among the many excellent points raised for discussion (see website), 10 crucial factors emerged in the course of the network:\n\n\n\n(1) As opposed to recent EU claims about a single European model of sport, the network identified at least four influential models (the British, German, Swedish, and Soviet), but noted how these might transect in different countries (e.g. France). \n\n\n\n(2) Future comparative work should consider the commonalities between German gymnastics and British team sports, usually regarded as mutually exclusive activities, not to mention the Europe-wide reach of the Turnen tradition, which drew on ancient Greek models and had its publications rapidly translated into Danish, French, Norwegian, English and Swedish.\n\n\n\n(3) Sports history is rich in examples of past alternatives which were only later foreclosed. One such instance explored by the network is the close historical connection between gymnastics and dance.\n\n\n\n(4) The widely held belief that Britain gave sport to the world is in need of urgent revision. The role of other countries - not least the French whose philosophy of universalism turned them into facilitators of vital international networks and tournaments, and the Swiss as educators - must be given more emphasis. Moreover, key areas of Europe were subject to their own complex patterns of influence. \n\n\n\n\n\n(5) The importance of regional and cross-national flows cannot be underestimated. Eastern European sports history, in particular, demands a regional approach due to the late emergence of the nation state. In divided Poland, sport developed in the least industrialized areas and amongst the most traditional sectors of society - thus overturning, or relativizing at least the theory that sport goes hand in hand with modernization.\n\n\n\n(6) Periodization needs to be conceived in looser rather than stricter terms. The striking success of participant and spectator sport in the 1950s, to pick one example, had its roots in the rapid growth of teams and clubs in the interwar years. \n\n\n\n\n\n(7) Contributions to the network showed that there is no easy mapping between sport and politics in the Cold War, and there was significant flow between the ideological blocks.\n\n\n\n(8) The German term 'Eigensinn', which refers to the processes by which individuals or groups carve out their own meanings and interpretations of events or practices (usually in totalitarian regimes) offers a conceptual tool for understanding sport in the Eastern block. \n\n\n\n\n\n(9) It is all too easy and highly misleading to assume that the brave new world of satellite sport created a uniform product and reaction across Europe. In fact, the impact of subscription television, whether by satellite or cable or internet, varied significantly across Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n(10) Similarly variegated positions were taken up in reaction to the Bosman ruling of the European Court of Justice in 1995, which banned the imposition of quotas for players of EU origin by national football authorities. There are ongoing plans for two uses in non-academic contexts:\n\n- An exhibition of European sports photography\n\n- The showing of a series of European sports films.\n\n\n\nAt each of these, key findings of the network can be disseminated to a broad public via very accessible media. Both currently await funding. Creative Economy","dataset":"gtr"}
