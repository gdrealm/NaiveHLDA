{"id":"AC0ED71F-30EB-4DBA-9992-46AD329B9C9F","title":"Tidal array cost reduction: Testing a removable nacelle design for DeltaStream Technology","abstractText":"The global tidal renewable energy sector is preparing to enter the growth stage and is estimated to reach &pound;7bn by 2020\nwith 3712MW of installed capacity, demonstrating huge potential to become a serious contributor to the energy mix.\nTransition from the current embryonic stage of the sector requires to overcome a number of technological barriers and\ndemonstrate that significant reduction of cost of energy is achievable in order to remove barriers to market penetration.\nThere is an urgent need to reduce the installation and maintenance costs of tidal stream turbines. The current project\nproposes an effective wet-mate nacelle removal system for cost-effective installation and recovery. Swansea University\n(SU) will evaluate of the mechanical interfacing of the removable nacelle which is to be integrated on the DeltaStream final\ndevice assembly. This Work Package focuses specifically on the testing of the removable nacelle components through a\npurpose built experimental test rig for a full scale space-weight prototype assembly. Support will also be provided to the\nfinal device assembly including tribology investigations to establish requirements for the critical mechanical interfacing\nsurfaces for long term deployment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N509826/1","grantId":"EP/N509826/1","fundValue":"112269","fundStart":"2016-01-07","fundEnd":"2017-07-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Masters","coPersons":["Alison Jayne Williams","Thomas Nicholas Croft"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
