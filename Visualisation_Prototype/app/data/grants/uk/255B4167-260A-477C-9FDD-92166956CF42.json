We include here controlled trials, natural experiments, and design studies. The intended audience includes research students, novice researchers, mid-career researchers, policy-makers, and research trainers. Training and development activities will be held regionally, within the north of England, but participants from throughout the UK will be encouraged. Activities include face-to-face and residential workshops, debates, internet discussions, web-based resources, published protocols in downloadable form, and methodological papers. The training resources will be maintained on-line for at least two years following the end of the project. </p>\n\n<p>Among our objectives are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Increase collaboration between social scientists in order to make trials larger and more ecologically valid;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Explore specific methodological issues relating to the feasibility, ethics, conduct, analysis and reporting of such research designs;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Create a trials methods study group to provide a professional base for researchers with interests in trials that cross interdisciplinary boundaries;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Increase awareness and debate among policy makers, practitioners and academics on ways to maximise the impact of trial evidence on policy and practice.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PTA-035-25-0006","grantId":"PTA-035-25-0006","fundValue":"117509","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This was an RDI project with intended impact with social science trainers. The use of trials in public policy has greatly expanded since this work, and some part of that is attributable. Most notable and lasting achievement is the Annual Trials Conference - http://www.york.ac.uk/media/healthsciences/documents/trials/IEE_ConfBrochure_0614sm.pdf - set up by the project and still led by the applicants.

We created resources for them to use, and an annual conference for them the discuss issues at. The resources and ideas need to be more fully integrated into methods resources for wider audiences.
