The challenge is to finds ways of improving health and maintaining wellbeing throughout the life-course. \n\nThere is very good evidence that behavioural factors (smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity) and social conditions are strongly associated with health and wellbeing in later life. However, there is very little evidence about practical interventions to change these factors that are effective in promoting improved health and wellbeing in later life. The LIVEWELL programme is designed to address this research gap by identifying i) types of intervention that are expected to be feasible, effective, and cost effective i.e. behavioural and social changes that can be incorporated into everyday life and ii) windows of opportunity when interventions are likely to be most effective. In addition we will develop tools for measuring change in health and wellbeing in response to interventions ? lack of such tools is a significant limitation on current research attempting to improving health and wellbeing in later life. \n\nWe plan to focus on the ?retirement window? i.e. the period before and after when the main income provider in a household retires from primary employment. In discussion with older people about what they think would be feasible and attractive and on the basis of the best research evidence available, we will develop interventions will address each of the main behavioural and social factors which are likely to be modifiable. This will include novel interventions in the areas of diet (encouraging a Mediterranean eating pattern), physical activity (e.g. walking and swimming) and social interactions. We will integrate these new interventions with more established interventions on smoking cessation and moderation in alcohol consumption to develop a package of interventions which, when appropriate, can be tailored to the needs of individuals and communities. Further, we will develop novel ways of delivering these interventions which will be feasible and cost-effective and which will encourage sustained behaviour change and improved social circumstances in preparation for later studies to test the intervention package.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900686","grantId":"G0900686","fundValue":"2246700","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John Cummings Mathers","coPersons":["Paula Jane Moynihan","Ian Grant McKeith","Martin  White","Lynn  Rochester","Falko F  Sniehotta"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
