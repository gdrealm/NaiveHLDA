When the linear transformations are invertible they represent a group, and this models symmetry. Algebras are more general, they also model processes which cannot be reversed. An example for such model is a linear transformation whose iteration eventually maps everything to zero. Another example comes from taking derivatives of functions- if x^2 is differentiated three times one gets zero. Hecke algebras belong to the larger class of cellular algebras which occur in many situations, such as in theoretical physics. One wants to have a mathematical model of phase transition; for example, water is very different from ice, although they have the same molecules. How can one understand this? Such processes are a motivation to study cellular algebras, but apart from this, they are very interesting mathematical objects. This project aims to investigate large-scale behaviour in the representation theory of Hecke algebras and related algebras.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D077656/1","grantId":"EP/D077656/1","fundValue":"253733","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Karin  Erdmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" This studied finite-dimensional selfinjective algebras, and their\n\nHochschild cohomology. A crucial problem is to decide when Hochschild\n\ncohomology satisfies finite generation properties which ensure that\n\nrepresentations have support varieties.

As well we determined the ordinary cohomology for\n\nHecke algebras of type A over characteristic zero. \n\n\n\nSubsequently our results were used by Linckelmann, to prove that in general\n\nHecke algebras of type A over characteristic zero have finitely generated Hochschild cohomology, without being explicit. This again inspired work of the PI and Benson, which shows how to obtain an explicit description. These are results in pure mathematics. They are published in refereed Journals. ","dataset":"gtr"}
