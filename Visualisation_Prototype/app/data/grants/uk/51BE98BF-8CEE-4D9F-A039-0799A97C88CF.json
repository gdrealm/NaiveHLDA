This is demonstrated by in excess of 35 organisations writing significant statements of support and including contributions to the project of 1.6m in-kind and 160k cash. The commitments of stakeholders with this breadth of knowledge and understanding is crucial both to: \n - Development of a relevant proposal (all Tier 1 partners of LCS and many Tier 2 and others were heavily involved in the development of the contents of this SCC proposal)\n - Ensuring that the research is undertaken using data and experience that can maximise its credibility, but importantly also\n - Guaranteeing a direct pathway to impact in all the key governance and commercial stakeholders of the sector.\nShipping is a global industry and its challenges must therefore be considered in a global context. However, to provide focus for the research we will concentrate the application of our global modelling and analysis for understanding the impacts of changing climates on three key specific sub- global components of the system: UK, SIDS (Small Island Developing States) and BRICS shipping. The UK, for its importance to the funder and the UK stakeholders engaged in our project, the BRICS and SIDS because of their central role in the policy debate due to their high sensitivity to changing climates \n Research Excellence will be ensured through research across three interacting research themes:\n - ship as a system (understanding the scope for greater supply side energy efficiency)\n - trade and transport demand (understanding the trends and drivers for transport demand)\n - transitions and evolution (understanding transport supply/demand interactions)\n The research undertaken will be both quantitative and qualitative, apply for the first time new data and modelling techniques and be deployed to answer a series of cross cutting (themes) research questions. \n Shipping in Changing Climates will put the UK at the forefront internationally of research into the shipping system and inform the UK and EU debates around the control of its shipping GHG emissions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K039253/1","grantId":"EP/K039253/1","fundValue":"3512260","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tristan  SmithPaul Geoffrey  Wrobel","coPersons":["Paul Jonathon Gilbert","Kevin  Anderson","Alice  Bows-Larkin","Alan John Murphy","Alistair Russell GREIG","Robert James Nicholls","Atilla  Incecik","T  Osman","Joanne  Scott","Andreas Wolfgang Schafer","Kayvan  Pazouki","A.
