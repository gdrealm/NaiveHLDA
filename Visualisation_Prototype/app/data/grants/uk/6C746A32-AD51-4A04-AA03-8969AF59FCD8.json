{"id":"6C746A32-AD51-4A04-AA03-8969AF59FCD8","title":"Rapemeal valorisation: improving the economics of biodiesel manufacture","abstractText":"The economics of biodiesel production are currently constrained by its costs of manufacture and its introduction into the marketplace is being partly facilitated by Treasury tax breaks. This proposal seeks to improve the economics of production by development of value-added chemicals and materials from the rapemeal co-product. This focused study will look at the market economics to develop commercially viable products. The two major product streams to be investigated will be separated and validated for use as: (1) pour point depressants to boost bio diesel performance and (2) additives &amp; co-polymers for rubber materials and cosmetics. The BioComposites Centre (BC) will provide and develop separation/processing technologies to achieve these aims. BC will undertake ozonolysis experiments on RSO to develop new cold pour technologies that will be evaluated by Octel. The development of additives based on this technology will also be explored for alternative applications such as tack modifiers and stabilisers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E006884/1","grantId":"DT/E006884/1","fundValue":"162505","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Fowler","coPersons":["Brett  Suddell"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
