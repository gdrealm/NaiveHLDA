{"id":"7B9CFA12-BF28-4578-9161-0973615E00A1","title":"Learning to combine sense and experience for optimal perceptual judgements","abstractText":"Making decisions based on uncertain sensory information, such as recognising somebody in the dark, involves taking a “best guess”. This depends on knowing the reliability of the sensory information (eg at night vision is poor, so we should place less confidence in it), and knowing the prior likelihoods of different events (eg if a friend lives abroad, it is unlikely to be them across the street). In using both sensory reliability and prior probability information, human adults approach statistical optimality in some perceptual tasks. This reveals several new requirements for the development of a mature perceptual system. Perceptual systems must learn their own reliabilities, and use this reliability information to weight different sensors in multi-sensory judgments. They must also learn the probability distributions associated with different objects and events in the world, and use these distributions in combining sensory and prior likelihood information. How this information is acquired and used is not yet understood. This project will therefore study the developmental trajectory for optimal perception in a series of novel tasks. This will be the first major investigation into these new aspects of perceptual development, and into the developmental basis for optimal perception.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F017154/1","grantId":"ES/F017154/1","fundValue":"317012","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Denis  Mareschal","coPersons":["Marko  Nardini"],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
