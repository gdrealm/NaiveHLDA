{"id":"5FCCABB8-E2F5-49FB-A9B2-B30EC33BC868","title":"A Computer-enhanced Package for Learning School Algebra","abstractText":"<p>This project will roll out the outcomes of the ESRC/EPSRC-funded MiGen project (Award no: RES-139-25-0381), in order to enhance the teaching of early algebra in the secondary school.</p>\n\n<p>MiGen focused on the widespread difficulty that students routinely fail to see the point of algebra and cannot therefore use algebra as a tool for thinking mathematically. MiGen addressed these challenges by building a pedagogical and technical environment so that 11-14 year-old students could appreciate from the outset that algebra is about building and expressing structure and generality and that symbolic rules are the language of this expression.</p>\n\n<p>In this project, we will assemble and disseminate a polished package for students and for teachers of computer and text-based materials arising from the MiGen environment to support the learning of early algebra. The package will be explicitly aligned to the National Curriculum and to teachersâ€™ practice at Key Stage 3. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J02077X/1","grantId":"ES/J02077X/1","fundValue":"96147","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Tools developed in this project and the previous MiGen project have been adapted with SRI for a major UK scaleout project (Cornerstone Maths).
