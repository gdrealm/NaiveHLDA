To enable these organisms to perform this key function most effectively they require large quantities of copper. Methane-oxidising bacteria have evolved novel mechanisms that ensure they are able to accumulate the copper they need to metabolise methane. This includes the secretion of small peptides called methanobactins (mbtins) that are able to sequester the minute amounts of copper present in the organism's surrounding environment. Methane-oxidising bacteria use mbtin to uptake copper, with one of the main uses being for the enzyme that oxidises methane (a methane monooxygenase). How these organisms handle copper, which is potentially toxic as well as being essential, has not been studied in any detail. Whilst analysing extracts from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, a methane-oxidising bacterium, for mbtin we have found a number of high abundance soluble copper pools containing proteins that bind this metal. The presence of large amounts of soluble copper in M. trichosporium OB3b was unanticipated as only two low-abundance soluble copper proteins are predicted (the copper-containing methane monooxygenase is membrane bound). One of the high abundance copper pools has been found to contain a novel copper protein, potentially involved in storing copper ions, herein called Csp1. The other soluble copper pools have not yet been studied in any detail.\n\nIn the proposed work we will study copper binding to Csp1 both in M. trichosporium OB3b and also using protein that we have produced in large amounts via an over-expression host. We will analyse the structure of Csp1 and how this is influenced by copper binding. We will investigate the role of Csp1 in copper storage by genetically engineering M. trichosporium OB3b, as well as by looking at how copper levels during growth influence the production of Csp1. Proteins similar to Csp1 are present in methane-oxidising bacteria and also in other bacteria. The Csp1 homologues from M. trichosporium OB3b and Bacillus subtilis, an organism in which copper handling has been studied and that is more tractable for genetic engineering approaches, will be studied. The other soluble copper pools that have been identified in M. trichosporium OB3b will also be analysed with the aim of finding additional novel copper-binding proteins. The proposed studies will provide insight into copper management in a relatively simple system of environmental importance and therefore has applications in helping to understand the oxidation of methane in Nature and the mitigation of the contribution this greenhouse gas makes to global warming. Furthermore, vast gaseous methane reserves are untapped as a feedstock for liquid fuels and chemical production due to the expense and difficulties associated with the available processes that can facilitate the conversion to methanol, a reaction readily performed by methane-oxidising bacteria. Understanding how these organisms handle an essential cofactor, copper, for the oxidation of methane therefore has potential biotechnological applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K008439/1","grantId":"BB/K008439/1","fundValue":"328048","fundStart":"2013-04-15","fundEnd":"2016-10-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are currently only half way though this grant but have already made important discoveries about bacteria that can oxidise methane (methanotrophs). These are a unique group of aerobic bacteria that require large quantities of copper for the membrane-bound (particulate) methane monooxygenase (pMMO). Certain strains are able to use iron to catalyze methane oxidation via the soluble MMO (sMMO), with switchover regulated by copper. MMOs are Nature's primary biological mechanism for suppressing atmospheric levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. As well as having environmental applications, methanotrophs and MMOs have enormous potential in bioremediation and for biotransformations producing bulk and fine chemicals and bioenergy, particularly considering increased methane availability from renewable sources and hydraulic fracturing of shale rock. We have already made significant discoveries having identified and characterised the copper storage protein for pMMO. We anticipate that these data will be of great use for future environmental and biotechnological applications of methanotrophs.\n\nI originally ticked societal and economic as types of impact and chemicals and environment as sectors in which this research has been used (below), as these may arise from our studies in the future. However, no such impacts have arisen yet and I tried to deselect these but the system did not allow me to do this.

This protein binds multiple Cu(I) ions in a previously unseen manner. Cytosolic homologues are present in diverse bacteria thus challenging the dogma that such organisms do not store copper in this compartment. This raises the possibility that there are many copper proteins with a range of functions, many of which could have beneficial applications, still to be discovered. Understanding how methanotrophs handle copper is essential for all methane-based applications. The discovery of how these organisms store copper for methane oxidation provides a major breakthrough in this area and can be used for enhancing methane-related technologies. Furthermore, in collaborative studies we have started to make mutated methanotroph strains to identify the function of particular proteins and that may facilitate biotechnological applications.
