The fMRI analyses of our first paradigm have shown that, in comparison to non-maltreated children, maltreated children exhibit increased amygdala and anterior insula activity when consciously processing angry faces (McCrory et al., 2011). Previous fMRI studies that scanned the brains of soldiers exposed to violent combat situations have shown the same pattern of greater activation in these two areas of the brain, which are associated with heightened threat detection and pain anticipation respectively. We suggest that both abused children and soldiers may have adapted to be hyper-vigilant to danger in their environment. However, the amygdala and anterior insula are also areas of the brain that are implicated in anxiety disorders. Neural adaptation in these regions might help explain why children exposed to family violence are at greater risk of anxiety problems later in life.\n\n2. In our second fMRI paradigm we used an attentional bias paradigm to examine for the first time pre-attentive (i.e., non-conscious) face processing in maltreated children compared to their non-maltreated peers (McCrory et al., 2013). Maltreated children showed significantly increased neural response to pre-attentively presented angry and happy faces in the right amygdala compared to non-maltreated children. Amygdala activation to angry faces correlated with the severity of exposure to family violence in the maltreated group. This second paradigm revealed that atypical neural activation in maltreated children is not confined to threat processing but extends to the processing of positive affect. The heightened neural response to emotional facial stimuli during pre-attentive processing may reflect differences in early salience detection. We suggest that this pattern of heightened amygdala activation constitutes a latent neural risk marker associated with increased vulnerability to future psychiatric disorder.\n\n3. The sMRI data showed that, in comparison to the non-maltreated children, maltreated children are characterized by decreased grey matter in the medial orbitofrontal and middle temporal cortices, brain regions implicated in decision-making, emotion regulation, and memory (DeBrito et al., 2012). Grey matter disturbance in these regions in a community sample of well-functioning maltreated children cannot therefore be explained by the presence of psychiatric disorder. However, these same brain areas are implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders and may represent neural markers of future risk.\n\nEngagement with the academic community:\n\nTo date, our academic publications include one empirical paper reporting our first fMRI paradigm (McCrory et al., 2011: Current Biology), one scientific comment (McCrory &amp;amp; Viding, 2010: The Lancet), three comprehensive reviews on the neurobiology and genetics of childhood maltreatment (McCrory et al., 2010: Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry; McCrory et al., 2011: Frontiers in Child Psychiatry; McCrory et al., 2012: Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine), and one book chapter (McCrory et al., 2011: Child Psychology and Psychiatry, Wiley Publishers). The findings of our second fMRI paradigm and our sMRI data are under review. We have also presented our work at international conferences and specialist meetings in the US, Portugal and the UK. \n\nEngagement with Potential Research Users: \n\nWe organised two large conferences (31st October 2009 and 28th October 2011) each with over 250 delegates, mainly social work and clinical practitioners, at UCL in collaboration with the Anna Freud Centre and the NSPCC. We have developed a collaboration with Islington Social Services and convened a free CPD event on neuroscience and resilience for all social workers in June 2010; a second event is planned for summer 2012. Further, we have organised a series of assemblies in London schools to discuss brain development and resilience and have met with an advisory group of young people in care in Islington to obtain their views on our work. In June 2012 we will be presenting findings from this project to a specialist group of MPs and policy makers as part of the ESRC Seminar Series on Developmental Social Neuroscience, Ethics and the Law. Finally, we have developed a website (www.drru-research.org) to help disseminate our work. \n\nEvidence of impact: \n\nOur 2010 JCPP review and 2011 Current Biology paper have already attracted substantial attention. The review has now been cited 43 times (as of 2/5/2012) since publication. Further, our Comment in The Lancet has attracted attention from practitioners and professionals. Our Current Biology paper was the first fMRI study of emotional processing in children exposed to familial maltreatment. It attracted substantial media interest, with an article in Times Online, in the Huffington Post, and Daily Mail and was featured in an article in the New Scientist. The PI gave several radio and television interviews, including a BBC World Service interview (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00lxb9w#p00mcy9m).

Maltreatment is a well established risk factor for a range of problems later in life, including depression and anxiety. Yet we know relatively little about how maltreatment can impact brain development in ways that may increase a child's later vulnerability or resilience. \n\n\n\nIn our research we investigated how the experience of maltreatment may have influenced how children process emotion. We recruited children between the Children's charities including a variety of voluntary sector organisations have a direct interest in establishing a better understanding of the multi-dimensional impact of child maltreatment. This work will help support their case for intervention for children who have experienced maltreatment and early adversity. Many of these charities lobby government to increase provision for children in need, particular those who experience abuse.
