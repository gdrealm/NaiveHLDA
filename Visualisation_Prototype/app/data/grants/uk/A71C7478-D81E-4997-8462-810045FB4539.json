Using sustainable sources of wood as\na fuel is one such method of reducing the CO2 emissions associated with energy production. However, wood has a high\nmoisture content, low energy density, has variable combustion properties and there are considerable costs incurred\nmodifying existing power plants for co-firing. As result the energy sector is looking increasingly to torrefaction to produce an\nenergy dense and renewable &quot;bicoal&quot; from wood. Torrefaction is low temperature heating of wood in the absence of oxygen\nto produce a char-like fuel that, once pelletised, has properties similar to coal. However, the economics of existing\ntorrefaction technology has yet to be proven on an industrial scale and based upon prior pilot activity we believe that\nmicrowave induced plasma torrefation (MPT) technology provide a more cost effective way to torrefy wood. The overall\nobjective of our project is to develop a prototype MPT demonstration reactor for cost effectively converting wood pellets to\nbiocoal.\nThis study will bring together a unique project delivery consortium comprising of Stopford Projects Ltd (SPL) and Liverpool\nJohn Moores University (LJMU). SPL is a multidisciplinary engineering design and project management consultancy with\nsignificant expertise in green technology and energy projects spanning research through to plant commissioning.\nThis project will investigate the feasibility of using microwave plasma technology for torrefying pre-pelletised wood with the\nintention of improving fuel combustion efficiencies and reducing OPEX costs. It is the intention of the consortium to\ndevelop, test and demonstrate an industrial lab-scale reactor as an output of the project as well as developing the\ntechnological and commercial route to market. Unlike currently available torrefaction technologies, the novel advantage of\nthe described microwave plasma technology is that the process has a lower parasitic load, has significantly lower capital\ncosts, has greater tolerance of mixed feed streams, is more durable, modular, and potentially mobile. As such the\ntechnology presents the sector with a more efficient and cost effective method of handling and transporting woody biomass\nthan conventional processes.\nThe project will be conducted in nine Work packages:\nWork package 1: Feedstock Characterisation: (2 months)\nWork package 2: System specifications and boundary conditions (2 months)\nWork package 3: Microwave plasma torrefaction reactor design parameters (3 months)\nWork package 4: Design and build microwave plasma reactor (2.5 months)\nWork package 5: Experimentation and Optimisation (3 months).\nWork package 6: Process performance and analysis (2 months)\nWork package 7: Engagement with endusers (2 month)\nWork package 8: Regulatory Requirements (2 month)\nWork package 9: Process Scale-Up and Technology Exploitation (3 months)","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505894/1","grantId":"EP/L505894/1","fundValue":"84125","fundStart":"2014-02-04","fundEnd":"2015-02-03","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ahmed  Al-Shamma'a","coPersons":["Andrew  Shaw"],"organisation":"Liverpool John Moores University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
