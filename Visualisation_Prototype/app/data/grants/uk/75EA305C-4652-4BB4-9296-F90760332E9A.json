Or when Vishal Bhardwaj adapted Othello in the Bollywood musical Omkara? Or when the Tomb Raider video game had to be altered significantly for the Japanese market? \n\nThe Media Across Borders research network explores the myriad ways in which media content is translated and adapted across cultural borders. The network will bring together academic scholars and industry professionals, with the objective to deepen understanding of these processes of media content adaptation and to consider the broader significance of cultural translation within the creative industries. It will take up its work with two one-day workshops focused on the ways in which the film, television and video game industries adapt content for a variety of national contexts and media platforms. The two workshops will be followed by an international conference, aimed at widening the debate to include more media and to open up the network to a broader range of participants. \n\nThe research development network aims to model a new approach to the translation of ideas from one culture to another, defined above all in terms of language and locality (national, regional, local), but also taking into account fan cultures and different genre and media cultures with their distinct historically developed conventions. The network seeks to reveal and understand the cultural particularities of the various adaptations while simultaneously noting what is shared. Taking a holistic and anti-reductionist approach, the network will pay close attention to the diverse and complex ways in which media content travels the globe and is appropriated locally by producers, marketing teams and fan audiences. Drawing on international academic expertise, the network aims to offer a fresh perspective on contemporary digital media that looks beyond the national context to consider global popular culture and the transnational implications of media content adaptation. \n\nInterest in media adaptation, both in the media industries and in academia, is growing: Articles in trade journals, and seminars concerned with the franchising of media content at major industry events have increased manifold in recent years. New technologies and the ongoing consolidation in the media industries have led to an enormous growth in the exchange of cultural artefacts across borders, particularly in the form of franchised media content sold for adaptation. In our digitalized, globalized world innovative and audience-drawing media productions are 'discovered' ever more quickly and reworked on a growing scale for worldwide distribution and consumption. \n\nGiven the central importance of the international market to the creative industries, our research has the potential to build a productive dialogue between industry and the academy. Locally adapted television formats, including shows such as Big Brother, Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? and Deal or No Deal, generated global revenues of EUR 9.3bn between 2006 and 2008. More than a third of this money went to British production companies (J&auml;ger and Behrens, The Frapa Report, 2009). A large scale analysis of German and US television schedules revealed that over 30% of primetime programming of the large national networks consisted of formatted programming (Esser, 2010). The mobile and home video game sectors are worth more than $100 billion (PWC, 2011), and global industry trends suggest the localisation business will continue to increase. \n\nBuilding on these events, this network will evolve into an ongoing international forum for the exploration of the intricacies of content adaptation and the potential benefits and limitations it can have in both economic and cultural terms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013471/1","grantId":"AH/J013471/1","fundValue":"23985","fundStart":"2012-02-13","fundEnd":"2012-08-12","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The grant was to set up a network. As such there have been few concrete 'research findings' emanating from the funded network's launch activities that could be 'used'. Talking to Creative Skill Set, an industry body for the creative industries and two other industry partners about potential research projects that would benefit the industry was the most important outcome from the two funded workshops. Talks are still ongoing. Other 'uses' of the network launch activities are that network members have been in constant contact sine 2012, exchanging information, discussing and initiating research collaborations, editing books together and bidding for large, international research grants.

Industry participants included Marta Lois Gonzalez (SEGA Europe), Sonia Souto and Flavia Timiani (Disney Interactive), Vanessa Wood (Sony Computer Entertainment), Joerg Bachmaier (BBC Worldwide), Mike Beale (ITV Studios), Vasha Wallace (FremantleMedia), Kaspar Pflueger (RTL Hrvatska), Max McGonigal (CrowTV) and Alessandro Traverso (HIT Entertainment). All work in roles and media businesses that are extremely international but in a localised form. A summary of the discussions can be found on http://mediaacrossborders.com/?page_id=1222.\n\nThe second workshop event was aimed at bringing together academics and professionals working in localisation. Thirty-two academics and ten industry professionals debated the following topics in six workshops: TV Formats - Production &amp;amp; Distribution; Film Across Borders; Video Game Localisation; National Label, Global Brand; Researching Transnational Media; and The Translation of Audiovisual Media. (For more detail please see http://mediaacrossborders.com/?page_id=1255) The workshops, scheduled across two 1 1/2 -hour timeslots with 11-17 participants each, were preceded and followed by organised networking opportunities, starting with a game of Rueda Cubana (a Spanish form of speed-dating) and ending with a joint dinner. Together these activities proved very effective, achieving a high quality and quantity of dialogue and networking.\n\nThe conference featured 27 academic papers plus two roundtable discussion panels and a closing plenary roundtable to further the dialogic intentions of the organisers. (For detailed programme see http://mediaacrossborders.com/?page_id=789). Speakers were asked to strictly limit their papers to 15 minutes to allow sufficient time for discussions at the end of each session. As a result, discussions throughout the day were lively, highlighting different points of view. Conference attendees counted nearly 130 people, including 46 speakers and panel chairs and 18 industry professionals. \nSince the conference various publications have been agreed: The principal investigator, Andrea Esser, guest-edited a special edition on television formats for the academic journal Critical Studies in Television (Manchester University Press), published in the autumn of 2013 (8:2). Edinburgh University Press, who sent an editor to the conference, signed a contract with Iain Smith for a monograph on Global Adaptations of American Film and Television, and for a collection on transnational film remakes, edited by Smith and Constantine Verevis, to be published in 2015. Another contract has been signed with Routledge for an edited collection, also to be published in 2015. The book, Media Across Borders: Localisation in television, film and video games, entails contributions from Media Across Borders network members from around the world and is aimed at academics, students and industry professionals interested in issues of localisation. \n\nFurther activities to strengthen the network and initiate future joint publications were network meetings at the IAMCR conference in Dublin (June 2013) and network panel submissions for ICA in Seattle (2014). \n\nDuring the period of the grant (Feb-Aug 2012) the team moreover met and talked with people who were unable to attend the launch events but were interested in the network and possibilities for future collaboration. Most notable amongst academics is Albert Moran, the world's most eminent researcher of television formats. Notable amongst industry professionals and organisations were CreativeSkillset; Kevin Mundye, a producer for Shine International, who offered to share his experience of localised production in an interview and potential future workshops; John Gough, Director of Entertainment Masterclass (an academy created by the television industry to train TV executives from around the world), interested in being involved in potential future practice-based workshops; and Nie Mei, Station Director of Hunan Broadcasting Systems, the largest commercial broadcaster in China, who during a personal meeting in London offered support for research on Chinese television. \n\nFurther notable outcomes and achievements are the network's growing database (using the professional conference management software CRM), its website and Facebook page http://www.facebook.com/groups/493945790616377/), acting as an introduction to the network and its members and as a helpful point of call for members and non-members. Facebook offers instant communication and provides an interactive platforms where members can share news and find partners for collaboration. \n\nThe network's activities make research in the area more transnational, multi-media oriented (reflecting media convergence) and multi-disciplinary. It has brought together scholars of translation and adaptation studies, media and cultural studies, film studies, modern languages and media management. It has attracted a high-profile international advisory board and successfully brought together postgraduate students, early careers, mid-career and renowned academics in the field of media localisation. Members and conference participants reveal its truly international character and its success in bringing together academia and industry, with industry informing academic research and vice versa. Enquiries and activities following the launch events demonstrated that the network has successfully raised the status of this area of research, and the partnerships initiated with non-academic institutions mean that avenues have been created to disseminate work emerging in the field beyond academia and to broaden and deepen academic-industry collaboration. Publications coming out of the network will be useful to those teaching translation/localization and those wanting to work in the localization industry. Research findings may furthermore benefit the media industry. For example, network co-investigator Miguel Bernal-Merino, has extensive involvement in conferences organized by and for the games industry, where he organizes and hosts workshops and panels on game localization. Finally, cultural insights gained from localization research may be taken to media policy makers and have a beneficial cultural impact.
