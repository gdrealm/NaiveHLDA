In these years, Japan moved from limited democracy and internationalism to militaristic nationalism and war, a shift which greatly affected education and experiences of childhood. Much has been written (mainly in Japanese) about how school curricula, textbooks, and ceremonies changed in order to inculcate children and adolescents with a strong spirit of loyalty to the Emperor and the Japanese state, and a willingness to sacrifice themselves. However, there has been little or no attempt to systematically record the memories of those who experienced this momentous period of Japanese history as children and adolescents. In addition, scholars have yet to make adequate use of the wealth of contemporary records of the personal experience of juveniles that survive from this period, especially in the form of diaries. As a result, it is hard to get a sense of what it was like to experience childhood, education, and youth in these years; moreover, scholars tend to make assumptions about the effects of nationalistic textbooks and school practices without supporting data. Also, the tendency to focus on the increasing nationalism and militarism of education during this period can lead us to overlook other aspects of the experience of childhood and education at the time. For example, what were relationships like between teachers and students, as well as between students themselves? What kind of teaching styles and methods did teachers use, and how did children experience these? What were children's lives like outside school, within their families and neighbourhoods, and with their friends? This research will investigate all these questions. The study is especially urgent because of the advanced age of those who were young before 1945.\n\nThe research will use two major methods. First, we will conduct oral history interviews with about 100 people who were children before 1945. These interviews will be recorded and summarized to create a digital archive to be held at the University of Manchester. Personal documents such as diaries, notebooks, letters and photographs will also be collected and copied for the archive. Secondly, archival research will use the rich and underexploited holdings in Japan of pre-1945 juvenile diaries. The research team will then write a history of the experience of childhood and education in Japan during the years from 1925 to 1945. In doing so, the team will also use recent studies of pre-1945 education by historians of Japan, which are often not yet incorporated into scholarship in English. \n\nThe project is a study of memory as well as of history. Although many accurate memories of the past can be elicited by careful interviewing, it is necessary to scrutinize such memories for their accuracy by examining their internal consistency and by comparing them with surviving historical documents and records. It is also necessary to consider how memories may have been shaped by historical and ideological discourses about the past, something that is particularly important in the case of 1925-1945, whose history continues to generate controversy in Japan and East Asia. The project will endeavour to explain when, why and how memories conform to and diverge from familiar postwar narratives of the period. \n\nImpact beyond the academy will be enabled through a website with both English and Japanese versions, which will greatly interest educators and the public at large. Data such as transcripts of interviews (with English translations), personal documents, and photographs will be publically available through the website, subject to the permission of interviewees and donors. The website will be publicised to teacher associations, museums, and libraries. Given the study's relevance to citizenship and national identity debates, summaries of findings will be sent to government and NGOs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J004618/1","grantId":"AH/J004618/1","fundValue":"505740","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Cave","coPersons":["Aaron William Moore"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
