{"id":"DE9C87D6-1070-4146-9512-5B7493ADF145","title":"Protein assembly and trafficking in eukaryotic cells","abstractText":"For cells and tissues to remain healthy they must be able to make proteins and the proteins they make must be able to function correctly in the right place. The cell has a complex machinery for ensuring that when new proteins are made they are functional and are transported to the correct location, be it within the cell or outside. The research carried out by this group will study how proteins are made and delivered to their correct location and, in particular, how this delivery process breaks down during disease. The production and delivery of proteins can be summarised into two key stages: i) ensuring proteins are made correctly and adopt the correct shape, ii) transport of the protein to the correct location.\nProteins are made as a string of amino acids that coil up or fold to adopt a characteristic three-dimensional structure. In some cases, folding is delayed to allow the elongated structure to cross membranes and enter specialised cellular compartments. We want to understand how this transfer occurs. When proteins finally fold the cell ensures that they produce the correct shape, by providing helper proteins or chaperones to aid folding. If cells are unable to carry out the correct folding of proteins disease results, including some common inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Our group wants to understand in detail the reasons behind the inability of cells to fold proteins. In order to do this we need to know how proteins are folded correctly and what causes them to fold incorrectly. \nOnce proteins are folded they are transported through a series of membrane-bound cell compartments, which depend on the ultimate destination of the protein. The route taken by proteins to the outside of the cell is called the secretory pathway. Proteins can also enter cells, via the endocytic pathway. Selective transport of proteins is a complex process requiring proteins to be sorted and transported, akin to the process that occurs when you post a letter. We aim to determine how proteins are selected for transport, how and in what they are transported, and how this process breaks down in certain disease states. By gaining this information we will enhance both our basic knowledge of cell biology and possibly provide vital clues for the rational design of therapeutic approaches to treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9722026","grantId":"G9722026","fundValue":"1001310","fundStart":"1998-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip George Woodman","coPersons":["Viki  Allan","Richard  Brennan","Sabine  Hilfiker","Colin John Stirling","Timothy  Dafforn","Martin  Lowe","Kostas  Tokatlidis","Stephen  High"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
