These performances are highly visual, overtly playful and prioritise conversation between performer and participant. Being inherently dialogic, the 'text' of these encounters is improvised, co-authored and malleable. These types of performances can be understood as operating in the responsive mode. To be effective they must respond intimately to their audience, to physical location and to cultural context. Our proposal aims to explore the impact of contextual changes on performance practice and brings into focus how performance 'texts' might be created, shared and transmitted across festival communities. \\n\\nOur project uses practice as its core methodology. The practices under investigation can be articulated as:\\n\\n1. Devising and making interactive performance for a festival site\\n2. Performing interactive work within a festival site\\n3. Audience-performer interaction within a festival site\\n\\nHow these practices develop, change and adapt according to environment will be the main focus of our research. To this end, we will be asking a series of questions that address both process and performance. These questions correlate to three key terms - making, performing, responding:\\n\\n- What are the implications for making relational or interactive performance for a festival environment where site, audience and context are inherently unstable and unpredictable?\\n\\n- In what way do changes in the festival environment impact upon the manner in which work is performed and how are the interactions that ensue negotiated differently according to changes in context?\\n\\n- In what ways do festival-goers respond to performative encounters within the festival site and how does this differ across a range of environments? \\n\\nAcademic researchers will be working in partnership with Urban Angels Circus who will be commissioned to make a piece of interactive performance that will be toured to three different contemporary music festivals. Each festival will be chosen to provide a different 'environment for encounter' so that a comparative analysis can be made and our research questions addressed. We intend to situate the work in two UK festivals that have distinctly different cultural contexts - namely Glade Festival (a dance music festival which is over 18s only) and Latitude Festival (an interdisciplinary festival which attracts families). The third context will be a European festival - namely Boom, Portugal (an electronic music event that supports the confluence of politics, art and culture). In addition we will be engaging with festival promoters in order to assess the impact this type of performance practice may have in terms of developing festival culture.\\n\\nThis project builds on the success of the existing Beyond Text Research Network: 'Festival Performance as a State of Encounter'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H013563/1","grantId":"AH/H013563/1","fundValue":"88808","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Findings from the network grant were built into and developed in the Small Grant that followed. The second award started as soon as the first award ended so the findings are very much linked and the impact narrative the same. \n\nFindings from the first award were built into the second and used to create the relational performance 'Heavenly Court of Madame Fantaisiste'. Findings from the second award are now being used specifically by the aerial performance company, Urban Angels Circus, who use the research as part of their own practice in terms of developing relational performance. Their work has now been seen by a large number of people at festivals in the UK and internationally who have been able to experience and participate in relational performance of this kind. In addition, Urban Angels Circus have just received a substantial award from Arts Council England which is, in part, due to their involvement with the research. The impact to the company itself is very significant but has far reaching impact as the ACE project involves the training of other aerialists in the North of England to address a skills deficit in practical training. \n\nFindings from this initial award have continued to grow and develop within the academy. What began as a specific project on festival performance has now developed into a broader consideration of participatory performance and risky aesthetics which is being headed by the PI. A call went out to the international community for participation in an edited collection (due for publication 2016) and this attracted unprecedented interest. Further impact activities are being planned in order to respond to this surge in interest in this field.

The purpose of this was to examine the extent to which the varying environments in which the piece was performed would alter how the work was shaped by the performers and received by the audience. Each festival chosen presented a different cultural context in which to work. They differed in size and demographic. They were located diff The research has many potential uses in non-academic contexts. The work has already been carried out within the professional festival industry and findings from the initial project could be used in planning, programming and scheduling performance work of this kind that contributes an important element to the festival experience.
