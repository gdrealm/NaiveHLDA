{"id":"48D7DDF9-79F9-4989-9773-44290BFD648C","title":"Gesture Recognition in Aphasia Therapy","abstractText":"Aphasia is a language disorder, usually caused by stroke. It affects a substantial number of people; there are about 250,000 people living with aphasia in the UK and approximately 45,000 new cases each year. People with aphasia have difficulty with all aspects of communication: speaking, reading and writing. The negative effects of aphasia can be immense and are not confined to the affected person but are also felt by the immediate family and social circle.One approach advocated by therapists is for the aphasic person to communicate using gestures, but this also poses challenges as the ability to produce and understand gestures may be impaired. In recent research we have investigated whether gesture production can be enhanced by therapy and the initial evidence from face-to-face therapy is encouraging. However gesture therapy is resource-intensive and this has motivated our proposal.Our goal is to develop and pilot an innovative gesture training tool to be used in aphasia therapy at home. This will build on our existing work on non-computer based therapy and there is no previous published research in this area. Our approach to achieving this goal will be to refine and adapt existing gesture recognition technology, incorporating it within a training package that we will develop. In so doing, we will refine and exploit existing research into gesture recognition and gesture-based interaction, utilising mainstream interaction devices such as the Nintendo Wii remote and open source software. We will investigate appropriate forms of gesture recognition and feedback for this user community.The development of the tool will address several fundamental issues: it needs to recognise a substantial set of gestures that are relevant to the aphasic user and can be trained by the therapist; it must not be over-sensitive as gesture production is likely to be variable and inaccurate; we need to understand and incorporate appropriate forms of training and feedback in the tool.Research in the wild is integral to this proposal. Close engagement with the user community will be facilitated by our project partner, the Stroke Association. Aphasic people will be employed as consultants in exploring and evaluating gesture recognition technologies as the design and development of the therapy tool progresses. In the later stages of the project, a pilot study will be conducted with 10 people who have severe aphasia to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of the tool as well as its broader acceptability.The potential transformational impact of using gesture-recognition technology in therapy is significant. Given the numbers of people affected by aphasia, the provision of a therapeutically effective, low-cost, gesture training tool would be of substantial benefit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I001824/1","grantId":"EP/I001824/1","fundValue":"297280","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have:\n- Inspired further research into technologies, including therapeutic technologies, for people with aphasia.\n- Been taken forward into a doctoral research project that is using the GeST software in further trials.\n- Been disseminated directly to practitioners and user groups, contributing to a heightened awareness of the therapeutic potential of technology for people with aphasia.\n- Contributed to an increasing body of knowledge on how to design technology that is accessible to people with aphasia.\nOpportunities for making the software available to practitioners are being explored.

One possibility for people with aphasia is to use non-verbal communication strategies such as gestures instead but their ability to produce gestures may also be impaired. Therapy to enhance the production of gestures is usually delivered by speech and language therapists; the GReAT project aimed to provide a novel, computer-based alternative.\n\nThe overall objective of GReAT was to investigate, prototype and trial a gesture therapy tool for use at home by people with aphasia. The key findings from the research lay in three areas:\n\n1. Interaction design for people with aphasia\nCurrent guidelines for designing accessible interactive technologies provide little advice on designing for aphasia; the first of our key findings was a contribution to this area. We ran a series of participatory design workshops with 5 people who have aphasia who were employed as consultants on the project. The workshops explored how people with aphasia interact with technologies, where they are successful and where they face challenges. The results were reported as a set of initial design principles (Galliers et al, 2011) and as techniques and lessons learned for facilitating participation of people with aphasia in design (Galliers et al, 2012).\n\n2. GeST: a gesture therapy tool for people with aphasia\nWe designed and implemented GeST, a prototype gesture therapy tool to help people with aphasia improve their gesturing. GeST works by demonstrating communicative gestures (such as phone, umbrella, glasses) to the user, detecting the user's attempts to produce the gestures and providing motivational feedback. It incorporates computer vision-based gesture recognition technology and a 3D world to provide an engaging interactive experience. GeST is novel both as a mechanism for p roviding gesture therapy and in its use of a 3D virtual world in a therapy tool for people with aphasia.\n\n3. Therapy study\nAn eight-month, home-based study was undertaken to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of GeST. The study involved 10 participants with severe aphasia; 9 successfully completed the therapy. The primary aim was to determine whether GeST improved gesture production; secondary aims were to investigate whether GeST improved production of spoken words, its acceptability and its usability.\nResults showed that gestures practised with GeST improved significantly after therapy and the gain was maintained. The gains only occurred on items that were practised with GeST and therapist support. There was no generalisation to unpractised gestures and no effect on spoken words. Usability results were positive: results showed that GeST provoked interest, motivation and a sense of fun. 1. The principles for accessible design can be applied by practitioners involved in the design and implementation of a broad range of interactive technologies for people with communication impairments.\n\n2. We are pursuing two potential exploitation routes for the software tool to make it available to others:\no Making the current prototype of GeST available to a wider group of speech and language therapists for use in their work with people who have aphasia.\n\no Transforming the GeST prototype into a robust software package that can be made widely available to therapists and people with aphasia. We are exploring options for follow-on funding for this purpose.\n\n3. The GeST tool, one of the key outcomes from the project, is intended for use &quot;in the wild&quot;. A PhD student will take the work forward in a further empirical investigation of the efficacy of GeST.\n\n4. The research has, and will continue to, raise awareness of the potential role of digital technology in aphasia therapy. It has demonstrated a novel approach to utilising technology which has attracted significant interest from both academic researchers and practitioners.
