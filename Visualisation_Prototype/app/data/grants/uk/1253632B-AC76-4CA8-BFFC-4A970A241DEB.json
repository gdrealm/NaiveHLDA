In people with degenerative diseases of the brain such as Alzheimer's disease there is a growing body of evidence to show that systemic infections or inflammation may accelerate disease progression and exacerbate symptoms. Communication between systemic inflammation and the brain involves the macrophage populations of the brain, those that lie at the interface of the blood vessels and coverings of the brain and the macrophages within the brain tissue itself, the microglia. In a diseased brain we have shown that these cells increase in number and are more sensitive to the systemic inflammation: they are &quot;primed&quot;. In response to systemic inflammation they generate inflammatory molecules that have the capacity to interfere with signalling between neurons and even kill endangered neurons. The planned outcomes of the proposed project include the understanding of fundamental mechanisms that regulate immune-to-brain communication and the progression of chronic neurodegeneration, leading to the potential for development of protective or therapeutic approaches against these diseases. \nIn this project we will determine where the increased number of macrophages and microglia in brains with neurodegenerative disease come from: are they derived from the blood or from local proliferation. In animal models of chronic neurodegeneration we have preliminary data to show that proliferation during chronic neurodegeneration is driven through a receptor on the microglia called CSF1R. Also, there is evidence supporting the idea that activation of macrophages through this receptor also leads to priming. These two key biological functions of CSF1R, the control of proliferation and priming, would highlight the importance of this molecular pathway during chronic neurodegeneration. We will use a novel technique to deliver viral vectors to the bone marrow to label blood derived macrophages and determine whether they contribute to the macrophages and microglia in the normal and diseased brain. We will investigate whether systemic inflammation also drives proliferation and or recruitment of macrophages/microglia in healthy and diseased brains by influencing the activation of CSF1R. We will correlate our findings in animal models with studies of human brains from individuals with Alzheimer's disease who died with or without a systemic infection. We will finally investigate whether pharmacological blockade of the CSF1R can prevent both priming and proliferation of the macrophages and microglia and thus ameliorate the harmful effects of systemic inflammation on the diseased brain. The research objectives proposed here are a novel and ambitious approach to understanding inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, and would generate important information for the neuroimmunological and medical sciences community.\nThe understanding of microglial biology during neurodegenerative disease is crucial for the development of potential therapeutic approaches to control the harmful inflammatory reaction. These potential interventions could modify or arrest neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer disease. The potential outcomes of the proposed research would be rapidly translated into the clinics of neuropathology, and would improve the quality of life of patients with this disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K022687/1","grantId":"MR/K022687/1","fundValue":"397535","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Diego  Gomez","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
