The problem is compounded by the spread of antibiotic resistance and we know the organism best as MRSA (methiciliin resistant S. aureus). We have identified a number of S. aureus components that are being developed as a vaccine to prevent disease and spread of the bug. We have also found that one of these bug proteins protects it against a number of the mechanisms we humans make to defend ourselves. In doing so we have found a new way in which humans are able to turn off the toxins made by S. aureus. We will find out how this mechanism works and how the bug is able to defend itself in this battle. The research will define how the bugs and we have evolved to interact with each other and give novel potential avenues to sway the outcome in our favour.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600801","grantId":"G0600801","fundValue":"319448","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon J.
