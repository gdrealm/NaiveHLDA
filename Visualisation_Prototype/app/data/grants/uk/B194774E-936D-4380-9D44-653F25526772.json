It has formed the main evidence base for a policy brief published by the NGO, HelpAge International in October 2014, as well as for a blog by the Inter-American Development Bank in July 2014. The evidence encouraged official health agencies in South Africa to collaborate in the development of a funding proposal to MRC for an intervention study. If funded, the pilot intervention will begin in late 2015.

With reference to older people in South Africa, we found pension receipt is not associated with enhanced health or quality of life. For hypertension, pension receipt was associated with higher awareness and use of treatment, but not with more effective management of the condition.\n\n2) What are the main causes of varied rates of uncontrolled hypertension prevalence among older people in poorer countries? We found that poorer older people and those living in rural areas are sometimes less likely to be aware of their condition and effectively managing it than richer urban groups.\n\n3) Does more access to education in childhood improve the wellbeing of women in poorer countries when they reach old age? We found some evidence for this effect in China, but less in other countries, indicating that the lifelong benefits of education are strongly affected by wider national development experiences.
