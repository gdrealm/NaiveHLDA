{"id":"21D638DA-DCE7-4960-9DF1-EC4C09EF2B3C","title":"Crossing the shell-bone divide","abstractText":"Living systems produce mineral structures such as shells or skeletons. Shells are usually composed of calcium carbonate and bones are made of calcium phosphate. Biomineral scientists tend to work on shells or bones. This project will use a technique that identifies the directions of the crystals within shells and apply it to bone. This will help our understanding of healthy and diseased bone and also assess the success of current bone disease therapies. This project will also pursue the interesting observation that calcium carbonate stimulates bone cells to produce bone. By understanding which aspects of the calcium carbonate structure are required to stimulate bone production, effective bone regenerative implants can be designed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601765","grantId":"G0601765","fundValue":"100543","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Maggie  Cusack","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
