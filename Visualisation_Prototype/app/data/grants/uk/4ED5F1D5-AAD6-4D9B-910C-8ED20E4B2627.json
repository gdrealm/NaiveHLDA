{"id":"4ED5F1D5-AAD6-4D9B-910C-8ED20E4B2627","title":"Sex On Screen: Women, Technology and Sexualization","abstractText":"For years, the representation of women's sexuality has been an area of significant public debate and a focus for political activism, becoming at key moments emblematic of feminism itself. In the contemporary climate, claims that women are interested in sex as never before have become commonplace. Sex products are aggressively marketed to a new female audience and sex shops for women are proliferating. Erotic arts such as pole dancing, erotic writing and advanced sexual techniques form the basis of classes, parties and other organized activities for women. Erotica has become established as a women's genre and it is claimed that women increasingly consume pornography. A range of more mainstream media texts and leisure activities are also increasingly sexualized for women; in advertizing and magazine culture, in television drama and in the burgeoning sex advice industry. Developments in new media and communication technologies have made all kinds of sexual materials accessible as never before, and in addition, have provided new, safe spaces for sexual encounters such as cybersex. It has been argued that this safe access is of particular significance for women for whom active sexual interest has in the past been restricted, stigmatized and often punished.\\n\\nThis project focuses on the ways in which women represent and perform sexuality online in 'camgirl' and pin up sites, chat rooms, discussion boards and sex sites. It therefore represents a major contribution to work in this area and paves the way for future study. \\n\\nThe outcomes of this research will be of value to academics and students in media and communication studies and in gender and sexuality studies. It will also be of value to policymakers, women's organizations and the general public interested in new media.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E000894/1","grantId":"AH/E000894/1","fundValue":"24847","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  I have drawn on the research funded on this grant to develop my ability to contribute to public debates about the role and significance of sex and sexuality in late modern society, particularly in relation to gender and technology; this is something I have developed in other funded projects.

The project was one of the first to develop research into the relationships of sex and new technologies. It has made a significant contribution to understanding the position of women as sexual subjects in their use of technologies and the ways that sexuality is performed online, and to developing discussions of sexual agency in contemporary culture. The project has contributed specifically to debates about sexualization, new sex taste cultures, new forms of pornographic aesthetics and production, and the representation and performance of sexuality in new sites such as chat rooms and blogs. It has also contributed to discussions of research methodologies and ethics and researcher experiences in this area of study. The findings from the research may be put to use to develop more nuanced and contemporary understandings of the relationship of sex and technology and a more sophisticated set of theories about the relationship of gender, sexuality, media production and media representation.
