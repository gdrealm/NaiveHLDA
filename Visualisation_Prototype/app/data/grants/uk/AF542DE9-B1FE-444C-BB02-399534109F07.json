This period witnessed crucial changes in the way that 'race' as a concept was handled by experts. Most analysts of British 'racial' science have argued that the 1930s and 1940s witnessed a sea change in British scientific thinking on the subject. They assert that British science took a decisive turn towards dismissing 'race' as a concept as part of wider social opposition to Nazi thinking. This study will use the papers and written works of leading British biologists and sociologists from this period in order to consider whether this really was the case.\n\nIt will probe the impact of politics on 'racial' scholarship as Britain descended into war against Germany and emerged victorious, questioning the role of changing ideologies and political views in shaping supposedly objective scientific studies of 'racial' difference. Importantly, it will investigate the impact of scientific opinion on government and popular reactions to key migrant groups in the pre-war and war period, notably Jewish and other European refugees from Nazism.\n\nSurprisingly few historians have explored 'racial' research in modern British science: Barkan, Stepan, Hawkins and Mazumdar being obvious exceptions. These existing studies have analysed scientific 'race' thinking in Britain but none have substantially questioned the interaction between scientific thinking and wider society. Similarly, the many historians of twentieth century immigration to Britain have largely neglected the importance of science in shaping social 'racial' attitudes. By probing the relationship between scientific thinking, policy and society this research will offer an iconoclastic thesis on the history of racism in Britain and will provide a new prism through which social ideas on 'race' and immigration can be understood.\n\nThis research will challenge the academic consensus that the defeat of Nazism brought with it a new anti-'racial' commitment on the part of Allied nations, which transformed scientific thinking on 'race'. It will argue that changes in scientific and social 'racial' attitudes occurred more slowly and were less clear than has been previously suggested.\n\nThe post-war research in this project will thus explore the continuing influence of scientific theory in shaping British 'racial' ranking in the 1950s and 1960s. This period witnessed major immigration to Britain and the establishment of substantially increased Black and Asian communities. I argue that scientific thinking on 'racial' difference continued to be of crucial importance in shaping social attitudes towards these newcomers, helping to develop the language and attitudes with which wider society responded to the new multi-ethnic reality.\n\nThe rationale behind this research is that the evolution of 'racial' attitudes in Britain needs to be understood as part of a symbiotic relationship between science and society. Scientists played a crucial role in setting wider social responses to 'Race' issues as both the government and the public often referred and deferred to expert opinion, especially as regards issues of 'racial' difference and 'miscegenation'. However, these same scientists need to be analysed throughout as products of British social experience, not only as theory shapers but also as protagonists within an overarching established British 'racial' discourse. Simply, I argue that science influenced British attitudes towards immigrants and minorities and that existing 'racial' attitudes affected the agenda and judgment of British scientists.\n\nThis research will improve historical understanding of host-minority relations in Britain and open debates about the construction of attitudes towards immigrants and minorities in different contexts and periods. It will address key questions about the relationship between science and society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E50518X/1","grantId":"AH/E50518X/1","fundValue":"18472","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin  Schaffer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Portsmouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
