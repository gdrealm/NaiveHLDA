Very recent work\nfrom our groups and others indicate that novel elements of the canonical and noncanonical WNT signaling pathways could be targeted to modify and monitor AD\nprogression.\nIn this project we will use multidisciplinary approaches, including brain oriented drug screening, a novel proprietary mouse model of AD, new genetic and pharmacological tools for modulation of WNT/GSK3 and WNT/JNK pathways, human\nblood samples from our and the IMI/EMIF platform to identify novel biomarkers of AD progression and a pilot study on metabolomics, to explore the impact on AD of\nnovel WNT elements including but not limited to clusterin, DKK1 and Nrf2.\nOur results in this pathfinder phase with the identification of new candidate targets and drugs for clinical studies will pave the way to therapeutic innovations in\nthe long-term programme. Indeed, several Biopharma companies have initiated drug development programs aimed at targeting certain components of the WNT signaling pathway, including ligands and other small molecule regulators of Axin1 and GSK-3, and Nrf2 that will be interested in our findings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L501505/1","grantId":"MR/L501505/1","fundValue":"220123","fundStart":"2014-05-06","fundEnd":"2016-05-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Lovestone","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
