{"id":"DADDA844-34C2-412B-924F-52A53D6DACAF","title":"When the Going Gets Tough: Motivation and Goal Self-Regulation","abstractText":"<p>Goal setting is a widely used psychological skill for enhancing performance in various life domains, including sport. Previous goal setting research has primarily focused on the &quot;what&quot; as opposed to the &quot;why&quot; of goal striving.<br /><br />However individuals can have different motives for the pursuit of the same goal with differential implications for performance and well-being. Further previous research has largely focused upon positive experiences of goal striving and goal attainment.<br /><br />Comparatively less attention has been devoted to how individuals respond to serious challenges during goal pursuit, yet responses to such challenges are integral to both future goal striving and psychological and emotional health. Consequently the research project comprises two laboratory studies with sport-specific tasks that examine individuals' responses to increasingly difficult attainable goals (Study 1) and unattainable (Study 2) goals.<br /><br />The research project also examines the role of goal motives in predicting such responses. The aim of the project is to develop causal models inking goal motives, appraisals, coping, goal-persistence, and well-being with engagement in physical activities. Our findings may have implications for understanding mechanisms of responses to challenges in goal striving in achievement domains.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3684","grantId":"RES-000-22-3684","fundValue":"79679","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nikos  Ntoumanis","coPersons":["Constantine  Sedikides","Joan Lynne Duda"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
