This will be\nundertaken by Prof Wynne, Dr Palmiere, and Dr Jackson in collaboration with a PhD Student, supported by the grant. Thus\nthe aim of the project in its broadest sense is: Development of quality heat treatment schedules for thick sectioned welds.\nThis will be achieved by the following four work packages.\nWork Package 1: Validate Finite Element Model of Thick Section Welds produced using Reduced Pressure Electron Beam\nWelding (Phd Student, UoS, TWI, SFIL)\nThis includes determination of temperature distribution during welding, size of weld zone, size of heat affected zone,\ncooling rates, and residual stress distribution. Furthermore, material type sensitivity will be investigated from current\nnuclear grade steels through to next generation materials.\nWork Package 2: Microstructure Evaluation of As-Welded Microstructure. (PhD Student, UoS)\nA detailed investigation of the as-welded microstructure in terms of alloy segregation, weld zone sizes, grain size,\ntransformation product, etc will be undertaken using optical and electron microscopy. Results will be compared to the modelling results produced in WP1\nWork Package 3: Development of Potential Heat Treatment Schedules for As-Welded Materials. (PhD Student, UoS, SFIL)\nReview of literature on potential heat treatment schedules for welded materials, concentrating on issues relating to the\ngeneral physical metallurgy, welding methodologies and metallurgical challenges, as well as NDT evaluation techniques.\nThe project has already identified the steel compositions, and so this particular task should be highly focused, identifying\nmaterial and post-production issues. Thermodynamic modelling of the steel compositions will indicate the phases and\nphase fractions expected. Initial risks associated with the use of the steel compositions will also be assessed.\nWork Package 4: Application of Identified Heat Treatment Schedules in the Heat Treatment Simulator. (PhD Student, UoS,\nSFIL)\nFollowing on from the outcomes of WP3, the chosen heat treatment schedules will be undertaken on as welded material\nusing the heat treatment simulator. Mechanical property evaluation will be in the form of tensile tests, Charpy impact tests,\ncrack tip opening displacement tests, and hardness profiles. Microstructure characterisation will produce information on\nphase fractions, segregation profiles, and microstructure type and uniformity using optical and scanning electron\nmicroscopy. These results will then form the basis for large scale trials.\nWork Package 5: Validate Linkage Between Chosen Heat Treatment and Actual Component. (PhD Student, UoS, SFIL)\nThis work package will compare and contrast simulated results, both mechanical and microstructure, with an actual\ncomponent. Extreme areas of the as-forged component will be investigated to ensure good variability coverage.\nMicrostructure at levels above optical, i.e. precipitation density, will be taken thus requiring advanced characterisation\nmethods such as scanning and transmission electron microscopy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508494/1","grantId":"EP/N508494/1","fundValue":"119903","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2018-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bradley Peter Wynne","coPersons":["E.J.
