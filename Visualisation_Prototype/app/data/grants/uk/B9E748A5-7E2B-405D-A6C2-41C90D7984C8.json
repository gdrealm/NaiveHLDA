This is important in early phase trials as this information is routinely used to decide whether further study is warranted and to power future studies. Additionally, health bodies require accurate estimation of the treatment effect to make informed choices about cost-effectiveness relative to alternative options as well as benefit risk assessment. In many current studies multiple hypothesis tests are conducted which has the unwanted side effect that the standard method for estimation is inaccurate. \n\nThis project aims to thoroughly evaluate the extent of bias of the standard estimator in studies in which multiple hypothesis tests are conducted. We will also investigate appropriate graphical displays to visualize treatment effects and develop novel approaches for point and interval estimation that balance accuracy and precision of the estimator. The developments will be made in close connection with clinical researchers and will be overseen by an advisory panel.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M005755/1","grantId":"MR/M005755/1","fundValue":"277601","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas Friedrich Jaki","coPersons":["Martin  Posch","Lisa Victoria  Hampson"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
