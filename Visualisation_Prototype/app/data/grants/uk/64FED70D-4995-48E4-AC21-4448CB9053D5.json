The disease inflicts very significant losses especially in livestock in India, with infection levels reaching 55% in some regions. Recently-estimated costs for liver fluke induced losses associated with livestock in India fall within the range of US$1.95-4.78 billion per year. This is a huge burden to the largely agricultural Indian economy and directly impacts the productivity of large and small farm holdings alike, negatively impacting individual farmers and their families. Liver fluke infected buffalo show reduction in general health, weight gain, feed conversion efficiency and reproduction. The infective worm stage encysts on vegetation such that host animals inadvertently consume the cysts during grazing. Once in the gut, the juvenile worms hatch, burrow through the gut wall and penetrate the liver, ending up as adult worms in bile ducts where they feed on host blood, significantly diminishing the health of the animal and greatly reducing agricultural productivity. In the developed world liver fluke is mainly controlled using the chemical triclabendazole (TCBZ). This drug is an Achilles heel of liver fluke control as it is the only drug that kills both adult and pathogenic juveniles. New control strategies are urgently needed as anthelmintic resistance in parasitic worm populations is spreading globally, and agricultural communities in many parts of the developing world simply cannot afford short-lived, anthelmintic-based treatment options. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a cost effective, single-treatment control strategy based on vaccination. Numerous vaccine trials have been completed in liver fluke, many showing some success, but none have provided protection levels adequate for immediate commercialization. The problem is that since most leading vaccine candidates exist in large, related groups of proteins within parasites, it has been impossible to determine which is the best candidate from the group such that up until now, these decisions have not been subject to rigorous validation. To this end, this international collaborative project between laboratories in India and the UK will, for the first time, incorporate new fast throughput nucleotide and protein technologies to validate the candidate proteins and thereby assess if these leading vaccine candidates can be used to treat liver fluke parasites in different parts of the world, a key to successful commercial production. Once a vaccine target is confirmed as widely present in liver fluke populations, we will use another new technology called reverse genetics that can switch-off (or silence) a target in a parasite, and then confirm if this target is essential for parasite survival. If confirmed as important to parasite survival, we will subsequently use yeast laboratory cultures to produce the candidates for vaccine trials in livestock in India. Since this is a multi-discipline and multi-laboratory project, we have formed an International Science Advisory Board (ISAB) in order to manage and co-ordinate progress and to trouble-shoot. Members of the ISAB include a representative from a large Animal Pharmaceutical Company, a parasitologist with many years of industrial experience, a leading world authority on liver fluke vaccination and a representative from the industrial Biotechnology sector in India. The programme addresses the mission of the BBSRC, including treatment of diseases of livestock, application of new technologies and international collaboration. Validated trial vaccine(s) from this programme would form the basis for commercial development for treating liver fluke disease, and our technology strategy is directly transferable to other helminth parasites of animal and humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H009477/1","grantId":"BB/H009477/1","fundValue":"578551","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  1. Information on liver fluke control has been disseminated through workshops in North and South India - including training workshops with veterinarians; further information on liver fluke control has been distributed via multi-language pamphlets in both North and South India. \n2. Researchers in India have been trained in the application of new functional genomics tools for vaccine discovery and are using these in Chennai and Aligarh (South and North India) towards the development of new parasite vaccines.\n3. Grant supported the development of a new molecular diagnostic laboratory in Chennai (TANUVAS) that is undertaking leptospirosis screening for the public.\n\nNew Partnerships / Links with Industry established as a result of the CIDLID funding:\n\n• The new scientific collaborations between Aligarh (AMU-North India), Chennai (South India), Aberystwyth (Wales) and Belfast (Northern Ireland) were developed through resource and technology exchanges and training. The CIDLID programme has provided leverage for the procurement of additional funds from various national agencies within India for the establishment of a central instrumentation facility (Aligarh and Chennai) and animal holding complex (Chennai) [see above for more details]. \n\n• The team at Queen's University Belfast developed formal collaborative links with Merial to exploit the RNAi technology developed during the project. These links have been formalized through a co-funded BBSRC-LINK programme (details below) to validate and exploit new flukicide targets for liver fluke control. This project started in July 2013 and will run for 3-years. This academia-industry link developed as a direct result of interaction with Dr Lance Hammerland (Merial, Atlanta, USA) an industrial member of the International Scientific Advisory Board (ISAB) established for this CIDLID grant. \n\n• Another member of the ISAB for this CIDLID grant, Professor Terry Spithill (LaTrobe University, Australia), provided some additional and novel putative vaccine targets for validation through a new collaboration. As part of the development of this collaboration, a PhD student (Paul McCusker) who worked on the RNAi-tools development aspect of this CIDLID grant spent 3-months training in Prof Spithill's laboratory in Melbourne on vaccine antigen production. Further, Prof. Spithill will undertake a research visit to Belfast for one month from 14 July 2014. \n\n• Prof. Brophy (PI at Aberystwyth) was appointed to the Parasitology Steering Committee for Meat Promotion Wales (HCC) Levy Body in 2011 and this has lead to a HCC Contract on Liver Fluke control in Wales (2012) and a BBSRC-iCASE application with HCC on fluke in 2013. Professor Brophy and Dr Morphew have been awarded a 2013 BBSRC Sparking Award to host a workshop on commercial opportunities on liver fluke control at the new Aberystwyth Innovation Campus.\n\n• A PDRA from the CIDLID consortium (Dr Morphew) has recently been appointed to a lectureship position at Aberystwyth. Another PDRA from this CIDLID consortium (Dr McVeigh) secured Gates Foundation funding to develop new diagnostic tests for parasite diseases. \n\n• Dr. M. Raman and Dr. G. Ravikumar invited Dr. Ramamoorthy Jayaraj, Senior Lecturer-Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Engineering, Health, Science and the Environment, Charles Darwin University, Australia to TANUVAS Chennai for additional advise on the BBSRC Fasciola research project (Januray 2013).\n\n• Dr. M. Raman and Dr. G. Ravikumar visited Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand for research discussions with Dr. Suda Riengrojpitak on the development of a Fasciola vaccine (October 2013).

Animals were challenged with 1200 metacercariae each (35% viability). Necropsy showed statistically significant reductions in worm burden of 21.8%, 29.1%, 34.5% (fluke secretion [FS], sigma-GST [sGST], FS &amp;amp;amp; sGST) in the three treatment groups. The combination of ES &amp;amp;amp; sGST proved the highest (34.5%). With a 34.5% reduction the animals remained clinically healthy throughout the 9 month study period. Further work is ongoing with varied doses of antigen for improvement in the reduction of worm burden and a small scale field study in subsistence and organized farm conditions will pursue other key candidate antigens identified by the work (both FABP1 and 3 in addition to ES &amp;amp;amp; sGST). If there is significant and practically useful levels of protection in these follow-on trials, the Indian partners at TANUVAS will develop and commercialize this new treatment. They have experience in the development and commercialization of vaccines within India. \n\nMulti-language information leaflets were prepared and distributed to farming communities in both North and South India: \nA video and pamphlets in multiple languages providing information for the on-farm treatment and control of helminth parasites were developed and distributed by the Indian partners in both North and South India. These were distributed to farming communities and to local veterinary practices across Tamil Nadu and in Northern India in Aligarh and surrounding areas. \n\nTraining Workshops and Seminars for Field Veterinarians: \nWorkshops at three veterinary stations in both North and South India leaves a legacy of knowledge transfer activities that will continue to impact farmers, both men and women, in the future. \n\nNew functional genomics tools developed during the project have been transferred to two Indian Universities (TANUVAS in Chennai and Aligarh Muslim University), increasing their capabilites in molecular parasitology. \nVaccine trials in buffalo were completed but the protections provided (30%) was disappointing.\nNew molecular parasitology laboratories developed at Aligarh Muslim University and at TANUVAS, Chennai. The latter is a molecular diagnostic laboratory for zoonotic diseases that is serving the public. \n\nResearch methods / tools / resources provided by UK laboratories:\nIn addition to the scientific papers/reports and conference presentations (data below), the UK laboratories provided the Indian collaborators and wider research community with the following: \nThe Aberystwyth team generated recombinant proteins (with storage plasmid clones) and polyclonal antibodies to a number of project identified liver fluke vaccine candidates. Recombinant forms of Sigma, Omega and Mu Class Glutathione transferases (GSTs), fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) IV, V, VI and VII, Thioredoxin glutathione transferase and Leucine aminopeptidase were produced and polyclonal antisera raised to these proteins. All recombinant proteins have been produced for both F. hepatica and F. gigantica. These reagents are available to the research community.\n\nProteomics methodologies have been developed to study major protein superfamilies in liver fluke (and other organisms): GSTs (Morphew et al. 2012), Cathepsin L (Morphew et al. 2011) and FABPs (Morphew et al. in preparation). \n\nThe transcriptome of newly excysted juveniles (NEJs) from Fasciola gigantica support the research community by providing gene discovery and protein identification databases. The data generated from transcriptomics approaches will be deposited into public databases (NCBI Genbank) and online for publically accessible BLAST facilities to be hosted by IBERS, Aberystwyth. \n\nWe also generated an optimized and validated RNAi platform for the in vitro and in vivo analysis of control (vaccine or chemotherapy) target candidature (established protocols for efficient and robust knockdown of all putative vaccine targets identified in proposal - these were relayed to Indian collaborators during research visits to UK and in workshops held in India - see below). Also established the first evidence for RNAi in the tropical liver fluke, Fasciola gigantica. The new protocols will be available to the research community via publication in PLoS Negl Trop Dis (McVeigh et al. 2014; McCammick et al., in preparation). \n\nData/Sequences lodged in databases:\nNew sequences of immuno-suppressor and vaccine candidates were posted by Aberystwyth in public access databases (NCBI Genbank).\na) F. gigantica Sigma GST GenBank: AFX98103.1\nb) F. gigantica Omega GST GenBank: AFX98105.1\nc) F. hepatica Omega GST GenBank: AFX98104.1\nd) F. hepatica Cathepin L1D GenBank: ACJ12894.1\n\nAdditional vaccine candidate sequences will be deposited by Aberystwyth post publication on the Fatty Acid Binding Protein (FABP) superfamily (Morphew et al. in preparation). \na) F. gigantica FABP IV; b) F. gigantica FABP V; c) F. gigantica FABP VI; d) F. gigantica FABP VII; e) F. hepatica FABP IV; f) F. hepatica FABP V; g) F. hepatica FABP VI; h) F. hepatica FABP VII The Indian partners now have the methods in place to continue the work to develop a new liver fluke vaccine and are doing so. \nThe resources and training provided in India has improved their capacity for research and this is moving in many different directions, including improved molecular disease diagnosstics facilities for the puiblic Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
