{"id":"D59F0192-A01A-4E09-A788-F176CCB0FE7A","title":"Study phase of the EUV Imager for Solar Orbiter","abstractText":"We aim to validate the design of an imager for the Solar Orbiter mission. This mission has an extreme orbit, reaching 0.2 A.U. at its closest point. The imager will provide the highest ever resolution imaging in the EUV and will allow us to understand the source of solar wind and coronal mass ejections by 'touching' and 'seeing' the sources and the output. This mission will achieve a new domain in space exploration by orbiting the Sun and getting in closer than Mercury - nothing has achieved this before. This mission is already capturing the imagination of the general public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E006612/1","grantId":"PP/E006612/1","fundValue":"135081","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Louise Kim Harra","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
