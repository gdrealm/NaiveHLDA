{"id":"9581D1B3-59A5-41B5-8AC1-36E87516428A","title":"Lego Physics","abstractText":"For the Big Bang Fair in National Science and Engineering Week 2011, we developed a LEGO physics set documenting the history of the Universe, which covered aspects of the physics syllabus at both GCSE and A-Level. This grant bid is to extend the workshop to two separate workshops, incorporating the fission/fusion aspects of GCSE and the more extended particle physics aspects of the A-Level.\n\nThe aim of this project is to improve the understanding of these topics within the syllabi by demonstrating them in an innovative way. We hope this may encourage more students at GCSE to take physics at A-Level, and students at A-level to consider a research career or a degree in physics.\n\nWe will disseminate the kits both via workshops, supported by current undergraduates and Ph.D students, and through a mailing to all UK schools, which we will be undertaking in September 2011. The mailing will include the instruction booklet for the LEGO kit we currently have, as well as other curriculum resources.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J500318/1","grantId":"ST/J500318/1","fundValue":"2000","fundStart":"2011-09-12","fundEnd":"2012-06-11","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Benjamin  Still","coPersons":["Bryony  Frost"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
