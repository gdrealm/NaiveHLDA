The use of satellite technologies in this way is still in its infancy, but its significance increases as geographical coverage and technological capabilities improve and costs reduce. Australia is at an interesting and advanced stage in satellite monitoring usage, and is the only jurisdiction where satellites are systematically used to check compliance with a specific environmental law.</p>\n\n<p>This research will consider the lessons which can be learnt from Australia in order to assess the successes and constraints of satellite monitoring. Of particular interest will be whether satellite monitoring might prove more effective in some instances than more traditional forms of inspection and if its use might result in higher detection coupled with higher deterrence. Awareness and reactions amongst regulated communities will also be examined in order to assess whether satellite monitoring influences compliance behaviour. It will also consider whether its use could result in regulatory cost-savings.</p>\n\n<p>Considering the factors involved in the use of satellite monitoring in Australia will contribute to better understanding in the formulation of policies, and eventual inclusion of its use, in the UK and Europe.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1865","grantId":"RES-062-23-1865","fundValue":"181066","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Raymond  Purdy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
