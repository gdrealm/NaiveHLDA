The increasing frequency and intensity of heat stress episodes have been identified as the major threat to reefs survival. The impact of high temperature on corals can be exacerbated by regional factors such as pollution of coastal seawater. In the Persian/Arabian Gulf (hereafter: &quot;the Gulf&quot;) corals are exposed to elevated salinity levels and unusual nutrient concentrations. At the same time, they endure extreme temperature maxima that would kill corals elsewhere on the planet. Despite the crucial role of the lipid composition of zooxanthellae in defining the susceptibility of reef corals to heat stress, the specific lipid signature characterising the symbionts of Gulf corals is as yet completely unexplored. The proposed study will address this knowledge gap by applying a mass spectrometric (MS) approach to compare the lipid profiles of zooxanthellae from Gulf corals flourishing in an extreme temperature habitat (Abu Dhabi, UAE) with those of conspecifics that experience typical tropical conditions in the Indo/South Pacific (Hoga Island, Fiji). We will analyse samples from the two field sites collected at different seasons over a year. In parallel, we will monitor changes in the physicochemical environment over the same period. This strategy will identify key differences in the quantitative / qualitative lipid composition of zooxanthellae associated with coral survival at high temperature and with the dynamic response to changes in environmental conditions. We will use our established laboratory strains of Porites lobata originating from the Gulf and the Pacific to examine how altered temperature, nutrient concentrations and salinity individually affect the lipid complement of zooxanthellae. The experiments under controlled conditions will allow us to test our hypothesis that the unique physicochemical environment of the Gulf promotes thermotolerance of corals by altering the lipid composition of zooxanthellae. The comparative approach of this project will be enabled by the highly complementary expertise of the participating scientists (coral physiology/molecular biology/biochemistry; lipid biology/mass spectrometry &amp; biogeochemistry). The project will benefit from excellent project partners (Burt, Voolstra, Suggett, Smith) that provide substantial in-kind contributions and from the support of a large international consortium of stakeholders from academia, industry, governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with the coral ecosystems of the Gulf.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K00641X/1","grantId":"NE/K00641X/1","fundValue":"376276","fundStart":"2013-05-31","fundEnd":"2016-08-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Joerg  Wiedenmann","coPersons":["A.D.

In the Persian/Arabian Gulf (&quot;the Gulf&quot;) corals are exposed to elevated salinity levels and unusual nutrient concentrations. At the same time, they endure extreme temperature maxima that would kill corals elsewhere on the planet. Hence, they represent ideal models to study the basis of heat stress tolerance and contribute essential information required to forecast the fate of coral reefs in the warmer oceans of the future.\n\nIn this project, we are exploring the physiological basis for the stress resilience of the Gulf corals using a range of -omic techniques.\n\nThe outcomes of the proposed research will facilitate the prediction of the adaptability of reef corals to global warming. In particular, the results of the study will underline the importance of the Persian/Arabian Gulf coral communities as unique examples of stress resilient corals, making a strong case in support of their rigorous conservation.\n\nWe made significant progress and have submitted the key results in the form of two papers.\n\nKey Findings Paper 1 (submitted):\n\nIn light of the bleak predictions for coral reefs, drastic measures such as the intentional translocation of individuals has been proposed to rescue threatened species and ecosystems (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2008, Science 321, 345-346, 397 citations). Since the oceanographic conditions in the Gulf are believed to prevent a natural dispersal of Gulf corals to adjacent seas (Sheppard et al. 1992), their &quot;assisted migration&quot; has been proposed to help the restoration of reefs devastated by rising sea surface temperature in the Indo-Pacific (Riegl et al. 2011; Coles 2003). \nWe found that, despite the dominant opposing surface current, gene flow exists from the Gulf into the adjacent Gulf of Oman, potentially facilitating a natural pre-adaptation of Indian Ocean populations to the projected warming seas.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate experimentally that the superior fitness of Gulf corals at high temperatures is associated with local adaptations to the high salinity of the Gulf and would be lost if they were transferred directly to other reef environments. Indeed, our study of the ancestry of three Porites species along &amp;gt;1000 km of coastline in the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman through the molecular identification of their symbiotic algae, reveals a restricted distribution of Gulf corals within the adjacent seas. Hence, coral reef management cannot rely on assisted migration as a &quot;quick fix&quot; solution for reefs devastated by global warming, but should rather concentrate on alternative actions to strengthen the resilience of reef ecosystems.\n\nKey Findings Paper 2 (under review)\n\nBy analysing nuclear ribosomal DNA, we have recently shown that Symbiodinium clade C3 is the\nprevalent symbiont in coral species in Abu Dhabi, UAE whereas clade D zooxanthellae, proposed\ncandidates for thermotolerant symbioses, were not encountered. This finding was puzzling since clade\nC3 symbionts have not usually been found to be exceptionally thermotolerant, but have rather been\ndefined as a cosmopolitan, generalist clade.\nIn the present manuscript, we answered two important questions to establish the significance of clade C3\nzooxanthellae for the functioning of the coral-alga symbiosis in extreme temperature environments: (1)\nIs the prevalence of these C3 zooxanthellae in the Southern / Southeastern Gulf a temporal phenomenon\nthat might be reverted seasonally or permanently to a dominance of clade D symbionts? (2) Does the C3\nzooxanthellae lineage from the Gulf represent a cryptic species that cannot been identified by the\nresolution of &quot;classical&quot; ITS2 sequence phylotyping?\nWe addressed these questions by monitoring the seasonal dominance of zooxanthellae types in individual\ncolonies of six coral species over three years and by analysing an alternative phylogenetic marker\n(psbAncr) of C3-type zooxanthellae along &amp;gt;400 km of coastline in the Persian/Arabian Gulf. We found\nthat the predominant symbionts from Gulf corals represent a new species that we named Symbiodinium\nthermophilus. Despite some species-specific variability in seasonal composition of the zooxanthellae\ncomplement, S. thermophilus remains the prevalent symbiont of corals from the Gulf, the world's hottest\nsea.\nOur results demonstrate that the molecular method that is currently most often used to classify coral\nsymbionts might obscure significant taxonomic features and has insufficient capacity to identify heattolerant\nsymbionts. Hence, the insights provided by our paper allow us to link the molecular taxonomy of\nalga symbionts with their stress tolerance, an important advance in predicting the resilience of coral under\nthe pressure of climate change. The key activity to increase the impact of the proposed study is the establishment of the Mideast Coral Reef Society with the aim to improve the knowledge exchange between representatives of academia, industry/private sector, governmental and non-governmental organisations. The webpage is already live (http://mideastcrs.org) and the official launch will take place during the &amp;quot;Coral Reefs of Arabia&amp;quot; conference in Abu Dhabi, February 2015.
