{"id":"A4A68A79-018B-4DE0-A63E-030BE769E4F9","title":"A History of Television for Women in Britain, 1947-1989","abstractText":"This project will research television programming made for and watched by women viewers during a significant period of British television history: 1947-1989. In this period television re-started after the war, commercial television was introduced, followed by the introduction of BBC2 and Channel 4. Despite the suggestive connection between the development of television as a domestic technology and changes in gender relations, there has been scant attention paid to this relationship over time. The development of television and its viewers in Britain will therefore be related to social change, particularly in relation to the growth of consumer culture, increase in the female workforce, the re-organisation of family life, and the rise of the women's and civil rights movements during the research period. \\n\\nAvailable glimpses of programming from the period suggest interesting shifts in content, modes of address and representations of gender. However, little is known about how the British television industry, with its public service ethos, conceptualised the female audience, or how, when and why programmes were made specifically for women. Also, little is known about women's memories of television viewing, despite prevailing common-sense and academic assumptions about the feminisation of the medium. \\n\\nThis project works to fill in some of the gaps in the history of British television, outlining significant moments in the period, specific programme types, genres and scheduling slots which have become significantly marked as feminine. To these ends it pursues an approach to production, text and reception through an innovative combination of methods:\\n\\nIt will explore the production culture, policies and decision making which produced the strong vein of television programming for women in Britain, using, amongst other sources, the BBC Written Archive at Caversham and the ITC collection held at the BFI. \\n\\nIt will document, using listings magazines and popular publications for women, the factual and dramatic programming that was addressed specifically to a female viewer to establish (and attempt to protect) what is available in the archives. \\nIt will produce an analysis of some of the key texts that emerge from this search, by viewing where possible, or by reconstructing programmes through written archives (floor plans, shooting scripts etc). Our analysis will explore the terms in which the female viewer has been addressed, how that address has changed over time, identifying of the continuities and transformations (in both form and content) with the current period. \\n\\nIt will attempt to recover a generationally and nationally dispersed set of female audience members from the historical period in question who will be approached through contemporary women's publications. Our interviews will explore their memories of television against their personal narratives to uncover the programmes that they saw as being for them, and question how these programmes resonated with their everyday lives. The data will be analysed against the backdrop of discourses from the industry.\\n\\nA key impact of this project will be to bring the issue of the preservation of programming often marked as 'for women', or feminised as part of the 'everyday' and thus characterised as ephemeral, into clearer focus for those organisations involved in archiving 'our' television history. Alongside academic publications on the subject, the project will produce reports for both archivists and women in media groups which will outline the significance of a feminist politics of archiving through our key findings about influential programming and their significance in women's cultural memories. This is a project with a strong feminist agenda, which aims to contribute to a fuller understanding of the production, texts and reception of women's media culture in Britain.\\n\\nN.B.The delay in start date reflects the fact that Wheatley will be on maternity leave until May 2009.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F017251/1","grantId":"AH/F017251/1","fundValue":"348177","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  At our final events, representatives from the BBC commented that knowledge of our research on the history of television for women would change the way they thought about reaching and addressing female audiences in the future.\n\nVisitors to the 'Pop Up TV Pop Shop' in Coventry, May 2012, commented that the shop had changed their views about the university and the research carried out there, and had impacted upon their relationship to their own memories of television, family and social life.\n\nPublications from the project are being addressed in other academic research.

Research on Stephens' career and the programmes she oversaw has demonstrated that the address of key early programming for women was broader than has typically been assumed, and that, in particular, she wanted to address the female audience in ways which not only spoke to their roles as housewives and mothers, but also acknowledged their potential interest in and engagement with the world of politics, current affairs and the arts outside the space of the home. One such instance is the 'lost' women's daytime arts programme, Wednesday Magazine, rediscovered as a result of Irwin's research. Preceding the more widely-known and critically acclaimed programme Monitor, Wednesday Magazine is an instance of early women's non-fiction programming, examples of which do remain available to view; another is the drama serial Compact, written by Hazel Adair, whose work on key programmes including Crossroads and Emergency Ward 10 has also remained hidden from critical view. Rediscovery of and analysis of the production and textuality of these and other programmes has enabled us to: (1) fill in significant gaps in existing histories of British television, which have consistently overlooked the contributions made to television's generic and aesthetic development by programmes and programme-makers addressing a female audience and (2) challenge assumptions about the domestic address of television produced for women in Britain, which often, for example, in the early period, acknowledged women's roles as workers outside as well as within the home. Work on the later period has demonstrated the significance of critically neglected genres such as romantic situation comedy and adaptations of popular romantic fiction (e.g. Catherine Cookson) in British television's address to a female audience.\n\n(c): Doctoral researcher Hazel Collie's interviews with British women viewers of different generations has produced significant new data about both the programmes understood by women as having been in some way 'for them', as well as knowledge about the significance of generation and life stage in modes of viewing. This research is for the first time revealing how television moves through different modes of significance in women's lives over the duration of the life course, as well as demonstrating key distinctions between generations. This shows a mapping of the intimate relations of television around family, relationships and the home. The interviews have shown that programming genres quite removed from those usually assumed to be 'television for women' (e.g. soaps, costume drama) have been important in women's lives, including in their constructions of self and their relationships with others. Perhaps the most significant genre to emerge as important has been pop music programming, from the 1960s to the end of the research period, with programmes such as Ready Steady Go! ,The Tube and their female presenters featuring repeatedly. Moving from this finding to research on the programmes themselves and their paratexts, for example in television listings magazines such as TV Times, the gendered address of pop programming is clear. This finding was only possible, however, as a result of the interview data, and demonstrates the significance of our dialogic method. Other unanticipated genres to emerge from the interviews included sports programming, children's television and documentaries; a key finding of this strand of the research, then, has been to extend significantly the way in which the formulation 'television for women' has been, and might in the future be, understood.\n\nOverall, the research has produced new knowledge about the production, texts, address and reception of television for women in Britain from 1947 to 1989, historicising research on contemporary programming (e.g. women's television before the moment of 'postfeminist sensibility' addressed women as both homemakers and career women). Television in Britain has also addressed its audience outside as well as within the typically researched genres of soap opera and other fictional forms of television, thus extending the definition of what might be understood as 'television for women'. Our understanding of what and how women view has been significantly shifted by the analysis of interviews with women across the period and across the nation. The project has reached beyond academia in its engagement with the viewing public to increase awareness of women's television history as a site of valuable cultural heritage. This has operated through the relationship built with women viewers who responded to our adverts about women's memories of television. This prompted many letters, emails, contributions to our social media sites, and some press attention which form part of a broader picture of the ways in which women viewers have been encouraged to engage with the project, alongside the thirty women selected for interviews. This has been supported by a number of public engagement events (talks and screenings at the Phoenix Arts Centre Leictester and the BFI at the London Southbank), as well as a Pop-Up exhibition with Coventry Arts Space where we took our findings into a public space to gather feedback and more memories around the findings about pop music programmes. In these ways the project has directly involved the viewing public in any construction of 'their' history.\n\nBy the end of the project, the research team will produce a report for the television industry and television archivists which will outline key findings and identify their potential usefulness outside of the academy. Our findings support our initial hypothesis about the importance of a feminist politics of archiving, showing that while few 'women's programmes' have been preserved across British television history, there are some 'jewels' in the National Archive which the research has been able to identify, analyse and highlight. Our research, we believe, shows that the preservation of programming perhaps deemed 'ephemeral' or unimportant at the time of its production may nevertheless prove important historically and thus the research supports and underlines the significance of the work of archivists like Lisa Kerrigan at the BFI who are striving to keep women's television on the archiving and curating agenda at a moment when difficult decisions are being made about preservation in the digital context. The work the project has done on the struggles of women like Doreen Stephens working in the industry in the early days will be of interest and use to professional networks such as Women in Film and Television (UK) with whom we have developed a significant ongoing working relationship. Our findings about the kinds of programming women have understood as having been 'for them' should prove both surprising and useful for those working as commissioners and producers in the contemporary industry.
