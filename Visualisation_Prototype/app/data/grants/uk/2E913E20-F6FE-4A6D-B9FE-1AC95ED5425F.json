{"id":"2E913E20-F6FE-4A6D-B9FE-1AC95ED5425F","title":"The photographic magazine: prototype installation phase","abstractText":"The primary outcome of this phase of research will be an illustrated catalogue. The objective is to stage an exhibition of the original material at MMU's Holden Gallery with a component in the institution's All Saints Library site, a short walk away. Interactive access to magazine material, being produced by VSW students, will be via VSWs website. An illustrated catalogue written by myself will be produced by Prof. David Crow and published by MMU's Righton Press, enhancing its portfolio of titles. Distribution will be through Cornerhouse, Manchester. Audiences for whom this research will be valuable are students of photography, history of photography, art history, media studies and graphic design, and researchers in these fields. Access to this material will be enhanced by video interviews in situ with at least two artist/editors (AA Bronson and Nathan Lyons) and facsimile magazines, made in collaboration with personnel at VSW and MMU. Documentation of the installation will be added to the &quot;third space&quot; project web site to enable wider access to this research within its wider context.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119610/1","grantId":"119610/1","fundValue":"4700","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2006-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Brittain","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
