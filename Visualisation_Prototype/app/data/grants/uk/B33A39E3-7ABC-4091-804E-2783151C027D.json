Transparency of the cornea depends upon the integrity of its outermost layer called the epithelium, which is constantly regenerated throughout life by a population of stem cells found at the edge of the cornea in an area called the limbus, the so called limbal stem cells (LSC). If LSC becomes deficient as a result of injury or disease, this epithelium will breakdown leading to severe pain and blindness. This condition is often difficult to treat, however, the management of limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) has benefited from major breakthroughs in recent years. LSC from the patient?s own (one eye disease) or a relative healthy eye or from a cadaveric eye can grow in the laboratory and then transplanted to the diseased eye. This technique however uses animal products to help grow the cells with a great risk of diseases transmission. In addition, the safety and effectiveness of this treatment is rather difficult to establish due to the diversity and the small number of cases reported. Transplantation of cultured limbal epithelium can therefore not be recognized, enabling NHS funding, until its effectiveness and safety is determined by a formally structured clinical trial. Such a trial forms the main objective of this proposal. We have therefore developed an ?animal product free? technique for growing the cells in the laboratory in an ultra-clean environment and successfully transplanted 8 patients with LSCD in one eye by taking LSC from their healthy other eye. Despite of our success, this number of patients is not significant to draw proper conclusions. This proposal aims therefore to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our methods by treating more patients with total unilateral LSCD. Another aim of the project is to develop a freezing method of cultured human LSC for storage and to set-up a service to supply clinical grade cultured LSC for transplantation at other UK centres. In addition, this study will investigate the abnormal tear film in patients with LSCD to allow for a customised eye treatment. Finally, LSCD has an enormous impact on patient?s quality of life with serious detrimental effects on productivity and leisure activities. To that effect we have selected 4 questionnaires to look at different aspects of patients with LSCD and its treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900879","grantId":"G0900879","fundValue":"1172580","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Francisco Carlos Figueiredo","coPersons":["Sajjad  Ahmad","Monica  Berry","Anne Mary Dickinson"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
