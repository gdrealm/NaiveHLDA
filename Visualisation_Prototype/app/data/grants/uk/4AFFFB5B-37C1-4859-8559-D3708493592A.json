The cost of heating that water (assuming 10 p/kWh and 2.4 M households) is estimated to be in the order of 184 million); this reduction in energy demand will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power generation. People share a common desire to wear clean clothes, regardless of their wealth or nationality. Current detergent formulations are a complex mixture of reagents, but in terms of their cleaning composition but can broadly be considered to contain (i) surfactants to solubilise fabric-based stains; (ii) enzymes to digest stains and (iii) bleaches to degrade and increase the hydrophillicity of coloured stains. Typically, these formulations require non-ambient temperature water to be effective. A significant problem associated with washing at lower temperatures is the removal of fats and oils below 35 C, preventing their facile removal from fabrics. While the technological problems of cleaning in cold water are many-fold, ultimately it is the limited performance of enzymes at these temperatures that are major contributors to the problem.Several technical issues must be addressed to overcome these issues. The key elements are the inefficient activity of lipase enzymes at low temperatures and the incompatibility of enzymes both with other enzymes and other components in the formulation limit the application and performance of the most aggressive formulations. This proposal will focus on the development of technology that uses state of the art molecular biology to engineer cold active lipases and enables the currently incompatible formulation components to be applied together. This will be achieved by the encapsulation of enzymes and other components in novel degradable polymers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H03496X/1","grantId":"EP/H03496X/1","fundValue":"195801","fundStart":"2010-05-17","fundEnd":"2012-11-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Peter Dove","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
