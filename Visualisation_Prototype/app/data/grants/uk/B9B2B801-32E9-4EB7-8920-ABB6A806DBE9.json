In addition, as a New Investigator Award, this proposal will support a vibrant research environment by enabling young promising researchers, such as myself, to establish independent research careers here in the UK.\n\nThe results of this research will be communicated in peer reviewed publications. In addition, results will be presented at scientific meetings to communicate progress with the scientific community. Close interaction with the communications department of Imperial College and the MRC will ensure that new findings and porgress are dissseminated to the public in an appropriate and timely fashion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501176","grantId":"G0501176","fundValue":"323943","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Toby  Lawrence","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
