{"id":"7465DBBE-E175-4582-A1EC-FA7A62D94AFB","title":"The Decorated School","abstractText":"This research network will record and begin to analyse what we have termed 'the decorated school'. For our purposes, 'the decorated school' means those aspects of the school building and surrounds that were worked on by artists and sculptors to integrated art works intended to project ideas about education in relation to notions of local or national identities. Mural decoration has been characteristic in school design in the past and is often a feature in the present design of new schools and today is frequently used as a vehicle for pupil or community participation. But in the past there was a deep appreciation of how the best design and art might act as a kind of educator and in England regional education officers such as Henry Morris in Cambridgeshire, Stuart Mason in Leicestershire and John Newsom in Hertfordshire ensured that new school buildings would contain works of beauty and excellent design. The post-war period was a time when the renewal of school buildings led to artists working collaboratively with architects and educators to decorate school interiors and grounds. The artifacts installed ranged from ceramic tiles to large scale murals and sculptures. These items were carefully considered to project a particular image of childhood, adolescence or education to a specific local audience. \\nThe research network will meet at sites where there are existing examples that have survived to date. Additionally, the research will document what has existed, and what remains, making this data publicly available through a website and publication. This is urgent work as many school buildings that were built in the past are threatened with demolition as the renewal of the building stock progresses.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I021604/1","grantId":"AH/I021604/1","fundValue":"32206","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings have been presented in an attractive and accessible book - C.

It has generated substantial public engagement and activity in re-evaluating the significance of public art as integral to the built environment of schools. The findings will stimulate parallel research and activity in Europe and in the USA via a new interactive searchable website that is being developed. This will make the initial findings accessible and useable to non academic as well as scholarly audiences. Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
