The ability to do so skilfully (accurately, automatically and without much mental effort) means that we can work productively, live independently, and interact with our environments efficiently and safely. However, there are points during the lifespan when our performance is reduced compared with the years in which it is optimal. This includes the childhood years when we are less able to select voluntary actions appropriately, and as we age when our bodies become less efficient. Experiments have shown that eye movements can also become skilful, and that a part of the brain, the cerebellum, is stores the memories for these skills. They have also shown that the cerebellum gives us the ability adapt to the ways that our bodies change, and this may be a good way of preserving skill as we get older.\n\nSkilful eye movements are not movements that we notice very much, but they are essential for a range of everyday tasks that allow us to live productively and independently. Reading, which involves moving eyes across text at precisely the right pace is one example, and selecting the right eye movements during driving is another important example in which routines like checking mirrors in sequence and at critical times becomes habitual and automatic. Our work will study eye movement skills in three ways: \n1. We will determine how well the automatic selection and execution of eye movements are preserved across the age span, and how well they can be taught. \n2. Although we know that the cerebellum is important for learning how to execute eye movements, we don't know whether it is also important for selecting the right movements. We will use brain scanning methods to test whether the cerebellum is recruited when we learn to select movements automatically. \n3. We will test these effects in normal people, but it will also be important to do so in a highly skilled population. We plan to use elite cricketers of all ages from childhood through to old age. We will compare their performance to normal people to determine whether involvement in sport improves skill. This group of people are known to have the potential to become highly skilled, so they will be useful for us to test our training methods. We will use technology that allows us to track the eyes to see how highly skilled batsmen select their eye movements and give themselves scope to plan their actions on the basis of the bowlers actions and the path of the ball. We will then train exactly the same skills in novice cricketers and, following training, test their eye movement skills on the field. \n\nAlthough we will test our effects in cricketers, the project will not only be of benefit to the ways in which we train young cricketers, but will also help us to develop methods for training older people to retain and develop important mental and motor eye movement skills so that they are better able to live productively and .","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J017116/1","grantId":"BB/J017116/1","fundValue":"349009","fundStart":"2013-01-07","fundEnd":"2016-07-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Narender  Ramnani","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
