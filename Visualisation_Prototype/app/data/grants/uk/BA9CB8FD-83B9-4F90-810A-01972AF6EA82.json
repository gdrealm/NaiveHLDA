{"id":"BA9CB8FD-83B9-4F90-810A-01972AF6EA82","title":"Inhibitory mechanisms in memory for action","abstractText":"<p>In our every-day life we are surrounded by objects with which we have to interact. Objects, however, have different uses under different circumstances. For instance, one can use a pen to write or stir a drink. Therefore, we require a process which allows us to select the target action to be performed against a field of related, but contextually inappropriate, actions. Selecting the appropriate action for the goal at hand (ie writing a letter) requires the suppression of other potential, but contextually inappropriate, actions (ie stirring a drink) related to an object.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed research will examine the role of inhibitory mechanisms in our ability to control our memory for actions using the retrieval practice paradigm. This paradigm will prompt participants to act out a subset of actions (eg, writing a letter with a pen) but not other related actions (eg, stirring a drink). Memory for all actions will be tested using methods which are sensitive to the presence of inhibition (ie, novel retrieval cues, reaction times). If inhibitory mechanisms are responsible for controlling memory for action memory should be impaired for related actions which were not themselves acted out (eg, stirring a drink).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1761","grantId":"RES-000-22-1761","fundValue":"81227","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jo  Saunders","coPersons":["Irene  Reppa"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
