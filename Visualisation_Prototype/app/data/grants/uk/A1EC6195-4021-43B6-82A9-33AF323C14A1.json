In this research, we aim to investigate how differences between designers influence the quality of designers' judgement, and how the quality of judgement influences installation safety. In the main phase of the research, we will assess individual differences between designers, quality of designers' judgements, and other factors in a sample of over 300 designers. We will assess factors that indicate designers' judgement quality (memory lapses, risky decision-taking). We will do this by asking designers to complete brief assessments several times per day over four periods of one working week. Designers will make these assessments on palmtop computers. We expect to gain over 15,000 such assessments. In this way, the indicator of judgement quality between designers takes into account periodic variations in performance, rather than relying on a single-shot measurement that could be inaccurate.We will then relate indicators of judgement quality, and designers' individual differences, to the safety of the designs they were working on during the period of the study.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D04863X/1","grantId":"EP/D04863X/1","fundValue":"209807","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A checklist developed from research done on D04863X and EP/F02942X/1 and other research with colleagues at the Health and Safety Laboratory. The checklist has been included in a toolkit for managing common health problems in the workplace funded by the Health and Safety Executive. The toolkit is under development.\n.\n\nBeneficiaries: Managers, workers\n\nContribution Method: The research provided some of the main principles regarding effective problem-solving in work environments. Subsequent research found these principles were applicable to all problems, not just problems encountered by design engineers, and added a few additional principles on taking effective breaks from problems. This and related research indicated that successful problem-solving contributes to well-being as well as work performance and innovation.\n\nThe research has contributed to multilevel research design.\n\nThe methodological impact has been through developing knowledge of experience sampling and multilevel design and analysis of experience sampling data in organisational contexts. The knowledge is summarised in a number of places, but most especially in the book 'A Day in the Life of a Happy Worker' edited by Bakker and Daniels.\n\nBeneficiaries: Work and organisational psychologists, management and business researchers\n\nContribution Method: Extending knowledge of conducting advanced field research methods.\n\nThe work contributes to knowledge of the fluid nature of job design, and how the day to day experience of job characteristics influences important outcomes like mood, fatigue, cognitive performance and safety.\n\nThe work contributes to knowledge concerning the fluid nature of job design, and how day-to-day variation in the experience of job characteristics influences important outcomes., The research has indicated how safety-related attitudes modify the impact of time pressures on safety-related decisions in engineering design teams and how designers reactions and agency in job autonomy and support influences their mood, fatigue and cognitive performance,.\n\nBeneficiaries: Work and organisational psychologists, business and management researchers\n\nContribution Method: Advancing knowledge of the fluid nature of job design, how hourly time pressures and safety attitudes interact to predict individual and team level safety outcomes, how designers' agency in using their characteristics of their work influences their mood, energy levels and cognitive performance, how levels of fatigue and cognitive performance influence levels of designer problem-solving.

The key findings indicate that:\n\n\n\n1) Stakeholders in industry believe that designer error and safe decision making is influenced by designer competency levels, barriers to communication, attitudes to safety and time and budgetary restraints prevailing in industry.\n\n\n\n2) Designers who seek advice from others on how to solve problems report feeling less anxious a few hours after encountering problems that those designers who do not.\n\n\n\n3) Designers put a lot of effort into changing their work activities and schedules to solve problems are less anxious, less fatigued and able to concentrate better a few hours after encountering problems that those who do not.\n\n\n\n4) When problems are perceived by designers to affect their work performance, designers report feeling more anxious and less motivated.\n\n\n\n5) Hourly fatigue impedes problem-solving efforts a few hours later, but impaired levels of hourly concentration and memory performance seem to motivate problem-solving a few hours later.\n\n\n\n6) Designers who feel their team members have a positive attitude to safety are more likely to take risky design decisions if under time pressure than designers who are less confident in team membersâ€™ attitudes to safety.\n\n\n\n7) Compared to other design teams, design teams are more likely to include risky design features in their designs if the team tends to believe they have a positive attitude to safety and the team was under time pressure during the design project.\n\n\n\nMore generally, this research indicates that workers, in this case design engineers, are active in usng the resources embedded in the design of their work, in solving problems, and the research contributes to debates concerning how workers shape the content of their own jobs on a day-to-day basis. One of the organisations involved in this research developed a training programme to enhance safety in design for their designers. It was rolled out across several sites, multiple design teams, and over 140 designers to our knowledge. In conjunction with findings from another EPSRC funded project (EP/F02942X/1), the principal investigator developed a training programme for design engineers that ran over two years at Loughborogh University that was concerned with effective and innovative design decision making. The findings of this research together with subsequent research with colleagues at the Health and Safety Laboratory in Buxton led to the development of a simple problem-solving checklist for use in organisations that is currently part of a took-kit for managing common health problems in the workplace - the development of this toolkit has been funded by the Health and Safety Executive, and it is undergoing feasibility testing. The principal investigator is one of the project team funded by the Health and Safety Executive.\n\n\n\nThe findings from this and a related project (EP/F02942X/1), especially in relation to worker agency in shaping the content of work, informed an on-line seminar presentation published through Henry Stuart Talks.\n\n\n\nOther exploitation routes concern changes in job design to improve team working, collective problem-solving, knowledge sharing, delegated authority to make decision and solve problems, and management training to improve job design and attitudes to safety in time pressured environments.

An overall summary report of has been disseminated to all industrial collaborators. \n\n\n\nOne of the researchers presented results from the project to design engineers working in Calgary, Canada at an AMEC internal safety symposium. Findings and recommendations from the research were also presented at two industry seminars held in Aberdeen and London. A four-page summary of the major findings and recommendations has been produced and distributed to research participants. This four-page summary has also been sent for distribution to the Off-shore Directorate, Health and Safety Executive and the Human Factors Division of the Office of Rail Regulation.\n\n\n\nOne of the researchers on the project (Beesley) worked for AMEC in Calgary on a short-term assignment from January to May 2008, whilst retaining employment at Loughborough. Subsequently, Beesley has returned to industry full time as a safety consultant.\n\n\n\nOther exploitation routes concern changes in job design to improve team working, collective problem-solving, knowledge sharing, delegated authority to make decision and solve problems, and management training to improve job design and attitudes to safety in time pressured environments.\n\n\n\nThe project involved the use of personal digital assistants to collect data from design engineers, four times per day, five days per week, for up to four weeks during design projects, as well as experts' ratings of the designs produced by design teams. Collecting data in this novel has increased knowledge and capability of collecting electronic data in real time, and has fed into a co-edited book by the principal investigator and Arnold Bakker (Erasmus University).
