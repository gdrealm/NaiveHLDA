{"id":"E8DE8663-CDD5-4BE7-80BE-E59A409659D0","title":"A National Centre for Protein Kinase Profiling","abstractText":"Kinases are the largest family of enzymes present in human beings. They are involved in co-ordinating almost all the body s functions and their deregulation is a cause or consequence of many diseases. For this reason, kinases have become the major drug targets of the 21st Century. Ten drugs that prevent particular kinases from working have been approved for clinical use and have had a huge impact on the treatment of cancer, including one drug that essentially cures a form of leukaemia that previously was rapidly fatal. The purpose of this application is to obtain funding to maintain and improve a novel service that has been set up by the MRC Unit that I direct and which has proved to be of great value in speeding up the development of drugs in this area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_EX_G0800765","grantId":"MC_EX_G0800765","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Cohen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
