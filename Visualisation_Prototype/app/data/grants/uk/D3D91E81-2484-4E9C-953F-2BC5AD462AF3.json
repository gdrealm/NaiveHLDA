We aim to measure black hole masses, accretion rates, accretion disk temperature-radius profiles and luminosity distances, kinematics and ionisation structure of broad emission line regions, size and radial structure of dusty tori.\n Mineral Clouds in Alien Atmospheres - we will model dust formation in cool atmospheres including processes driven by dust-dust collisions such as coagulation and charging, resolving the grain size distribution and gas-phase chemistry throughout the atmosphere, to understand the observable spectral signatures along the evolutionary sequences of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K001515/1","grantId":"ST/K001515/1","fundValue":"37501","fundStart":"2012-03-31","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Our astrophysics research is published in open access refereed journals from which it is available for use by any and all interested parties.
