Radiation from a central dipolar source was to be synchronously coupled to a magneto-inductive wave propagating in a circular arrangement of coupled L-C loop resonators. The loop resonators themselves were to provide signal amplification through their high Q-factor and coupling. Two techniques were to be investigated to increase signals further: parametric amplification, and the use of cryogenic elements. Application of the detection system to magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy and the location of RF signal sources were to be studied.\n\nA literature survey carried out at the start of the project highlighted the similarity of the magneto-inductive ring detector to a conventional birdcage RF detector, and allowed important judgements to be made in planning project targets. Firstly, the excellent detection uniformity offered by a birdcage suggested that it would be difficult to use any similar coil arrangement to determine the position of a RF source unambiguously, and this aim was discarded. Secondly, the known reduction in Q-factor caused by loading a cryogenic birdcage coil with tissue implied that there would be little advantage in developing a refrigerated system, since increases in performance in the coil itself would be lost in practical use, and this aim was therefore also abandoned. Instead, efforts were concentrated on the challenging task of demonstrating a parametrically amplified system, which can in principle overcome the loading due to the patient, an extremely important advantage in a detector for MRI signals.\n\nAfter development of the underlying theory of magneto-inductive ring resonators in collaboration with researchers at Osnabruck University, several passive detection systems of gradually increasing size were demonstrated, using magnetically-coupled L-C resonators based on printed circuit board inductors and surface mount capacitors. These systems included flexible rings with a specially designed link mechanism that could hold the coupling coefficient between adjacent elements constant as the ring was flexed. The shapes and numbers of resonant elements were optimised and high-Q passive systems were demonstrated.\n\nParametrically amplified systems were then investigated, starting with two-frequency amplifiers and then moving on towards three-frequency amplifiers. In the latter case, a novel configuration based on a coupled pump and signal resonators and uncoupled idlers was demonstrated. Using this approach, signal gains of 27 dB at 63.8 Mhz (the frequency of 1H MRI in a 1.5 T magnetic field) were achieved in the laboratory, in a system with full quadrature detection. The effect of amplification in recovering the Q-factor of a loaded system was clearly demonstrated.\n\nWork on parametric amplification of magnetic resonance signals is on-going, in collaboration with St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. Amplifiers are being trialled in a 1.5T GE Signa clinical scanner. The main difficulty identified is the need to decouple the coil during RF transmission. A number of approaches are being tried including varactor detuning and PIN diode decoupling. The latter has already been successful for fixed coils and varactor-tuned coils. At present amplification obtained using parametric coils is weak and images are noisy, mainly due to pickup on the additional cable runs required. However, good progress is now being made in eliminating noise sources.\n\nOther possible applications of magneto-inductive devices in MRI systems including MR-safe cables for in-vivo internal imaging were also studied, and patient-safe magneto inductive cable for operation at 63.8 MHz frequency was developed, in both hybrid form (using bulk components and co-axial cable) and thin-film form (using entirely printed components). More advanced forms of detector have subsequently received funding for further development from the Wellcome Trust Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
