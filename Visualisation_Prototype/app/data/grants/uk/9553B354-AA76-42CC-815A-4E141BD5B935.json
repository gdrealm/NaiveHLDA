{"id":"9553B354-AA76-42CC-815A-4E141BD5B935","title":"Animal Decision-Making: Sequential Versus Simultaneous Choice","abstractText":"We are building a theory of decision-making, and to do this we investigate how birds take decisions. In behavioural science a decision is not assumed to result from thoughtful deliberation but refers to what organisms do when several actions are possible. In humans, introspection can create the perception (often inaccurate) that one's own decisions are driven by evaluation of each alternative, and as a consequence people often assume that animals also choose by evaluating alternatives. If this were true, choosing would take information-processing effort and time: more options, more time. For instance, if a lion sees a zebra, it may start a chase, but if it sees both a zebra and a wildebeest, it would evaluate their relative merits. If it chooses the zebra, it would have taken longer to start the chase. The paradox of choice, for instance, states that more options make choice more difficult. We found that the opposite is true in starlings: they take longer to take a lonely alternative than when they take the same alternative in a choice situation. In our experiments the times taken to take each option when faced alone predict very accurately how long it takes when it takes it out of a choice, and the shortening of time in choices results from the way the model works. Further, the time to accept each option when it is met alone depends not only on its absolute properties, but also on the benefit it gives relative to the context. To deal with all these findings, we used ideas originating in biology, economics and psychology to propose the Sequential Choice Model or SCM for short. SCM postulates that the mechanisms used by birds to choose between options are the same they use when facing each option alone. SCM incorporates the idea that these mechanisms evolved as adaptations to environments in which meeting different options simultaneously is rare, but meeting them sequentially is common. Thus, there are no special adaptations for simultaneous choices, but the time to chase each alternative is precisely tuned to exploit the benefits it gives compared with the opportunities in the whole environment. The SCM very effectively explained and predicted (post-hoc) the results in our original experiments, but the real value of a theoretical model is when it works for situations different from those that led to its inception. We propose to test SCM in choice problems that have never been studied from this perspective and to see if we still observe the same predictive precision including the shortening of decision times in choices. We'll use experiments that require cognition that might be expected to be time consuming. In one of them, a blue light is shown for a time lasting between 0 and 30 s, and after that either a red or a green light shows (In separate trials). If it is red, after the bird pecks the key it gets food after waiting 15 s, but if it is green the waiting time is 30 s minus the time the blue light had been on. Thus, if blue lasted 10 s, then green's waiting is 20 s, but if blue lasted 25 s, then green's waiting is 5 s. We measure how long the starling takes to peck in both red and green no-choice trials. On other (choice) trials, after the blue light goes off both red and green show, and we look at which one the bird chooses and how long it takes. To minimise waiting for food, birds should choose red if blue lasted less than 15 s and green if it lasted longer, but they don't do exactly this. SCM predicts what they will do using the times to peck red or green in no-choice trials, and it also predicts how long it will take to peck either: it should take less in choice than in no-choice trials. Since choice involves consulting the memory for the duration of blue one might expect choice to take extra time, but SCM predicts the opposite. If the SCM predictions are met, this would be evidence that it applies to very different situations from those in which it originated, and hence that it is a very valuable model.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G007144/1","grantId":"BB/G007144/1","fundValue":"478178","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alex  Kacelnik","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" The main objective of this project was to contrast two views of how the brain deals with choices using a model species, the starling. These two views differ in whether choices are modelled as if they involved cognitive deliberation and specialised mechanisms, or if instead when several options are present individuals deploy the same mechanisms they use when facing only one, without any comparison at the time of choosing. \n\nFrom an adaptive perspective, cognitive processes dedicated to solve specific kinds of problems should evolve if and when those problems are prevalent in the species' natural circumstances. However, in most ecological situations simultaneous choices are rare, with animals more often facing the decision of whether to pursue a potential food item or instead continuing searching in the environment. Thus, we expect choosing between a single option and its background rather than between simultaneous targets to be more influential in the design of choice behaviour. This ecological argument led to the Sequential Choice Model (SCM) which contrasts with the more conventional idea that choice involves deliberation effort and consequently time. The conventional notion of targets competing for the preference of the agent is captured in the Tug-of-War model, that implies that each option present in a choice set pulls the attention of the chooser in its direction. This idea leads to the Paradox of Choice, which postulates that it takes more effort and time to act when facing more possibilities, against the intuition that finding an acceptable solution should be easier and faster when there are more options in the set. The SCM led to several different expectations: (i) that in encounters with a single option, time to act would be determined by the value of that option relative to the average background opportunities; (ii) that the time to act towards different options when encountered one at a time would be predictive of the relative preferences between them if encountered simultaneously; (iii) that, in the ansence of deliberation time, the latency to act towards each individual option should not be longer when other options are present, and if anything should be shorter, due to cross-censoring between the alternatives.\n\nWe tested these ideas in multiple experimental and theoretical studies, (see publications). In a variety of experimental protocols we found strong support for predictions i and ii. Regarding the 3rd prediction, we never detected a deliberation time, but neither could convincingly establish whether the time to act is equal or shorter (as predicted by SCM) in the presence of additional options.\n\nOur research provides an endorsement to the search for parsimony in animal cognition models, establishing wiehter a small set of simple to implement mechanisms can account for apparently sophisticated behaviour. More generally, iy, it shows that it is possible to make precise quantitative predictions about animal behaviour with models that combine functional insights with realistic psychological mechanisms. We explored theories of animal choice. There is no reason to believe that our results (the endorsement of a simple competitive cognitive process rather than an involved comparison mechanism of relative evaluation) is limited to our study animal, and even to non-human animals. The outcome of our work may be applied to consumer behaviour or to facilitate choice in professional contexts where actions need to be fast. This, however, would require testing in humans.
