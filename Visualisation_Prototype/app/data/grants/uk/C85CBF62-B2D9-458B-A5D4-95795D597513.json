It not replaces only more and more so far 'wired' network installations but also opens new dimensions in the availability of high network connectivity in various scenarios. In many application areas the integration of wireless communication in particular together with autonomous sensing devices leads to an improved quality of service due to the immediate availability of measurements and data about the current mode of operation. The goal of this proposal is to investigate different approaches that can improve the performance of ad hoc networks. A wireless ad hoc network consists of several transceivers (nodes) located in the plane, communicating by radio. Unlike wired networks, in which the link topology is fixed at the time the network is deployed, wireless ad-hoc networks have no fixed underlying topology. In addition, the relational disposition of wireless nodes is constantly changing. The temporary physical topology of the network is determined by the distribution of the wireless nodes, as well as the transmission range of each node. The ranges determine a directed communication graph, in which the nodes correspond to the transceivers and the edges correspond to the communication links.\nTopology control is to allow each node in the network to adjust its transmitting power so that a good network topology can be formed. There are many possible metrics to measure the efficiency of the constructed topology. To increase the longevity of such networks, an important requirement of topology control algorithms is to achieve the desired topology by using minimum energy consumption. To speed up the performance of routing algorithm we aim to produce a communication graph of bounded diameter and low interference levels. On the other hand, from the user's perspective, for already determined network topology, we want to identify the ``important'' places in the network in terms of robustness (failure of some node may lead to disconnected network), energy efficiency (some parts of network might be wasteful\nin terms of energy), and scheduling (nodes may have many common neighbors which causes many interferences).\nThe main goal of this proposal is to design efficient solutions for topology construction of wireless ad hoc networks and to recognize important topology parts, taking into account various parameters altogether: energy, transport, schedule length, lifetime, hop-diameter and interference levels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K022601/1","grantId":"EP/K022601/1","fundValue":"35622","fundStart":"2013-08-14","fundEnd":"2014-08-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The results here were taken up as part of work in the Cambridge Center for Smart Infrastructure&amp;Construction Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software) Economic","person":"Jon  Crowcroft","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" Found a new way to minimise energy use for routing messages in ad hoc radio systems Optimising sensor systems which use multihop radio nets to report values is becoming more and more common in smart homes and smart cities-- techniques for optimising power use are important practically.
