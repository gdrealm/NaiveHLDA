We wish to analyze the critical copying machines - known as 'RNA polymerases' - in their natural surroundings. During the last fifty years, techniques have been developed to purify these copying machines from our cells, and we now have detailed maps both of their contents and structure. We also know they are part of a larger production line that carries out additional functions; for example, the major copying machine - polymerase II - is found with other machines that work on the RNA copies as they are made. We have shown that a number of these production lines are, in turn, organized into still-larger 'factories'. [We define a factory as a site containing at least two RNA polymerases copying different pieces of DNA, and the reason for having all factories is the same (whether they make cars, jam, or RNA) - to enhance production by concentrating relevant machines and raw materials in one place.] Unfortunately, these factories are so tightly bound to the substructure in the cell that hitherto they have been impossible to isolate (so we know little about their contents); fortunately, we have just developed a method that allows us to release them from the substructure (we use the enzymes the cell uses naturally when it commits suicide!), and this has enabled us to go on to partially purify the factories free of many other cellular components. We now want to exploit this method, and a related one for assaying which genes are being copied in the factories; we want to catalogue some of their contents using various techniques (including sequencing to determine DNA and RNA content, and light microscopy to map locations).\n \nWe are especially interested in comparing factories before and after they start copying particular sets of genes. To this end, we will use two natural agents that rapidly switch on copying of selected genes - tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFb). [TNFa orchestrates our inflammatory response when our body becomes infected with microbes; it binds to the cell membrane and sends a messenger - NFkappaB - into the nucleus to switch on the copying of the genes that encode protective proteins. If the infection is mild, the system produces proteins able to fight it. But if severe, the cell may choose to commit suicide by activating those enzymes described above - so taking the infecting microbes with it to the grave. Clearly, the system has to make the right decision! TGFb sends a different messenger into the nucleus to switch on a different set of genes. As these genes control many cell functions involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, TGFb plays important roles in diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.] As both agents act so rapidly, we will add them to cells obtained from normal umbilical veins, switch on different groups of genes, purify the factories after 10-480 min, and compare their contents with those from untreated cells.\n\nWe also have a more ambitious aim. Human chromosomes are arguably the largest and most important biomolecules, and many aspects of their structure - and how structure affects function - remain obscure. This has practical consequences: for example, we cannot yet predict how active a gene will be when inserted into a new location, and this obviously limits the development of successful gene therapies. As a result, major questions of our age are: what is the 3D structure of the human chromosome, and how does that structure affect function? We suggest that the clustering of active genes into factories is one of the major architectural motifs; we hope this analysis will help prove or disprove whether this is so.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K010867/1","grantId":"MR/K010867/1","fundValue":"435572","fundStart":"2013-06-15","fundEnd":"2016-06-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Cook","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
