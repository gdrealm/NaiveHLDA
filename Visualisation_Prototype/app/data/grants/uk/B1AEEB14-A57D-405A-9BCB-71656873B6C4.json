{"id":"B1AEEB14-A57D-405A-9BCB-71656873B6C4","title":"HIV and Religion: Disclosure and the Church","abstractText":"<p>There is an increasing recognition by policy makers of the importance of engaging faith communities in HIV discourses. The global HIV crisis disproportionately affects Africans in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Diaspora.&nbsp;In England, Africans are the largest group affected by heterosexually contracted HIV. Zimbabweans are most prominent in this group. Christian Churches in Zimbabwe, as in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, play a leading role in support, care and anti-stigma initiatives. In so doing, they are taking on a more robust role than their counterparts in England. What is the capacity of faith/ordained leaders to negotiate the meanings brought by HIV into an environment where sin, sexuality, gender and secrets are biblically curved?</p> \n<p>The proposed study investigates the role of the Church in Manicaland, Zimbabwe, in the construction of meanings regarding the disclosure of the presence of HIV within the Church.&nbsp;Using qualitative methods it maps the capacity of ordained members to respond to the needs of those living with HIV, given the tensions regarding rights to privacy and public health. The study also explores how HIV-positive&nbsp;Christians negotiate disclosure of their HIV status in the context of their gendered roles. As Zimbabweans increasingly live trans-national family lives within the British African population profile, understanding care practices offered by faith leaders in relation to issues of disclosure and the risks of onward transmission in their home country would help inform the evidence base to underpin development of strategies in Zimbabwe and England.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1919","grantId":"RES-000-22-1919","fundValue":"76010","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martha Judith Chinouya","coPersons":["Eileen  O'Keefe"],"organisation":"London Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
