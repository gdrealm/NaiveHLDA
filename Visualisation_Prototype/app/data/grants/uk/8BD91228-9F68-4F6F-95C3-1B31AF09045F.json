{"id":"8BD91228-9F68-4F6F-95C3-1B31AF09045F","title":"Advancement of Castings in the Nuclear Supply Chain","abstractText":"Sheffield Forgemasters International Ltd (SFIL) is a World leader in the production of cast recirculation pump casings\n(RPC) for nuclear power stations, and this application is closely aligned with the 'Materials and Modelling' and 'Advanced\nManufacturing &amp; Construction' technical themes. SFIL wants to enter the Eastern European market for civil nuclear power\nstation components by offering a cast solution for the RPC to replace the current forged design. Successful qualification of\na cast design could result in orders of up to 12 castings per year and would establish a presence in the Eastern European\nsupply chain. The steel grades specified are new to the company, and a cast design for the RPC in these reactors is a\nmajor technical challenge due to the large section sizes and current unknowns regarding the physical metallurgy of the\ncandidate alloys specified. There are questions concerning the castability of the candidate alloys, the optimum casting\nmethods that should be employed, the mechanical properties that can be achieved, welding procedures and the limits on\ndetectability of the non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques. A collaborative R&amp;D project with The Welding Institute (TWI)\nand The University of Sheffield is proposed that will address these issues and deliver a proven cast RPC solution for this\nnew market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L504701/1","grantId":"EP/L504701/1","fundValue":"179963","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"E.J.
