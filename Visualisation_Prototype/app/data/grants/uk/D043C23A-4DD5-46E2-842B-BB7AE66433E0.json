These are examples only of the considerable achievements in GW data analysis.\n\nWe advanced our fundamental research on suspension systems/materials and dielectric coatings relevant to the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors and their enhancements and strategically critical for any future generation of detectors;\n\n- This included: provision of full support for two monolithic suspension installations at LIGO Livingston site and support for installations at the Hanford site; demonstration of the use of an AC discharge technique to mitigate charge applied to dielectric samples; Studies of the mechanical losses associated with non-oxide amorphous materials for use in dielectric coatings. Identifying promising new materials ; measurements of the loss of silicon cantilevers with micro-structured surfaces showing micro-structuring improved the loss of the surface; advances in the development of techniques for jointing surfaces with high strength and vacuum compatibilitiy\n\nOur research enabled experimental demonstration of advanced interferometry techniques, topologies and the use of non-classical light for upgrading Advanced LIGO and for application to future generations of gravitational wave detectors;\n\n- This included demonstration of interferometry with waveguide coatings; tests of the use of non-Gaussian (LG33) beams in a suspended 10m cavity. Demonstration of optical springs in a coupled 3-mirror cavity using a 100g mirror Our findings are taken forward by (a) in-field academic routes to operate efficiently current GW detectors and to influence the design and construction of future detectors (b) by influencing academics in related fields in precision measurement where our technologies can improve measurement capabilities (c) in spinoffs such as using data analysis techniques to improve commercial products in the field of image analysis (healthcare, defense); using bonding techniques to allow industrial fabrication of high power compound optics; using silicon-based mems for precision gravity imaging (with security and energy applications) amongst other routes.
