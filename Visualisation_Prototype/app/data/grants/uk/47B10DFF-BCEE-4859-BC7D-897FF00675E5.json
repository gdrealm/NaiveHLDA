This project aims to establish whether these newmanufacturing processes represent a means of manufacturing precise protein calibrationstandard products offering advantages in terms of product specification, stability, processflexibility, economics and scaling. This will find application in enabling first-in-classquantitative immunoassays and standards for mass spectrometry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I500200/1","grantId":"EP/I500200/1","fundValue":"101622","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Benjamin  Davis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
