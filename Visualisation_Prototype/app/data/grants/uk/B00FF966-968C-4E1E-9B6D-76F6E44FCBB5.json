A comparative test.","abstractText":"<p>A social gradient in health is perhaps the most robust and consistent finding in epidemiology. However, not everyone in stressful or deprived circumstances suffers ill-health. An individualâ€™s beliefs and value systems will influence his/her reaction to social situations and this explanatory category has been neglected in research. Some national studies have found a correlation between individual religious involvement and poor health, and religious involvement now needs to be considered in the context of social deprivation and health. </p>\n\n<p>This project tests whether, and under what circumstances, religious involvement enables individuals to maintain better health than would be expected on the basis of their socio-economic conditions, behaviour and national context. Specific research questions are: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Whether religious involvement is a source of resilience protecting individuals against the adverse health consequences of socio-economic deprivation.&nbsp;</li>\n\n <li>Whether the relationship between religious involvement and health varies between countries. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research will undertake secondary analysis of three existing surveys covering all 27 member states of the European Union plus additional countries including Russia and Turkey. Each survey has a nationally representative sample and includes a variety of measures of religious involvement and health. Statistical methods will include multivariate regression and multilevel modelling.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2429","grantId":"RES-000-22-2429","fundValue":"74176","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Amanda Claire Nicholson","coPersons":["Richard  Rose","Martin  Bobak"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
