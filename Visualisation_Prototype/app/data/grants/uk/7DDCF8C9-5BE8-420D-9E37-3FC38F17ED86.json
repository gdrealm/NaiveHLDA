The research program is entitled 'The production and application of Japanese alloys and patination' and will run from May 2007- April 2010. \\nIn this application we seek funding to complete research in four areas of the overall fellowship program. This research was outlined in the original fellowship application and is central to the overall research program. Funding from the AHRC will ensure that the research is carried out to the highest quality. \\nThe Western tradition of metal patination and colouring is based on the use of a small range of metals and alloys which are coloured by the application of a wide range of patination solutions. In contrast to this, Japanese metalworkers developed a wide range of irogane alloys which are coloured with a single patination solution (the niiro chakushoku eki or boiling colour patination solution). This approach allows different alloys to be combined in one piece and patinated, producing a multi-coloured piece of metalwork.\\n\\nThis study will examine in detail:\\n1. Pre-patination treatment of alloys with daikon radish.\\n2. Composition of solution ingredients and their effect on patination colour.\\n3. The use of protective coatings on niiro patinated surfaces.\\n4. Trial of the materials and techniques with non-expert metalworkers\\n\\nWork in the previous part of this project has demonstrated that the use of daikon improves the patination of silver alloys. In order to produce a consistent process it is necessary to determine exactly what the radish treatment is achieving.\\n\\nThe research will ask:\\nWhat are the active compounds in the daikon radish?\\nCan we achieve a similar effect with laboratory chemicals?\\n\\nThe patination process is not yet optimised, especially with respect to some of the vital secondary ingredients. \\n\\nThe research will ask:\\nWhat is the effect of secondary ingredients on patination colour?\\n\\nIt is not known how effective are coatings used for the preservation of colour and for protection from handling and corrosion, which is of particular importance for commercial applications.\\n\\nThe research will examine the change in colour over time and the use of protective coatings:\\nDo patinated colours change with time?\\nDo waxes and lacquers work and if so what are they preventing? \\nAre there new technologies which provide acceptable alternatives?\\n\\nThe applicant works with these materials and processes in his own studio work and evaluates their potential through his practice. It is important to also carry out a trial with a group of non-expert metalworkers to further evaluate practical application of the materials and processes.\\n\\nThe research will ask:\\nCan these materials and processes be used by a group of non-experts?\\n\\nA limited number of researchers have published work on pre-patination surface treatments and the composition of the niiro solution. However, a full understanding of the process has still to be achieved. This study will be the first to focus on coatings for irogane alloys.\\n\\nThe research will be located at Sheffield Hallam University using the facilities and expertise of the Art and Design Research Centre (ADRC), the Materials and Engineering Research Institute (MERI) and the Biomedical Research Institute (BMRI). \\nPapers will be submitted to an academic journal and an international conference. The research will also be disseminated through lectures and workshops. The University website will be utilized for the publication of papers, exhibited works etc. Commercial collaborators will be sought through SHU to exploit any materials or processes that are developed.\\nThis project is a fundamental part of the larger research programme as surface cleaning, control of the niiro solution, and protection of the patinated surfaces are all crucial to the successful control and application of the materials and processes in studio work or in industrial applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H020624/1","grantId":"AH/H020624/1","fundValue":"24347","fundStart":"2009-11-16","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Coilin  O'Dubhghaill","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":" The research has allowed us to significantly advance knowledge of technical issues relating to niiro patination and irogane alloys and to disseminate the results widely.\n\n\n\nPre-patination treatment of alloys with daikon radish. Our earlier work confirmed that the use of daikon radish as a pre-patination treatment reduced the formation of chlorides in the niiro solution. We have tested extracts from daikon radish on cu/ag alloys to evaluate their potential as inhibitors to the formation of chlorides but have not yet achieved conclusive results. Research is ongoing to determine the active compounds and to achieve a similar effect with laboratory chemicals.\n\n\n\nComposition of solution ingredients and their effect on patination colour. We have tested the effect of secondary ingredients on the niiro solution such as alum, salt and citric acid and characterised the resulting patina. In particular the Cl level was found to be crucial to the formation of strong and desirable colours. This research is central to our development of a reliable synthetic niiro solution.\n\n\n\nThe use of protective coatings on niiro patinated surfaces. We have produced samples to compare a range of surface coatings on irogane alloys. The surface coatings include traditional materials and non-traditional coatings. These samples will be tested for change as part of a long-term study into the effect of protective coatings. This information is important for commercialisation of the processes, and for preservation and restoration of historical metalwork.\n\n\n\nTrial of the materials and techniques with non-expert metalworkers. We recruited three craftspeople to conduct tests with the irogane alloys and niiro patination. Although experts in metalcraft, they have not used the irogane alloys and niiro patination process. The makers were selected for their interest in using the materials in non-traditional and innovative ways. This work was exhibited as part of an exhibition of contemporary research in metalwork and jewellery in Sheffield in 2011.\n\n\n\nThe research has been disseminated to a wide audience through conference papers, articles, lectures and exhibitions of studio work.\n\n\n\nWe extended the project to look at three other areas: electrolytic niiro patination, laser colouring of irogane alloys and the influence of cleaning during patination treatment. It was found that both laser colouring and electrolytic patination did not produce better colours or improve reliability. Although interesting results were achieved, including some new colours, further work would be needed to fully understand the behaviour of the alloys in these processes if they were to be optimized for use by craftspeople. Cleaning during the patination process was found to produce brighter patina colours through removal of large crystals and smearing of the oxide layer.
