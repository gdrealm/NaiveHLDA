Severe malaria is caused by both the aggregation of red blood cells infected by the parasite into rosettes and via cytoadherence, the attachment of red blood cells to the cells of the host, lining the blood vessels. Rosette formation and cytoadherence both prevent proper transport of oxygen by the red blood cells around the capilaries of the brain and causes blockages, damaging the brain, and this is often fatal. This project will identify the simplest fragments, from a novel semi-synthetic library of negatively charged carbohydrates, that are able to disrupt rosetting and cytoadherence while minimising/eliminating any potential side-effects. This will provide information concerning the minimum structures required, allowing cheap, chemical synthesis of the molecules to be undertaken. This project will ultimatley lead to the development of new pharmaceutical agents, which are urgently needed, as resistance emerges to the drugs being administered currently.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700852","grantId":"G0700852","fundValue":"464470","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Edwin Alexander Yates","coPersons":["Alexandra  Rowe","Scott  Guimond","Mark Andrew Skidmore"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
