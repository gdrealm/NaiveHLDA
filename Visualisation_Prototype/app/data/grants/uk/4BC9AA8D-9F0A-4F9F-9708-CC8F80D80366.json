{"id":"4BC9AA8D-9F0A-4F9F-9708-CC8F80D80366","title":"Astronomy Observation and Theory Consolidated Grant 2012","abstractText":"This proposal is for a single Consolidated Grant to support the\nmajority of research in Theoretical and Observational Astrophysics at\nthe Institute of Astronomy (IoA) in Cambridge. The new grant subsumes\nresearch activity previously supported by STFC under the three generic\nthemes: &quot;Theory&quot;, &quot;X-ray Astrophysics&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Formation and\nEvolution&quot;.\n\nThe theoretical research profile includes work to understand the\norigin of the Universe itself. Members of the IoA are play a leading\nrole in the European Space Agency Planck mission, and will lead a\ndefinitive determination of the parameters that both define the\ngeometry of the Universe and quantify the age, size, dark matter, dark\nenergy and baryonic content. The research links to one of the key\ngoals in astrophysics: constraining the properties of the dark matter\nand dark energy content of the Universe.\n\nThe Universe today is filled with galaxies, of which our own Milky Way\nis a not atypical example. A full understanding of galaxy formation\nand evolution requires multiple lines of attack. Observations of the\nresolved stellar populations in the Milky Way and its Local Group\ncompanions provide a detailed fossil record of the dynamical\nassemblies of the galaxies, the formation of stars, and the buildup of\nheavy elements over a wide range of mass scales and initial\nconditions. At the other end of the scale, observations of distant\ngalaxies spanning lookback times of up to 12 Gyr provide direct\nmeasurements of the evolution of galaxy populations and the buildup of\nstars and metals with cosmic time. Finally, measurements of the\nlarge-scale star formation and abundance properties of nearby galaxies\nform a vital astrophysical bridge between the studies of nearby\nresolved stellar populations and the distant high-redshift\ninvestigations, by allowing us to characterise the evolutionary\nproperties of the Hubble sequence and the complex &quot;gastrophysical&quot;\nprocesses that regulate the accretion of gas and the formation of\nstars in galaxies.\n\nIt is now recognised that there is an intimate link between the\nevolution of galaxies and the origin and properties of super-massive\nblack holes, which reside at the centre of the Milky Way and other\ngalaxies. The regions close to black holes allow the exploration of\nphysics at the extremes. The formation and properties of super-massive\nblack holes and their relation to the galaxies in which they reside is\na research theme that involves theory, X-ray astrophysics and\nobservational programmes in the grant. The X-ray based research will\nmeasure the spin of both the super-massive black holes, which power\nthe enormous energy emissions from quasars, and the stellar-mass black\nholes in binary star systems. This work, based on spectroscopy of\nrelativistically-broadened iron lines, will also provide insights into\nthe accretion phenomena that power the systems.\n\nWithin galaxies, the grant focuses on star formation, from the giant\nmolecular clouds which give birth to stars, down to the more detailed\ninvestigations of the processes that lead to the formation of stars\nand star clusters within these molecular clouds. The investigations\nwill combine state-of-the-art numerical simulations with analytical\ntheory and a new set of multi-wavelength observations of nearby\ngalaxies being obtained with the Herschel and Spitzer space\nobservatories under IoA leadership.\n\nThe quest to study planetary systems around stars and their formation\nis another key goal. Research activity in the grant extends from\nsearches for the elusive brown-dwarf companions to normal hot stars\nthrough to theoretical work that concentrates on the properties of\ndebris discs, discs of asteroids, cometary objects, and dust\nsurrounding stars. A feature of the research is the investigation of\ndebris discs surrounding both stars on the main sequence (where they\nspend the majority of their lives) and in the final stages of their\nevolution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K000985/1","grantId":"ST/K000985/1","fundValue":"2449550","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  HewettAndrew  Fabian","coPersons":["Robert C  Kennicutt","Anthony  Challinor","Richard Gerard McMahon","C  Clarke","George  Efstathiou","Gerard  Gilmore","Martin  Haehnelt","Max  Pettini","W  Evans"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
