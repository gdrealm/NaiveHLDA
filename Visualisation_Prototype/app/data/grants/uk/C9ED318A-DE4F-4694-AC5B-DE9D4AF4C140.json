These receptors need to be tightly controlled. The addition of small tags called ubiquitin onto these receptors causes their removal. \n\nHerpesviruses have devised ingenious ways of adding ubiquitin tags to important cell surface receptors, leading to the receptors’ removal. Viruses are cunning and stole this idea from our own cells. This led to the discovery of a new family of genes –called the MARCH family. We found that MARCHs play an important role in regulating receptors of our immune system. \n\nOur preliminary evidence suggests that MARCH proteins control immune cell activity to ensure that cells are neither over- nor under-active. We will use modern molecular techniques to find out how MARCH proteins control cell surface receptors.\n\nThis will be important for learning about (i) how immune cells work (ii) whether MARCH proteins will be good drug targets to prevent immune-mediated disease and (iii) whether they allow cells to escape the immune system and develop into cancers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600823","grantId":"G0600823","fundValue":"292701","fundStart":"2007-03-03","fundEnd":"2010-03-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Lehner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
