{"id":"8DA550EF-3E0A-4A4B-8C0D-60EE58A39AE5","title":"The operatic canon","abstractText":"Everybody knows that what is often described as 'classical' music is old, and getting older. More than twenty years ago, the problem was summed up in the title of a well-known study by a philosopher working in the field of music history: The imaginary museum of musical works (Goehr 1992). But Goehr's thesis, which depends on the idea that, at a given moment, composers and listeners alike began to think of music as residing in inviolable 'works', is unable to account at all satisfactorily for the history of opera, where the concept of inviolability (even of the musical work as such) has never had the same importance.\n\nNevertheless, opera is now even more restrictively canonical than concert music: of the 2415 operas produced professionally worldwide in 2012-13, only around 200 enjoyed more than a dozen productions, while the top ten, all more than a century old, boasted almost 7000 between them (Operabase.com). This project addresses the problem of when, where and in what terms opera became focused on canonic repertoires, one that has received remarkably little consideration among scholars: while we now know a lot about how symphonies, sacred works, and string quartets stayed in concert repertoires, little systematic effort has gone into determining the practical or aesthetic pressures shaping long-term opera repertories--issues that are of urgent concern to today's opera industry.\n\nPerhaps the clearest difference between canons in opera and concert music is that opera production has always been more deeply involved with commercial considerations. Historically, even though concerts usually had to break even, far more capital was required before production of a new opera began. On the other hand, during the nineteenth century sales of opera extracts were on a much larger scale, and had much greater potential for profit, than those of symphonic classics; lucrative publishing enterprises came to exert extraordinary control over opera houses and musical periodicals, hence critical discourse, as the century progressed. In the days when such a thing was still possible, opera culture valued the making of profit, and spoke freely and approvingly about it, as was emphatically not the case in concert life.\n\nMusicologists, historians, journalists and others have been slow to discuss this and other differences in part because no over-arching aesthetic evolved around older operas as was the case with older works on the programmes of concerts during the nineteenth century. The researchers in the proposed network, who are not only musicologists, historians and journalists but also economists, cultural theorists, arts administrators and opera directors, will, among other things, seek to demonstrate exactly how the canonic repertoires that emerged in the opera world, as well as the terms in which people thought about them, were separate from those in concert life, stimulated in large part by the ways creative teams used and reshaped ageing works.\n\nThe planned workshops and public debate will be devoted to exploring the roles of these teams and other key figures in opera production and consumption, outlining competing and complementary conceptual and methodological approaches to the subject and comparing tendencies found in different countries and regions within countries. The overall framework of the research will be chronological, ranging from the mid eighteenth century to the present day, but there will be cross-cutting themes: metropolitan vs provincial, geographical spread, contiguous genres such as musical theatre, the influence of performers, and what all this means for the opera industry now. With academic contributors from various countries and traditions (individual researchers and collaborative teams, acknowledged experts as well as the most promising post-docs), industry practitioners and policy-makers, this project aims to set the agenda for scholarly and practical interaction with the opera canon for years to come.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M008517/1","grantId":"AH/M008517/1","fundValue":"36104","fundStart":"2015-03-25","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Cormac  Newark","coPersons":["William A.
