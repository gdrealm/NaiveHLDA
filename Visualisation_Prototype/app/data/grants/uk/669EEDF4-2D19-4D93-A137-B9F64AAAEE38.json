Such operating conditions can lead to the development of faults during the lifecycle of the structure.

The novel structural health monitoring methodology proposed and investigated during this project demonstrated the potential for the rapid and cost-efficient inspection and permanent monitoring of large surface areas of complex technical structures using guided ultrasonic waves. Guided waves can propagate over large distances in thin structures, allowing faster and more frequent inspections and monitoring of large surface areas at a lower cost, thus improving the reliability and safety of the inspected structures for a large number of industries. \n\nThe significant step change achieved during this research project was to work on real, complex, multi-layered aircraft structures and to investigate and find ways to deal with the complexity of the guided wave propagation and scattering. Fatigue crack growth during cyclic loading has been monitored successfully. Appropriate measurement equipment for guided waves in multi-layered structures has been developed and tested. The sensitivity and reliability of the proposed method for the detection of fatigue cracks at fastener holes in the different layers was investigated and ascertained. Due to the propagation of the energy of the guided wave along the structure, the detection sensitivity in hidden layers (2nd) in such a multi-layered structure can be improved and inspection time and thus costs reduced. The technology has been applied to real aircraft components and structures, and practical application experience gained, demonstrating the potential for the increase of inherent safety and cost reduction in further applications. In addition to the verification of the proposed SHM technology, fundamental research on guided ultrasonic wave propagation in complex, multi-layered structures was conducted, laying the base for the application of the methodology in other important UK industry sectors, such as wind energy and oil and gas exploration. The research project did focus on the application of guided ultrasonic waves for fatigue damage detection in multi-layered aircraft structures in order to investigate and demonstrate the potential of the methodology for such practical structures. The work carried out had and achieved the following objectives:\n\n- Development and implementation of the novel nondestructive testing methodology using guided ultrasonic waves for structural health monitoring in complex, multi-layered structures, such as aircraft wings.\n\n- Development of an experimental setup and instrumentation for the combined measurement of guided wave scattering using a laser vibrometer, optical determination of fatigue crack length, and strain monitoring in multi-layered specimen during fatigue testing.\n\n- Development and manufacture of appropriate guided ultrasonic wave transducers, optimisation with regards to excitation frequency, wave mode and energy distribution in multi-layered structures.\n\n- Investigation of guided wave excitation and propagation in multi-layered plate strip structures.\n\n- Monitoring of fatigue crack growth using guided waves in tensile and multi-layered specimens, demonstration of accuracy and repeatability. \n\n- Verification of the sensitivity predictions from numerical FEM calculations against the experimental results, assessment of the minimum detectable defect size in different layers for varying geometry.\n\n- Demonstration of the application to real aircraft components supplied by Airbus, verification of the methodology and sensitivity for defect detection.\n Fatigue damage is an important, safety-critical failure mechanism for aerospace and other technical structures. Industry costs for inspection and overhaul are significant, including personnel costs and loss of revenue due to down-time of planes for regular inspection and maintenance. The project will establish the framework for the application of guided ultrasonic wave inspection and monitoring technology to be applied to aerospace structures, with the potential of large area inspection and permanent structural health monitoring. This will in turn lead to a substantial cost reduction compared to current working practice, as down-time will be reduced and inspection intervals might be extended. However, the concept of continuous, large area monitoring using guided waves is not limited to aerospace industry, but can be applied for problematic structures in the power and process industries. The technology will be applied to real aircraft components and structures, and practical application experience gained. The proposed methodology can be extended to fatigue damage detection in other industrial structures, e.g. off-shore oil platforms or ship hulls, where significant cost reductions and enhancement of inspection reliability might be achieved. This will help to advance the knowledge and understanding of guided wave inspection beyond the field of aircraft applications, and represent a significant advancement of the scientific research in this area.
