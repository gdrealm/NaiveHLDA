It is a unique collaboration between two groups of social scientists at the University of Leeds and UCL whose expertise is in simulating the spatial dynamics of development in cities using large scale data and computational resources. It builds on the two existing nodes in the National Centre for e-Social Science, the MoSeS node at Leeds which has developed a micro simulation of the demographic space economy in the UK and the GeoVUE node at UCL which has pioneered visualisation techniques for spatial systems in 2D and 3D.</p>\n\n<p>GENeSIS will integrate these techniques through macro and micro simulation, developing bottom-up agent-based models (ABMs), using the following work pakages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Integrate demographic simulation using MoSeS with traditional land use transportation models applied to London to assess the impact of key changes in the space economy at Heathrow, the Olympic Games development, and the financial services in the City.</li>\n\n <li>Develop a series of ABMs based on London and Leeds data which focus on simulating patterns of crime, educational provision, neighbourhood segregation and crowding.</li>\n\n <li>Provide the infrastructure for these various models through the grid and the web.</li>\n\n <li>The development of novel methods of visualisation for ABMs, and progressing the various map graphics developed under GeoVUE for displaying the results of simulation models.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-149-25-1078","grantId":"RES-149-25-1078","fundValue":"1370060","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Batty","coPersons":["MC  Clarke","Anthony  Steed","Mark  Birkin","Jie  Xu","Paul Arthur Longley","Alison Jane Heppenstall","Alan  Wilson"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
