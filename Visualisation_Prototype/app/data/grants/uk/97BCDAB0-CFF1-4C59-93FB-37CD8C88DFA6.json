This proposal is concerned with potent weapons employed by the body to destroy bacterial cells, but which sometimes go astray and damage our own tissues. The ability of components within human blood to burst open foreign cells was first recognised almost a century ago and represented one of the great early discoveries of immunology. Today, the eleven proteins involved (called C1, C2, C3 etc. up to C9 and factors B and D) have been thoroughly characterised. The sequence in which they act (roughly starting with C1 and culminating with C9) is also well established. The grand finale is the self-assembly on cell membranes of a ring of C9 proteins that punches a hole (or pore) right through the membrane. Many thousands of such pores can form on a cell resulting in leakage of its contents, an influx of water, swelling and rupture ('cytolysis'). It is clearly vital to minimise the number of such pores that form on our own cells. Unfortunately this does not always happen. Many diseases are associated with failure to control MAC formation on human cells and there is a lot of interest in developing inhibitors of the MAC as potentially powerful drugs. One way in the body controls MAC assembly is by ensuring that formation of the pore itself can occur only after C6 and C7 have assembled on C5b to form a 'pre-lytic' complex. The key point is that C5b is not normally present in the blood in substantial quantities. Its creation (by conversion from inactive C5) is triggered by detection of bacteria or other hazardous particles. In this proposal we want to take a very close look at the role played by C5b in nucleating MAC formation. In particular we will focus our efforts on the proteins C7 and C6. We suspect that C7, like C8 and C9, contains the molecular equivalent of a flick-knife fitted with a safety catch. Release of the safety catch results in the flipping out of a blade like structure that effectively cuts through the membrane. One proposal is that C5b is necessary for release of the safety catch in C7 and we wish to investigate whether this is true and if it is, then we want to find out precisely how this comes about. This will involve taking a very detailed look at the structure of the safety catch and its mode of interaction. In our model, the safety catch consists of a swinging arm of C7 that interacts with itself to maintain MACPF in a state of latency, or with C5b to release the MACPF. We propose to dissect the arm, into its component domains and study their structures, how flexibly they are attached to one another and how the arm is disposed relative to the MACPF domain in C7. These insights will be useful in the future design of small molecules designed to prevent the safety catch from releasing. Such molecules would be the starting points for therapeutic compounds in clinical settings where dangerous levels of the MAC form on human cell surfaces.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I007946/1","grantId":"BB/I007946/1","fundValue":"377066","fundStart":"2011-08-15","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Nigel Barlow","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" The complement system can very rapidly become activated on any blood-exposed surface including the surfaces of our own cells and tissues. The ultimate consequence of complement activation is the formation of membrane-attack complexes that penetrate cellular membranes and cause cells to lyse or burst. The complement system is said to be triggered - able to respond almost instantly to an invading bacterium or virus. This provides a highly effective first line of defence but is potentially dangerous. Consequently, there are safety catches tasked with preventing inappropriate activation. These can fail leading to disease. We set out to discover precisely how safety catches work with a view to designing therapeutic strategies for complement suppression.\n\nIn this work we focused on the main, soluble, safety catch on the trigger of complement activation, a protein called factor H. Note that our original proposal was focused on a more downstream safety catch in the pathway.\n\nThe most important and potentially game-changing finding of our work was that factor H can switch between a latent or quiescent conformation and an activated conformation that has enhanced regulatory potential. The quiescent form circulates in blood. It is able to control fluid-phase regulation of complement but is unable to keep surface-based complement activation in check. The enhanced-activity conformation, on the other hand, is induced by sugars that are specific to host surfaces. In this way host surfaces (as well as bacteria that mimic them) are protected from complement-mediated injury. While there are some aspects of this hypothesis that require confirmation we think that we have discovered the molecular mechanism underpinning the ability of complement to distinguish between self and non-self. The bacterial protein that anchors and stabilises the activated conformation of the complement regulator factor H has potential application in biocompatible surfaces, diagnostics and therapeutics. We have filed a priority application based on these potential uses. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
