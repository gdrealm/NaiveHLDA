The ISIS-funded lab visit has succeeded in providing an excellent training of the appointed Post Doc David Barneda. He developed molecular tools used in the study through this international visit to Cornell University where he acquired additional skills in yeast manipulations. The wide range of skills acquired from the project (e.g. time management, problem solving, information technology, presentation skills, record keeping, budgeting, innovative thinking and mentoring) are applicable to career progression both within and outside academia. Thus, David has benefitted as an individual from the training, and the UK institutions where he applies his skills and training will benefit. David is continuing his scientific career at Queen Mary University of London.\n\nThe visit to Cornell University was one component of an international multidisciplinary collaboration network (UK-USA-Italy-China) established through this project has served to enhance the research capacity and skills base. The management skills involved in coordinating a multicentre collaboration are important on a personal development perspective and are applicable to economic advancement. The network has served to raise the profile of UK research with a group of influential scientists and policy makers within their different fields.

Although Dr Barneda spent only one month in the Henry lab in Cornell he was able to validate the yeast expression model and determine the importance of PA in CIDEA action.\n\nImportantly, although the CIDEA gene has no yeast equivalent, it was fully functional in increasing lipid droplet size. The finding from this visit that CIDEA expression in yeast increased lipid droplet size could be taken further in biotechnological applications. Applications include biodiesel production.
