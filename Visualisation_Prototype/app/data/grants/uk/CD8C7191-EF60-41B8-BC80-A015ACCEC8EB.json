This is contrary to findings from earlier, smaller studies, and overturns the predictions of previous\nphonological theory. Such an unpredicted phenomenon required a large-scale study in order to detect it, on account of its relative rarity.\n(2) Word-final [t] and [d] in consonant clusters (such as [ft] or [ld]) are highly variable, and may often appear to be &quot;deleted&quot; (e.g. ol' man). In previous work this has been\nattributed to the class of the word (regular past tense forms vs. irregular pasts vs. uninflected words) - but we found no such conditioning. Instead, we found that most of the variation is due to differences in the frequency of use of the word. This relationship seems to be mediated by word duration: higher frequency words are pronounced\nmore quickly and their endings are pronounced less &quot;carefully&quot;, whereas lower frequency words are pronounced more slowly and carefully. This finding, too, overturns prior views about how final &quot;[t]/[d] deletion&quot; works. \n(3) For both nasal assimilation and &quot;[t]/[d] deletion&quot;, novel probabilistic models of the respective patterns of variation are required.\n(4) The large amount of data we examined, and its natural variability, necessitated creative approaches to acoustic measurement that are automatic and robust.\n(5) Quite subtle variations in pronunciation can be studied in colloquial, spontaneous speech using purely acoustic measurements when a sufficiently large sample (roughly 100 or more instances of each item of interest, 50 per gender, in the same context) is employed.\n(6) In order to find relevant examples in such a large audio corpus, it is necessary to use automatic methods to align the transcription - the start and end times of each vowel, consonant and word - to the audio, and to link data about the speaker (such as their sex and age) to the time-aligned transcriptions. We used forced alignment to obtain the tens of millions of time-alignments, and evaluated the accuracy of this method: 60% of automatically-assigned word boundaries were within 50 ms of manually-corrected controls, and 80% were within 100 ms.\n(7) In a complementary study of &quot;g-dropping&quot; (i.e. variation in word-final -ing or -in', as in droppin'), our US co-investigator Jiahong Yuan developed a technique based upon forced alignment (adaptive discriminative training) to find examples of -ing or -in' pronunciations and to measure the acoustic differences between them.\n(8) Given the highly asymmetric distribution of words in spontaneous speech, our corpus of 6.9 million words was barely sufficient for some of our research questions; in\nfuture, speech corpora 10 or 100 times larger will be needed, thanks in part to the diversity of English accents in the British Isles. The audio data and transcriptions we have published have already seen (quite rapid) actual\nuptake by teachers of English as a foreign language, around the world. During the lifetime of\nthe project, over 1200 distinct users have registered to access the data. The economic and\nsocietal impacts of this is that UK English, in a wider range of dialects and varieties, is being\nused in teaching English. This also helps to advance the BNC &quot;brand&quot;, and may help to\npromote sales of other resources based upon the BNC, such as English language teaching\ndictionaries published by Longman, Oxford University Press, and Chambers.\nThe OCR school examinations board uses extracts from our BNC conversation\ntranscriptions in public examinations such as AS and A-Level English Language, and sells\ncopies of those exam papers.
