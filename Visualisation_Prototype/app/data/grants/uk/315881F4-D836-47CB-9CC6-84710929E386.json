Whilst some of these babies will be healthy, many will die shortly after birth and those who survive risk developing lifelong disability or behavioural problems. Ideally, obstetricians would like to be able to predict which women are at risk of delivering their baby prematurely and prevent them going into labour too early. However, this is not yet possible and women present at hospital in preterm labour requiring drugs to stop their uterus (womb) from contracting. The drugs currently available are not very effective and there is a real need to develop better treatments. Our research has identified a new class of drugs (Kv7 channel activators) that can potentially stop the uterus from contracting. Before we can begin testing these drugs in pregnant women, we need to show that they are safe to use in pregnancy. Our project aims to do this and also to develop our understanding of how these drugs can target the uterus specifically.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100243","grantId":"G1100243","fundValue":"748684","fundStart":"2012-04-02","fundEnd":"2015-07-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rachel Marie Tribe","coPersons":["Iain  Greenwood","Paul David Taylor","Philip Irving Aaronson","Mark R Johnson"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
