{"id":"E1E82EA6-33C1-4812-A5D7-CFE6B268C5DE","title":"New Photo-Releasable Iron Complexes","abstractText":"This proposal concerns the development of iron complexes that collapse upon exposure to specific wavelengths of light to release iron at the illuminated surface. These novel chemical tools will be useful for studying biological processes believed to arise from the release of Fe (III) from their normal sequestered state. Such photo-collapsible complexes will offer precise control over the space, time and concentration Fe(III) released in a biological system under study by the remote-control of light. These chemical tools will specifically be used to model processes leading to blood coagulation or thrombosis. Fe (III) is widely used to induce thrombosis in models, but is currently administered in a very poorly controlled way by placing filter paper soaked in the iron solution onto the site under study. This proposal seeks to develop a more precise method of administering iron that may provide more detailed understanding of the mechanisms leading to thrombus formation. Blood coagulation is an important feature of the healthy organism, protecting against injury to the vasculature, but the formation of thrombosis and the resulting occlusion of blood vessels is a feature of aging and many disease states, often with fatal consequences. The mechanisms leading to this event are complex and are an important area of study since this understanding may be directly relevant to health and welfare. Fe (III) is often implicated in other tissue damage processes, such as arthritis, because it can catalyse the formation of radical species associated with oxidative stress. The precise control over iron levels offered the proposed chemical tool may therefore be attractive to a wide range of researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G000484/1","grantId":"BB/G000484/1","fundValue":"97445","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have not been used from this project.

Unfortunately, synthesis of the target molecule could not be completed within the ~10 month time frame of the pilot project. The main finding was that a more expedient route would need to be developed in order to allow a &lt;1yr PDRA to complete the synthesis. The planned compounds could be used by researchers in a medical and healthcare industry environment for non-academic research. The planned use of the target compounds was to provide transport of Fe3+ complexes into a (epithelial) cells (in vitro or in vivo) and then achieve timed and specific release by irradiation with a specific wavelength of light. These tools would be useful for interrogation of the role of iron in disease processes. Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
