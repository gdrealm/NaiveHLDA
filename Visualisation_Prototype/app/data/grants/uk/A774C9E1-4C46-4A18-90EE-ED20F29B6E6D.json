{"id":"A774C9E1-4C46-4A18-90EE-ED20F29B6E6D","title":"Continuous Twin Screw Rheo-Extrustion of Light Alloys","abstractText":"This project is to exploit the commercial application of the novel Twin Screw Rheo-Extrusion (TSRE) technology and facilitate the related technology transfer to industry. The TSRE process takes advantage of the non-dendritc microstructure and dynamic shear resistance of semisolid-metal slurries and produces simple metal profiles directly from the melt, with designed microstructure, uniform chemistry and excellent properties. This offers a step change for metal production, presenting a major opportunity for the UK industry to save costs and energy and enhance efficiency. The project's core objective is to successfully demonstrate the TSRE process for producing aluminium welding rods/wires at an industrial-scale.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J500793/1","grantId":"EP/J500793/1","fundValue":"100453","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Yan  Huang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
