Theoretical concerns that conciliation or mediation may be inherently inappropriate in some or all citizen-versus-state disputes because of the imbalance of power will be tested.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F016476/1","grantId":"ES/F016476/1","fundValue":"313943","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sheila  Riddell","coPersons":["Neville  Harris"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
