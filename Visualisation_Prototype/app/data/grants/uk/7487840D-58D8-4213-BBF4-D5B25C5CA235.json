They retouch their art, sometimes to make it more accurate, other times to bring out parts of the scene that interest them. The point is that making art involves seeing somethings as more important than others, and requires an ability to match artwork to the real world. If we replace the artist by a computer we should expect the same things to be true, but at the moment this is not the case. Our proposal is to match photographs and artwork so machines can make better - and new - art. Doing so offers more benefits than producing better artwork, it is a basic technique we can use to help machines identify important parts of a photograph, which helps computers see the world through human eyes just a little more.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D05429X/1","grantId":"EP/D05429X/1","fundValue":"275797","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Maxwell Hall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":" 1.
