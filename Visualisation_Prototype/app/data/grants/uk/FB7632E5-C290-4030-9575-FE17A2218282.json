We hope to attract up to 250 delegates, including not only participants from academia, but also a strong industrial representation to address the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Insects have a huge impact on our health and economy. Never before have we had such powerful scientific tools to exploit beneficial insects and control pests. The conference is themed to promote the value of entomology. We aim to facilitate optimal communication between all attendees through provision of pre-scheduled, one-to-one meetings, to ensure each delegate has an opportunity to meet and liaise with relevant academics or companies to initiate future collaborations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H527816/1","grantId":"NE/H527816/1","fundValue":"5625","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  Dudley","coPersons":["Tariq Mahmud Butt"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
