{"id":"F378F76C-2984-41F7-A525-4AFEA6CCBA0A","title":"Platform Grant: Centre for Digital Music","abstractText":"Digital Music is a rapidly growing research area. Its research covers a range of disciplines, including computer science, information science, audio engineering, digital signal processing and musicology. The music industry is undergoing radical change from a physical to digital distribution model. Digital music downloads are above $1.1bn worldwide and rising rapidly; in the UK these grew over 350% in 2005. The internet and peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies have opened the possibility for new or small bands to release their music to a wide range of listeners, although the problem remains of how their listeners may find them and their music. Finally, it must be stated that music is not simply a commodity to be delivered to consumers, but is also a medium for creative expression and social interaction: people do not merely consume music but engage with it. The Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) at Queen Mary University of London is a world-leading multidisciplinary research group in this field of Music and Audio Technology. Our current research is focussed in two main areas: signal processing of digital music; and digital music performance and interaction. By early 2007 C4DM will have about 40 full-time members, including academic staff, research staff, research students and visitors.This Platform Grant will provide the Centre for Digital Music with background funding to allow us to further enhance our international research reputation, and to continue to be a major contributor to the UK research base in this area.This will be achieved through:* Retention of key research staff;* Retaining key graduating PhD students as named researchers;* An internship and outreach scheme;* Maximizing research impact &amp; exploitation; and* Adventurous interdisciplinary projects.These will be in addition to the usual type of research projects, funded by EPSRC, EU and others, which we will continue through the duration of the Platform Grant and beyond.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E045235/1","grantId":"EP/E045235/1","fundValue":"1054460","fundStart":"2007-07-30","fundEnd":"2012-07-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Impacts include a number of artistic outputs, including experimental piano piece with Sarah Nicolls, a wearable musical instrument (the Serendiptichord) with artist Di Mainstone, and an Augmented Instruments Concert.

We undertook this through Retention of key research staff, Retention of key graduating PhD students as researchers, Maximizing impact (e.g. through presentations at events), Interdisciplinary projects / feasibility studies, and Internship / outreach / visits. Potential beneficiaries of the research supported by this Platform Grant outside of the academic research community include anyone who could benefit from latest research in audio and music. Examples from various sectors are given below.\n\nCommercial private sector:\n\n* Commercial companies designing audio equipment, through easier access to new audio research\n\n* Companies wishing to provide new ways for their customers to discover or access music based on music recommendation research\n\n* Musicians and sound artists, through their ability to use new research methods and processes for new creative outputs\n\n* Computer games companies, for improved game music and audio, or for new types of audio or music-based computer games\n\n* Hearing aid and cochlear implant manufacturers, through access to new research applicable to hearing improvement\n\n* Audio archiving companies, through access to the latest algorithms and methods for music information retrieval\n\n* Television and radio companies, through ability to use the latest research in the design of new technology-based programmes or in new audio production processes.\n\nPolicy-makers and others in government and government agencies:\n\n* Police and security services, through access to methods for analysing and separating audio signals.\n\nPublic sector, third sector and others:\n\n* Healthcare workers who work with music and audio, such as music therapists, through new music and audio visualization tools\n\n* Museums, through tools to measure and visualise acoustic properties of objects\n\n* Libraries, through improved open access to our research results for the benefit of their users\n\n* Standards organizations, through access to new research methods on which to base forthcoming standards\n\n* Science promotion organizations, through availability of high-quality usable research tools attractive to people who may be interested in science.\n\nWider public:\n\n* People interested in exploring music or other audio recordings at home, school, college or university, using the latest research, either for educational or general interest purposes\n\n* Teachers in schools, colleges or universities who want to use our research-based software for teaching audio or music\n\n* Audiences of creative output involving audio and music, through availability of new creative outputs or technology facilitated by our audio and digital music research. Beneficiaries of our research include: other researchers in the audio and digital music research; researchers in other fields who might use the results of our research, including musicologists, audio engineers, bio-acousticians, and auditory psychologists; and researchers who use techniques related to ours in other fields, such as medical signal processing or general semantic web research.
