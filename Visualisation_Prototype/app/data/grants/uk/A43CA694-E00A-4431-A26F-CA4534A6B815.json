An analysis of patterns in the recruitment, training and employment of scientists.","abstractText":"<p>More science is now being taught to more students at school than at any time in history. However, falling A-level science entries, the closure of several university science and mathematics departments, poor career opportunities and educational experiences and narrow skills development, all point to a crisis in education and training in the sciences. This ‘science problem’ both threatens the place of the UK as a knowledge-based economy and foreshadows an impending crisis in the provision of scientifically educated workers and scientifically literate citizens. Much of the focus of the ‘science problem’ has been on long-standing concerns about how science is taught in schools. Less attention has been devoted to the undergraduate student experience and the reasons learners give for continuing along a career trajectory that will end in them becoming professional scientists and technicians. In this project we will combine secondary data analysis with a survey and interviews with undergraduate students, to examine these three research questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>What are the long-term patterns of participation in science and science-related courses at the end of compulsory schooling?</li>\n\n <li>What influences undergraduate students’ decisions to pursue a career in science? </li>\n\n <li>What happens to science graduates once they leave higher education?</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2005-A","grantId":"RES-000-22-2005-A","fundValue":"64035","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emma  Smith","coPersons":["Stephen  Gorard","Robert Hamilton (Robin)  Millar"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
