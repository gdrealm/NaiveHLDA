The first aim of this project is therefore to tackle misconceptions about nuclear physics among 14-16 year olds; to make clear the distinction between nuclear power, nuclear engineering and nuclear weaponry; and to introduce concepts from current nuclear research. This will include both practical issues such as radiological risks, radioactive material handling and waste management, and the fundamental questions of nuclear physics: How does matter hold together? Where does it come from?\n\nThese ideas will be introduced to the students in the context of the work going on at CERN ISOLDE, with the secondary aim of raising public awareness of this facility, its history, ongoing research, and the UK's involvement. This will tie into the upcoming 50th anniversary of the facility's foundation. \n\nIn order to communicate these concepts to the target audience in an engaging, accessible way, the programme will be themed around a robotics competition, where schools will be challenged to build and program a LEGO robot analogous to the ISOLDE target handling system. This practical, hands-on activity will be a fun introduction to robotics, and the programming element will build on activities schools may have undertaken as part of 2014's 'year of code'.\n\nTen undergraduate 'science ambassadors' will be trained to deliver a schools workshop around nuclear physics and ISOLDE, and introducing the LEGO Mindstorms robotics kit to be used in the competition part of the programme. Each school will then be provided with a Mindstorms kit and assigned a science ambassador to act as 'robotics coach'. This ongoing contact with a student science ambassador will give pupils from ten schools an opportunity to talk informally to a physics undergraduate about his or her academic path and careers plans, with the aim of raising aspirations and promoting physics as a subject choice at A-Level and beyond.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M006727/1","grantId":"ST/M006727/1","fundValue":"7401","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas Elias Cocolios","coPersons":["Emma  Nichols"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
