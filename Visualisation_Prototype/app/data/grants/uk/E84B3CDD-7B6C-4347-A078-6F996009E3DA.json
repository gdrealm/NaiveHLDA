{"id":"E84B3CDD-7B6C-4347-A078-6F996009E3DA","title":"Empathy Dynamics in Conflict Transformation","abstractText":"<p>EDiCT is a 12-month knowledge exchange project that brings together academic research on empathy with the field of conflict transformation to develop new models and methods, involving joint work with the NGO Responding to Conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Academic research carried out by the PI investigated how people construct, negotiate or resist empathy with others through dialogue and interaction. Application to post-conflict reconciliation in N Ireland and to conflict transformation interventions in Kenya showed the potential of the research to contribute to the field of conflict transformation. The current project aims to realise that contribution by working with conflict transformation experts and practitioners, and parties to conflict.</p>\n\n<p>In its first phase, the project brings together a network of academics and conflict transformation experts to produce a shared framework that maps models of conflict transformation processes against previous research findings, to be called the 'Empathy in Conflict Map'. The second phase will operationalise the Empathy in Conflict Map through collaborative work in Kenya (post-conflict) and Nepal (settlement phase of conflict) to collect stories of conflict transformation through interviews and collaboratively develop methods for analysing empathy dynamics. In the third, dissemination phase, findings will be incorporated into training materials and activities for wider dissemination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000713/1","grantId":"ES/K000713/1","fundValue":"71526","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lynne Joan Cameron","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
