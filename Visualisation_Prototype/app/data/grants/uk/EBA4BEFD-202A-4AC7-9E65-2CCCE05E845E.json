This proposal is for Academic/Academic Knowledge Exchange from the Astronomy domain to the Energy domain.\n\nBackground\nThere is an enormous (20PWh p.a.) market globally for electricity generation Climate change concerns and increasing oil prices have lead to a rapid increase in the demand for renewable energy, including solar. This technology has several novel features and the proposed project will explore the configuration necessary for these features to confer the greatest competitive advantage. The thermal generation of electricity by concentration of solar radiation is a highly efficient method of power generation but is obviously limited to daylight hours. This concept, with an appropriate configuration, has the potential to beat the competition in several power generation application areas, especially off-grid. \nThermal (as opposed to photovoltaic) generation of electricity by concentration of solar radiation has three configurations that are in use or being developed:\n* Heliostat\n* Parabolic Troughs: \n* Dish Collector with a Stirling Engine \nThus far a configuration has not been designed which achieves the high concentration ratios and operating temperatures of a dish system in combination with an energy store so that electricity can be produced according to demand rather than simply during daylight hours. \nDrawing on their extensive experience of optical, thermal and systems engineering the UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UKATC) have developed this concept, which adds storage to a dish system in a novel and modular way by using direct illumination of the thermal store using an off-axis parabolic reflector. Uniquely, this removes the need for pipe work and heat transfer fluids in a trough system while retaining the high concentration ratio of a dish system; thus taking advantage of the positive aspects of two existing technologies.\n\nTechnical Concept\nThe proposed approach is to cut out the middleman (heat transfer fluids &amp; heat exchangers) by directly illuminating a thermal store thus increasing overall system efficiency.\nThis is done with an off-axis fixed focus reflector inspired by astronomical off-axis systems such as the Bell Labs Horn Antenna which was used to discover the microwave background. The reflector and storage co-rotate on an azimuth track while the reflector follows the sun in elevation throughout each day.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J002879/1","grantId":"ST/J002879/1","fundValue":"23862","fundStart":"2012-04-02","fundEnd":"2013-04-01","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Tadhg Se√°n O'Donovan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
