{"id":"68ACB321-BC57-4C02-BCB5-02A5ADAD1B6C","title":"Compact diode-laser-pumped THz source based on a novel photomixer device.","abstractText":"Within this project we will carry out theoretical and experimental studies of novel types of compact THz sources where semiconductor laser diodes will be combined with a novel dipole/spiral and waveguide photoconductor devices. Specifically, we propose to design, fabricate and assess the performance of the material systems of amorphous/nanocrystalline silicon and quantum-dot semiconductors as materials having short electron-hole photocarrier lifetimes and high photosensitivity at 780-1300nm. In addition to fully characterising and optimising the dual- and multi-longitudinal modes diode lasers we will evaluate the performance of these lasers in the optical pumping of the dipole/spiral and waveguided antennae for obtaining THz power levels in the &gt;100 microwatts range with optimised beam characteristics. The overall objective of this work is to produce a diode-laser-driven, ultra-compact THz source having some potential for additional functionality through its frequency tunability.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H015795/1","grantId":"EP/H015795/1","fundValue":"525059","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Edik U Rafailov","coPersons":["Mervyn John  Rose","Steve  Reynolds"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
