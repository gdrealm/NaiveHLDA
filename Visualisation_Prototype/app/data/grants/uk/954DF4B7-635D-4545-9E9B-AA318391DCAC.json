They therefore offer a potential cure for injuries and also for degenerative diseases such as Alzheimers and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In the testis, stem cells are required to maintain the supply of sperm, so that the male has potential to produce offspring for much of his life. In recent years, there have been rapid advances in the understanding of the genes which are required to be switched ON to produce self-renewing stem cells that are capable of developing into a wide range of tissues e.g. skin or nervous tissue. However, it is now known that it is also crucially important to make sure that certain genes are switched OFF to prevent stem cells from spontaneously differentiating into particular cell types or developing into cancer cells. We have recently discovered that an enzyme named Pacman, which is involved in the destruction of messenger RNA molecules, is necessary for stem cell function in testis cells of the fruit fly Drosophila. Messenger RNAs are the molecules which instruct the cell to make particular proteins. By comparing mutant flies with normal flies, we have found out that there are fewer testis stem cells in the pacman mutant leading to fewer sperm and offspring. Using various genetic and molecular techniques we have found out that Pacman is likely to destroy particular RNAs that would otherwise prevent stem cell division or cell death. This is interesting as it shows that these mRNAs must somehow be 'tagged' allowing Pacman and its partners to identify, 'hunt down' and destroy these particular RNAs. The specific aim of this project is to understand, in molecular terms, exactly how Pacman and its partners can identify and destroy its correct target RNAs and how this is controlled. The ability of Pacman to selectively destroy target RNAs is not intrinsic to itself as isolated Pacman protein in the test tube cannot distinguish between different RNAs. We know that different RNAs are selected in different tissues so how does Pacman and its partners do this? Our hypothesis is that a particular protein (or a tiny regulatory RNA) binds to a specific feature or the target RNA and 'tags' it for destruction. This tag is then recognised by Pacman and its partner proteins. We propose that Pacman, which is a large protein, can act as a scaffold to assemble other proteins upon it. When the correct partners are assembled, in the correct 3-dimensional shape, then a decapitation enzyme snips off the end of the RNA and the rest is rapidly chewed up. In this project, we aim to find out the details of this destruction pathway, including the ways that the target is tagged. This work will increase our general understanding of the ways that genes are specifically switched off in response to their cellular context. Since Pacman is known to be important in other important cellular events such as wound healing and migration of cell sheets, this work may also shed light on the molecular mechanisms of these processes. Although this project will be carried out using the fruit fly Drosophila, it also has relevance for stem cell function in humans as the cellular processes are surprisingly similar in both organisms. In addition, the Pacman enzyme is extremely similar between flies and humans therefore the insights we gain during this project may help us to improve treatment for fertility and also help us to understand the ways that stem cells remain virtually immortal for the lifetime of the organism. This project will therefore provide valuable insights into the ways in which specific RNAs are targeted in a particular cell type which can be used in the development of new therapeutics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I007989/1","grantId":"BB/I007989/1","fundValue":"433308","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2014-10-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This work, together with related projects, has led to very fruitful collaborations with clinicians within Brighton and Sussex Medical School. Because of the expertise of the named post-doc, we have been able to lead a biomarker project where we have identified key microRNA biomarkers which provide prognostic and diagnostic information in the blood cancer myeloma. These biomarkers have been patented and have generated substantial Industrial interest. In addition, we are now part of a collaborative project to identify the microRNA biomarkers involved in sepsis. This project is primarily &quot;basic, blue-sky research&quot; which nevertheless is likely to lead to new insights important for new therapeutics in the future. Beneficiaries in the public sector already include clinicians, who are benefiting from the knowledge and techniques developed from our current BBSRC-funded research. Since the proposed project focusses on stem cells, it is relevant for many fields of clinical research. Other potential beneficiaries include Industrial collaborators and the general public, particularly school children.

We have developed a novel hypothesis to explain the targeting of particular mRNAs to Pacman. Using a range of genetic, cell biological and biochemical techniques tested this hypothesis and so gained an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved. The experiments were performed in the developmental context of spermatogenesis, so these experiments also provided insights into the molecular control of stem cell function at the level of mRNA stability. Since Pacman is highly conserved in all eukaryotes, the understanding of the mechanisms whereby it targets mRNAs and regulates mRNA turnover is likely to shed light on many important cellular events in Drosophila and humans.\n\nWe made substantial progress on the project, with 4 papers published and 6 presentations at national and international meetings during the lifetime of the project. Our main achievements so far are as follows:\n\n1. We have shown that males carrying mutations in pacman have fewer stem cells at the tip of their testes and fewer sperm and offspring. This suggests that pacman plays an important role in stem cell renewal or maintenance.\n\n2. We have carried out preliminary microarray experiments to identify the key targets of Pacman. We have also used genetic experiments to determine whether downregulation of these potential target mRNAs, which are upregulated in pacman mutants, rescues the pacman phenotypes. So far, none of these potential targets has given a clear rescue effect.\n\n3. We have constructed 2 new null alleles of pacman, in order to more clearly define the effect of pacman on spermatogenesis. Although flies homozygous for these null mutations die at the pupal stage, we have found that we can rescue Pacman activity in somatic cells to produce viable adult males which are mutant for pacman in their germline. These flies will provide a valuable resource for future experiments.\n\n4. Using the GAL4-UAS system, we have shown that expression of Pacman in spermatogonia and spermatocytes cannot rescue the fertility phenotypes therefore confirming that Pacman is required for stem cell function. The results of this work are relevant to understanding the function and maintenance of stem cells. The role of RNA stability in the maintenance of stem cells is virtually unknown therefore this work contributes to this research field. Since stem cells are important in tissue regeneration and wound healing, this work has relevance to human health. By understanding how enzymes that regulate RNA stability contribute to stem cell function, this work has set the scene for future work on human stem cells.
