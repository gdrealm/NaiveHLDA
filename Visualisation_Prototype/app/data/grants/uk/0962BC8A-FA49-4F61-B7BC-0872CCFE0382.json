Two Departments (Sociology and Politics) work closely with the co-investigators.The degrees of BA Econ, BSc Econ, and BA in Social Sciences degree (BASS) are affected.The money supports a research assistant, videos, and other costs.<br /><br />The proposed step-change in QM embedding involves:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Getting students to generate and interpret their own quantitative survey data on substantive topics. New data about the students themselves follows the question wording found in national surveys. Students also use national and international data. </li>\n\n <li>The project also trains faculty to deal with QM teaching.</li>\n\n <li>It publicises useful Online Education Resources (OERs). </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The project is delivered partly by staff in the UK Data Service and in MIMAS, the national data delivery and support service. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J011665/1","grantId":"ES/J011665/1","fundValue":"80315","fundStart":"2012-03-26","fundEnd":"2015-03-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Wendy  Olsen","coPersons":["Brian Thomas Heaphy","Jackie  Carter","Ian  Plewis","Mark Simon Brown","Tarani  Chandola"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
