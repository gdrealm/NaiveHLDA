An important tool to achieve this is high resolution simulation modelling of chronic and acute contamination. While the overheads involved in building and running such models are largely beyond SMEs involved in such work, NERC has invested strongly in ocean modelling and this presents an opportunity for collaboration and the extracting of added value from our research. Within GOBLIN, we propose - in conjunction with our industrial partners - to develop existing simulation output into a format that is both appropriate for and available to industrial stakeholders. To achieve this, we will produce data visualisations of our fine-scale global ocean model, and create a data portal that will allow access to the underlying simulated circulation. These outputs of GOBLIN will be showcased at the international &quot;Ocean Business&quot; exhibition in 2015, and supported by a parallel workshop that will introduce them to potential new partners in industry. In conjunction with these activities, GOBLIN proposes to learn from engaging with this sector to adopt protocols for simulations and model output that best map to industry requirements. The intention of GOBLIN is, firstly, to show stakeholders what NERC is able to provide, and, secondly, to provide a forum for engagement to adapt future NERC efforts to best complement industry needs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M006972/1","grantId":"NE/M006972/1","fundValue":"98783","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Ekaterina  Popova","coPersons":["JoÃ«l Jean-Marie Hirschi","Andrew  Yool"],"organisation":"National Oceanography Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
