Moreover hypotheses have been proposed about optimal forms, with many scholars highlighting a need for open questions from teachers; extended responses from students (optimally involving justifications); cumulative building upon other students' contributions; articulation, discussion and evaluation of competing viewpoints; and gradual resolution of differences in a productive direction. However, despite its prominence in theoretical analyses, it remains uncertain whether classroom dialogue that takes this form is genuinely beneficial for student learning, and even if it is, whether the magnitude of benefit justifies making its promotion an educational priority. Although there is a handful of promising studies and findings are sufficiently encouraging to warrant further inquiry, past research has not been conducted with appropriate rigour nor on a large enough scale to provide conclusive answers.\n\nWithin the UK (as elsewhere), clarity about classroom dialogue is of the utmost importance, for dialogue is now an entrenched part of schooling: classroom talk is not limited to teacher monologue, and educators at all levels presume that this is appropriate. The implication is that, if the form of dialogue matters, it is already having significant but undocumented consequences. It is critical to ensure that these consequences are optimal. So recognizing the dearth of research and the urgent need for progress, this project will take a major step forwards. It is in fact the first study to investigate the implications of dialogue in whole-class settings. The project will use dialogue recorded in c.80 Year 6 classrooms. Three successive lessons will be videotaped in each classroom, with literacy, mathematics and science all covered. All teacher talk during target lessons will be recorded as will student talk that occurs during interaction with teachers. Small groups that are working independently of teachers will be sampled. To ensure a contribution to researcher development, postgraduate students (who will be trained and monitored) will assist with recording, and with transcribing and/or coding of data. Transcripts will be archived as a resource for future researchers. \n\nRecordings will be coded and rated using a scheme that the applicants are developing. The scheme synthesizes the features with which scholars have characterized optimal dialogue, and while it goes beyond what any single analyst proposes, it is fully representative of the field as a whole. In other words, it is a model of effective practice that all analysts can sign up to, and it will be used in the project to represent degrees of approximation to a theorized ideal. It seems unlikely that any classrooms will reach the ideal. Nevertheless, published research together with the applicants' experience suggests that some will come close, while others will be nowhere near. The extent of approximation within the sample will be charted and specific areas of difficulty identified. Teachers' reflections will be invaluable, so workshops are planned where the 80 participants will be asked to brainstorm about why patterns of results were obtained, and what messages can be drawn for practice. \n\nAt the same time, analyses will assess whether there is a positive association between approximation to the theorized ideal and student learning, and if so whether the magnitude is sufficient to carry significant implications for policy. Taking steps to ensure that variation in classroom dialogue is not confounded through association with other predictors of learning, e.g. prior attainment/attitudes, SES, regression-style statistics will be used to assess the extent to which variation in dialogue predicts subsequent performance on objective, standardized and socially significant measures of learning attainment (e.g. Year 6 SATS) and attitudes to study.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M007103/1","grantId":"ES/M007103/1","fundValue":"343214","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Howe","coPersons":["Sara  Hennessy","Neil McKay Mercer"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
