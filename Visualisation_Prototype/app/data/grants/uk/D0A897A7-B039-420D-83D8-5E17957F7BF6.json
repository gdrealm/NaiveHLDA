Stem cells hold the promise of rejuvenating tissues to treat human disease but achieving this will be difficult unless more is known about their regulation. In recent years a significant body of work has begun to characterise the skin epidermal cells (keratinocytes), which have an enormous proliferative potential under optimum in vitro conditions and recent work has shown that somatic stem cells do undergo ageing in vivo as well as senescence in vitro. Therefore, understanding the regulation of somatic stem cells sufficiently to rejuvenate or expand them in situ by transient pharmaceutical intervention has longer term appeal, provided that at least some stem cells remain in the tissue. However, increasing stem cell numbers without increasing the risk of cancer is very difficult as many of the pathways known to increase stem cell number and function also promote neoplasia. The enzyme telomerase is a large protein complex composed of whose established (canonical) function is to maintain the TTAGGG repeats at the ends of human chromosomes (telomeres) and prevent the chromosome ends being recognised as DNA double strand breaks. This function of telomerase prevents one mechanism of ageing but provokes an increased risk of cancer. In addition there is now good evidence that telomerase has other (non-canonical) functions. In particular, recent work has suggested that telomerase can promote stem cell self-renewal and functional maintenance without an increased risk of cancer, thereby identifying the non-canonical functions of telomerase as a target for drugs that increase stem cell numbers and function. However, it is very unclear how telomerase activates keratinocyte stem cells. To address this we have used a human keratinocyte in vitro model system and a variant of telomerase that possesses only the non-canonical functions of the enzyme. We have shown that the non-canonical function of telomerase may increase keratinocyte survival when the cells are denied attachment to the epidermal basement membrane and this could contribute to the ability of stem cells to survive outside the stem cell environment (the niche). Our proposal seeks to investigate the molecular mechanism by which telomerase blocks death by anchorage deprivation (anoikis) by using two distinct approaches. Firstly, we will systematically probe the known pathways involved in keratinocyte anoikis to identify the precise point at in the extracellular matrix survival signalling mechanism where telomerase interferes with the process. As telomerase has been reported to regulate some extracellular matrix receptors (integrins), we will test whether any of the ones whose expression is altered by telomerase are modified by the non-canonical functions of telomerase. If any are up regulated we will seek to obtain proof of their functional involvement by either blocking or enhancing their function. If the integrins are not altered by telomerase, we will proceed to investigate the known downstream effectors of integrin-mediated survival, to test whether their expression or function is enhanced by telomerase and whether interfering with their function rescues anoikis in cells expressing telomerase.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F011725/1","grantId":"BB/F011725/1","fundValue":"286783","fundStart":"2009-03-02","fundEnd":"2012-03-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Eric Kenneth Parkinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
