It uses newly available data on unemployment and vacancies from much smaller areas than have been used before and proposes a new methodology for modelling spillovers across local labour markets, which overcome some limitations of existing approaches. The approach consists in modelling the number of job applications sent from a worker in an area to vacancies in any other area, as a function of the number of job opportunities existing in that area, the extent of job competition, and the distance between the two areas. The model is solved for the number of applications send from any area a in the economy to any area b, taking into account all the inter-dependencies between areas. The total number of applications received by vacancies in each area is the main determinant of the probability of a vacancy being filled in that area. Estimates of vacancy outflow equations are then used to obtain evidence on the returns to scale in the matching function, as well as in other features of this search economy, such as the maximum distance the unemployed would consider commuting in order to take a new job.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2445","grantId":"RES-000-22-2445","fundValue":"81411","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Barbara  Petrongolo","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
