The 1958-born National Child Development Study (NCDS), the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) are major national resources: rich multi-purpose storehouses of prospective longitudinal data. </p>\n\n<p>The main aims of the Resource Centre over the next five years are to collect core data from each cohort, BCS70 at age 42, NCDS at age 55 and MCS at age 11. </p>\n\n<p>A survey of MCS in 2014-15 at age 14 will be covered by a later funding application. NCDS and BCS70 now have about 10,000 adult subjects each, and collect very similar information, alternating interview and telephone surveys every four years. </p>\n\n<p>In the latest 2008 round, there is a 60 minute face-to-face interview survey of NCDS at age 50 and a twenty-five minute telephone survey of BCS70 at age 38. MCS has followed children at approximately two-year intervals up to the fourth survey of 7-year-olds in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>This study, starting out with nearly 19,000 babies, has collected data on over 15,000 children at ages 3 and 5, and approximately 14,000 at age 7.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G040923/1","grantId":"ES/G040923/1","fundValue":"9742540","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  ElliottAlissa Tamar Goodman","coPersons":["Lucinda  Platt","Heather Evelyn Joshi","Alice  Sullivan","Richard Donovan Wiggins","John William McDonald"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
