{"id":"1BD7017A-450C-449E-BA68-DC0830CA910F","title":"Ecological Interactions in a Warmer World","abstractText":"Our side-event aims to highlight the importance of climate change in relation to the ecology and viability of plant and animal species. Climatic patterns worldwide are changing rapidly with time - this inevitably has, or will reflect on entire ecosystems and man-based reliance of economically important living resources. We will present current knowledge on the following issues: To what extent does global warming impact on the biology of particular species and ecosystems? How important are shifts in species distribution ranges, and how can they affect particular economies and / or cultural practices? Finally, we will discuss emerging ideas aimed to tackle these problems in relation to previously established natural protected areas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H525370/1","grantId":"NE/H525370/1","fundValue":"5612","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Marta  Szulkin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
