But what happens between the cells that respond to light hitting the eye, and the time when we state our preferences? Unlike other thinkers concerned with aesthetics, such as philosophers and art critics, researchers working on cognitive neuroscience aim to discover how the humans process input from the senses (such as visual or hearing) and produce the emotional responses (pleasure) and preferences (overt judgements or tendencies to act in a particular way).</p>\n\n<p>In most experiments, we will present people with different types of visual symmetry on a computer screen. Symmetry is important because an infinite number of symmetrical patterns can be generated - so we never have to show the same image twice. It is also interesting because symmetry appears throughout all cultures in human art and architecture. Animals are also sensitive to visual symmetry - so this is unlikely to be a cultural whim. We are interested in the links between the parts of the brain that detect visual symmetry, and those that produce emotional responses or overtly reported preferences.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000187/1","grantId":"ES/K000187/1","fundValue":"284377","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marco  Bertamini","coPersons":["Ellen  Poliakoff","Johannes Martin Zanker"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
