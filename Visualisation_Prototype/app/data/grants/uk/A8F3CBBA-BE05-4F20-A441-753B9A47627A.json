To earlier emphases on business engagement has been added a rising growing expectation that universities will help socially-excluded communities to adapt to the demands of the knowledge economy. This expectation is based on several partly contradictory visions of universities:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Democratic communities where equals negotiate democratically and reflectively; </li> \n <li>As private businesses selling services competitively in global markets, and; </li> \n <li>As governmental instruments serving wider social purposes. </li>\n</ul> \n<p>This project explores the practical ways these theoretical tensions are playing out in the way universities are engaging with a number of socially excluded communities. Central to the research is the idea that what unifies all three visions of a university is that the university is a learning community, and reach out need bring socially excluded actors into these learning communities as full participants. </p> \n<p>The research will explore concrete university projects - in poorer British regions and nations – actively involving socially excluded groups. The focus will be how this is developing new learning and knowledge capacities in socially-excluded participants, using detailed place-based qualitative studies of communities engagement and co-evolution with universities’ own engagement activities.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-171-25-0028","grantId":"RES-171-25-0028","fundValue":"136792","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  DownPaul  Benneworth","coPersons":["David Robert Charles"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
