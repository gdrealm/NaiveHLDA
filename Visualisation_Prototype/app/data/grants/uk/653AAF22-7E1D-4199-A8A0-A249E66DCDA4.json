The thousands of proteins that are produced within a single cell interact to drive a multitude of pathways, such as cell growth and division. Protein modifications can enhance protein diversity beyond that encoded at the DNA level. For example, many proteins are modified by the attachment of the fatty acid palmitate, a process termed palmitoylation.\n\nCommunication between neurons, specialised cells in the brain, underlies every movement, thought and sensation; this neuronal communication occurs at specialised sites termed synapses. Palmitoylation of several proteins that are essential for neuronal communication mediates their targeting to synapses; modulating the extent of this targeting affects synaptic communication. It is well established that changes in synaptic communication are important for events such as learning and memory. Despite the importance of palmitoylation for normal synaptic function, there is very little known about how the enzymes that mediate palmitoylation reactions are regulated in neurons. Recent work identified a family of 24 'DHHC' proteins that are responsible for essentially all cellular palmitoylation activity. The importance of DHHC proteins for normal brain function is highlighted by work linking genetic mutations in these proteins with schizophrenia and mental retardation.\n\nThis research project will focus on DHHC2, which is one of the most highly expressed DHHC proteins in brain. Furthermore, DHHC2 is targeted to synaptic regions, where it has been shown to palmitoylate a protein called PSD95; this protein plays an important role in stabilising neurotransmitter receptors and is therefore essential for synaptic communication. Palmitoylation of PSD95 by DHHC2 leads to an increase in synaptic targeting of PSD95, which in turn affects synaptic dynamics of neurotransmitter receptors. In this project, we will investigate the mechanisms that regulate DHHC2 movement to synapses where it palmitoylates PSD95. Furthermore, we will examine how interfering with the mobility of DHHC2 at synapses impacts neuronal communication. This work will play a major role in delineating how palmitoylation dynamics are regulated at synapses and the downstream effects of this regulation on neurotransmitter receptor dynamics.\n\nThere is currently much interest in DHHC proteins as potential drug targets for the treatment of diverse human disorders, thus delineating the mechanisms whereby specific DHHC proteins regulate cellular dynamics is of major importance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J006432/1","grantId":"BB/J006432/1","fundValue":"389492","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  At present research is on basic biological mechanisms  ","person":"Luke Haydn Chamberlain","coPersons":["Trevor  Bushell"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":" This grant started in November 2012. Our research is focussed on an enzyme known as &quot;zDHHC2&quot;, which plays an important role in the physiology of neurons in the brain. In particular, the regulated movement of this enzyme into specific compartments of neuronal cells is important for &quot;synaptic plasticity&quot;, a process that is thought to underlie learning and memory. Our research has identified the signals within this protein that control its regulated movement. Furthermore, we have identified potential ways in which these signals are regulated.\nThis research deepens our understanding of the molecular basis of neuronal communication in the brain and also highlights novel sorting signals that are likely to control the movement of many other cellular proteins. At present, our research is likely to be relevant to many other people working in Cell Biology and Neuroscience- in particular, the identification of novel sorting signals is likely to impact on the research of many other groups working in these fields.
