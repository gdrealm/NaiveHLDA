New approaches to cell-based analysis are required to meet the demanding needs of cell-biology, genetics and experimental therapeutics. At the core is the need to convert images into numbers, this is a significant challenge which would greatly enhance the ability of the biologist to effectively interrogate and interpret complex data. To achieve large-scale imaging experiments we need to address critical issues of data bottlenecks. High-throughput screening instrumentation has been available in the commercial sector for the last five years, therefore the objective is to bring these capabilities to academia. Such equipment not only greatly augments research capacity but provides new opportunities taking a systems approach to cell-biology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E012574/1","grantId":"BB/E012574/1","fundValue":"239468","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The award of the JREI and its impact has been to enable the advanced screening of new drug, new reagents that will be of direct benefit to the healthcare industry Healthcare ","person":"Rachel Jane Errington","coPersons":["Paul James Smith"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" Cell-based assays derived from timelapse microscopy demand unique solutions enabling image acquisition, image encoding and interrogation of spatio-temporal cellular events in a population context. High-resolution imaging of live cells leads to bottlenecks in data handling and data analysis which have thus far restricted though-put for single cell analysis at Cardiff. The overall objective of this research equipment initiative was to address this critical issue of time-based high-content screening at the School of Medicine (SOM), Cardiff University. This research equipment iallowed us to take an integrated approach to meet the current and projected user demands and capacity. \n\n\n\nObjective 1: To build capacity for five screening systems at Cardiff BioImaging each with unique specifications. This consists of three core features (i) to transform existing timelapse instruments for screening, (ii) to obtain new spectral imaging capabilities (iii) to obtain a new 5D multi-parameter acquisition instrument incorporating image deconvolution capabilities.\n\n\n\nObjective 2: To develop the capacity for high-level integrated image analysis, informatics and data-mining.\n\n\n\nObjective 3: To provide universally supported and centrally accessed image and data management systems, providing a comprehensive platform for optimising image work flow including image archiving, retrieval and analysis audit trailing.\n\n\n\nObjective 4: To provide scientific training to users in microscopy, advanced cell-based assay development and bioinformatics. \n\n\n\nObjective 5: To work in collaboration with our project sponsor to develop high-through-put dynamic cell-based assays. Feedback and collaboration with academics has provided the equipment manufacturers and collaboration partner with the information they needed to improve existing products to meet the needs of their customers. In this case Molecular Devices (UK) Ltd has developed new software to allow us to incorporate a spectral imaging camera with our microscope configuration. It also enabled us to link the camera to acquisition software from a different manufacturer to process the data. The new capability has since been incorporated into different products sold by the company. &quot;This link between our software, Metamorph, and the third party software was a new thing for us which, without this JREI in placel, we wouldn't have developed.&quot; The screening microscopy equipment has been used and accessed by industry users and collaborators, for validation purposes and for optimising new probes.
