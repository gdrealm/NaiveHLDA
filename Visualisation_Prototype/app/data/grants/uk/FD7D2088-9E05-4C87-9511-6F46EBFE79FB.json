Poverty, social networks and social support amongst older people in Central Asia and the Cauc","abstractText":"<p>The break-up of the Soviet Union and the subsequent transition to market-led economies has been accompanied by a decade of economic and social upheaval on an unprecedented scale. Older people face particular challenges. Having lived their entire working lives under a paternal and relatively generous welfare system, they now find themselves in later life facing a new world – politically, economically, socially, psychologically and physically. </p>\n\n<p>This project examines the living conditions and sources of finance and social support (both state and family) amongst older people living in the seven poorest countries of the former Soviet Union – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan (referred to as the CIS-7).&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The project involves a mixed method design, combining quantitative analysis of the living standards of older people of recently available household survey data, with qualitative research providing deep insight into the reality of life for older people today. Obtaining greater insight into how the lives of older people have been affected by the socio-economic transformations of the last 15 years, and relative role of the state and family in both providing support to and benefiting from the contribution of, older people will aid the formulation of poverty alleviation programmes.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0191","grantId":"RES-167-25-0191","fundValue":"196712","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Cecelia Falkingham","coPersons":["Maria  Evandrou"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
