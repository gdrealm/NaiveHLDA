{"id":"FEE48794-850B-45DE-98C7-7F343AB0D829","title":"Increasing the use of large scale social surveys in undergraduate dissertations in the Social Sciences: a pilot project","abstractText":"<p>Training in quantitative methods now forms a compulsory element of most undergraduate programmes in the social sciences, but very few students build on this, for example by applying quantitative methods in their final year dissertations. In the context of the UK social scienceâ€™s known skills shortage in this area, this represents a major concern. It also represents a lost opportunity given the excellent resources of quantitative data now available to students (such as the Government surveys disseminated via the Economic and Social Data Service). </p>\n\n<p>This project will design and pilot (on a group of Sociology students) a training module with the specific objective of encouraging and supporting participating students to carry out final year dissertations using a large scale social data set. This will comprise a series of workshops designed to inform and enthuse students about the range and relevance of data resources as well as equipping them with the skills required to access and analyze data. Graduate Teaching Assistants will then provide one-to-one support via a series of drop-in clinics run for the duration of the dissertation study period. The training package will be externally evaluated, and all materials disseminated widely for use by&nbsp; teachers and students elsewhere.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E016855/1","grantId":"ES/E016855/1","fundValue":"58462","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Angela  DaleMark Simon Brown","coPersons":["Josephine Clare Wathan","Vanessa  Higgins"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
