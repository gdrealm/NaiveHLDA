Each electrode detects the signal from multiple cells in its vicinity, and the small, brief 'spike' events they generate can be hard to distinguish beneath the background noise.\n\nThis research has developed a platform technology that converts the raw signal observed at the electrodes into a stream of identified spike events suitable for subsequent processing by conventional digital microelectronics. This means that neural activity can be used to directly control (in real time) an external device. This could in the future, for example, be used in a brain machine interface to control a prosthetic arm via thought.\n\nSpecific project outcomes include:\n\n- Investigating the effect of front-end electronics on spike sorting performance (classification accuracy) and determining the different component parameter sensitivities. \n\n- Optimizing spike sorting parameters to achieve good computational efficiency (minimizing complexity whilst maintaining good accuracy).\n\n- Prototyping several novel integrated devices, circuits and systems for neural recording and real-time, hardware efficient spike processing (spike detection, feature extraction and classification) and power management.\n\n- Developing a standalone, bespoke integrated platform for facilitating spike streaming (i.e. interfacing to electrodes and recording neural spikes together with real time spike detection, feature extraction, clustering).\n\n- Securing the background intellectual property to this invention.\n\n\nAll the project outcomes listed above have/are in process of been disseminated in peer reviewed publications (available open access via our institutional library portal).\n\nOngoing and future research will concentrate on further optimizing the platform that have already been developed for a wider deployment in neuroscience laboratories. We are currently in the process of licensing our technology to commercial partners such that our research outcomes can directly benefit the community.
