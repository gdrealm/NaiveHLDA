{"id":"B45FC125-3933-4F48-83FB-7CFC639ED44C","title":"Development of data packages for registration of novel nematicides based on essential oil formulations","abstractText":"Project partners Barrier Biotech Ltd (BB), Syngenta Ltd (SYN) and the John Innes Centre (JIC) are applying for funding to develop novel nematocide products based on essential oil formulations. These formulations will target nematodes affecting arable root crops and substitute existing commercial nematicides coming off the market due to changes in the Plant Protection Products Directive (91/414/EEC). BB has extensive commercial experience with plant oils and has preliminary evidence suggesting that their patented formulations can control nematode problems within both agricultural and horticultural crops. Natural formulations provide efficacy at low concentrations; represent a minimal risk for the environment; will enhance user safety and are likely to provide more durable pest control due to the complexity of chemical composition and naturally occurring variability. The project aims to develop dossiers for CRD and/or DG SANCO registration of novel nematicide formulations. These dossiers will be the foundation of the development of marketable commercial products designed to cut losses in yield, reduce wastage and costs within the supply chain and promote cost effective and secure solutions within UK agriculture. Notably, potato cyst nematode costs the UK potato industry alone an estimated 43m/year. Damage caused by nematodes worldwide is estimated annually at $80-$125 bn. New formulations could replace 20-30% of the existing non-fumigant products on the $1 billion global nematicide market. These formulations are likely to be effective against nematodes on other major agricultural crops such as sugar beet, tomato and cucumber for which separate funding will be required.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/I001212/1","grantId":"TS/I001212/1","fundValue":"123048","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian David Bedford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
