{"id":"CB9D4DAE-4336-4F93-9E12-B71D0E304430","title":"Stargazing Oxfordshire: University Researchers and Community Astronomers bringing Space Science to the Public","abstractText":"Our aims are:\n\n1. To educate and inspire audiences from diverse backgrounds via access to the night sky with large and small telescopes;\n2. To promote and demystify current astronomical research and the scientific method;\n3. To support public involvement in observational astronomy, via their local community astronomy groups;\n4. To bring together teachers, pupils and youth groups with graduate researchers;\n5. To establish a community astronomy network, with the observatories in Oxford and Marlborough as central nodes.\n\nThe project will directly impact over 2000 people, most of which do not normally feel the benefit of living near a top-ranked research university. This direct impact will be in the form of science education, introducing them to the methods and results of scientific research, and allowing them to explore these concepts via hands-on activities. In particular, our central theme is astronomical observing. The sense of wonderment at the night sky is shared by all people: for us, it is a hook, allowing us to show how progress can be made through rational enquiry in the face of the unknown. The majority of the people we impact in this way will be schoolchildren of all ages, either on schools visits or attending open events with their families. Our impact is in illustrating, complementing and reinforcing concepts taught in schools by placing them in the context of astronomical exploration.\n\nThe project will indirectly impact many more people beyond these 2000. Those who attend our events, and absorb some of the messages outlined above, will propagate those messages in their own informal social networks. We see evidence of this via our online social network which simply reflects this process in miniature: the total reach of our web postings is approximately a factor of 5 greater than the number of people appearing as regular followers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K002740/1","grantId":"ST/K002740/1","fundValue":"6000","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Fraser  Clarke","coPersons":["Roger L Davies"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
