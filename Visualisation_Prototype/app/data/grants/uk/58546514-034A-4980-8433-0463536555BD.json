{"id":"58546514-034A-4980-8433-0463536555BD","title":"Transforming Citizenship? The EU, Electoral Rights and the Restructuring of European Political Space","abstractText":"Under EU law, all citizens of the Member States have a right to vote and stand in local and European Parliment elections, wherever they are resident in the EU. This is one of the limited number of rights granted as part of citizenship of the Union. This study examines the implementation of these rights, and looks at how they interact with other debates about immigration and the status of non-nationals, including those from non-EU Member States. EU electoral rights are part of a process of transformation of citizenship more generally within the EU's legal and political framework.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112661/1","grantId":"112661/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-10","fundEnd":"2006-05-09","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The work found that it was possible to bring together two linked areas of theory about citizenship and membership, namely those theories which look at the distinction between citizen and non-citizen, or alien, and which question whether that distinction is becoming fuzzier, and those theories which surround the boundaries of the suffrage, that is who can vote (and stand) in elections. Having brought these areas of theory together, the project constructed an analytical framework to examine in detail cases in which EU law and national law grant, or deny, electoral rights to non-nationals. One of the strengths of the project's finding thus lies in the blending together of cases grounded in both EU public law and national public law, since all too frequently these areas of law are considered separately, with insufficient attention to looking at the links between them.The research does not make the case, as such, for more 'alien suffrage', that is, for there to be more cases in which non-nationals can vote in elections to be extended. It is not useful necessarily to focus on the normative debate, as this can be reductionist. On the contrary, the research piloted an approach which looks at the role of law as both driver and reactive force, in constructing the incremental institutional steps which bring about change at the national and the EU level.
