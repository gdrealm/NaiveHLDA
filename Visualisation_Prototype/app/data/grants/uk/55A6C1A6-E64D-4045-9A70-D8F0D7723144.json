These brain tumours are one of the most lethal malignancies. Despite progress in neurosurgery, radiation and chemotherapy, little progress has been made in the treatment of these tumours. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.\n\nGene therapy is an attractive approach for cancer treatment. Glioblastomas were one of the earliest targets of cancer gene therapy, but the first clinical trials were not successful because of the inefficient delivery of therapeutic genes into the tumours. Thus, there is a need to develop new vector systems that are safe and able to provide strong expression of the therapeutic genes within the tumours. To achieve these two goals, these vectors need to be specifically targeted to the tumour tissue.\n\nWe have recently showed that combination of attributes of various viruses resulted in the generation of hybrid viral vectors for efficient and targeted systemic gene therapy. We will use this strategy to generate a novel hybrid vector for targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to glioblastoma.\n\nThese approaches could result in the derivation of a targeted vector system which would represent a major advance in the management and therapy of human glioblastoma.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701159","grantId":"G0701159","fundValue":"436217","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Amin  Hajitou","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
