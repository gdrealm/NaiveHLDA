This builds directly on our current AHRC project 'Our Data Ourselves' (http://big-social-data.net/), which studies the content we generate on our mobile devices, what we call 'big social data' (BSD), and explores the possibilities of its ethical storage. We will progress this research by engaging the cultural and technological elements entailed in the ethical sharing of that data. Our proposal addresses a basic research question: How do we transform BSD into open data, and in turn, empower the digital human and cultivate new data communities?\nThere are basic contradictions here that necessitate our cultural-technological approach. On the one hand, (meta)data is private data, digital traces identifying who, what, where and when. This is data already deeply embedded in digital enterprises and the security state as a source of both economic value and surveillance. Yet, it remains largely out of the hands of the everyday use of those who produce it. On the other hand, (meta)data is more than just a source of economic value or surveillance; it reveals a surprising breadth and depth of cultural activities. In identifying the who, what, where and when, these digital traces offer innovative approaches to the core of arts and humanities research. \nWe posit this new form of born-digital content as constitutive of the paradigmatic contemporary figure of what we call the 'digital human'. Our research proceeds on the premise that culture only ever unfolds in a technologically mediated environment and that the human is constituted therein. What is unique about the digital human is the ubiquity of our intimate relationship with technology and our existential expression in the discrete digital form of metadata. What remains largely unexplored is the multivalent potential manifested in this supersaturated data-state of being.\nThe main vector of our research amplification is in approaching such born-digital cultural content via the model of open data. Open data refers to data available for anyone to use for any purpose and free of cost. Open data should be in formats that are interoperable, that is, it can be linked, and thus easily shared, in a standard and structured format for easy reuse. Open data is critically important for adding value to our existing research project because it is designed to realise the potential of data. If, as we claim, the digital human is always already in a constitutive relationship with technology, then metadata needs to do more than provide raw material to digital enterprise and surveillance fodder. Open data is one way to expand the potential of data, its application to big social data facilitates an open data culture and helps to empower the digital human.\nWe will make significant and innovative contributions through a twofold amplification strategy. First, we will develop an open linked data framework to effectively embed anonymised born digital cultural data. Our technological research will develop proof-of-concept demonstrators that investigate the use of advanced anonymisation technologies for publishing cultural data. This will be done by our Research Associate in collaboration with Dr. Tom Heath, the head of research at the Open Data Institute. Second, we will investigate what cultural research can still do with such an anonymised resource, making possible fundamental humanistic research and the investigation of (meta)data in the context of the material turn in cultural and media studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M002551/1","grantId":"AH/M002551/1","fundValue":"64479","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Edward  Cot√©","coPersons":["Tobias  Blanke"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
