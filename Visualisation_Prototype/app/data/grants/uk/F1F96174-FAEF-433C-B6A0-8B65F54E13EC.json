{"id":"F1F96174-FAEF-433C-B6A0-8B65F54E13EC","title":"Bond energies of weakly bound molecules","abstractText":"The rate of reaction of elementary bimolecular reactions in the gas phase is usually determined by the height of the energy barrier between reagents and products. Most reactions proceed exponentially faster as the temperature is raised according to the Arrhenius rate law. This is because the fraction of molecules with sufficient energy to surmount the barrier is determined by the Boltzmann distribution function. Some reactions however exhibit a negative temperature dependence in which the rate of reaction increases as the temperature decreases. This so-called non Arrhenius behaviour occurs when the reaction is barrierless. An interesting class of reactions show Arrhenius behaviour at high temperatures but also speed up at low temperatures. This behaviour is attributed to the existence of long range weakly bound complexes in the entrance channel due to van der Waals forces between the reagents, and an important class of reactions which often exhibit this behaviour are those between radicals and molecules. These reactions are of particular importance in the cold environments of the tropopause of the earth's atmosphere, the atmospheres of the gaseous planets and some of their moons, and in the gas clouds surrounding young stars in interstellar space. Recently it has become possible to trap these weakly bound species in the laboratory and to study their properties. An experiment carried out at the University of Pennsylvania by Marsha Lester and her co-workers measures the infrared absorption spectra of these complexes by exciting them with a pulse of infrared radiation and observing one of the resulting fragments as the complex is heated using laser induced fluorescence. By calculating the energy difference between the energy of the dissociating photon and the maximum internal energy observed in the photofragment they are able to deduce an upper bound for the bond dissociation energy of the complex. In the case of the hydrotrioxy radical, HO-OO, the value they so obtain is large enough that in the upper earth atmosphere about a quarter of the OH radicals would be expected to be complexed with molecular oxygen and if true would provoke a significant rethink of our understanding of the chemistry of the tropopause. Theory on the other hand predicts a bond dissociation energy for HO-OO that is about half the value suggested by the experiment. The reason for the discrepancy is most probably due to the assumption that the dissociation is barrierless and what is required is a direct measurement of the bond energy of the complex. We propose to do this using a technique called velocity map imaging. Even though we are fairly confident that we understand the reason for the apparent discrepency between theory and experiment in the case of the hydrotrioxy radical, our experiment would be the first direct measurement of the dissociation energy and would provide the essential data needed to assess the true atmospheric importance of the species. More generally we propose to study a number of other similar complexes and obtain accurate data on their dissociation dynamics by measuring properties such as the internal energy distribution in the photoproducts and correlations between their recoil velocity vectors and rotational angular momenta. The principal output of our research will be to provide data on the bond energies of these complexes which may be compared to quantum mechanical electronic structure calculations and fed into chemical kinetic models of the reactions of radicals and molecules.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I011749/1","grantId":"EP/I011749/1","fundValue":"377637","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Two PhD, one MPhil and two MChem project students who contributed to the project received training in laser spectroscopy, optics, vacuum technology, charged particle detection and software engineering.

To this end we needed to develop and refine our existing velocity map imaging (VMI) spectrometer (a) by modifying the molecular beam source to produce the radical by electrical discharge or by photolysis of an OH precursor and subsequent reaction with O2 in the throat of the expansion and (b) by developing a tunable vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) light source for the detection of OH radicals by resonantly enhanced two photon ionization (REMPI). We succeeded in later task but, so far, not the first. We have however used the instrument to measure the bond dissociation energy of NOCl and CH3ONO. In the latter case uncovering hitherto unknown competing dissociation channels, producing NO2, CH3 and CH2O photofragments. \n\n\n\nThe VUV REMPI scheme for OH detection was tested on a kinetics time-of-flight mass-spectrometer (TOF-MS) where the generation of significant radical (e.g. OH) concentrations is routine. Frequency tripling of a dye laser was performed in Xe/Ar gas mixtures to generate 122 nm light and OH was detected through a 1(122 nm)+1'(366 nm) REMPI scheme. The kinetics of the reaction of OH with CH3CHO/O2 was measured. Another REMPI scheme was also investigated based on an alternative 1(281nm)+1'(118nm) scheme. This was at least as good as the 122 nm scheme, and has the potential of being an order of magnitude better; tested with only a weak 281 nm light source. We conclude that frequency tripling schemes are certainly generating &amp;gt;10^10 VUV photons / pulse and it is the low radical density in the VM machine that is the main problem. A new compact VM machine has been comissioned but wil require additional funding if we are to achieve our original goal. The non-academic context for this fundamental research is normally through news and media channels. Recent work by colleagues in the School of Chemistry on usual OH reactions was highlighted in a main article in New Scientist: Cosmic Chemistry: Life's molecules are made in space 21 (October 2013) implicating OH chemistry being involved in unexpected places. If we can detect OH in our VMI appartus we would have the potential to probe the dynamics (mechanism) of these reactions as well as their kinetics. The VUV source has been used to detect OH radicals in a discharge flow apparatus attached to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and is being applied to kinetic studies of various gas phase reactions of importance in atmospheric and combustion chemistry. We are currently assessing the potential impact of the newly discovered photophoducts from methyl nitrite (CH3ONO) on tropospheric chemistry models. We believe that we are close to developing a reliable photolytic source of radicals which we plan to test by producing HONO and detecting the NO photoproduct. \n\n\n\nThe co-I has recently been funded by NERC to look at peroxy radical photolysis in the atmosphere, and while the thrust of this project will involve OH detection via the sensitive laser induced fluorescence technique rather than VUV REMPI, knowledge of this potentially very important atmospheric process could also be obtained via the VM technique.
