However, many of these tools rely upon the availability of nanostructured materials - materials consisting of precisely engineered structures - that are difficult to make, and require the availability of expensive and complex instrumentation. For many applications involving molecular and biological materials, these difficulties are daunting. A good illustration is the development of nanooptical techniques for biological analysis: there are now some extraordinarily powerful methods available, that use phenomena such as the plasmonic enhancement of optical activity, and surface enhanced Raman scattering, to make biological detection possible at very high sensitivities. However, the potential for uptake of these methodologies in society (for example, in the National Health Service) is limited unless inexpensive methods can be found for the precise fabrication of miniaturized structures over large areas. The goal of this project is to make that possible, be developing a fast, inexpensive approach to the fabrication of hybrid metal-biomolecule structures. Our preliminary work shows that simple monolayer chemistries can be developed and used in conjunction with interference techniques - that require only a laser and a few lenses - to provide exquisite control over surface structure on length scales down to a few tens of nm - approaching the dimensions of single biomolecules. We aim to try to build a sensor capable of detecting small amounts of DNA that could be the basis for a cheap chip-based screening technique that might be introduced quickly an inexpensively in the NHS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H050132/1","grantId":"EP/H050132/1","fundValue":"556892","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Leggett","coPersons":["J  Green","Tim  Richardson"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" It has been known for some time that the unusual optical properties of noble metal nanoparticles are useful for the detection and analysis of biological molecules. In particular, there are strong plasmon absorptions associated with gold nanoparticles, resulting from strong coupling between light waves and the surface electrons in the gold. Optically active molecules (for example, ones that emit fluorescence) may exhibit greatly enhanced optical activity when placed close to such particles. This offers the potential to deliver large increases in sensitivity. However, there are challenges associated with the fabrication of such structures. The two alternate approaches are to use electron beam lithography and related techniques, which are extremely precise but very expensive, or to use colloidal lithography, which is inexpensive but gives poor control of particle morphology. For nanostructured metals to be useful in sensors and diagnostics in the NHS, it is necessary to find an inexpensive but flexible route to their fabrication. This is what we have done in this grant. Using a technique based on laser interference, we have discovered how to fabricate dense arrays of nanoparticles, displaying a very high degree of perfection, of macroscopic (square cm) areas. The method is simple, using only a few components besides the laser, and inexpensive. It does not require clean-room conditions. Particularly importantly, we have discovered how to produce re-useable nanostructure arrays. We have samples that have been in repeated re-use for periods of years; after each use the sample is simply cleaned in a solution of strong oxidising agent and rinsed, and is then ready to use. Using the flexibility of the interference technique, we have been able to fabricate a very broad range of types of structures, with different dimensions, morphologies and periods. We have assembled a combinatorial library of 200 specimens that are all reusable and with which we can screen easily for the particle array that gives the best sensitivity for the analyte of interest. We are now exploring ways to develop this methodology for commercialisation, and we have also translated the methodology into a major EPSRC programme grant focussed on the development of biologically-inspired systems for solar energy harvesting. We believe that the re-useability of our arrays, combined with their low cost, makes them ideal candidates for translation into applications in the NHS. One example of a possible application area is in screening for cancer. We are currently exploring possibilities to take the work forward in that direction.
