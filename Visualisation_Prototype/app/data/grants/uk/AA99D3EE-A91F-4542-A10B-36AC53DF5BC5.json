{"id":"AA99D3EE-A91F-4542-A10B-36AC53DF5BC5","title":"Improved Access to Abortion, Neonatal Mortality, and Gender Bias: Evidence from Nepal.","abstractText":"<p>There is evidence from the United States that the legalisation of abortion has led to a significant reduction in neonatal and infant mortality. However, no research to date has been able to disentangle between effects of improved access to abortion at the household- and cohort-levels; there is no evidence for developing countries; and existing studies of the impact of abortion legalisation on early life health in the United States are not unanimous.</p>\n\n<p>Nepal initiated a drastic abortion reform in 2002. Moreover, because abortion facilities were made available to the public, the change in the law was not purely de jure. This research will collect data on local availability of abortion services, which opened at different times over a two-year period across the country. Combined with existing data sources, this information will allow estimating the effect of improved access to abortion more precisely, holding constant a number of potentially confounding factors. It will also compare neonatal mortality occurrence between siblings born before and those born after the opening of a nearby legal abortion centre, compare the effect on boys and girls, and estimate whether there is any evidence of improved access to abortion leading to sex-selective abortions.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H00890X/1","grantId":"ES/H00890X/1","fundValue":"20082","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings of this research had an impact on stakeholders from the NGO sector, Nepalese government, and international organisations present at the dissemination workshop which took place in Kathmandu in September 2010, and through them to their respective institutions.

In this context, the finding that legal abortion centres in Nepal do not affect parental investments in neonatal health despite contributing to reducing fertility is striking and contributes to gathering momentum for the rethinking of the way economists understand decisions related to fertility and investments in the health and education of children, adding to recent work by, e.g., Black, Devereux and Salvanes (Quarterly Journal of Economics , 2005) and Angrist, Lavy and Schlosser (Journal of Labor Economics, 2010).\n\nThe second key contribution pertains to the growing but still scant body of knowledge concerned with the rising phenomenon of sex-selective abortions. The finding that improved access to first-trimester abortion in Nepal did not contribute to skewing sex ratios is an important one in this context. Indeed, this finding has highlighted a new potential theoretical mechanism through which improved access to gender-blind abortion might in fact reduce sex-selective abortions for parents who do not have a marked preference for aborting a female or a male fetus. Other researchers in Economics and related fields might build upon this work to understand further how households make decisions regarding investments in neonatal health and sex-selective abortions.\n\nFrom society's perspective, the findings of this research had an impact on stakeholders from the NGO sector, Nepalese government, and international organisations present at the dissemination workshop which took place in Kathmandu in September 2010, and through them to their respective institutions.
