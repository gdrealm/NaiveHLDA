This issue has hardly been addressed in the literature.</p>\n\n<p>This research will ask:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>How do the potential gains from marriage (or loss of gains on divorce) anticipated by forward looking agents, and the process by which decisions are made within the household, affect consumption and saving decisions across the entire life-cycle, particularly in comparison to the traditional life-cycle model?</li>\n\n <li>How well can this model rationalise patterns in UK expenditure data?</li>\n\n <li>What are the estimates of consumption economies of scale to marriage from this model when it is simulated on UK data?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>As this is a novel area of research, the initial focus will be on one life-stage transition: single to couple. The techniques developed will ultimately be applicable to other transitions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J005754/1","grantId":"ES/J005754/1","fundValue":"80588","fundStart":"2012-01-31","fundEnd":"2014-01-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Laura Emily Blow","coPersons":["Martin  Browning","Mette  Ejrnaes"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
