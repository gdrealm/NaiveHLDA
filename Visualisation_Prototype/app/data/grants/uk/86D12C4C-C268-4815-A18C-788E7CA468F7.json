Dr Payne and Dr Chavez have been working so far on software for the simulation of the modules and their physics performance, on optimization of the design, on detector QA preparations, and on physics studies preparing data analysis from the (international) T2K experiment over the next five years. The position of the two RAs are being renewed for a year using recently approved STFC bridging funds, and they will provide all the support at their level at Liverpool for the calorimeter construction, as well as to the rest of the UK collaboration (8 institutes).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G003300/1","grantId":"ST/G003300/1","fundValue":"147495","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Christos  Touramanis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
