{"id":"0417F134-F408-4E2C-8A4D-BEEAE2305D94","title":"The Universal Short Title Catalogue 1450-1650","abstractText":"The invention of printing was one of the crucial technological milestones in the creation of modern European society. It facilitated the generalisation of reading, the dissemination of scientific knowledge, the creation of an information society and the growth of public opinion.\\n\\nThe Universal Short Title Catalogue is the first comprehensive survey of all books published in the period 1450-1650: the first two hundred years after the invention of printing. It will present, in a searchable database accessible free to all users, data on over 700,000 editions published in more than 20 languages. It will provide the locations of over 3.5 million surviving copies in some 6,000 libraries and archives. Crucially the database will also provide links to the many thousands of editions made available by recent digitisation projects. Instead of having to locate and then travel to see these very rare texts, users will be able to access them from their desktop.\\n\\nThe USTC will be an indispensable resource, and the first port of call, for all those interested in the history, literature, religion and culture of this period of European history. By gathering together information on all of Europe's printed books in one place, the USTC will bring to light previously unrecognised phenomena, such as the flow of text across national and linguistic boundaries, or the trans-national popularity of particular works or authors. A unique system of subject coding will allow users to search for all works of particular genres wherever they were published in Europe: the power and ease of these searches will facilitate any number of particular studies in the fields of literature, science and political writing. \\n\\nThe USTC documents the printed book in the first two centuries after the introduction of the new technology of mechanical book production: the last great media transformation before our own electronic age. In the first years the experimental technology was carried along on a wave of enthusiasm: but for the most part the books published in the first decades were texts familiar from the manuscript book world of the late mediaeval period. It was only in the sixteenth century that publishers began to experiment with new types of books for new classes of readers, offering a vastly expanded range of literature, practical handbooks, religious and political works. The early seventeenth century witnessed a further huge growth in pamphlet literature, stimulated by the great conflicts of the age: the Fronde, the Thirty Years' War, and the English Civil War. The early seventeenth century also saw the first experiments with periodical newssheets, adapting and reshaping an already buoyant market for news, entertainment and sensation.\\n\\nMany of the new genres of print were small ephemeral publications with an extremely low rate of survival. A high proportion of the books, pamphlets and broadsheets registered in the USTC are documented in only one located copy. Bringing together information on these unique items, scattered among libraries and archives around the world, has only become possible thanks to the transformation of resources in the new digital age, as libraries move towards the publication of on-line catalogues. The USTC team in St Andrews had developed new methodologies to capture, sieve and analyse this electronic data, moving to completion a project that in an earlier era would have scarcely been possible. When complete, the USTC will allow us for the first time to appreciate and study the full richness of this diverse, dynamic world of print: and its impact on society.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I026480/1","grantId":"AH/I026480/1","fundValue":"815400","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Pettegree","coPersons":["Malcolm Norman  Walsby","Matthew  McLean"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
