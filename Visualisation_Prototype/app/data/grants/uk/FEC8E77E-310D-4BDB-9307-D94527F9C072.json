French and English constitute part of Lebanese childrenâ€™s daily language use in both locations due to the sociolinguistic role that the two languages play in relation to education, social class, and religion. The structural differences between the three languages provide an interesting context for examining input and interaction factors in the acquisition of Arabic by monolingual and multilingual children.</p> \n<p>The specific objectives of the study will therefore be:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>To provide a comprehensive longitudinal study of the acquisition of Lebanese Arabic both alone and together with English and/or French by children aged 1 to 2 years growing up in Lebanon and the UK. </li>\n <li>To carry out a detailed study of three related phonological aspects: vowel lengthening, consonant gemination, and stress patterns in Lebanese Arabic.

A link was established between language choice by the parents and social factors (e.g. religion, education, language status), some of which transcended the geographical context (UK vs Lebanon). This in turn was reflected in language use by both parents and children, and highlighted the role of cultural practices and beliefs in language choice and language dominance/language loss. Given the scarcity of research on English-Arabic bilingualism and the need for norms for phonological development in this population, the PI was invited to deliver an invited presentation to speech and language pathologists at the annual American Speech-Hearing Association (ASHA) convention in 2013. This was part of a session on &quot;Cultural and linguistic considerations in language assessment and intervention for children of Arabic, Turkish and Persian Descent&quot;. Recommendations from this meeting regarding support for all languages of bilinguals were later written up for publication in a special issue of Perspectives, an ASHA publication that is aimed at speech and language therapy practitioners and that focusses on communication disorders in culturally and linguistically diverse populations. Since the project ended the PI has also been involved in two ESRC-funded seminar series which aimed to bring together professionals for various disciplines who are working with children who have English as an additional language in order to improve educational, psychological, social, and clinical provision for this population.

The focus was on the acquisition of contrastive duration in consonants and vowels, i.e. the ability to express different meaning by varying duration in words, e.g. 'bana' he built vs 'banna' coffee producer; 'katab' he wrote vs 'kaatab' he corresponded). Learning to control physical timing for grammatical purposes is a challenging task for the child due to their developing articulatory control and the lack of one-to-one correspondence between articulatory lengthening and phonological/grammatical consequences. Factors such as word/phrase-level stress, speech rate and syllable structure influence the duration of sounds, so the child needs to learn how to factor these variables into the perception/production of short/long segments. \nData from Lebanese-speaking children in this study suggest that such acquisition takes place early due to a collection of language-specific factors which increase the saliency of phonological length in Arabic. These include degree of elongation, number of sounds that can shortened/lengthened, their frequency of occurrence in spontaneous interactions, and their functional use beyond the vocabulary (e.g. to express changes in grammatical category). Early acquisition of length was exhibited in all the children despite varying degrees of exposure to English and French (which do not have contrastive consonant length). Qualitatively different learning trajectories were observed for Lebanon- and London-based children due to differences in the effect of language contact on the varieties being acquired. The project has provided the first set of much needed data on adult and child phonology in Arabic. Given its relatively modest scale, however, it paves the way for much larger studies both on adult Arab phonology and on monolingual and bilingual phonological acquisition of Arabic in conjunction with English and or French. In terms of the adult phonology, there are still many understudied aspects of Arabic phonology which not only pertain to segmental and suprasegmental aspects of speech but also to statistical regularities in sounds and sound sequences in the language and the way these are used by speakers/hearers. To look at this requires divergence from the model normally applied to languages with concatenative morphology, as the non-concatenative nature of Arabic requires a model of phonology which takes into consideration the role of prosodic phonology in the processing of vowels and consonants. In terms of child phonology, findings from this project could be expanded to look at all aspects of phonological acquisition (this study only looked at contrastive vowel and consonant length) with the view to provide norms for early phonological development of Arabic as a 1st language and to build monolingual and bilingual phonological assessments.
