However, this apparent wealth of new drugs has masked the true reason for this explosion, simply the bacteria were becoming resistant to each drug as it was being introduced. We did not know how to use the antibiotics in a manner to prevent the emergence of resistance because we did not understand how resistance really develops within the clinical population. Carbapenems are the final major antibiotic group that can effectively treat infections caused by A. baumannii. This project aims to understand how carbapenem resistance caused by OXA beta-lactamases develops within A. baumannii, not just at the molecular level but also within a species. It aims to question the belief that resistant bacteria are simply sensitive bacteria that acquire resistance but rather they derive from sub-populations of bacteria selected during therapy. If we can determine how this resistance enters and spreads through the population, we shall be in a better position to control it.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501433","grantId":"G0501433","fundValue":"290712","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sebastian Giles Becket Amyes","coPersons":["Kevin  Towner","Susan  Brown"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
