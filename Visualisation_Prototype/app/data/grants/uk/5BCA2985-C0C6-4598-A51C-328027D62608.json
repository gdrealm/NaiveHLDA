The network embraces a wide range of disciplines, with a strong core in language-based disciplines, which gives the network a distinctive, internationally comparative dimension, and illuminates the interpenetration of cultures from within. Themes include intercultural communication, cultural memory, representation, and diasporic subjectivities, across a spectrum of modes of migration, from refugee studies, through border studies and language contact to transnational cinema and 'queer diasporas'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119544/1","grantId":"119544/1","fundValue":"19231","fundStart":"2006-01-02","fundEnd":"2008-01-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Encarnacion  Gutierrez Rodriguez","coPersons":["Margaret  Littler"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
