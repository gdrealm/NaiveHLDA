Although some aspects of the cognitive ‘phenotype’ of autism have been well characterised, to date the approach to identifying the profile of strengths and impairments has been piecemeal. Few studies have included children across the breadth of the autism spectrum, most have employed small samples and none to date has employed a population-representative sample. The proposed study represents a significant step forward for cognitive research in the UK in terms of the size and representativeness of the sample, the broad range of cognitive domains studied, the focus on studying cognitive in tandem with behaviour and the link to recognised clinical subtypes of autism. The study will establish the cognitive domains (social orientation, emotion processing, theory of mind, executive function, central coherence, perceptual processing) in which impairments are associated with the core behavioural features of autism spectrum disorders (social reciprocity, communication, repetitive behaviours). In addition, the study will allow us to test if meaningful subgroups exist with broader autistic spectrum.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400065","grantId":"G0400065","fundValue":"370472","fundStart":"2005-01-10","fundEnd":"2008-07-09","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Richard Charman","coPersons":["Gillian  Baird","Emily  Simonoff","Francesca Gabrielle Happe","Andrew Richard Pickles"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
