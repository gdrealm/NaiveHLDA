{"id":"BA973670-06A9-4AC5-A8BE-1C48B31627EC","title":"Characterisation of candidate therapeutic targets for Huntington disease","abstractText":"Huntington disease is a fatal hereditary disorder that is characterised by the formation of lesions in the brain. It is a late onset disease in which patients exhibit involuntary movements, rigidity, and dementia. Though a great amount of work has been focused on this disease in recent years, no effective therapy is yet available for Huntington disease. \nGenetic analysis in bakers yeast has been used extensively as a fast and easy approach to study genetics and cellular processes. We have previously used a yeast model of Huntington disease to identify a candidate therapeutic target for this disease, which has recently been validated in preclinical trials in a mouse model of Huntington disease. \nHere, we propose to validate additional candidate therapeutic targets identified in yeast in mammalian cells. In addition, we will use yeast to characterise the genetic interactions among the identified modifiers. Ultimately, we feel this work will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in Huntington disease as well as inform novel therapeutic approaches for this disorder.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700090","grantId":"G0700090","fundValue":"337752","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Flaviano  Giorgini","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
