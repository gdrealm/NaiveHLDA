It focuses on the cellular mechanisms that are involved in the formation of the complex arrangement and interconnection of the neurons within this system. During the process of development, neurons extend neuronal processes, which seek out the cells that they need to establish connection with. Following contact with their target, synapses are assembled which allow the communication between neurons. Rather than being stable structures, synapses are dynamic and continuously undergo shape changes. These changes in shape are controlled by changes in the cytoskeleton, which mainly consists of actin filaments. Indeed, direct interference with the actin filaments blocks shape changes of the synapse and impairs neuronal communication. Through changes in intracellular lipid signalling, the phosphatase PTEN is known to alter the morphology of synapses. In fact, many neurological conditions are associated with a deregulation of this signalling pathway. What is not known, however, is how this signalling pathway controls changes of the actin cytoskeleton, leading to altered synapse shapes. This research will investigate the mechanisms that control the actin cytoskeleton during changes in lipid signalling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F015321/1","grantId":"BB/F015321/1","fundValue":"343755","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Britta Johanna Eickholt","coPersons":["Madeline  Parsons"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
