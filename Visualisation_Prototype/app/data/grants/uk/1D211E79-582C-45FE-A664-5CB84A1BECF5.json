Psychological research has demonstrated that how people behave is influenced by perceptions of how other people behave in similar situations and by the opinions of others about what is appropriate behaviour in a given context.</p>\n\n<p>In relation to eating behaviour, people look to others as a guide for how much to eat and the presence of other people in eating situations can guide food selection. This suggests that one way of encouraging healthier eating is to provide information about the healthy eating habits of others. This approach has been used successfully to reduce unhealthy consumption of alcoholic drinks but has yet to be applied to eating behaviour.&nbsp;To address this, a series of experiments will be conducted in which participants will be exposed to posters and flyers that provide information about the healthy eating behaviour of others. Effects on actual food selection in a simulated caf&eacute; environment will then be assessed. It is predicted that healthier food selection will be promoted.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The results will provide evidence to help develop a new intervention to promote healthier eating.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002678/1","grantId":"ES/K002678/1","fundValue":"260167","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  No demonstrable wider impact as yet but we have been involved in various public dissemination projects including having stalls at the ESRC Festival of Social Science - Library of Birmingham in 2013 and 2014.

We presented participants with either a neutral control message (neutral-control), a control poster which featured vegetables (control-food), a message about the health benefits of consuming vegetables (health), a description of how other students eat plenty of vegetables (descriptive norm), or a message which conveyed how much students like eating vegetables (liking norm). Participants were exposed to one of these messages, and then either given direct access to a buffet of snack foods (no delay), or given access after a delay of 24 hours (delay) to examine whether the effects of the messages were sustained over time. \n\n400 participants were recruited to the study, 47 were excluded hence, 353 participants successfully completed the study. Preliminary results indicate that for individuals who do not usually eat much fruit and vegetables (low habitual consumers), both the control-food, descriptive norm and the liking norm significantly enhanced the amount of vegetables eaten, compared to the control-neutral message. Further analysis of the individual vegetables consumed (cucumber, celery and broccoli) suggests that being exposed to the liking norm enhanced the consumption of broccoli when given immediate access (no delay), but showed an even greater enhancement of intake when it was provided after 24 hours (delay).\n\nTogether, these results suggest that social norms can be used to enhance the intake of vegetables, even when standard health messages fail. The control-food message also had an effect, though the reasons for this require further investigation. Examination of the individual vegetables suggest that the largest increase in broccoli consumption after the liking norm message was produced after a delay, suggesting that not only does the effect of the norm not decrease, but it might actually be stronger after a delay. Our findings could be translated into healthy eating interventions to be used in the workplace or educational setting or commercial canteens. We are currently working with a company to develop such an intervention has part of the programme of work. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
