{"id":"7EF54A18-BDE1-4920-B73B-6B9DA92A7C54","title":"Increasing the use of quantitative methods in Social Science undergraduate dissertations","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this pilot project is to increase the number of final year Social Science undergraduate dissertations undertaken using quantitative methods (QM). This will be achieved through the provision of additional tutoring &amp; intensive support at key stages of the research process. The project will develop a set of materials using real world and discipline specific examples to highlight the utility and relevance of QM within social sciences and thus inspire students and staff in their future application. A key component of the project will be the organisation and delivery of a Summer School and a Winter School in QM for undergraduates and drop-in clinic for third year students to support the use of QM within their dissertations. </p>\n\n<p>The project will last for 20 months and will focus on the cohort of University of Southampton students entering their second year of study in 2006/7 in disciplines where historically the use of quantitative methods has been low such as Applied Social Sciences, Politics, International Relations, Social Work, Sociology and Social Policy. The project is part of a broader agenda to increase the knowledge and use of quantitative methods amongst undergraduates within the social sciences.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E016944/1","grantId":"ES/E016944/1","fundValue":"63423","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Cecelia Falkingham","coPersons":["Jackie  Powell","Bernard Jonathan Harris","Anthony  McGrew"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
