But there is another and very different kind of story to be told of the immigrant experience in England between 1330 and 1550. An extraordinarily rich body of material in the National Archives reveals the identities of thousands of foreigners who continued to find their way into England. Some of these people prospered, and became fully naturalised subjects of the English crown. Others clustered in the poor areas of larger towns or scratched a living as migrant, seasonal workers in the agricultural economy. There is every indication that both public opinion and official policy usually treated these resident aliens with a liberal tolerance that was altogether exceptional in pre-modern Europe.\\n\\nThe core data collected by the project comprises a series of taxes levied on aliens in England between 1440 and 1550. The largest groupings identified by the collectors were the Scots (who were an independent nation in this period), the Irish (who, although subjects of the English crown, were at first treated as aliens for tax purposes), the 'Dutch' (a label that denoted a range of northern Europeans who spoke Germanic languages) and the French (sometimes differentiated by regions as Picards, Normans, Bretons, Gascons, etc). There were also significant numbers of Italians, Iberians and Scandinavians. Preliminary investigations of the most comprehensive set of tax accounts, that for 1440, suggests that there were at least 20,000 registered aliens in England. This brings the alien presence to nearly 1% of a total population of 2.5 million, and as high as 6% in London. These figures are comparable with levels of immigration still being reported in the 1901 UK census. \\n\\nMore remarkably still, the tax records reveal a huge amount of detail about the life experiences of these incomers. Immigrants established themselves as householders and/or servants, artisans and labourers, and included significant numbers of single and married women. They spread out in a remarkable diaspora over the whole of the country: indeed, contrary to received opinion, a remarkably large proportion of late-medieval English rural society must have had direct human contact with foreigners. Other evidence also reveals a small but discernible group of non-whites (and, at least originally, non-Christians), mainly from Iberia, North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean.\\n\\nThe full database of immigrants recorded in England between 1330 and 1550 will offer numerous opportunities for researchers. Local historians will be able to document the diversity of their communities in the Middle Ages. Family historians will find a rich body of evidence for the foreign origins of modern English surnames. Political historians will re-evaluate the mechanisms by which government sought to regulate immigration. Economic and social historians will investigate the role of foreigners in the agricultural, manufacturing and commercial economies. And cultural historians will have a powerful body of data on which to base new debates about the integration of foreigners and their contribution to evolving notions of nationality, race and religion.\\n\\nIn these and many other ways, 'England's Immigrants, 1330-1550' aims to contribute significantly to the longer-term history of immigration and to provide a deep historical context for important contemporary debates about the free movement of peoples, about multiculturalism, and aboutnational identity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I022767/1","grantId":"AH/I022767/1","fundValue":"784545","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  To inform my research and that of my team and thus to contribute to public debates about immingration in a deep historical context Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural,Societal","person":"William Mark Ormrod","coPersons":["Nicola  McDonald","Craig David Taylor"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" New research that has informed the work of my team and allowed engagement in debates about teh histroical context of current debates on immigration.
