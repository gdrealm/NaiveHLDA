{"id":"96272CE0-B2CA-400A-BB79-BAFBF9F2326B","title":"Reducing the number of non-human primates in research by developing a rodent model of selective attention","abstractText":"Selective attention is the process by which brains 'zoom in' on events or objects that are important. Attention is fundamental to sensory and cognitive processing, so attentional disorders are among the most common and most devastating neurological conditions. Selective attention is generally thought of as a higher cognitive function, perhaps only present in animals with elaborate brains. For this reason non-human primates are currently the major animal models of selective attention. This proposal is to develop a rodent model of selective attention. We will develop a state-of-the art system for controlling visual stimuli and measuring behavioural responses in freely moving rats. Such a model would refine the use of animals in medical research by reducing the number of non-human primates. In addition the presence of a rodent model would allow better experimental design, and therefore better predictive power, by reducing individual variability. More generally a successful rodent model of selective attention will encourage the gradual reorienting of research into 'higher cognitive tasks' from non-human primates to rodents and non-vertebrates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/L000385/1","grantId":"NC/L000385/1","fundValue":"72592","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Samuel  Solomon","coPersons":["Kathryn Jane Jeffery"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
