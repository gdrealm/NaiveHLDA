Adequate physical models and simulation tools are necessary to address this issue.collaborative research involves four partners: 1) Pisa : Atomistic modelling of ballistic transport in gated structures with contacts. (2) Vienna: Effective mass approach to transport inclusive of scattering.(3) De Montfort University : Characterisation, parameter extraction and defect analysis of devices fabricated at Cambridge. The parameters will be fed into the modelling at Pisa and Vienna.(4) Cambridge University : Fabrication of devices.overall goal of the project is to carry out a comprehensive analysis linking theory with experiment to enable some fundamental design rules for fabrication of such technologies in future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D064465/1","grantId":"EP/D064465/1","fundValue":"484397","fundStart":"2007-01-15","fundEnd":"2007-10-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria Merlyne De Souza","coPersons":[],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
