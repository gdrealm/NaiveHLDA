Stem cells are produced by the body as a 'universal' type of cell that is capable of replacing many tissues when they are damaged or worn out. Human stem cells are found in small numbers in tissues, such as bone marrow. These cells can leave the site at which they are made and travel via the circulation to the area of injury, thus helping to keep the tissue in good health. Stem cells can change or develop into mature cells that have different specialized functions. To put it another way, stem cells can change into different cells from their organ of origin, for example bone marrow stem cells can change into heart muscle, skeletal muscle or even brain cells. Therefore these cells can be used for organ or tissue regeneration or repair. One of the major problems with using stem cells therapeutically is that stem cells do not automatically home to the area of damage. This study will try to develop a new technique that will allow the stem cells to accumulate at the site of injury, and we hope that this will improve the therapeutic benefit of the stem cells. To do this, we have chosen to work with blood stem cells as they are know to repair damaged to the heart or blood vessels. Our previous work has shown that we can incorporate tiny iron oxide particles into the stem cells by incubating these particles and stem cells in the same dish. When these iron particles come into contact with a magnetic field they become attracted to the magnet. Therefore by placing the iron oxide particles into the cells we can magnetically tag each cell and attract these cells toward the magnet. This does not require a large magnet, and using a magnet the size of a small coin would be enough to attract these particles. To get the magnetically tagged stem cells to go the area of damage, we will place a magnet on the outside of the body over the area of damage. To cause a small area of damage we will injure a vessel wall by inflating a small balloon inside one of the major arteries in the neck (common carotid artery) of the rat. Afterwards we will inject the magnetically tagged stem cells into the circulation via a vein. From previous studies, we know that after damage to the heart only 2% of the injected stem cells will go to the site of damage. We hope to improve this number by placing the magnet on the neck of the rat, near the damaged artery wall, to attract the stem cells to this area as blood circulates through it. Next we will monitor how many stem cells have attached to the blood vessel using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as the magnetic iron-oxide particles appear as dark areas on the image. Finally, we will look at the vessel with different types of microscopes to see to where stem cells have attached to, and will also use an iron detector know as a SQUID to measure how many iron particles have attached to the vessel wall. This will enable us to determine if, by placing a magnet on the surface of the body, we can improve localization of the stem cells to the site of damage. We believe that if this novel technology is successful we will be able to target delivery of stem cells to other regions of the body, such as to the heart, for the restoration of function in damaged or diseased tissue. It may even be possible to use stem cells as a gene delivery system. Stem cells can be incorporated with additional new genes that have been specifically designed to fight diseases. Therapeutic genes can be introduced into stem cells before their injection, so they can transport the gene, possibly under magnetic control, to the area of the body lacking or needing a particular gene, leading to an improvement in well-being.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D014727/1","grantId":"BB/D014727/1","fundValue":"500970","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We have used this data to establish contacts with Companies to look into developing magnetic targeting in humans.

This technology could be more widely adapted to\nlocalize cells in other organs and may provide a useful tool for the systemic injection of cell therapies. Ultimately, we envisage concurrent MR imaging and MR-based magnetic guidance of labeled cells in the body, possibly in a manner similar to magnetic guidance of intravascular catheters and magnetic beads. This approach could augment localization and simultaneous monitoring of cells in other organ systems such as the heart or the brain and may prove complementary to the systemic injection of cell therapies, thus expanding the horizon of cardiovascular interventions and the future of stem cell therapeutic trategies.
