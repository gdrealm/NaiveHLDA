This was a period of considerable financial innovation combined with systemic instability. There were several shocks to the system including the erosion of capital controls, the advent of floating exchange rate regimes, asset market volatility and commodity price shocks (especially the oil crises of 1973 and 1982). The outcomes of the research are on-going but the key findings to date include: \n1. The lack of comprehensive, timely and consistent data on international banking and particularly the accumulation of sovereign debt by less developed economies arose from competition among agencies (IMF, IBRD, BIS, national supervisors and central banks) and from the reluctance of banks themselves to share their information. This resulted in an opacity that reduced the ability of lenders to measure risk. The research identified several initiatives during the 1970s that sought to improve the quality of the data, but these all foundered on the inability/unwillingness of central banks to coordinate the collection and dissemination of data and the reluctance of banks to share their data.\n2. There is clear evidence of moral hazard in sovereign lending during the 1970s apparent in the meetings and correspondence between international banks and the International Monetary Fund and between US banks and the New York Federal Reserve.\n3. Banks were under considerable pressure to internationalise in order to retain their competitive position in rapidly growing markets, but they were ill equipped to establish the internal governance structures that would support such an extension. The project identified cases of rogue trading and other forms of fraud that contributed to instability in international banking markets, particularly in a near-miss international banking crisis in 1974.\n4. During the 1970s there was a rapid increase in the number of non-bank financial intermediaries that were outside the regulatory and supervisory framework for existing authorities and this increased the fragility of the banking system through several channels.\n5. The initial meetings of the Basel Committee established in 1975 to improve the supervision of the international banking system showed the resistance to innovation, the limits to coordination and the inconsistency of national supervisory systems among the G10 (plus Switzerland and Luxembourg) central banks. This helps to explain why there were no appropriate safe-guards in place before the onset of the Latin American sovereign debt crisis of 1982. The research undertaken has generated some data on Hong Kong's banking system which have been deposited for public use.\n\nFurther research on European and Japanese banks will increase robustness of the results.
