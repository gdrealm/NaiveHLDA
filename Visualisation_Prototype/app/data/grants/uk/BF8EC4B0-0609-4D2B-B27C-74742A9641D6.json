{"id":"BF8EC4B0-0609-4D2B-B27C-74742A9641D6","title":"Greece, Rome, and the British Empire","abstractText":"This book-length project explores the relationship between Classics and Empire from the late \\neighteenth to the early twentieth centuries. Focusing on the relationship between Britain and India in this period, it argues (1) for the importance of the colonial context to our understanding of the history of classical studies and (2) for the central role played by the reception of Greco-Roman antiquity in the development of empire. The project, which is informed by archival research that I have carried out in the UK and India, works through a series of case-studies that explore significant features of the association between Classics and Empire. The topics covered include ancient Rome and modern theories of empire; Alexander the Great as a model for European colonialism; Indian and British responses to Greek theatre; contemporary translations and interpretations of Vergil; the debates over neo-classical architecture in India; and the role of Greek and Latin in the Indian Civil Service. The project should be of interest to scholars of antiquity and empire, and will result in a monograph for OUP.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F00494X/1","grantId":"AH/F00494X/1","fundValue":"19481","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Phiroze  Vasunia","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
