The commercial product will be market ready within 2 years, providing a lower cost, more accurate system compared to competitors, such as Symyx Powdernium, FlexiWeigh and BIODOT DisPoTM. The bench-top system will act as a first step in validating the technology for scale-up to high-value applications, such as production-line filing of capsules and blisters with pharmaceutical drugs and combinatorial research. The bench-top system will be developed in partnership with Huxley Bertram Ltd, an established engineering company with expertise in designing and developing equipment for the pharmaceutical industry","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H502319/1","grantId":"EP/H502319/1","fundValue":"81014","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Shoufeng  Yang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
