{"id":"5E7D7EE0-5EF5-4C20-9F6F-EE1B7DFC837B","title":"Preventive Justice","abstractText":"There are good reasons for permitting the state to authorize the use of coercion to protect the public from harm. Preventive measures permit the police to intervene before an offence has been committed and the courts to incapacitate those who pose a danger to society. They permit state intervention at an early stage before the harm eventuates and may even have a deterrent effect upon prospective perpetrators. Yet they carry the risk of rendering unlawful conduct which would otherwise be lawful and of permitting premature intervention and potentially oppressive and intrusive measures that erode individual liberties. \\n\\nRecent years have witnessed a remarkable proliferation of preventive measures that alter the parameters of criminal liability and blur the historic division between the criminal and civil law, allowing the civil law to be used for criminal law purposes but without the protections normally provided to defendants. Not only is the ambit of preparatory offences being extended, but new legal forms are being developed in the name of prevention. The most important of these is a new species of hybrid or 'two-step' measure, imposed in civil proceedings but backed by severe criminal sanctions for breach. Insofar as civil preventive measures are burdensome in ways analogous to punishment, or render those subject to them liable to punishment on breach, then adequate justification and principled limits to their deployment are needed if they are not to inflict punishment under the guise that it is 'just prevention'. \\n\\nThese developments demand more systematic attention than they have been given. Whilst much has been written about criminal law, criminal justice and punishment, little attention has yet been paid to the question of preventive justice (save in emergency situations and in respect of exceptional powers introduced to counter terrorism). This project will rectify this omission by examining the theoretical underpinnings, aims, and justification of preventive justice in order to formulate limiting principles or a jurisprudence of 'just prevention'.\\n\\nIn co-authored articles, chapters, a book, and a co-edited volume we will examine the prevention of harm as a social good and explore the politics of risk and prevention. We will examine the recent shift from retrospective policing and punishment toward prospective intervention by exploring the emergence of a preventive politics and a growing array of preventive measures introduced in the name of security. We will analyse the expansion of liability for preparatory offences and the proliferation of civil, and hybrid civil-criminal, preventive measures. We will establish what justifies preventive measures and what limits ought to be placed upon them in order to distinguish the preventive measures more clearly from those that are in fact punitive. \\n\\nTo the extent that these preventive developments blur the civil-criminal divide they invite scholarly attention to the changing character of criminal justice; the appropriate boundary between civil and criminal; and the possible emergence of a legal middle ground and new legal forms. Inviting criminal lawyers from different jurisdictions, civil procedure scholars, legal theorists, and philosophers to contribute to two workshops on these and related issues will stimulate cross-disciplinary interaction and invite critical reflection on important questions that sit at the margins of criminal, regulatory and civil law and yet which affect liberty. Convening a third workshop of policy makers will ensure their input and add a vital policy dimension to the project. The objective is to provide an account of the principles and values that should guide and limit the state's use of various preventive techniques that involve coercion, and thereby to stimulate more focussed debate in fields of study relating to the civil-criminal divide, risk, security and the control of 'anti-social behaviour'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H015655/1","grantId":"AH/H015655/1","fundValue":"407858","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  There is evidence of their use by the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, in chapter 10 of his 2014 Annual Report; by the Parliamentary Committee on the Draft Modern Slavery Bill, where Professor Lucia Zedner appeared as an expert witness, at the committee's invitation.

To do this, we identified a range of liberty-depriving powers taken by the state in the name of prevention, in realms such as policing, civil preventive orders, anti-terrorist measures, extended and indeterminate sentences, quarantine of persons with contagious diseases, detention of the mentally disordered, and immigration detention. We then developed a set of restraining principles, based on the rights to be taken away by the proposed preventive measure. These principles include procedural rights at a public hearing to decide whether the preventive power should be exercised, the principle of the least restrictive appropriate alternative, and principles for the assessment of risk. We anticipate a whole range of policy and academic applications. In the policy sphere, we would expect our findings to be taken forward by the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation and by parliamentary bodies such as the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Justice Committee of the House of Commons.
