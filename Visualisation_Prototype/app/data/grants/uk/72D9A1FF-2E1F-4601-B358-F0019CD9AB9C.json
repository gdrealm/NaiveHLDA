{"id":"72D9A1FF-2E1F-4601-B358-F0019CD9AB9C","title":"Understanding private sector demand for malaria medications in developing countries","abstractText":"<p>Less than half of the estimated 200 million malaria infections in 2010 received the recommended treatment, called artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). This is partly because those infected often turn to private clinics, hospitals and retail shops to obtain treatment, where patients are more likely to be treated with older, less effective medicines.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this study is to help to understand why private sector malaria patients are less likely to receive ACTs, and what factors act as facilitators and barriers to receiving them. There will be a particular focus on the responsiveness of demand for ACTs to price, and the potential effects of interventions to reduce the price of antimalarial medicines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Data collected from households and sources of malaria treatment in Benin, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia will be used to describe whether treatment was sought, from where, what antimalarial was received, the price paid for the medicines, and total costs of treatment. Statistical modelling will be used to ascertain which factors are important facilitators and barriers to receiving an ACT. These models will then be used to predict how changes in ACT price, household income, distance to outlets, etc., might affect the number of patients treated with ACTs.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00381X/1","grantId":"ES/K00381X/1","fundValue":"144031","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kara  Hanson","coPersons":["Benjamin Franklin Palafox"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
