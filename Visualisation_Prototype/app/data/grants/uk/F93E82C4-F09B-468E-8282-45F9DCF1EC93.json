It is a contributory factor in 30% of all deaths in the UK, with 4 million NHS bed days annually. A major review in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) estimated that a 5 mmHg error would result in 21 million Americans being denied treatment or 27 million being exposed to unnecessary treatment, depending on the direction of the error. The importance of blood pressure measurement is without doubt, but it is still one of the most poorly performed diagnostic measurements in clinical practice.Blood pressure measurement Manual auscultatory blood pressure measurement has changed little over the past 100 years. It contains three main elements: a cuff, pressure display and stethoscope. The cuff encircles the upper arm to occlude the brachial artery, and is deflated with a control, allowing the blood to flow again as the pressure is released. In spite of, or perhaps because of, its simplicity, it is still the most accurate measurement technique. The current International Standards shows that automated blood pressure devices can have an inaccuracy in comparison with manual measurement of +/- 16 mmHg (95% confidence interval), which is not adequate for clinical diagnostic decisions. Guidelines from the three main clinical European Societies addressed the need to re-establish manual measurement. This was further reinforced by the UK Department of Health when they issued a Medical Device Alert, requiring all clinical users to have access to a manual device so that accurate measurements are taken when required.The research problem Manual measurement relies highly on the skills of the trained users to identify the Korotkoff sounds associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) using the stethoscope. The proposed research will develop novel engineering solutions to achieve easy and accurate manual blood pressure measurement. SME collaboration The applicant is Chair of the British Standards Institute committee on sphygmomanometers and represents the UK on the International Standards Committee (joint International Organization for Standardization, and International Electrotechnical Commission) and has been active in this field for over 25 years. Our Newcastle research group has worked with the only UK manufacturer of sphygmomanometers, the family firm AC Cossor &amp; Son (Surgical) Ltd, cooperating closely and successfully to produce the novel electronic patented Accoson greenlight 300 with a very clear display to make the reading of the measurement much easier, and to display the cuff deflation rate(also patented). These features have produced dramatic improvements, and have been led by UK industry. The only feature still to be improved is the use of the stethoscope. This is complex and requires much basic research before any new prototype device could be proposed. Our proposal to this Healthcare Partnerships will tackle this problem.Our goal In this proposal we will research techniques to aid and improve the identification of systole and diastole in manual blood pressure measurement. This research will study our existing unique database of recorded Korotkoff sounds, develop algorithms to help accentuate key differences in Korotkoff features at systole and diastole, set up a laboratory system to allow investigation of other sensors, investigate more discriminatory ways of presenting the sensor output, and prospectively evaluate the techniques proposed. There is enormous scope for improving this 100 year old acoustic technique.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I027270/1","grantId":"EP/I027270/1","fundValue":"492397","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Murray","coPersons":["Philip  Langley"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
