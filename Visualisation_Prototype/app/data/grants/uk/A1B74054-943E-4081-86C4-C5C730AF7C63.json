The quantity and composition of phospholipids are tightly regulated during growth and development, and in response to environmental change, so that membranes always maintain their structure and function. Research in mammals and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has uncovered elegant metabolite signaling mechanisms, both transcriptional and post-translational, that allow the cell to sense changes in key lipid intermediates and adjust phospholipid synthesis (and turnover) accordingly. Analogous mechanisms are also likely to exist in plants but surprisingly they have not been elucidated. Because phospholipids are essential, genetic analysis of their regulation through loss-of-function is problematic. However, we have recently isolated an Arabidopsis thaliana double mutant in two phosphatidate phosphatases (pah1 pah2) that produces approximately twice as much phospholipid in its leaves as wild type plants. To our knowledge this is the first plant mutant to over-produce phospholipids and the gain-of-function phenotype provides a unique tool. The objective of this grant proposal is to use the pah1 pah2 mutant (and corresponding genes) to discover how phospholipid biosynthesis is regulated in Arabidopsis and to investigate how it is coordinated with cell cycle progression, which requires membrane biogenesis. This discovery will be of fundamental scientific interest, particularly as there is already evidence to show that many key elements of the regulatory mechanism(s) in plants must differ from those described in mammals or yeast.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G009724/1","grantId":"BB/G009724/1","fundValue":"443269","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  In stems and roots of mutants plants disrupted in pah1 pah2 the total lipid content per unit dry weight increases by 80 to 100% and in leaves (where chloroplast galactolipids normally make up ~80% of total lipids) the increase is ~20%. Mechanisms to increase the lipid content of these tissues have recently become of significant interest because they could potentially be used to enhance the density and bioavailability of carbon in crops used for either bioenergy or animal food. Lipids have a much higher energy density than carbohydrates and are far more digestable than cell wall material.

We discovered that PHOSPHATIDIC ACID PHOSPHOHYDROLASE (PAH) catalytic activity controls ER biogenesis and morphology in plants by modulating phosphatidic acid levels that, in turn regulate phospholipid synthesis by governing the activity and ER membrane association of the rate-limiting enzyme for phosphatidylcholine synthesis (CTP:phosphorylcholine cytidylyltransferase; CCT1). Our results have provided incite into the control of membrane biogenesis in plants and have provided tools to investigate the control of endomembrane morphology and dynamics.
