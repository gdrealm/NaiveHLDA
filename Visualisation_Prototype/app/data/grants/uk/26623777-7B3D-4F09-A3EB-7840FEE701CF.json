{"id":"26623777-7B3D-4F09-A3EB-7840FEE701CF","title":"The virtual seed (vSEED)","abstractText":"The aim of the vSEED project is to provide a dynamic mathematical description of seed dormancy, after-ripening and germination focussing on the key seed compartments the radicle and endosperm. This interdisciplinary project will analyse the comparative biology of the closely related Brassicaceae species Arabidopsis thaliana and Lepidium sativum, using engineering, imaging, modelling and post-genomics approaches to develop a virtual germinating seed. We propose that germination is an ideal exemplary subject for the integration of new technologies and for developing molecular plant biomechanics in conjunction with dynamic mathematical modelling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G02488X/1","grantId":"BB/G02488X/1","fundValue":"479058","fundStart":"2009-09-21","fundEnd":"2012-09-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Holdsworth","coPersons":["Nicola Mary Everitt","John  King","Andrew  Wood"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" Detailed information about the molecular biology and mechanics of seed germination Further scientific research Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education","dataset":"gtr"}
