The challenge for researchers is to place these observations into a longer-term context and produce computer models ('ice sheet forecasts') that reliably predict the fate of ice sheets over this century and beyond. Although remote from habitation, the polar ice sheets influence global sea level. Retreat by increased melting and iceberg calving produces higher sea levels and concerns exist that sea level may rise by metres displacing many millions of people, and their livelihoods, from their coastal homes. At this point in time, it is not possible to study the full life cycle of the present Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets as they are still evolving and undergoing large-scale changes. Instead, we will use an ice sheet that has now fully retreated; the ice sheet that covered most of Britain, Ireland and the North Sea during the last ice age. \n\nThe last British-Irish ice sheet covered up to 1,000,000 km2 at its maximum size, around 25,000 yrs ago, and was relatively small by global standards. However, its character, setting and behaviour have striking parallels with both the modern West Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets. Large parts of the British-Irish Ice Sheet were marine-influenced just like in west Antarctica today; and numerous fast-flowing ice streams carried much of its mass, just like in the Greenland Ice Sheet today. All three are or were highly dynamic, in climatically sensitive regions, with marine sectors, ocean-terminating margins and land-based glaciers. All these common factors make the British-Irish Ice Sheet a powerful analogue for understanding ice sheet dynamics on a range of timescales, operating now and in the future.\n\nRecent work by members of this consortium has revealed the pattern of ice sheet retreat that once covered the British Isles, as recorded by end moraines and other glacial landforms. Other work by members of this consortium has used sophisticated computer models to simulate the ice sheet's response to climate change at the end of the last Ice Age. However, these models can only be as good as the geological data on which they are based, and the pattern is poorly constrained in time. We need to know more about the style, rate and timing of ice sheet decay in response to past climate change. Such knowledge allows us to further refine computer modelling so that better predictions can be made. The main focus of the project therefore, is to collect sediments and rocks deposited by the last ice sheet that covered the British Isles, and use these, along with organic remains, to date (e.g. by radiocarbon analyses) the retreat of the ice sheet margins. The project will use over 200 carefully chosen sites, dating some 800 samples in order to achieve this. Offshore, samples will be extracted using coring devices lowered from a research ship to the seabed, and onshore by manual sampling and by use of small drilling rigs. Once the samples are dated and added to the pattern information provided by the landforms, maps of the shrinking ice sheet will be produced. These will provide crucial information on the timing and rates of change across the whole ice sheet. The British-Irish Ice Sheet will become the best constrained anywhere in the world and be the benchmark against which ice sheet models are improved and tested in the future.\n\nKnowledge on the character and age of the seafloor sediments surrounding the British Isles is also useful for many industrial, archaeological and heritage applications. Accordingly, the project is closely linked to partners interested, for example, in locating offshore windfarms, electricity cables between Britain and Ireland, and heritage bodies aiming to preserve offshore archaeological remains.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J007056/1","grantId":"NE/J007056/1","fundValue":"333616","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Grant is towards end of year 2 out of 5 and so question not relevant yet, that said information on the sea floor geology of the Irish Sea has been used by Centrica Energy for windfarm planning.\n\nGlacial land systems in the Irish Sea Basin: approaching a sediment-landform predictive model for the sea floor.\nGeological appraisal of swath bathymetry and seismo-stratigraphic data in the SE region of the R3 zone - Liverpool Bay.

Journal of Quaternary Science, 28 (2). pp. 200-209. \n\nThis output showed that scientific dating of sediments in the Irish Sea and Celtic Sea basins indicates that the last British and Irish Ice Sheet expanded very rapidly 34.0–25.3 thousand years ago (ka), accelerating into the Celtic Sea to reach maximum limits 25.3–24.5 ka before a\ncollapse with rapid marginal retreat to the northern Irish Sea Basin (ISB). This retreat was rapid and driven by climatic\nwarming, sea-level rise, mega-tidal amplitudes and reactivation of meridional circulation in the North Atlantic. The\nretreat, though rapid, is uneven, with the stepped retreat pattern possibly a function of the passage of the ice stream\nbetween normal and adverse ice bed gradients and changing ice stream shape. These data show the importance of the ice bed slope and lateral extent of ice margins in predicting the longer-term (thousands of years) patterns and rates of ice-marginal retreat during phases of rapid collapse, which has implications for the modelling of projected rapid retreat of present-day ice streams.
