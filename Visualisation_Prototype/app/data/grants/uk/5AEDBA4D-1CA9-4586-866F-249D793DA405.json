{"id":"5AEDBA4D-1CA9-4586-866F-249D793DA405","title":"Support of the Cardiff Herschel-SPIRE Programme from June 2007 to May 2009","abstractText":"SPIRE, the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver, is an instrument, to fly on ESA's Herschel Space Observatory, due for launch in 2008. It will work at far infrared wavelengths which are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and can tell us a great deal about the formation of galaxies and of stars and planetary systems in our own galaxy. The SPIRE flight instrument has been built by an international consortium, led and managed by the UK, and has now been delivered to the Herschel industrial contractor. Between now and the launch of Herschel (currently foreseen to be around October 2008), SPIRE will be integrated and thoroughly tested as part of the complete Herschel system. Following six months of in-flight commissioning and evaluation, Herschel will have an operational lifetime of at least three years, during which time the SPIRE Instrument Control Centre (ICC) will be responsible for many aspects of instrument monitoring and operation, in conjunction with ESA's Herschel Science Centre. Cardiff contributions to the UK SPIRE team include participation in the satellite-level testing of SPIRE, the various activities of the ICC, and the integration and testing of the Flight Spare focal plane unit. In addition, Cardiff is the PI institute for SPIRE - the PI role involves overall responsibility to ESA for all aspects of the project until the end of operations, and the leadership of the international SPIRE Consortium.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F004699/1","grantId":"ST/F004699/1","fundValue":"451674","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Matt  Griffin","coPersons":["Peter  Ade","Walter  Kieran  Gear"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
