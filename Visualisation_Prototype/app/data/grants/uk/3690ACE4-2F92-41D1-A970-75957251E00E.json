Even though sample size of this data is fairly large, other problems related to data quality and measurement error persist. The nature of errors in administrative data is often directly linked to the data generating process. For example, if only a small number of registers are merged, this leaves considerable unobserved periods in the employment trajectories of individuals. Therefore, a good understanding of the data is necessary to address data quality issues in an appropriate way.</p>\n\n<p>This project mainly focuses on the analysis of unemployment duration within the context of competing risks. If parameters of interest are not point identified due to either data problems or partial identification of a model, bounds are to be derived in which the true parameters are located. The project aims at stepping ahead of current research in this field by providing appropriate bounds for empirical problems of interest. The project targets two user groups. Firstly, it provides new methodological insights for data providing institutions into how their data is appropriately used in applications. Secondly, applications contribute to recent policy debate.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0059","grantId":"RES-061-25-0059","fundValue":"125757","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ralf Andreas Wilke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
