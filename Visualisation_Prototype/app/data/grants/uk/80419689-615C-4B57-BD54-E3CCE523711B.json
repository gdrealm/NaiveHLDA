{"id":"80419689-615C-4B57-BD54-E3CCE523711B","title":"Targeted supply chain ethylene removal to control the development of fresh produce","abstractText":"The overarching aim of the project is to control the scheduling of the UK tomato and peppers by suspending ripening at optimum eating quality for grower and retail postharvest supply chain environments. In an industry with a combined value of &pound;957m / year, the potential to market a higher proportion of UK produced tomatoes and peppers represents a 5% increase or &pound;49m /year opportunity for growers and increased revenue for the retailers. Reduced energy use by improving storage and increased shelf life at ambient conditions to increase the availability of high quality UK produce will better meet the requirements of retailers and consumers. The removal of ethylene in post-harvest environments after the onset of ripening, will develop a new area of investigation to extend shelf life. The project team, by a combination of laboratory and on site commercial scale investigations, will develop a robust evidence base to implement new ethylene control technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M025918/1","grantId":"BB/M025918/1","fundValue":"300328","fundStart":"2015-03-03","fundEnd":"2018-03-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Seymour","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
