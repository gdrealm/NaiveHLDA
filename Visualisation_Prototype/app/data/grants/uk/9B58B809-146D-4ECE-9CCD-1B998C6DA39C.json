Any non-standard interaction, be it a completely\nnew type of interaction, or a new type of neutrino interacting in a non-standard\nway (such as a sterile neutrino) will show up in the ratio of oscillated to non-oscillated\nenergy spectra. This experiment will give the highest confidence level test of the\nso-called standard model of neutrino interactions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K001558/1","grantId":"ST/K001558/1","fundValue":"155756","fundStart":"2012-04-09","fundEnd":"2014-05-08","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer Anne Thomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
