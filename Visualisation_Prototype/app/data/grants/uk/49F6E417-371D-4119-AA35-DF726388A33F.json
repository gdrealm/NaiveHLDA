In place of the ‘classic’ inter-state model,\n<br />there are conflicts with&nbsp; very few actual engagements between organised\n<br />military forces.&nbsp; The&nbsp; battlegrounds are civilians’ homes and combatants not\n<br />recognisable as national militaries.&nbsp; This type of&nbsp; violence can engulf entire\n<br />regions and produce new patterns of&nbsp; national boundaries. These shifts in the realities of armed conflict have not just affected the military sector. Many humanitarian and development agencies now find themselve operating in conflict zones.\n<br />\n<br />These shifts all have implications for the study of gender relations,\n<br />particularly those&nbsp; around conflict and violence. For example, women –\n<br />especially mothers - have commonly been associated with a ‘pro-peace’\n<br />position, and there are certainly many important initiatives of this\n<br />kind in conflict zones. However, at the same time, women have sustained\n<br />violent conflict in a number of ways. Despite&nbsp; conventional assumptions\n<br />about male aggression, there are also&nbsp; many instances of men\n<br />refusing/avoiding involvement in armed conflict.\n<br />\n<br />This seminar series will provide an opportunity to examine these shifts&nbsp; in\n<br />detail and to relate them to current policy initiatives e.g. around sexual\n<br />violence in war.\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4232-A","grantId":"RES-451-25-4232-A","fundValue":"11381","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-22","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ruth  Jacobson","coPersons":["Miranda  Alison"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
