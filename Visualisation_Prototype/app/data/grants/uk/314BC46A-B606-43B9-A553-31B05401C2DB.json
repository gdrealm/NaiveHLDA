The funding would be used to assess the viability of sensors inserted vertically into the channel margins to provide accurate and near real-time continuous monitoring of bed morphology. Funding would enable UoW to lead an assessment of existing methods used for river bed surveys and define the requirements of potential end-users. Q-par Angus would lead technical developments and assess the viability of EIT for this purpose. If successful, further funding would be sought to test, develop and market the new environmental sensor","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E522559/1","grantId":"NE/E522559/1","fundValue":"5525","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2006-11-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Philip Maddock","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Worcester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
