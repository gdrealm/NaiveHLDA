To support such legislation, methods must be developed to reduce uncertainty on existing national GHG emissions estimates and monitor the efficacy of emissions reduction strategies.\nIn 2010, CO2 represented about 85% of total UK GHG emissions, with the remainder largely from methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). In 2010, the main UK sources of CO2 were energy supply, road transport, business, and residential; the main sources of CH4 were agriculture and landfill with small sources from gas leakage and coal mines; and the main sources of N2O were agriculture, industrial process, and road transport. There are substantial associated uncertainties with sectoral estimates of these emissions, particularly for N2O.\nThe main focus of Greenhouse gAs Uk and Global Emissions (GAUGE) is to quantify UK budgets of CO2, CH4, and N2O from different sectors, and to improve global GHG budgets. The UK study will focus on fossil fuels and agriculture, the two largest sources of the three GHGs. We will achieve this by combining atmospheric measurements with computer models of the atmosphere, which describe the movement of GHGs after emission. We already have a reasonable idea of where GHGs are emitted but the size of the emissions typically has a large associated error. Depending on the emission type it may also have a substantial seasonal cycle (e.g., agriculture). It is therefore important we make regular GHG measurements at different times of the year and in different places.\nThe UK research aircraft will provide the broad-scale 3-D perspective on the inflow and outflow of UK GHG budgets, complementing information from existing tall towers. The network of tall towers measure GHGs at 100-200m above the surface to ensure that the sampled air is representative of larger areas, and the towers are intentionally sited to provide estimates of GHG emissions in the Devolved Administrations. As part of GAUGE we will add to this network with a tower in the Scottish borders that provides substantially more information about the north of England, Scotland, and the North Sea; a tower over SE England, downwind of London; and we will support existing instruments on the BT tower in central London. The SE London tower and the BT tower together will allow us to provide the first multi-year record of urban emissions from a megacity. We will use GHG isotopes to improve understanding of the fossil fuel sources. A detailed study of agricultural GHG emissions will be conducted over East Anglia, allowing us to quantify the importance of this sector in the UK GHG budget. Weekly measurements aboard a North Sea ferry will provide constraints on UK GHG fluxes by regularly sampling transects of UK outflow. Satellite observations of GHGs offer a unique global perspective, linking UK emissions to the rest of the world, and we will work with NASA to develop and apply new observations to quantify global GHG budgets on a sub-UK spatial scale. Embedded in this long-term measurement strategy will be a measurement intensive to quantify London GHG emissions, where we will use the UK research aircraft to sample profiles of upwind/downwind air, validate dedicated satellite observations, and link urban measurements with downwind in situ and tall tower measurements.\nIn GAUGE we bring together computer models of the atmosphere, and a team of world-leading modellers, in order to relate observed variations of GHGs to estimates of the underlying emissions. Statistical approaches will be used to find emissions that best agree with the measurements, taking account of model and data uncertainties. The main outcome from GAUGE will be robust GHG emission estimates from the UK and from the world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K00221X/1","grantId":"NE/K00221X/1","fundValue":"333169","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-01","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Key findings resulting from GAUGE so far concern new methodologies and instrumentation for the measurement of greenhouse gases around the UK. My papers and conference presentations on regional scalability of flux calculations (from local to regional scales) are already providing global leadership on how to apply methodologies using aircraft sampling. Together with synergistic activity on other NERC projects (i.e. the MAMM programme and Allen's NERC Fellowship), we have also developed drone aircraft measurement techniques that we are currently operating in ongoing projects with the UK Environment Agency for regulatory monitoring of fugitve emissions of methane. This also resulted in a policy guidance note and faesibility study by Dr Allen that has been published by the Agency. Dr Allen was also invited to be a reviewer on the DECC Mackay and Stone report on &amp;quot;the potential for fugitive emissions from fracking in the UK&amp;quot; and this has led to guidance on new monitoring techniques for fugitive methane assessment and Dr Allen is working with Cuadrilla, in the UK on a baseline methane monitoring study ahead of operations for statistical analysis using transport models and local flux methods.

Analysis is ongoing and we expect this to lead to new case studies of greenhouse gas fluxes for the UK and its regions. \nWe have also conducted a major field campaign at a landfill site in Ipswich (August 2014), where we have tested many different techniques for the measurement of surface fluxes of methane. This will be a test-bed for their validation and will help the landfill industry (and its regulators) to decide future best pratice by more accurate and informed information. The developments in this fellowship have already been taken forward into several standard and large NERC grant proposals (e.g. GAUGE, CANMAM, BIOCOOL, QUANT) to continue scientific work on air quality, the measurement and quantification of greenhouse gas fluxes, and numerical weather prediction. \nIn addition, the development of my drone sampling capability is part of an ongoing project with the Environment Agency to provide a new way of regulatory monitoring of landfill gas emissions. This work also formed part of a policy guidance note and a published Agency feasibility study. \nWe are also working with Cuadrilla in the UK to measure baseline concentrations of methane in selected prospective fracking sites to provide a statistical dataset to compare with any potential emissions during various phases of operational drilling. DECC have expressed interest in the technology and capability for commissioning of future fracking sites.
