{"id":"BDCE3662-0470-4A70-BFA3-A4343F441258","title":"Network to Investigate Sustainable Economic and Ecological models of Peripheral Urban Functional Units","abstractText":"We propose establishing a network of academics, industry and professional partners, governmental institutions, and community groups committed to research the issues of sustainable economic development for peripheral urban functional units. The aims of the network are to determine what conditions are necessary to combine sustainable economic development and sustainable ecological objectives in urban units on the periphery of mega-cities. The Network will bring together leading firms with an emerging, interdisciplinary group of researchers engaged in studying, developing and testing theoretical frameworks, conceptual models and practical guidelines that can be deployed both in Dongtan as well as similar developments elsewhere around the world. The Built Environment Innovation Centre at Tanaka Business School, Imperial College London in partnership with The College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University Shanghai, will form the nucleus of this proposal. Their academic, industry and governmental collaborators will form the basis from which we aim to build a larger dissemination and implementation Network.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F015119/1","grantId":"EP/F015119/1","fundValue":"283517","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Colin Davies","coPersons":["David  Gann","Lars  Frederikson"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
