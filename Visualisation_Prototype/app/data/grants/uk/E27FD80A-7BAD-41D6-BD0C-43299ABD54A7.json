{"id":"E27FD80A-7BAD-41D6-BD0C-43299ABD54A7","title":"The Listening Experience Database","abstractText":"The project is run by members of the Music and English Departments at The Open University (OU) in collaboration with researchers at the Royal College of Music (RCM). The distinctive feature of the evidence that this project seeks to capture and analyse is its unsolicited nature - this is evidence recorded not for the purposes of influencing an audience, such as a review, or some other published form of musical opinion, but a record of an essentially private experience, either of an individual, or of a group of which the individual recording the event was part. The evidence is contained in a variety of sources, including private diaries, correspondence and oral testimony, which is searchable in electronic collections such as EEBO, British and Irish Women's Letters and Diaries, as well as in public archives such as those held in the British Library and in private sources. This is the first time that evidence of this sort has been systematically collected and documented. It will shed new light on a number of areas of investigation. For example, it will provide music and social historians and social scientists with the evidence to form a deeper understanding of the effect of music on professional and amateur musicians. It will also provide a greater understanding of the way in which music has been used domestically, or as part of religious ritual, and it will reveal the impact of new technologies on the listening habits of individuals. The project will be of benefit to students of performance history, who will gain further insight into the settings and the way in which music was performed. Educationalists will be provided with a range of material relevant to the way in which music is studied and learned and social historians will be able to gain further insight into the extent to which music is valued and understood in society.\n\nIn its first three-year phase the project is restricted to sources in the English language, but within that constraint the project team is interested in evidence from any historical period concerning music of any sort - 'classical', popular, the music of non-western cultures, etc. The evidence will be entered into a searchable database that will be 'live' to the public at the end of the first year of the project on the project's website. A particular feature of this research is that it builds on the OU's Reading Experience Database (RED) project (http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/RED/index.html) and actively encourages members of the public to participate. The main reason for inviting this form of public involvement is the belief that many of the most interesting accounts of listening will be found in small archives and in sources owned by private individuals. Members of the public are invited to submit examples of listening experiences (appropriately verified, for example, by scanned copies of the relevant material) to the project's website. The project team will then verify the evidence prior to including it in the database.\n\nThe findings of the project will not only be made available in academic publications, but will also be disseminated through symposia at the end of years 1 and 2, a conference at the end of year 3, public lectures, a proposed radio broadcast series, and regular updates posted on the project's website. The project will run for three years initially, but it is planned to develop it thereafter, having established a network of international participants - both scholars and members of the public. The eventual aim is to create a multi-lingual and multi-national database of listening experiences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013986/1","grantId":"AH/J013986/1","fundValue":"750300","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project is still only in its second year, so there is nothing to report at present.

Please note - the project is not yet complete (2014 is year 2 of a three-year project), so the answer to the next question should be understood in that light. We anticipate that the database will have a wide usage both within and beyond the academic world, amongst users interested in music reception and in finding out about the ways in which music has functioned in society. The project has also started to make a significant contribution to the global body of linked open data - in particular, we anticipate that it will fill some important gaps in musicological linked open data.
