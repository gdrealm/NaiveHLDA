","person":"Lucy  Druesne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":" The University of Kent, through its enterprise and innovation department, Kent Innovation &amp;amp; Enterprise (KIE), has considerable experience in facilitating KT with external organisations, and is also adept at wider reciprocal contact in the manner known as Knowledge Exchange (KE). KIE is also skilled at supporting the commercialisation of research through a multitude of avenues. The existing resources have been used for some proactive identification, however part of the process would rely more on researchers identifying the potential of their research and engaging with KIE. Substantial results have been generated from the university's knowledge assets stemming from research and all have not been fully identified and consequently exploited. If Impact generation relies on the efficiency by which knowledge outputs from research will be transformed into applications and bring about beneficial change, then efforts to augment impact could be focused on better identification of exploitable research outputs. The Pathways to Impact Award (PIA) presented KIE with a great opportunity to prime its activities in supporting the generation of KT through the identification of potential impact. Activities included developing a method for identifying the KT potential of research outputs, providing training to Academics and Research Associates in KT and commercialisation avenues for research with the aim of generating impact, and providing a small grant for supporting KT and commercialisation activities for research outputs.\nThe primary activity of the project was to design and develop a methodology for identifying potential impact from research. The methodology was based on the generation of case studies outlining potential processes for potential impact generation from research projects. Case studies included the potential support required by KIE to facilitate KT and commercialisation avenues leading to impact, and were aimed at raising the visibility of potential impact from research conducted at the UoK. The methodology for identifying potential impact through case studies was developed to support current KIE processes, as well as complement a wider remit of UoK impact activities. The provision of KT and commercialisation training to Academics and RAs was a complementary activity aimed at enhancing understanding amongst members of the UoK on the potential avenues that can be undertaken in order to generate impact from their research. Feedback from the training sessions suggested that these were greatly appreciated by the participants and provided them with important and useful knowledge in further developing research outputs. Additionally, the small grants competition was designed to support academics that wished to complement their research with general KE activities. Both complementary activities were set to amplify the impact generation prospects of research projects at the UoK. The small grants competition provided timely support for activities that could greatly enhance the prospect of impact generation from research outputs. All activities conducted as part of the PIA were successful, and provided an enhancement of the impact environment at the UoK. The ability to identify pathways to impact was the primary contribution of the PIA, and has enhanced the capacity of KIE and the UoK in supporting potential impact. Other institutions considering impact enhancing activities could look at our model of:\no case study led potential identification\no supporting KT and commercialisation training to Academics and RAs\no small pump priming monies for post research KE activities\nThis could be a starting point for determining a model that may suit other institutions.
