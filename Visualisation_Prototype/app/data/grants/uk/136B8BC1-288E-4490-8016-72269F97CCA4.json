With China's rising influence in many conflict-prone areas, it is essential to have a high level of cooperation with China in tackling these issues. A significant body of knowledge on China's engagement in non-traditional security issues, such as: 1) peacekeeping, 2) post-disaster assistance, and 3) the protection of citizens/assets overseas (including anti-piracy operations), has been accumulated over the past several years, but study results remain unused.</p>\n\n<p>This project will promote the application of accumulated academic knowledge and provide opportunities for academics and policymakers to co-produce creative policy ideas of UK-China non-traditional security cooperation programs. The project activity will have two components.</p>\n\n<p>First, an international conference is designed to gather insights and experience from a wide audience of UK, Chinese and European academics and policymakers, and the UK third and business sectors, and to arrive at policy directions by means of a break-out session involving all participants. Second, based on these policy directions, four confidential workshops will be held, to focus on co-producing more specific policy ideas.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J000639/1","grantId":"ES/J000639/1","fundValue":"8279","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The policy ideas included in the summary report of the conference held in September 2011 were consulted by the UK Embassy in China to form the UK government's future cooperation programme with the Chinese government from 2013 to 2016. The UK Embassy in China held a bilateral working-level conference in Beijing in March 2012, and discussed with its Chinese counterparts the policy ideas included in the report, and the feasibility of implementing them. The Embassy invited the PI to report the policy ideas created at the conference. This conference summary report is also made available on the website of the British Embassy in China, aiming 'to engage China's academic and policy community in debate on selected issues of mutual concern'. Please see https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/uk-china-strategic-communication-initiative. The conference held in September 2011 has also impacted on the research profile and contents of some of the third sector organizations invited to the conference. For example, Saferworld (China Programme) has been researching international cooperation on China's peacekeeping, which was one of the key issues discussed in this project.

Particular attention has been paid to the issues of (1) peacekeeping, (2) post-disaster assistance, (3) protection of citizens/assets overseas (including anti-piracy operations), and (4) environmental security.\nWe have developed policy ideas for UK-China cooperation based on the premise that bottom-up co-operation between the two countries on specific non-traditional security issues presents a clear way through the obstacles of the ideological differences encountered at a higher level. Bottom-up co-operation on non-traditional security challenges such as peacekeeping, post-disaster assistance, anti-piracy and environmental security can avoid entrenchment in an ideological position because:\no Such challenges are intrinsically global, and threaten global prosperity\no Effective solutions to non-traditional security problems require multilateral approaches and the pooling of capability.\n\nPolicy and situational factors increase the incentive for both China and the UK to expand military co-operation:\no Key British and Chinese policy documents, such as the UK's Strategic Defence and Security Review and China's Defence White Paper 2010, suggest real potential for an expansion of UK-China military co-operation.\no Facing budget cuts, the UK aims to make best possible use of its resources, in part through burden-sharing with rising powers such as China\no As its interests abroad expand and its military capabilities grow, China is beginning to take cautious steps towards a more active foreign policy. Yet, constrained by the need to present itself as a 'responsible power', Beijing requires international legitimisation of its actions. Furthermore, having been confined to its domestic borders for decades, the PLA does not have much experience in international operations. Both issues can be addressed by co-operation with the UK.\n\nSome of the concrete policy ideas this project has developed include:\nPeacekeeping\no Encourage dialogue among civil society actors in the UK, China and the conflict states in order to promote a better understanding of conflicts, and to reconcile different perspectives on peacekeeping and peace-building\no Promote conflict sensitivity in peace-building and overseas assistance activities\no Engage in programmes to train Chinese peacekeeping troops\n\nPost-Disaster Assistance\no Arrange joint familiarisation visits between relevant agencies in the two countries\no Co-operate in the joint training of post-disaster assistance personnel in developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region\no Conduct a joint study on conflict-sensitive approaches to the delivery of humanitarian aid in complex emergencies.\n\nAnti-Piracy Operations\no Share force-enabling capabilities\no Institutionalise regular information-sharing meetings between the PLAN and Royal Navy\no Establish common naval guidelines on how to apprehend piracy suspects\no Address the root cause of the piracy problem by helping to stabilise Somalia.\n\nEnvironmental Security\noTarget co-operation on short-term technical issues, particularly those that have an immediate impact or that represent a major crisis risk.\noConduct familiarisation visits between the MoD and PLA, and foster and develop individual relationships especially at mid-to-senior-level.\noFocus on co-operation with multiple departments, not exclusively the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The conference and workshops of this knowledge exchange project, jointly organised by the Principle Investigator and Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), were well attended by academics in China, Britain and Europe; British policymakers, including those in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence; and the third and business sectors working on China's non-traditional security issues, including Saferworld and the Overseas Development Institute. A non-confidential project report and presented papers are all available online (http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/iaps/research/projects/chinas-engagement.aspx), and have benefited academic and non-academic communities. Members of the academic community are using these materials in their research, teaching and grant applications relating to China's international engagement in non-traditional security issues. Government policymakers have gained scholarly analyses of the policy and practices of China's engagement in non-traditional security issues. The conference report contains a number of concrete policy ideas, which have been consulted by the British foreign policymaking community. The third and business sectors gained networking opportunities including with government policymakers, academics and between the sectors themselves. This has helped them to gain broader knowledge of each other's activities and interests in relation to UK-China cooperation. Education,Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
