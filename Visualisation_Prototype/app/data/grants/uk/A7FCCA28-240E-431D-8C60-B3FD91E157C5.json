{"id":"A7FCCA28-240E-431D-8C60-B3FD91E157C5","title":"Community-based participatory research: ethics and outcomes","abstractText":"This paper outlines the findings of a scoping study examining ethical issues in community-based participatory research (CBPR), based on a literature search and the deliberations of a co-inquiry action research group. The search indicated a range of research approaches claiming to be participatory and community-based, showing significant variation in degrees of participation and community control. Ethical challenges in CBPR include matters relating to: partnership, collaboration and power; community rights, conflict and representation; ownership and dissemination of data, findings and publications; anonymity, privacy and confidentiality; institutional ethical review processes; and blurred boundaries between researcher and researched, academic and activist. While many of these issues are common in qualitative social research, what is distinctive about CBPR is the openness, fluidity and unpredictability of the research process. It is often complicated by multi-layered partnerships based on the negotiation of power relations between diverse groups (with specific histories, politics, cultures and personalities), whilst also being constrained by rigid structures of research governance. Recommendations include: the adoption of specific ethical guidelines for CBPR by UK researchers, funders and sponsors; ethnographic research on the CBPR process; a search of grey literature for accounts of CBPR from community perspectives; and further longitudinal research on outcomes of CBPR.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J501057/1","grantId":"AH/J501057/1","fundValue":"32470","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Jane Banks","coPersons":["Rachel  Pain"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" This project was developed as a result of the findings of a previous Connected Communities research project that there were many complex ethical challenges in community-based participatory research; and that there was a need for ethical guidance and further resources to support community partners and academics in planning and doing this kind of research.\n\n\n\nThe final version of the ethics guide is based on these principles:\n\n\n\nEthical principles\n\n\n\n1.

Sharing and learning from the research The ethics guide and accompanying case materials, films, and podcasts will be useful to community-based organisations planning and delivering participatory research. It will also be of use to research funders and research ethics committees in helpiong them tailor their research guidance and procedures to fit CBPR.
