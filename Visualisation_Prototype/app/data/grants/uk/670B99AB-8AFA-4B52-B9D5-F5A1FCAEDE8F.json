The first workshop will be held in Toronto, Canada in October 2008 and the second will be in Bath in March 2009. The aim of of the workshops is to identify what are the barriers to the implementation of assistive technology for people with dementia in their own homes, and then to write proposals for collaborative research to solve the problems.Delegates will be invited from academia, local authorities, care homes and industry. The gathered consortium will be broad in its expertise to ensure that it is able to address the whole of the implementation chain from initial idea through to large scale adoption by formal and informal care providers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G025770/1","grantId":"EP/G025770/1","fundValue":"19962","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy  Adlam","coPersons":["Roger  Orpwood"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
