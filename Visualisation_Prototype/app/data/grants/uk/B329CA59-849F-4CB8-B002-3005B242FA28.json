{"id":"B329CA59-849F-4CB8-B002-3005B242FA28","title":"Climate Engineering Research: Responsible Innovation","abstractText":"This project will support a part time, named social scientist with high expertise in stakeholder and public engagement for 4 months a) to undertake a programme of stakeholder mapping and engagement around the RCUK funded SPICE project and the wider context of Solar Radiation Management (SRM) within which it sits; b) to undertake a brief but critical review of the wider risk uncertainties, ethical, legal. governance and social issues associated with the project and SRM more generally, and c) to integrate the stakeholder engagement work and literature review into a broader package of information to be submitted to an independent stage gate review panel convened by RCUK which will recommend whether the SPICE testbed should go ahead i.e. a mechanism through which the results from the engagement activities can inform subsequent project activities by SPICE.\n\nThis research will therefore be an important input to discussions regarding the outstanding (i.e. 'pass pending') criteria highlighted at the June 2011 SPICE Testbed Stage Gate panel (Macnaghten and Owen, Nature 2011), and which will be re-evaluated again when this panel is reconvened. Secondly, it will provide important understanding more generally of the conditions under which research in the field of SRM could progress in a way that is safe, open and responsible. \n\nThe named researcher (Jack Stilgoe) is an expert in upstream engagement around emerging technologies and has recently completed an ESRC / EPSRC grant (led by Prof Owen) to develop an outline Responsible Innovation (RI) Framework. He will use this framework to support and inform the study. The study will be both an important input into the governance of the SPICE project, and a valuable social science research site within which to deepen the existing ESRC/EPSRC Framework for Responsible Innovation project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K007505/1","grantId":"EP/K007505/1","fundValue":"39697","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research supported stakeholder dialogue which supported decision making within the SPICE geoengineering project and the development of the framework for responsible innovation which was subsequently published as an ESPRC policy http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/framework/ Energy,Environment Societal,Policy & public services","person":"Richard  Owen","coPersons":["Timothy Michael Lenton"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" The project undertook deliberative stakeholder engagement around one of the first major UK research projects in the emerging area of geoengineering (the deliberate intervention in the planetary climate). The project, Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering (SPICE), proposed an outdoor experiment that attracted substantial public scrutiny despite a strong consensus that the experiment posed no direct environmental risk. The programme of stakeholder engagement sought a deeper understanding of the views of stakeholders. The work was important as an input into policy options regarding geoengineering by RUCK and the UK government Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
