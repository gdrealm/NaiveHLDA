Whilst current technology is good there is still much room for improvement. The dyes used in DSSCs can themselves have detrimental environmental impacts as well as be costly and have a short operating lifetime. This project will provide new dyes that offer significant improvements relating to all these points taking a giant leap forwards to realising solar electricity generation as a cheap reliable technology for all.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J003220/1","grantId":"EP/J003220/1","fundValue":"87253","fundStart":"2012-04-23","fundEnd":"2014-04-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Stephen Fossey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" Series of novel compounds made as planned - awaiting results from collaborator in analysis we are further investigating with new partners in new avenues Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
