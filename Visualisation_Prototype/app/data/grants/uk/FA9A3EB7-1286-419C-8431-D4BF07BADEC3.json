{"id":"FA9A3EB7-1286-419C-8431-D4BF07BADEC3","title":"New-ACE: A Network for New Academics in Control Engineering","abstractText":"Control engineering, one of the classical engineering subjects, plays an important role in modern science and technology. Control techniques have been applied to various advanced subject areas, such as bio-systems, communications, signal processing, renewable energy etc, in addition to the conventional areas e.g. mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, robotics, and aerospace engineering. This proposal seeks funds to establish a network of New Academics in Control Engineering (New-ACE), aiming to shape the future of collaborative research and education in control engineering. The network offers a support framework and focal point for new academics, researchers and industrialists in the area of control and related subjects, providing them a platform to exchange ideas, experience and practices, to strengthen collaboration activities, to strengthen long-term collaboration activities, to support potential future leaders in control engineering and related areas and to develop/sustain a strong future for control engineering in the UK. The network consists of advisory members, core members (the investigators and project partners) and participants. It is planned to run for three years with funds from EPSRC and then to self-sustain afterwards, with membership subscriptions or sponsorship from academic publishers and industrial partners. The main theme of the network is collaborative research activities and career development of new academics. The network activities are divided into one non-technical work package and six technical work packages, in which six workshops are proposed to take place, two per year, at the core members' institutions: Liverpool, Belfast, Imperial, Loughborough and Sheffield. Keynote speakers talking about future perspectives, career development, writing successful grant applications, advanced teaching &amp; learning, course design etc will be invited. Some of the thinking behind the network has been inspired by the EPSRC initiative 'Challenging Engineering', with more emphasis on common language among participants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E055877/1","grantId":"EP/E055877/1","fundValue":"73381","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Not available at the time of filling this form.
