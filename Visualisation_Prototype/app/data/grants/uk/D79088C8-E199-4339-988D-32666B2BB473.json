{"id":"D79088C8-E199-4339-988D-32666B2BB473","title":"TradeTech2010 Showcase Workshop","abstractText":"This proposal seeks 18,110 funding from EPSRC to support a showcase of EPSRC-funded talent (i.e., early-career researchers) and technology (i.e., research outputs) at TradeTech2010, the premier annual trading-technology summit for senior executives in the global financial markets, to be held in London in April 2010. As the global financial markets are clearly a major component of the current and future digital economy landscape both in the UK and overseas, such a showcase seems ideally-suited to funding from EPSRC's Digital Economy programme. TradeTech2010 will be held in the UK for the first time in its ten-year history, adding extra significance to a showcase of EPSRC-funded researchers and research-outputs. The cash value of in-kind contributions from WBR, the conference company that organizes the TradeTech summit series, is worth up to 37,400 and hence significantly exceeds the EPSRC funding requested here. The two authors of this proposal have a unique mix of experience, expertise, and contacts that make them ideally suited to deliver a high value return on the modest funds requested here.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I001603/1","grantId":"EP/I001603/1","fundValue":"14488","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This grant enabled the purchase of computing and network equipment, and the development of software to run on the computers, that could be used to study the interaction of human traders with automated trading systems, under controlled experimental conditions. These experiments were run at the annual TradeTech Europe &amp;quot;Summit&amp;quot; (a trade-only conference/exhibition for senior executives in the global financial markets: individual registration fees typically around &pound;4,000 per person). The grant also enabled a number of EPSRC_funded PhD students to attend TradeTech, to help in the experiments and also to further their own experience by attending the various talks and exhibits at the Summit.

The OpEx software has been downloaded for use in experiments more than 900 times, by researchers from countries all over the world. The software enabled the study of experiments where the human traders were financial-market professionals, and resulted in a number of peer-review publications. The 930+ downloads of the software mean that it is likely to be in use by many research groups around the world.
