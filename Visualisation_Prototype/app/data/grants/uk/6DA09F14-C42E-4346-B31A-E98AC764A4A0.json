Research into postnatal PTSD is being carried out internationally, but in a disparate way by people from different disciplinary backgrounds. Clinically there are currently no specific guidelines for screening and treatment of postnatal PTSD, which means services are being implemented without a sufficient evidence base.&nbsp;This research network creates an opportunity to move the research and clinical agendas forward, and involves a range of disciplines as well as representatives from relevant voluntary group organisations. Participants represent the majority of those working in this area in the UK, Europe and Australia. This network therefore plays a crucial role in enabling key researchers, clinicians and voluntary groups to work together to produce a cohesive research agenda; achieve larger-scale funding; and form an effective world-wide collaborative network.&nbsp;Written output will be produced from initial seminars.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The research network met initially in 2005, funded by the British Psychological Society.&nbsp;Four more seminars are planned from 2006 to 2008, funded by the ESRC, which will result in written output.&nbsp;The final seminar will be open access and a website will be developed to increase the profile of the network.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4216","grantId":"RES-451-25-4216","fundValue":"15553","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kirstie Natalie McKenzie-McHarg","coPersons":["Susan  Ayers","P  Slade"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
