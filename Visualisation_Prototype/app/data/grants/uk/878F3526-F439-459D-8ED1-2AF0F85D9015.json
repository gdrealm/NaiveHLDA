Since this disease affects primarily older people and the number of people reaching an advanced age continues to increase each year, the proportion of affected people is rising. Some treatments for Alzheimer?s disease now exist, but all of these treat only the symptoms, and not the cause so that after a while the treatments fail and patients continue to deteriorate as nerve cells die and dementia worsens. One of the major changes in Alzheimer brain is the presence of neuritic or senile plaques, comprised mainly of a protein called amyloid. A second change is the appearance of tangles containing a different protein called tau. However, this project focuses on amyloid protein since the deposits of amyloid present in plaques are abnormal and it is important to determine how this abnormal form is generated from its precursor protein. A major site for the production of amyloid is in specialised areas on the surface of the nerve cell called lipid rafts. These rafts contain concentrations of molecules including proteins and cholesterol that ?float? around in the cell surface in a sea of fats. Our hypothesis is that changing the amount of cholesterol influences the composition of the proteins normally present in lipid rafts and this affects the production of amyloid protein. Such changes could trigger a series of signalling events through the cell that leads to nerve cell death and ultimately dementia. Understanding the processes involved in the regulation of amyloid production via cholesterol is the first step towards discovering new pathways involved in Alzheimer?s disease so that new targets can be identified. If changes in lipid rafts can be influenced by drug treatment, then this work will inform the development of new drugs to treat Alzheimer?s disease. Some drugs aimed at preventing the abnormalities in amyloid are in development, however these are aimed at different pathways and until we have an effective treatment there is still a need to find new drug targets to combat Alzheimer?s disease.\nKey research findings generated from researchers in the Neurodegeneration Interdisciplinary Research Group are posted on the Institute Psychiatry website. This information is accessible to all and therefore provides the lay public with information about the progress of our research. Topics of special interest are reported as press releases whenever appropriate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400050","grantId":"G0400050","fundValue":"565822","fundStart":"2005-04-04","fundEnd":"2008-07-03","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Diane  Hanger","coPersons":["Richard  Killick"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
