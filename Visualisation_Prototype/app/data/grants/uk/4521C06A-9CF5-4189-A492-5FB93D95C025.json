Metal powders are encapsulated in a complex-geometry reusable rubber tool and isostatically pressed. The resulting compacts are fully densified using a novel hot isostatic pressing (HIP) method that enables the densification of multiple green compacts into full density. Key innovations include novel tooling method to produce partially consolidated complex compacts and novel processing route to simultaneously consolidate multiple components to full density.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507672/1","grantId":"EP/M507672/1","fundValue":"97409","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Khamis  Essa","coPersons":["Moataz M Attallah"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
