{"id":"F439E0E7-E0F7-4015-8973-256508CC2EF2","title":"Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology at Edinburgh","abstractText":"We propose a coherent, 5-year, rolling programme of research in Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology. This rolling grant consolidates all grant support in this area at IfA Edinburgh, and supports the work of a significantly expanded group, including 8 permanent academic staff. The group has expertise in all observation, computation and theory, and our proposed programme includes both extensive observational work, and substantial theoretical/computational elements, with a clear synergy between the two. Much of the programme is linked to the exploitation of major new facilities, surveys and simulations in which IfA astronomers have made a major intellectual investment, and which should come to fruition during the next 5 years. For convenience, we have subdivided the programme into two sections - Cosmology, and Galaxies - where under the latter heading we include work on AGN and black-hole growth, now viewed as an integral part of galaxy formation. Detailed progress reports and self contained PDRA programmes for 2006-2011 are provided in the appropriate appendices (Section 5 - Cosmology, and Section 5 - Galaxies). In total we are requesting support for 9 PDRAs, plus support for 0.5 of a PDRA to match funds which we aim to raise from non-astronomical applications of the MOPED algorithm.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D001021/1","grantId":"PP/D001021/1","fundValue":"1532630","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"James  Dunlop","coPersons":["Andy  Lawrence","Ross  McLure","David  Bacon","Alan  Heavens","Philip  Best","John Andrew Peacock","Andy  Taylor","Robert Graham Mann","Makoto  Kishimoto","Avery  Meiksin"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
