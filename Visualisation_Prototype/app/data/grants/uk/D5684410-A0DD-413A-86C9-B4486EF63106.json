The study stems from successful previous work by the proposer in ultrasonic cutting of food products and recent work on ultrasonic cutting of bone, to improve the performance of current ultrasonic devices and identify a new generation of ultrasonic instruments for osteotomy and osteoplasty in implantology, periodontology, endodontics, orthodontic and orthopaedic surgery.Research by the PI has shown that nonlinear phenomena such as tuned frequency shifts and multi-modal responses are characteristic of ultrasonic cutting devices driven at high power. He has demonstrated that the vibration behaviour of these devices is qualitatively similar to theoretical models of autoparametric and nonlinear dynamic systems. In this proposed work, nonlinear phenomena will be characterised in a range of ultrasonic bone cutting systems with the aim of controlling, eliminating or enhancing the responses as benefits of each surgical application. A validated theoretical methodology for ultrasonic component design, based on the control of nonlinear vibration effects will be proposed. Hence, single-mode or multi-mode surgical devices will be designed either by constraining or by exploiting the inherent nonlinear behaviour of system components. The research outcomes will also provide insights and solutions for the control of nonlinear vibration characteristics in a wider range of ultrasonic systems including tuned devices used for manufacturing and chemical-biological processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E025811/1","grantId":"EP/E025811/1","fundValue":"110732","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret  Lucas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
