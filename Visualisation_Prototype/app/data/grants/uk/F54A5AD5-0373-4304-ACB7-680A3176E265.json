Remarkably, the same genes that run the circadian clock in the fruitfly, such as period, Clock, doubletime, also encode the clock in mammals. However, the most important environmental rhythms for animals that inhabit the seashore are not those of day and night, but those of high and low tide that ebb and flow every 12.4 h. Animals that inhabit this intertidal zone adjust their behaviour to the mechanical agitation of the incoming and outgoing tide. At low tide, they hide from predators by burrowing into the sand, and at high tide, crabs, for example, swim and forage for food. Terrestrial animals evolved from marine organisms so tidal rhythms may even have predated the circadian 24 h cycle. Nothing is known about the molecular basis for tidal rhythms. One idea is that the same genes that determine circadian rhythmicity may also be involved in tidal cycles. As many of the circadian clock gene products (mRNAs and proteins) cycle in the animals' brains with a 24 h period, we might expect that if the same genes controlled tidal cycles, their mRNA should also show 12.4 h cycles of expression in the part of the brain which controls tidal rhythmicity. Alternatively, a completely different set of genes might be determining tidal cycles, but we would nevertheless expect some of these to have12.4 h cycles of expression at the level of their mRNA. With this in mind, we have studied the molecular basis of the intertidal crustacean, Eurydice pulchra (the 'sea louse'). Eurydice shows very robust circadian and tidal cycles of behaviour. We have already identified almost all of Eurydice's circadian clock genes that would be expected to play the major role in generating 24 h cycles, and indeed we find rhythmic expression in some specific Eurydice neurons that express the PER protein. Under conditions in which we know that tidal cycles of behaviour are expressed, we find that two other neurons begin to express PER. It could be that the two groups of PER expressing neurons are both rhythmic with 24 h periods, but interact to give the ~12 hour tidal cycle. In order to see which genes cycle with 12.4 h mRNA rhythms, without any prior guesswork as to their identity, we have developed a Eurydice microarray, a glass slide on which the sequences corresponding to many thousands of Eurydice genes, have been spotted. By interrogating this microarray with mRNA collected from Eurydice brains at different times, which will hybridise to their corresponding DNA sequences on the microarray, we have obtained about 80 candidate tidal genes that show ~12 h cycles of expression. This grant proposal seeks to use those parts of tidal genes (promoters), that are responsible for their cycling and isolate the proteins that control this cycling. These proteins will then have their own genes and promoters analysed, and in this way we will work backwards into the tidal clock. We shall also use the canonical circadian clock genes from Eurydice that we have identified and use antibodies which label their proteins, to see whether groups of clock gene expressing neurons might form a network from which a ~12 h tidal rhythm could emerge. We shall also attempt to knock out these clock genes in individual Eurydice, and if this disrupts their tidal behaviour, it will mean that the tidal clock is probably generated by circadian oscillations. Finally we shall challenge the microarray with RNA taken from animals that have been acutely exposed to the major environmental stimuli that entrain circadian and tidal behaviour, namely light and vibration. This should allow us to identify light and vibration responsive genes. The vibration responsive genes would be particularly useful in helping us find the anatomical input pathways into the tidal clock.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E000835/1","grantId":"BB/E000835/1","fundValue":"404411","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Yes they were used to obtain further funding from BBSRC Education Cultural","person":"Charalambos  Kyriacou","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":" We showed that the main negative regulator for the Eurydice pulchra circadian clock was EpCRY2, with additional support from EpPER and EpTIM. We found that EpBMAL1 and EpCLK were the main positive regulators for the clock. CLK had many isoforms and we were able to identify the most abundant, which also gave the optimum trancriptional activation. We transformed Epper into Drosophila per mutants and obtained modest rescue possibly because EpPER appears to lack Casein Kinase 1 binding regions, and this was supported when we observed that in mammalian cells, EpCK1 does not stimulate EpPER degradation. We also demonstarted that a specific inhibitor of CK1e affects the transcriptional ability of EpCLK-EpBMAL1, by altering the postranslational processing of EpCLK. This was a crucial result in developing our model with our collaborators.\n\n\n\nWe have shown that disrupting the negative elements of the clock (EpPER) either genetically or environmentally, affects the expression of circadian but not tidal phenotypes. Pharmacological disruption of the positive element EpCLK disturbs both the circadian and tidal phenotypes. . Consequently, tidal and circadian rhythms must have the positive elements EpCLK-EpBMAL1 in common, but not the negative elements (EpPER, EpTIM). The tidal oscillator may have its own dedicated negative elements, one of which should be responsive to vibration, salinity etc (ie a tide-related stimulus) in the same way that TIM is responsive to light for the arthropod circadian clock. Furthermore one of these tidal negative regulators should cycle with a 12.4 or 24.8 h rhythm. The IHC results revealed that the Dorsal cells expressed positive and negative elements, but the Laterodorsal neurons only expressed the positive elements. Two other groups of neurons (Dorsolateral and Lateral) each expressed a different positive element plus EpPER. \n\n\n\nThus a tantalising hypothesis emerges where the Laterodorsal cells are the putative tidal oscillators and the Dorsal cells (and perhaps the Dorsolateral and Lateral cells) represent the putative circadian clock neurons. This would easily explain the phenotypic results we obtain. Our simple model provides the first mechanistic molecular and neurogenetic explanation for how tidal phenotypes can be generated.
