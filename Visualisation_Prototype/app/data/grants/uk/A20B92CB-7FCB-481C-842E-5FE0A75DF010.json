Volume 1 (up to 1817) was published in 1989, edited by Geoffrey Matthews and Kelvin Everest. Volume 2 (1817-1819), edited by Kelvin Everest and Geoffrey Matthews with contributions from Jack Donovan, Ralph Pite and Michael Rossington, was published in 2000. Volume 3 (1819-1822) will contain approximately 14000 lines of Shelley's poetry and is being edited by Jack Donovan, Cian Duffy and Michael Rossington with a contribution from Kelvin Everest. It is to be submitted in January 2007 for publication later that year.The edition will include, when completed, texts edited afresh of all the poetry written by Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822), arranged in chronological order of composition, and introduced and annotated in detail.The aim of the 'Longman Annotated English Poets' series is to provide specialists, university students, and the general reader with complete, authoritatively-established and fully annotated editions of the major English poets. As such the proposed work will be of interest to a wider audience than an advanced academic one only.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D00022X/1","grantId":"AH/D00022X/1","fundValue":"24544","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Rossington","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" The key findings of this project are to have produced in Volumes 3 and 4 of 'The Poems of Shelley' a complete, chronologically-ordered edition of all the poems and verse fragments composed by Percy Bysshe Shelley between mid-1819 and August 1821.
