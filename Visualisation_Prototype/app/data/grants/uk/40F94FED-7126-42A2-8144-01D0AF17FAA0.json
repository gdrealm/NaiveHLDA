A key challenge in geological science is how to predict reliably the sudden changes in behaviour that are typical of such domes, from gentle lava effusion to devastating explosive eruptions. Much progress has been made in recent years in studying eruptive behaviour, with the realisation that the material response of magma to applied stresses largely controls eruption mechanisms and the rheology of dome lava changes greatly during shallow degassing and crystallisation. A goal of the current generation of models for dome growth is to identify thresholds in behaviour (e.g. explosive/effusive eruptions, endogenous/exogenous dome growth) that are closely related to the fundamental physical behaviour of whether deforming magma will fracture or flow. We propose to do experiments in the laboratory on lava dome material from the recent eruption of Mt St Helens under simulated volcanic conditions. These expriments will establish the thresholds for dome growth and explosive eruptions. Acoustic emissions will also be measured during these laboratory experiments, so that the laboratory experiments can be related to observed volcano seismicity.These laboratory studies will provide direct input into the development of the current generation of models of volcanic dome behaviour.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D012910/1","grantId":"NE/D012910/1","fundValue":"459639","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Better understanding of precursors to volcanic eruptions.

This thinking underpins our understanding of volcanic earth- quakes, which are assumed to occur in cold rocks surrounding moving magma. However, the recent discovery of abundant brittleâ€“ductile fault textures in silicic lavas led to the counter-intuitive hypothesis that seismic events may be triggered by fracture and faulting within the erupting magma itself. This hypothesis is supported by recent observations of growing lava domes, where microearthquake swarms have coincided with the emplacement of gouge-covered lava spines, leading to models of seismogenic stick-slip along shallow shear zones in the magma. But can fracturing or faulting in high-temperature, eruptible magma really generate measurable seismic events? We showed by deforming high-temperature silica-rich magmas under simulated volcanic conditions in order to test the hypothesis that high-temperature magma fracture is seismogenic. The acoustic emissions recorded during experiments show that seismogenic rupture may occur in both crystal-rich and crystal-free silicic magmas at eruptive temperatures, extending the range of known conditions for seismogenic faulting. Our work is much cited and has stimulated further research into the fundamentals of volcano lava dome stability. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
