{"id":"963AEA0E-D770-4340-9019-F013D99FEB0D","title":"Party Patronage, Governance and Reform","abstractText":"<p>Public opinion research reveals overwhelmingly negative perceptions regarding how ministers make senior public appointments within the civil service and to various quangos. </p>\n\n<p>The origins of this public viewpoint may well inter alia lie in a journalistic interpretation of all appointments to public and semi-public bodies as not being based on merit but on more shady party-political clientelistic practices (frequently associated with sleaze, corruption, cronyism and 'jobs for the boys'). However the discretion and powers of ministers in relation to party patronage shifted markedly in the final decade of the twentieth century. </p>\n\n<p>After centuries of a classic 'spoils system' in which parties of both the left and the right utilised the political opportunity structure to flood significant areas of the wider-state sector with party political appointees an independent regulatory framework was established to impose and police a merit-based system from 1995 onwards. The distance between the public's perception and the media's projection of party patronage, on one side of the debate, and the creation of a dense institutional architecture of independent appointment commissions and regulatory frameworks, on the other, creates a demand to clarify and articulate exactly how the patronage capacity of ministers has altered in Britain since the mid-1990s.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H021280/1","grantId":"ES/H021280/1","fundValue":"80410","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew Vincent Flinders","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
