In eastern Germany there is a multiplicity of communal memories of the former German Democratic Republic ranging from nostalgic sentiments to government-sponsored critical examinations of the ‘totalitarian state’, all of which are contentious in the public.</p>\n\n<p>The research consists of ethnographic study in each setting including participant observation and interviews to enquire into the day-to-day management of ‘re-working the past’ and the tacit knowledge underpinning it. The interviews will explore individual reflections and value-judgements about past and present. The analysis will highlight differences in interpreting and representing the past between governmental, institutional and individual discourses, resulting contestation and its potential resolution.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the project aims to establish a network of scholars interested in how cultural reflections about the past play out in other postsocialist societies.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0035","grantId":"RES-061-23-0035","fundValue":"185308","fundStart":"2007-01-02","fundEnd":"2009-01-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anselma  Gallinat","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
