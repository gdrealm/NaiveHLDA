The delegation was lead by Feed Leeds, a third Sector umbrella organisation were I act as Secretary, which I have co-founded and that was launched and consolidated through the Urban Food Justice social platform. The delegation was asking the establishment of a working group for the establishment of a Sustainable Food Strategy for the city of Leeds, and the request was approved unanimously by the 99 Councillors on the 10th of September 2014.\n\n2) The article &lt;Critical Geography of Urban Agriculture&gt;; has been featured on a number of blogs and websites immediately after its publication and to date it is still the most read article of the journal (Progress in Human Geography - ranked 2nd in the impact factor in human geography journals).\nSee for example here: \nhttp://www.cityfarmer.info/?s=Critical+geography+of+urban+agriculture \nand here: \nhttp://www.citeulike.org/group/15407/author/Tornaghi:C\n\n3) The &lt;Users guide&gt; produced through this research has been distributed to public health workers following an invited presentation given to an educational workshop organised by the Public Health Services (Leeds City Council), where feedback from participants was excellent and people asked for specific guiding documents where to read more about the topic.\n\n4) A number of academics, following the publication of the article in Progress, have been in touch asking for further elaboration of the concepts, tailored to their specific projects (i.e. an Italian journal for planners - declined due to short deadline - and an international handbook on food and the environment - accepted). A major publisher, Springer, has also been in touch inviting me to submit a book proposal for their Future Cities series).

These can be clustered in three groups: \ni) Socio-environmental justice. Many individuals working/volunteering in these projects are driven by an environmental ethic, and are concerned about climate change, world food regimes, exploitation of people/natural resources, and ultimately food sovereignty.\nii) 'Green' jobs. A rising number of projects emerge out of a new awareness that funding is now available in this sector. This is especially the case of: a) artists, previously employed in the performing or public art sectors, and b) the public health sector that out of necessity - drastic cuts to public funding - looks for alternative ways of mobilizing &quot;the Big Society&quot; around health education and social cohesion. \niii) The search for new community ties is also a goal, but usually comes associated with ideas about neighbourhood regeneration, beautification of derelict sites and in general a will to impact and claim ownership of the local environment.\nMore details will be available in the paper (in preparation) &quot;Urban agriculture: Understanding a transnational trans-generational and class crosscutting cultural shift&quot;;\n\n2) The research has identified a number of exclusionary mechanisms related to food growing, for example:\n- The urban poor and people in food deserts, who are the ones who most need to access land for growing food often lack the capacity and resources (time, skills,) to navigate the system and benefit from existing opportunities\n- Vocational low income people, who are actually growing their own food to contribute to their family economy are increasingly experiencing obstacles due to austerity, corporate management and increase in land rents.\n- Across all the categories of growers, there is perception of lack of skills/time to transform the harvest into food: as a consequence, much of the food grown is not harvested or is wasted at home.\n- A range of UA advocates, knowingly or unknowingly, promote UA that contributes to dismantling the welfare state, advocating regressive self-sufficiency models and promoting further enclosures of the commons in the name of the 'big society'. \nA detailed discussion is available in &quot;Critical geography of urban agriculture&quot;, published in Progress in Human Geography (2014) and in the paper &quot;(Re)defining Urban Food Justice&quot; (under review with Antipode);\n3) The project has identified a range of opportunities and constraints around issues of land access, competing claims on land and the externality effects of UA that represent policy challenges. These are discussed in the research report 'policy brief'.\n\n4) The project has created the Urban Food Justice social platform, aimed at bringing together different stakeholders in critical dialogue and action. This consisted of 11 learning events co-designed/co-facilitated with local stakeholders and participated by over 90 individuals. The platform has been key in the establishment of a number of initiatives, for example, the umbrella organisation Feed Leeds (www.feedleeds.org), a soil quality network, a working group aiming to establish a Leeds Food Hub, a working group for the creation of a city wide Leeds Sustainable Food Strategy. I have published a paper highlighting how my explorative research lead to a new research agenda for a critical geography of urban agriculture. This is the most read paper of the journal (Progress in Human Geography, which is one of the top human geography journals).\nI ahve also been invited to write a chapter for an International Hanbook on food and environment which will be very influential.
