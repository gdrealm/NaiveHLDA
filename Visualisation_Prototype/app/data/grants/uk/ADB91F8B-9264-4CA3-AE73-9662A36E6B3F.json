It will address four research questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>To what extent can data collection using a smartphone app improve our understanding of social worlds, simultaneously measuring:&nbsp;social networks and their operation,&nbsp;individual behaviour, and how these relate to the environment?</li>\n\n <li>What are the ethical considerations to performing such studies, and to what extent do these differ between disciplines?</li>\n\n <li>What are the practical, individual, cultural and social barriers to using this methodology?</li>\n\n <li>Does the inclusion of social media feedback functions improve retention rates?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will compare the results of questionnaire-based survey methods with those collected via an App designed to capture self-reported changes in friendship networks and behaviour, GPS data on where, when and with whom adolescents spend their time, frequency and duration of texting and phone use. The App will also enable us to gather contextual data on young people's 'lived experience' via photo-journal/visual ethnographic data.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Participants will be school pupils aged 16-18 who consent to participate.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003198/1","grantId":"ES/L003198/1","fundValue":"196726","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Geraldine Mary Macdonald","coPersons":["Sakir  Sezer","Mark  McCann","Robert  Miller","John  Moriarty","Mark  Tully","Kathryn  Higgins","Paul Spencer Ell"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
