{"id":"CE30976B-1C51-4AA6-B2A6-E9EC328FEFBD","title":"Advertising and The City: Making the Political and Symbolic Economies of Urban Spaces","abstractText":"<p>This project aims to produce the first sociological account of the commercial practices of outdoor advertising companies in UK urban contexts and the impact of outdoor advertising on the visual landscapes of contemporary cities. The research involves the collection and analysis of ethnographic and interview data from outdoor advertising companies focusing on their conceptualisation of city space, potential consumers, and movements and flows in that space. An analysis will also be undertaken of the discourses of urban space and consumption produced by the companies' self-promotional materials (websites, media packs). </p>\n\n<p>The project will produce a case study of Manchester, focusing on outdoor advertising companies' ways of conceiving, segmenting and selling spaces and routes in the city, and analysing outdoor advertisementsâ€™ role in shaping the visuality of that urban space. Using this data, the project will theorise the role and impact in UK cities of outdoor advertising companies as 'creative industries' and will analyse the impact of such advertising on notions of 'public space', 'commercial space' and assess the synergies or tensions between them.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D000904/1","grantId":"ES/D000904/1","fundValue":"62851","fundStart":"2006-04-24","fundEnd":"2007-04-23","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Cronin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":" I have theorised the relationship between outdoor advertising, urban space and neo-capitalism.
