{"id":"D06F54EE-E4CC-4FC5-9C30-AFCF7B942803","title":"SWEPT2","abstractText":"The SWEPT2 project aims to develop a sophisticated tool for modelling wind turbine wakes and wake interactions in the\ncontext of large wind parks, primarily offshore. Such models are essential for improved wind farm designs with improved\nenergy yields. The Imperial College contribution is to improve the understanding of the flow physics associated with large\nscale rotor wakes interacting with the turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer and with downstream rotors. This is\naimed at improving the turbulence modelling in the CFD calculations of flow through the whole wind park array of HAWTs.\nComparisons with experimental measurements at laboratory scale and at full scale to help validation are intended.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508524/1","grantId":"EP/N508524/1","fundValue":"71008","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Mike Graham","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
