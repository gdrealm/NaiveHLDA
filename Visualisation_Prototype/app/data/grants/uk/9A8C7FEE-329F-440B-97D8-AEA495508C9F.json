The primary focus is the use of induced pluripotent cells (iPS), but the project outputs are expected to be applicable to other types of cells, including embryonic stem cells (ES). The team will have the following roles within the project:1. To provide the cellular materials to enable assay development and cell testing2. To test the 'quality' of different cell populations i.e. their stability and differentiation potential3. To analyse the profile of gene expression of the cell populations4. To analyse the genetically imprinted regions in the cell populationsThe above approaches will allow the project members to correlate different cell characteristics with the regulation of specific genes, and/or genetic imprinting. With further development, these discoveries will form the basis of new assays and tests that are used in the production of therapeutically competent cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/H001220/1","grantId":"TS/H001220/1","fundValue":"653623","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The MS-iPS project set out to identify and develop the tools and processes that enable effective translation of iPS innovation to the clinical use of high value stem cell therapeutic products. This would overcome the limitations of embryo-derived materials that currently dominate this area of product development. The iPS cell technology is expected to dramatically accelerate uptake and pace of new product development. Therefore, the original objectives of the project were: \n(a) Validate processes, media, additives and procedures that enable reproducible production of therapeutic iPS cells \n(b) Identify and validate assayable markers of iPS cell integrity and functionality \n(c) Develop commercially viable products for iPS cell manufacture.\nThe project has successfully completed:\n(a) by validating the processes and procedures for determining the production and derivation of iPS cells from clinical samples and their ability to succesfully and reproducibly differentiate these lines into extra-embryonic tissues, endoderm and neuroectoderm using defined culture conditions.\n(b) by correlating the capacity of differentiation between hIPSCs lines and markers using Q-PCR analysis, 450K Illumina deep sequencing arrays and pyrosequencing methods. Not only correlating differentiation potential with well established markers but also with novel markers and molecular signatures.

Accordingly, 45 hIPSCs lines were derived from 16 individuals 1 to 75 years old and with an equal representation of both Sex. In addition, we used two reprogramming methods (Sendai virus and Retrovirus) and different somatic cells (Skin fibroblast and vascular cells) to increase the complexity and deepness of our studies. 35 hIPSC lines were differentiated into the three germ layers and characterised by FACS, Q-PCR and immunostaining. These analyses revealed that hIPSC lines vary in their capacity of differentiation and that this variability is likely to be provoked by genetic background. We then provide large quantity of cells for epigenetic analyses to the different members of the consortium and then help them to interpret their results. We used these data to uncover new markers characterising hIPSC lines with a high capacity of differentiation toward specific germ layers. The importance of these markers was functionally validated by performing gain and loss of function experiments. These experiments revealed new mechanisms associating cell fate decisions and genetic. Explotation plan for Manufacturing solutions for high value induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) products (MS-iPS).\n\nThe aim is to produce a minimum viable population-signature which can distinguish good from bad iPSCs in terms of differentiation capacity.\n\nThe analysis will group induced pluripotent cells derived from patient tissue samples in terms of their ability to differentiate into the three cell lineages (endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm). It will determine the key epigenetic marks which are the most important distinguishing feature to be able to divide them into &quot;good&quot; (those which can fully differentiate) versus &quot;bad&quot; (those which can't) cell lines.\nInitial epigenetic analysis has shown that non-CpG methylation appears to be a good discriminator, whereas CpG methylation appears not to be a good discriminator. Thus, the project will select and validate a key signature gene set in the existing cell lines. Further validation work will confirm the initial findings with the end result being the identification of a signature array which can be used as a tool.\n\nExamples of the application of this signature could be: \n(i) Clonal analysis of revertants i.e bad cell lines which have been rescued to good ones.\n(ii) Predictive capacity for cells from a completely different source/protocol but same differentiated lineages. \n\nThe route to market will be via the licensing of patented gene sets for arrays. The types of products based on these innovations are well established and will initially be focussed on the non-clinical research market in the near term while pursuing clinical applications in the longer term.
