The pattern of welfare provision for carers has been studied neither concurrently nor over time. The aims of this research are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>describe the pattern of support in the 'mixed economy' of care for carers of people with dementia in relation to psychological and social characteristics of carers.</li>\n\n <li>study the interplay of contributions from welfare providers (statutory, voluntary and family) over&nbsp;two years, eg identifying whether carer services replace the family carer or facilitate ongoing care.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The data for this research was collected during a large intervention trial of befriending by trained lay volunteers funded by the Health Technologies Assessment Programme (99/34/07) and known as the ‘Befriending and Costs of Caring’ (BECCA) project (ISRCTN08130075). This ESRC funded project is a secondary analysis of the BECCA dataset in line with recommended practice of making full use of existing datasets. The findings will be disseminated to relevant interest groups and policy forums through a report and a series of journal articles.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E011322/1","grantId":"ES/E011322/1","fundValue":"78987","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Georgina Mary Charlesworth","coPersons":["Paul Frederick Higgs","Fiona  Poland"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
