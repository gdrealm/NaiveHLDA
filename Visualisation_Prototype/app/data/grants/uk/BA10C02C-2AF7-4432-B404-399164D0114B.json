Substituted o-vanillin molecules will be coupled with 2-aminophenol or enantiomerically pure 2-phenylglycinol to synthesize organic Schiff Base linkers. The proposed ligands when combined with divalent transition metal and trivalent lanthanide ions result in the synthesis of tetranuclear CCs possessing defect dicubane topology. \n\nThe targeted CCs will be used as catalyst for different Lewis-acid catalysed organic reactions. The catalytic activity of those compounds will be studied in protic and non-protic systems. This is a new approach of using 3d/Dy CCs as catalysts, and will be studied for the first time.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M023834/1","grantId":"EP/M023834/1","fundValue":"92471","fundStart":"2015-06-28","fundEnd":"2016-04-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Georgios  Kostakis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
