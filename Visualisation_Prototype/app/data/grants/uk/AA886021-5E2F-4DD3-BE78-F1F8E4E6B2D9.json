One of the major problems faced by multicore system designers is to achieve maximum performance and functionality while respecting the power dissipation budget, which limits how much energy the system can take from mains or batteries. The power budget should be set as low as possible, because of energy costs, impact on the environment, battery lifetime, cooling costs, among other factors. This project aims to investigate and develop design techniques to optimise multicores in such a way that they can perform the same functionality with the same level of performance, while dissipating less power. The main focus of the techniques addressed by this project is the on-chip communication infrastructure, which was introduced to allow the multiple processing cores to exchange data and can account for up to 30% of the total power dissipated by the chip. To maximise the impact of this research to the UK and European economy, the project will address system-level techniques which are available to local system design and integration companies, rather than technology-specific techniques that require control of the chip fabrication process, which is often outsourced.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J003662/1","grantId":"EP/J003662/1","fundValue":"99685","fundStart":"2012-03-26","fundEnd":"2013-12-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Extended lsi.noc framework used within an EU-funded project and internal educational activities (MEng projects).

For the majority of packets in real and synthetic application case studies simulated, the latency simulation produced results accurate to within several flits. Results also showed that the aggregate power consumption from the TLM models is also accurate to within 2-3% of the values obtained from the cycle-accurate simulations. The second work package showed that non-preemptive NoCs with dynamic task remapping can reduce power consumption and latency 30-40% compared to a static initial mapping in a priority preemptive NoC. This result was obtained in simulation with a real application case study. The third work package showed that coding-aware task mappers can reduce overall power consumption in NoCs compared to the conventional approach of separate mapping and coding, with a 15% power reduction demonstrated in simulation with synthetic traffic patterns.
