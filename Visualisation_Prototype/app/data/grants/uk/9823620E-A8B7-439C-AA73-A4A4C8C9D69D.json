The aim was to design a moving and handling system that enabled wheelchair users access to tents, vehicles, boats and to participate in limited climbing and abseiling. \\n\\nGraduate Andrew Nias, who graduated with an MA in Industrial Design, led the team at Sheffield Hallam University to create a portable A-frame device complete with a bogie/winch to move/ handle patients to and from adjacent locations, such as from the wheelchair to a bed/ toilet/ tent etc. Most importantly the new design can be assembled and disassembled in the field. A further cantilever concept was incorporated so that wheelchair users can be extended over a particular location, such as a boat, a car, a horse etc. and lowered into position. Special slings and 'spreader bars' were also created to make confined spaces accessible and the research team undertook thorough tests on all pieces of equipment to ensure that they met particular British Standard Specifications. \\n\\nThe work of the research team led to a fully functional and safe piece of adventure equipment that enables wheelchair users to enjoy many outdoor pursuits. Equal Adventures ensured that many users and handlers were involved in the equipment's development and made research designs into a successfully manufactured and marketed product. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F500114/1","grantId":"AH/F500114/1","fundValue":"25402","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"G  Cockerham","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
