{"id":"41365F27-F2D2-4BBD-AAAC-3A3D19246C8C","title":"Tailoring Unstructured Meshes for Use with 3D Co-Volume Methods for Engineering Analysis","abstractText":"Computational techniques have become increasingly important with the rapid advancements in technology in areas such as computational fluid dynamics and computational electromagnetic. Over many years, various approaches have been developed for the solution of the governing equations. The most efficient techniques require a structured subdivision of the domain. This normally constrains the problem to simple geometries. Unstructured type meshes provide the geometrical flexibility necessary for simulating the full range of industrial problems. However, simulations involving geometries of industrial interest can be expected to place severe demands on current computational resources, in terms of both cpu time and memory requirements.\nThe present proposal aims at developing a new meshing technique that enable the use of co-volume solution schemes on unstructured meshes, hence, maintaining the efficiency of the structured based solution algorithms and the flexibility of the unstructured subdivision of complex industrial geometries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K000705/1","grantId":"EP/K000705/1","fundValue":"265287","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"O  Hassan","coPersons":["Kenneth  Morgan"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
