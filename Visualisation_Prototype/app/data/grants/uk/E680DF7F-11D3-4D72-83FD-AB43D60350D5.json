{"id":"E680DF7F-11D3-4D72-83FD-AB43D60350D5","title":"The role of vasopressin in olfactory processing","abstractText":"The olfactory bulb is the part of the vertebrate forebrain that is involved in olfaction, the perception of odours. In this large and complex structure, olfactory signals from the nose are processed, and the results of this information processing are conveyed via the olfactory tract to brain areas involved with behavior and memory. That is why when we smell something, it often brings back memories associated with the object. Our work is focused on newly discovered nerve cells within the olfactory bulb that release the neuropeptide vasopressin. It is important to understand the role of vasopressin, because vasopressin acts in the brain to affect social behaviours, including social recognition, pair bonding, sexual behaviour and aggression. The aim of this proposal is to understand how vasopressin affects behaviour and memory within the olfactory bulb at the level of odour perception. Other nerve cells release peptides and they have effects on other emotions and behaviours and this has attracted wide attention because peptide mimetics may be valuable therapeutically for particular behavioural disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F019009/1","grantId":"BB/F019009/1","fundValue":"491040","fundStart":"2008-07-17","fundEnd":"2011-12-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  While the proposed work is aimed at fundamental understanding, this does not preclude us gaining novel therapeutic insights into olfactory signalling.

The findings indicate that social information is processed in part by a vasopressin system intrinsic to the olfactory system.
