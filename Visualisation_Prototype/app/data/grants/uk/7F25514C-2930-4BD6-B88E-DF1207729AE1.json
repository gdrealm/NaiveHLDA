{"id":"7F25514C-2930-4BD6-B88E-DF1207729AE1","title":"UK Carbon Capture and Storage Community Network (UKCCSC)","abstractText":"The potential for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to make a significant contribution to mitigating the risk of dangerous climate change has been recognised by a number of international bodies including the G8, International Energy Agency and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A range of commercial-scale demonstration projects are being proposed with the aim of CCS being available for widespread deployment from around 2020. A significant effort is required to train scientists and engineers (and others) to be able to design, construct and successfully operate these and future projects. It is also crucial to use lessons from these projects to inform CCS R&amp;D, as well as drawing on insights from other fields that could be crucial for rapid development of CCS. Recognising these needs, the Research Councils have made a significant investment in UK CCS R&amp;D capacity including through the E.On/EPSRC partnership and a programme of collaborative work with China.The UK Carbon Capture and Storage Community network (UKCCSC) has been established to support the UK academic community during a period (2009-2013) when significant changes in the CCS landscape are expected. The impacts of the Network will include better co-ordination within the UK CCS R&amp;D community and more effective communication of accurate and impartial information, including key research results, to a wide range of stakeholders in a timely manner. The UKCCSC network will be the main mechanism to enable inter-communication between Research Council-funded projects on CCS. It will also contribute to maximising the efficiency of UK intellectual leverage, including within the international community. UKCCSC is deliberately not sponsored by any commercial entity so that it is able to maintain independence.UKCCSC aims to provide a 'one stop shop' for access to the UK CCS academic community. It intends to encourage collaborations that can support high quality work that will advance fundamental understanding of CCS technology, and the non-technical impacts of its use, and contribute to building world class capacity in this area. Any UK-based researcher is eligible to participate in UKCCSC core activities. These include two face-to-face meetings each year for academic researchers to share ongoing work, as well as updating key stakeholders. Between meetings, the UKCCSC website will provide relevant resources. A regular newsletter will also be circulated to UKCCSC members and registered stakeholders.Additional UKCCSC activities will support the development of a dynamic and stimulating environment for research and innovation on CCS in the UK. These include a programme of activities for early career researchers and specialist workshops or seminars organised in response to proposals from UKCCSC members. Support for exchange visits and other activities to develop strategic alliances within the UK or with international collaborators will also be available to UKCCSC members. In addition, it is expected that UKCCSC will help its membership to contribute to shaping future priorities for funding of CCS R&amp;D in the UK.The UKCCSC secretariat will be responsible for running the network on a day-to-day basis. The full-time network manager supports and promotes academic CCS activities in the UK including by organising events. They are supported by a part-time early careers co-ordinator, webmaster and secretary. The secretariat is jointly hosted by Imperial College London and the University of Edinburgh and managed by Dr Jon Gibbins and Prof Stuart Haszeldine. A project advisory committee will be established to guide the development of UKCCSC as it responds to the rapidly evolving challenges and requirements for CCS R&amp;D. An international reference user group, formed of invited members from representative organisations in other countries, will ensure that strong links are maintained between UK researchers and the international CCS community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H022864/1","grantId":"EP/H022864/1","fundValue":"776389","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  UKCCSC activities have now been fully integrated with the UK CCS Research Centre. Important outcomes from UKCCSC activity included improved communication routes with key stakeholders to ensure timely use of key findings emerging from the CCS R&amp;amp;D community (e.g. coordinated responses to consultations) and a successful early career researcher (ECR) programme. ECR programme participants were able to put their research in context and meet a broader range of stakeholders (including industry) than would otherwise have been the case. This helped to ensure that their research was relevant and also that key findings were available to important potential users of their work as soon as possible.

CCS is a group of technologies that are being developed to reduce the risk of dangerous climate change. The UK is home to several world-leading researchers in this area and UKCCSC helped to ensure that the key findings from the work undertaken by the academic community were available to a broad audience (including industry and policy-makers). UKCCSC also developed a successful programme of activities to support development of early career researchers. In the later years of the award, UKCCSC activities were integrated with the UK CCS Research Centre (www.ukccsrc.ac.uk) after it was established in April 2012. UKCCSC activities are now being continued as part of the UK CCS Research Centre. The programme of activities delivered by UKCCSC could be used by other research communities that wish to improve coordination between researchers at all levels, ensure effective communication with stakeholders and actively support the development of their early career researchers.
