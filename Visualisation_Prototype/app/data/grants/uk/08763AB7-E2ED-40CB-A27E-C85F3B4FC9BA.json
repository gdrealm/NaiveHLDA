How complicated do we need to make the BBN representation to credibly capture the critical nodes and relationships as far as stakeholders are concerned? Is this credible simplification sufficiently manageable to be capable of systematic manipulation, communication and analysis?&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>We will then calibrate our system to represent a previously examined case study area. With this calibrated BBN of a known case, we should be able to replicate the major findings of this previous research, without substantial reference to additional input or interpretation from the specific expertise employed in the original project. If so, then this represents a substantial test of the methodological approach.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-240-25-0009","grantId":"RES-240-25-0009","fundValue":"160184","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Harvey","coPersons":["Jane Helena Atterton","Steven  Rushton"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
