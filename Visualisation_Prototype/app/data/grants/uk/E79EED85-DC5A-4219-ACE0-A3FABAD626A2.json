{"id":"E79EED85-DC5A-4219-ACE0-A3FABAD626A2","title":"International dimensions of political regime dynamics","abstractText":"The aim of this research is to clarify how the dynamics of political regimes and institutional rules in an economy are influenced by its interaction with the rest of the world and the international community. The focus will be on the effects of trade and economic integration, foreign investment, foreign aid, economic sanctions and credit agreements with international organisations on the emergence and consolidation of different types of democracies and autocracies, and institutional rules such as the respect of property rights. A social conflict view of institutions is adopted. Institutional arrangements, such as political regimes or respect of certain property rights, result from the interaction of different groups that attempt to induce institutional rules that maximize their own rents. To the extent that the rest of the world influences social group economic payoffs, political economy models (such as political agency models) and empirical tests of their main propositions will be developed to understand the multidimensional nature of foreign influence and its main economic and institutional consequences.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1360","grantId":"RES-062-23-1360","fundValue":"172895","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Facundo  Albornoz Crespo","coPersons":["Emanuel  Ornelas","Sebastian Franco Galiani","Toke Skovsgaard Aidt"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
