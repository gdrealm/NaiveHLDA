In a single process step, novel film coatings and nanostructures can be patterned and integrated into electronic devices such as conductors, transistors, sensors, printed batteries or displays. \n- Control the crystallisation of inorganic systems using inkjet printing.\n\nThe principle questions to be answered are: \n- Can the overall energy consumption involved in producing printed electronic devices be reduced?\n- Are there performance increases to be gained as a consequence of synthesising material in-situ?\n- Many crystalline systems have been produced by inkjet printing but can properties such as size and degree of crystallinty be controlled?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J014850/1","grantId":"EP/J014850/1","fundValue":"97179","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick James Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" Reactive Inkjet Printing\n\nThe desire to print reactants to simultaneously synthesise and pattern places a further constraint upon ink selection, namely the necessity to correctly balance the stoichiometry of possibly disparate inks and maintenance of suitable reaction conditions on the substrate. In addition, maintaining the integrity of the desired pattern throughout the synthesis and patterning process requires a significant understanding of the wetting and dewetting of the inks. To this end, a number of different, generic techniques were established that can help control both the synthesis conditions and the patterning capability; although the applicability of each technique to a given combination of reactive inks is dependent upon the specific properties of the constituents. \n\n\n\nThese techniques are as follows:\n\n\n\n1 Use of a partially soluble substrate\n\nA substrate coated with a substance that partially dissolves upon contact with the ink can be used to pin the contact line of the liquid with the substrate, and thus enable better definition of the printed pattern.\n\n\n\n2. Controlling the temperature of the substrate\n\nBy elevating the temperature of the substrate, there is increased evaporation of carrier solvent and increased contact line pinning and both the ability to produce an arbitrary pattern and the reaction rate is increased. Conversely, lowering the temperature can slow down the reaction rate but dramatically increase ink viscosity, leading to reduced contact line motion \n\n\n\n3. Use of structured substrates\n\nBy using either geometric or surface energy patterning of the substrate, the deposited ink is constrained upon the substrate with a defined pattern in which the reaction can proceed\n\n\n\n4. Patterning strategy\n\nDeposition of individual discrete droplets, rather than a series of coalesced droplets, enables a reaction to take place independent of patterning. The gaps between a layer of discrete droplets can then be filled in with subsequent layers to enable a macroscopic pattern to be formed.\n\n\n\n-Work carried out\n\n Successful reactive inkjet printing of magnetite via a modified Massart method\n\n Successive printing of a stoichiometric mix of iron II chloride and iron III chloride followed by a sodium hydroxide solution led to the creation of magnetite films. To enable successful patterning and synthesis, offset printing was used in conjunction with an elevated substrate temperature (usual picture needed)\n\n- Outcomes\n\nThe results contributed to a project proposal submitted via EPSRC Early Career Forum in Manufacturing Call (EP/L017237/1 &amp;amp;quot;Additive lithography: A novel route to magnetic nanodevices&amp;amp;quot;)\n\n Paper in prep\n\n\n\n-Work carried out\n\n Reactive inkjet printing of polyaniline/Ag nanocomposite\n\n A 3 ink system (Aniline, ammonium persulfate and silver nitrate, all in 1 N nitric acid) was used to produce polyaniline in situ by means of oxidative polymerisation, together with simultaneous reduction of silver ions to form silver nanoparticles. Particular success in patterning was found when printed onto a substrate coated with polyvinyl alcohol, but this was to the detriment of electrical properties. Limited success with patterning was achieved without the polyvinyl alcohol coating, but an array of reactively printed dots was successfully deposited. This is currently being evaluated for use in sensor applications.\n\n- Outcomes\n\nContinued collaboration with Dr. Aoife Morrin, Dublin City University (DCU).\n\nPaper in prep (awaiting characterisation results from DCU)\n\n\n\n\n\nControlled crystallisation\n\n\n\n-Work Carried out\n\nControlled templating of colloidal crystals for growth of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes\n\nA colloidal suspension of magnetite nanoparticles was deposited on silicon wafers for subsequent use as a template for growth of carbon nanotubes by chemical vapour deposition. The deposition parameters used in printing were found to have a profound influence on the final density and uniformity of the carbon nanotube forests. A model was proposed that related the ink characteristics (particle size, volume fraction) and the printing parameters (surface coverage, droplet size) with the ability to form a close packed monolayer of colloidal particles upon the substrate upon drying. This model was found to show good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiments.\n\n- Outcomes\n\nPaper published (&amp;amp;quot;High Yield Growth of Patterned Vertically Aligned Carbon Nanotubes Using Inkjet-Printed Catalyst,&amp;amp;quot; James D Beard, Jonathan Stringer, Oana R Ghita and Patrick J Smith\n\nACS Appl.
