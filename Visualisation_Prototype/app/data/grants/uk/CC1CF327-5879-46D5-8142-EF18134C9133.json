{"id":"CC1CF327-5879-46D5-8142-EF18134C9133","title":"Integrated Photonic Materials and Devices","abstractText":"This platform grant will underpin integrated photonics research in advanced laser sources, photonic circuits, and sensors, at the Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC) at the University of Southampton, leveraging the recent investment of &gt;&pound;100M in the new Mountbatten Fabrication Complex. Photonic materials and device research has been the key driver of many disruptive advances in telecommunications, healthcare, data storage, display and manufacturing, and this platform grant will provide the group with the horizon and stability to build upon its international standing to explore new high-risk, high-reward research avenues.\n\nIntegrated photonic materials and devices of the future will play a huge role in the next generation of cheaper, faster, greener, disposable, miniaturised and more versatile systems based on silica and silicon, glasses, crystal and polymer hosts, in both channel and planar geometries. The broad range of expertise within our group and our access to the unequalled brand-new planar fabrication facilities will allow us to fully explore this diverse research area. Impact will be realised through applications in compact kW-class waveguide lasers (new manufacturing techniques), pollution sensors (monitoring climate change), optical amplifiers and switches (high-speed data control), early threat detection devices (homeland security), and fast universally accessible disease screening (point-of-care medical diagnostics).\n\nApplications for the photonic materials, processes and devices developed during this platform grant will play a key role in fields of interest to society, Industry as well as university-based research and development, and will be pursued in collaboration with both existing and newly-identified partners during the programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J008052/1","grantId":"EP/J008052/1","fundValue":"1135910","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have published extensively as a group, and our findings have fed forward into further substantial grant successes from RCUK, the EU and industry.

The materials can be glass, crystal, polymer, semiconductor or insulator, and one of the main objectives of the grant is to combine such materials to produce optimised devices that have increased functionality. The outputs of the grant will be taken up by industry, other academic researchers and manufacturing companies in sectors that include healthcare, security, sensing, biotechnology, defence and the digital economy.
