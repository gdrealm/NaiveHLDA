{"id":"025A32C9-D3A5-4FCC-B5EC-9EEA3176C980","title":"Development of Tobacco Control Trial among Migrant Workers in Guangzhou, China","abstractText":"It has been widely accepted that cigarette has tremendous impact on human health. Effective tobacco control effects can help prevent kinds of diseases and social-economic disasters which may happen on smokers of non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke. In China, internal rural-to-urban migrant (mostly migrant workers) makes a large proportion of the whole population, accounting for about 0.24 billion in 2012. This migrant workers population has a serious situation of tobacco exposure.\n\nWe first propose to design a package tailoring the WHO 5A's model into 5A's group consulting intervention package through literature review, in-depth interview and focus group discussion.\n\nThe 5A's group consulting package intervention would include:\n1. Factsheets detailing key information on smoking, SHS.\n2. Guidelines for group guiders on how to deliver the 5A's group consulting (activities for different audiences: smokers, non-smokers exposed to SHS).\n3. A leaflet that contains the key facts about smoking and SHS that can be disseminated to migrant workers after consulting.\n\nBased on the package desigend, we aim to recruit 8 factories (clusters) and all the migrant workers working in these factories from industrial zone of Guangzhou, China. The clusters will be randomized to the intervention and control group in a 1:1 ratio. Clusters allocated to the intervention arm will be offered the 5A's group consulting package. The clusters in the control arm will not be offered the package until the completion of the study. All the migrant workers who work in each factory and provides informed consent will be recruited. Factories will complete a factory survey of basic factory information, all participants will complete a questionnaire (about the status of tobacco exposure, knowledge and attitude of tobacco, and demographic information), and a non-smoking individual will provide a salvia sample which will be tested for cotinine. All these participant outcomes (questionnaire and salvia cotinine) will be measured before and after the 3-month intervention in both arms of the trial. In addition, a purposive sample of participants will be invited for interviews to investigate the facilitators and barriers for integrating 5A's group consulting package into workplace settings and how these can be enhanced or addressed at the end of this trial.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M021513/1","grantId":"MR/M021513/1","fundValue":"133584","fundStart":"2015-05-11","fundEnd":"2016-06-10","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Li  Ling","coPersons":["Xiaolin  Wei","Guanyang  Zou","QUAN  GAN","Wen  Chen"],"organisation":"Sun Yat-Sen University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
