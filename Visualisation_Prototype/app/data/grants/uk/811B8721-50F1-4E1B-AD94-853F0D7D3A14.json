It relies on specific primers to recognize target DNA sequences unique to the organism being detected, making it highly specific. Most molecular diagnostics uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which involves repeated rounds of heating and cooling to make many copies of the target DNA, amplifying it so it can be detected. However the need for temperature cycling, and for sophisticated fluorescence-based systems to detect the amplified DNA, means that it is largely restricted to laboratory use. Moreover PCR is rather sensitive to inhibition by a number of common chemicals found in the environment and body fluids, requiring samples to be extensively purified before analysis.\n\nAs a result the instruments required for PCR are vulnerable and relatively expensive to engineer. Molecular methods are therefore largely confined to large and expensive equipment within diagnostic laboratories requiring skilled operators. The limited equipment available for out-of-laboratory use is expensive, relatively large and unsuited to widespread application.\n\nThe best solution to these problems is a recently developed approach based on amplification at a constant temperature, so-called isothermal amplification, coupled with a read-out of light as the specific target DNA sequence is amplified. This &quot;bioluminescent assay in real-time&quot; or BART results in a emission of a continuous light signal that reaches a peak at a time proportional to the amount of DNA present. BART was invented by the applicant and the CEO of the company started to commercialise such assays, Lumora Ltd. BART has been licensed by Lumora to the global partner 3M, who have commercialised assays for detecting food pathogens. This demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the approach.\n\nBART produces a light output that is simple and cheap to monitor using a camera chip or photodiodes in a solid-state device. This substantially reduces instrument costs and open up new applications for diagnostics and disease monitoring in resource-poor settings such as in the developing world, where there are extensive requirements for cheap molecular assays for disease diagnosis. \n\nA major challenge in molecular diagnostics remains the accurate measurement of the numbers of disease organisms (and hence target DNA molecules) in the sample. This can be done both by PCR and using BART, but the ability to accurately determine the number of molecules of the target becomes much more difficult below about 50 copies for both techniques. For certain diseases and situations, it is critical to be able to accurately measure the numbers of targets at this level. The proposed project is based on new methods discovered by the applicant and the company partner which are able to accurately determine the number of molecules down to a single molecule of target DNA. Moreover, remarkably they can distinguish between numbers of copies accurately in the range 1-10. The proposal is to test and develop these new approaches, and to use them with fluidic chips that would allow accurate measurement of numbers of molecules from 1 up to 100's of billions in a single set of assays carried out on a single plastic chip simultaneously- a so-called full dynamic range assay. Purpose designed algorithms will be developed and explored to analyse the data allowing the numbers to be quantified throughout the dynamic range using the most appropriate combination of methods for each part of the range.\n\nIf successful, this would represent a breakthrough in molecular diagnostics with significant implications as a full dynamic range quantification method, which would see widespread application in research, medical diagnostics, disease monitoring, and environmental protection, with potential economic, health and societal benefits.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L022346/1","grantId":"BB/L022346/1","fundValue":"393245","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"James Augustus Murray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
