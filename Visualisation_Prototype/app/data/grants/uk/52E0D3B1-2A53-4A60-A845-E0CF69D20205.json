If you know cases are all infectious for six days then a\nback-of-the envelope calculation tells you that each case infects on average a\nfurther three before recovering and vaccine coverage of 67% or greater is\nneeded to contain the outbreak. But if you don't know anything about how long\npeople with the disease are contagious for, then this simple calculation cannot\nbe made without additional information.\n\nThis project aims to quantify that uncertainty, so that when a measurement of\nthe duration of infectiousness is made then we will be able to assess how\ninfectious the disease associated with a particular outbreak is likely to be.\n\nAlso, when you have a cold then it is is convenient to describe your disease\nstate 'categorically', which is to say that you will say &quot;I'm coming down with\na cold&quot;, &quot;I'm in the middle of a cold&quot;, or &quot;I'm just getting better from a\ncold&quot;, rather than &quot;my viral titre is probably 3 on a logarithmic scale&quot;. It\nis also often convenient for scientific epidemiologists to take a categorical\napproach to disease state, and this project proposes to find a reliable method\nfor deciding what the relevant categories should be.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L001950/1","grantId":"EP/L001950/1","fundValue":"233340","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Deirdre  Hollingsworth","coPersons":["Thomas Allan House"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
