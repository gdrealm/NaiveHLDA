This information will be used by grass, wheat and barley breeders etc. for the development of superior plant varieties. The work is aimed at all traits and not merely a single trait. However, initial work will concentrate on the amalgamation and transfer of genetic information between species on key sustainability and climate change breeding priorities outlined by the Crop Science Review and Defra as well as production traits. These include the traits of nitrogen use efficiency (leading to low fertiliser input), tolerance to abiotic stress and root architecture (leading to prevention of water run off and thus prevention of pollution to water courses and tolerance to drought) for which genes have been identified on Lolium/Festuca chromosomes. The work will make explicit use of the rice genome which has been substantially sequenced and the fact that gene order in the monocot species has to a large extent been maintained during evolution. Research will also be undertaken to improve the efficiency of breeding strategies in grass, wheat, barley and other monocots. In addition the work undertaken will facilitate the identification of genes controlling target traits. This knowledge will be employed and exploited in breeding programmes via conventional means.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E00654X/2","grantId":"BB/E00654X/2","fundValue":"671039","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The lines are being used through the determination of the genetic control of target traits to 1) develop superior grass varieties that are adapted to the environment and environmental change and 2) to the physical mapping and the future sequencing of the Lolium genome.

This represents the largest introgression programme ever undertaken in the monocots. This germplasm and the genetic markers developed have provided a platform for identification of traits in grassland research and also provided the genetic markers which have led to the physical mapping of the Lolium genome. They have been used for identifying the genetic control of target traits and the physical mapping of the Lolium genome. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
