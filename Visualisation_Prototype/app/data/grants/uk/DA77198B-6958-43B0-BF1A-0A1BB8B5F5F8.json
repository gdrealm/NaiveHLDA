The proposed research investigates whether MPI symptoms can be elicited via expectation and modelling, and whether modelling is responsible for the gender effect (as suggested in a gender x modelling interaction observed in pilot data).&nbsp;In a 2x2x2x2 (inhale&nbsp;x modelling&nbsp;x participant gender&nbsp;x model gender) half of the participants will be told that they have been assigned to the experimental condition and will be asked to inhale a placebo substance (actually plain ambient air), presented as a suspected environmental toxin. Half of the participants will observe a confederate inhale a substance and display symptoms, and half will observe a confederate who does not inhale the substance or display symptoms.&nbsp;Confederates supposedly assigned to the experimental condition, will model the specified symptoms behaviourally and via their verbal ratings.&nbsp;Gender of participant and confederate will be balanced across cells. Verbal ratings of four specified symptoms and four additional symptoms will be elicited at 10-minute intervals over the course of one hour. At the conclusion of the study, all participants will be fully debriefed.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E005306/1","grantId":"ES/E005306/1","fundValue":"74031","fundStart":"2007-03-21","fundEnd":"2008-03-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Giuliana  Mazzoni","coPersons":["Michael Evan Hyland","Irving  Kirsch"],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
