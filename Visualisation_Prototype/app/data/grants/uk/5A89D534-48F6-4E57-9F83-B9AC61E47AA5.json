The University of Edinburgh recently introduced an undergraduate specialisation in Indigenous Religions with courses covering African, the Pacific, India and New Religious Movements, inferring that Indigenous Religions can be studied as a discrete unit. By evaluating this assumption in the light of case studies drawn from Zimbabwe, Alaska and shamanic traditions, and in view of current debates over 'primitivism', this study mounts a defence for the scholarly use of this category.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113039/1","grantId":"113039/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2006-05-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Cox","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
