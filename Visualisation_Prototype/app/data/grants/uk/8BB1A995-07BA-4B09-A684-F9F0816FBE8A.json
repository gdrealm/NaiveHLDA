Following this international research, this project will develop a series of behavioural interventions (involving meditative techniques and related forms of behavioural training). These interventions will explore the extent to which it is possible to use the insights of the behavioural sciences to empower individuals to more effectively control their own behaviour. These behavioural interventions will be assessed using a mix of participant observation techniques, in-depth interviews and quantitative measures of personal value changes.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003082/1","grantId":"ES/L003082/1","fundValue":"189992","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark James Whitehead","coPersons":["Jessica  Pykett","Rhys Alwyn Jones"],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
