Such a novel procedure reduced the number of animals required to undertake such studies. Many bacterial strains can be studied using a single animal, thereby significantly promoting the 3Rs. Adopting the technique, that is, dissecting and culturing intestinal organs for optimum viability and use to study host-pathogen interactions without use of whole animals, advancing the 3Rs theme.
