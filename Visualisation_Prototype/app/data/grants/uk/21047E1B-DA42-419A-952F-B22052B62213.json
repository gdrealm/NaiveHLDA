{"id":"21047E1B-DA42-419A-952F-B22052B62213","title":"The Stag Without a Heart","abstractText":"The Principal Investigator's practice-based research is in the field of artists' moving image. This practice explores the generic themes and traditions of fiction cinema, the dominant moving image and artists' film and video practice. The research typically explores the potential interplay between these languages, and asks how their conventions and generic qualities can be appropriated, expanded upon and hybridised. The proposed research project, 'The Stag Without a Heart', uses the Principal Investigator's moving image practice to research specific themes that are familiar from generic fiction cinema: temptation to power, deception and political corruption. These are central and recurring subjects of narrative entertainment cinema, and of universal human fallibility.\\n\\nThe research seeks to investigate what happens when these normally linear themes are adapted to become circular and endless. The project asks how these subjects might be impacted upon by their being placed in the gallery space, which has an inherent tradition of circularity and repetition. The research seeks to investigate whether greater or lesser authenticity is achieved when these subjects are placed in this repetitive and circular context. These questions will be considered through academic dissemination and a commissioned critical text.\\n\\nThe research intends to employ a hybrid of narrative codes in order to address the project's central themes and to answer its research questions. The research is investigating an existing allegorical fable that will be used as a narrative and textual template. This fable is attributed to Aesop. Early research has shown that this fable encapsulates the subjects of corruption, temptation and power, which are simultaneously the thematic foundations of the crime cinema, or more specifically its sub-genre, the mob film. \\n\\nThe research investigates the potential of the fable to become a circular and recurrent form. Thus, the cinematic themes of temptation, deception and corruption can become endlessly recurrent for the viewer. Crucially, a narrative template of universal human fallibility can be potentially transformed by employing the gallery's generic tradition of circularity.\\n\\nIn methodological terms, the research will aim to recreate the apparatus of cinema as closely as possible. The methodology will physically reproduce the visual and aural codes of the crime cinema, resulting in a single screen moving image work. The adapted Aesopic text will be performed as a monologue within a highly cinematic scenario, redolent of the 'New Hollywood' mob film of the 1970s.\\n\\nThe proposed project outcome is a gallery-based film loop for dissemination in international gallery spaces. The research will be disseminated academically via conference papers. A new website will be produced by the Principal Investigator that will critically document the research. This will contain a newly commissioned text that will assess the final outcome against the project's research questions.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H008284/1","grantId":"AH/H008284/1","fundValue":"21450","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project's adaptation of a pre-existing linear text, which was transformed into a seamlessly circular text performed within a highly cinematic mise en sc?ne, was used to produce new research methods: themes of temptation, deception and political corruption can become endlessly recurrent for the spectator.

Within the practice-based element of the research, the fable's themes of temptation, deception and corruption were able to become endlessly recurrent for the viewer - rather than conventionally linear and resolved. A narrative template of universal human fallibility was transformed by employing the art gallery's tradition of circularity and repetition. Within the academic dissemination of the project, which included a specially commissioned essay and a research symposium for the project held at the Royal College of Art, numerous academic themes and discussions added to the debate around the project. These included discourse subjects such as the 'eternal return', repetition, difference, theatricality, transatlantic cinema, modernism, isolation, technology, narration, the 'speech act', psychoanalysis, absence, censorship, entrapment and metaphor. Many of theses subjects were not anticipated as being potentially prompted by the research. This intensive academic dissemination allowed me to develop my continuing practice-based research further into new projects and themes. The practice-based outcome of the research employed high-end cinematic production values, the use of a highly developed text, and a honed performance by a professional cast of actors. Within the field of this research, which is contemporary moving image art practice, these methodologies are relatively rare. My view is that this research is helping to develop the field of contemporary artists' moving image substantially by allowing these methods to become available to others.
