However, in recent research we found that emotional feelings can change people's moral judgments (Schnall, Haidt, Clore &amp; Jordan, 2007). In addition, we observed that such influences are especially pronounced for people who are generally sensitive to their own bodily cues.</p>\n\n<p>This is consistent with the notion that disgust constitutes a powerful &quot;gut feeling&quot;, and as such, influences cognitive processes (eg Damasio, 1994; Haidt, 2001). The proposed research will expand on this work, and take it in new directions. In particular, the following research questions will be&nbsp;investigated</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>To what extent do contextual manipulations influence &quot;embodied&quot; moral judgments?</li>\n\n <li>How do moral norms emerge in &quot;disembodied&quot;&nbsp;virtual contexts?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>To address the latter question, novel methods will be used involving virtual reality and newly emerging virtual online communities, such as Second Life. Thus, in addition to investigating substantive theoretical questions, the project will afford the opportunity to explore the extent to which recent technological advances can be utilized in psychological research.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0119-A","grantId":"RES-061-25-0119-A","fundValue":"124892","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simone  Schnall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
