{"id":"8171C3C7-1BCA-4C54-AA7A-2C44D1F991A5","title":"Exploring Trust between Service-Users and Professionals in Acute Mental Health Services","abstractText":"<p>Research suggests that trust is vital for quality healthcare and effective outcomes. Trust becomes necessary in conditions of vulnerability and uncertainty. These conditions may be especially relevant to the experience and treatment of mental illness yet there exists a paucity of research into trust in this area. </p>\n\n<p>The aim of this research is to develop an understanding of trust as it relates to mental health services and their users. More specifically, the research will investigate the role of trust as it affects people with severe mental illness&nbsp;- in their approaching services in the first place, openly disclosing their concerns and problems, and their continued cooperation with agreed treatment. </p>\n\n<p>Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a range of service-users, professionals and carers across three different types of psychosis service&nbsp;- early intervention, assertive outreach (aimed at those least willing and/or likely to engage with services), and a more standard community mental health team. </p>\n\n<p>Data analysis will focus on understanding the types of knowledge and assumptions service-users apply when they come to trust. This will develop understandings of the characteristics of services and individual professionals which are conducive or problematic for trust. The findings have important implications for policy, local services and professionals.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3535","grantId":"RES-000-22-3535","fundValue":"55323","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Calnan","coPersons":["Patrick  Brown"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
