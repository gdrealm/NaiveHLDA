{"id":"B9B7C89F-C8B3-4203-AD45-46D5DA0B87EC","title":"User Innovation Communities: Digital Tools for Cultural Production","abstractText":"As the web becomes pervasive and deeply entrenched as part of our daily routines, more people than ever have the basic tools to express themselves through creative activities including: producing and editing video clips, composing music, and creating design artefacts and artworks. Yet sceptics including professionals often criticise this newly found freedom for destroying established business models, and for contributing to a cultural divide by fracturing our common culture into cultural bolt-holes . This proposal seeks to bring the creative public (including user groups and communities) to work alongside the producers (including the professional designers), by mindfully harvesting the public contributions as cultural resources to transform traditional in-house design and reduce R&amp;D wastage; and to induce creativity, and social innovation. We will collaborate with Marks and Spencer to build and test a platform that facilitates contribution to the cultural production of design, exploitation of existing digital tools, and development of new tools. The platform will make available an array of digital tools to encourage interactivity and to further contribute to a register of cultural resources in terms of: a wiki of design artefacts (product forms, functions, etc.); and repertories of 'data' on how users perceive, appropriate and incorporate products into their lives, how well products fulfil their needs, how they imbue meaning and explore their individual, social and cultural identities through them, and how communities are formed through consumption and use. The cultural register provides a repository of cultural resources, which encourage reuse across and within different socio-cultural and business contexts. Our project fits RiTW well in that it enables us to engage directly with user groups and a consumer products brand to test the potential transformational impact of 'user innovation' as cultural production with consumer communities, which could feed into other areas of 'open design'.The ultimate aim of our research is to create a cultural register of design objects that facilitates sharing and reuse by the producers and the creative public through better use and exploitation of digital tools.The project team brings together reseachers with a background in design, user and open innovation, and ubiquitous computing. We will adopt a user driven approach to the design and development of a series of tools that bridging the socio-cultural gaps between user and business communities. The project team will leverage our strong connections with key industrial, public sector and academic groups in UK and internationally, ensuring that the proposed research will have maximum impact to communities of practice and creative and cultural industries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I032096/1","grantId":"EP/I032096/1","fundValue":"121100","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This is an emerging field of research.

","person":"George  Kuk","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" The ways user-designers use and combine private and public resources are unique. Hobbyists whose background in engineering often use codes to express their designs and are more likely to attract further derivation. Each derivation entails creation of additional digital files and resources, constituting the digital commons in 3d printing. User entrepreneurs who are designers by trade focus upon the printability and the quality of finish, and are more likely to selectively review their designs under non-commercial use. However, their designs are least likely to contribute to the digital commons. Whereas user-designers who have background in both engineering and art are more likely to attract further derivation and makes from their peers. They are more likely to switch between design as a hobby and design as a second source of income. The findings show when user-entrepreneurs intertwine private and public resources through the interdependent tinkering of 3d digital artifacts and 3d printing firmware, a trajectory with the highest level of collective contribution results. This trajectory significantly outperforms the other two trajectories comprising a purely independent or purely dependent private use of public resources. The findings show hobbyists and user entrepreneurs through the ways they combine private invention and public resources and at the same contribute back to the digital commons are the most influential user- designers. Their designs are more likely to be featured and they enjoy higher status as 'superstars' and 'superusers' among the makers. The findings provide practical insights into the governance issues of user innovation communities and the formulation of inclusive strategy without an increase in competition among users and designers.
