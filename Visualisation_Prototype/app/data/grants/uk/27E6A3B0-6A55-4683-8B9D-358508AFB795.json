Setting stringent high standards for achieving behavioural and cognitive goals is a common characteristic of many of these perseverative activities, yet there is little research on how or why people with perseverative psychopathologies develop these high performance standards. However, there is some evidence that negative mood may be involved in promoting information-processing styles that would foster high performance standards, and this research intends to investigate the role of negative mood as a causal factor in raising performance standards across two particular psychopathology-relevant tasks – worry and checking.\n<br />\n<br />The objectives of the research are: (1) To identify some of the factors that influence the development of high performance standards in the stop rules for perseverative tasks, (2) To determine the role of negative mood in the development and deployment of high performance standards, (3) To identify some of the factors that determine the deployment of ‘as many as can’ stop rules within a mood-as-input model of perseveration, and (4) To clarify some of the critical variables that influence the aetiology of perseverative psychopathologies.\n<br />\n<p></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2740","grantId":"RES-000-22-2740","fundValue":"75922","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham Charles Davey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
