A particular area of interest is the cytoskeleton which provides eukariotic cells with mechanical support andhelps the cells to perform their biological functions. This trip will lead to a synthesis of two complementary theoretical descriptions of the cell cytoskeleton and to a program of combined experimental and theoretical work which will be used to test these theories and provide directions for their improvements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E065678/1","grantId":"EP/E065678/1","fundValue":"3079","fundStart":"2007-05-31","fundEnd":"2007-08-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tanniemola Bunting Liverpool","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
