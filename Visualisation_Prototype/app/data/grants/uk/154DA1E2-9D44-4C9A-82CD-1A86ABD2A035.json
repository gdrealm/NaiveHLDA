This is due to the loss of an insulating cover, the myelin sheath, from the nerve fibres and from damage to the fibres themselves. As a result, nerves are unable to communicate messages from the brain to muscles and from the skin and muscles back to the brain. The myelin sheath, which is made by Schwann cells, surrounds axons in the peripheral nervous system. It protects the nerve fibres and speeds up the rate at which messages are transmitted along them. Loss of the myelin sheaths, de-myelination, leads to a failure to transmit signals correctly and ultimately to the death of axons. We have recently identified a signalling pathway within the Schwann cells that has a central function in de-myelination caused by direct nerve injury. We wish to determine whether this novel negative regulator of myelination is also likely to be central to the de-myelination that is characteristic of hereditary and acquired neuropathies in humans. For this purpose, we will use well-characterized mouse models of these human conditions together with strategies that inhibit the signalling pathway to determine whether we can prevent de-myelination and improve nerve function. Positive findings would provide new strategies for treatment of human neuropathies for which, at present, there are no cures.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600967","grantId":"G0600967","fundValue":"325397","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kristjan Rodgaard Jessen","coPersons":["Rhona  Mirsky"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
