The resource has had over 5700 downloads, about 1/5 of which are from practising teachers and teacher educators, 3/5 from students, and a 1/5 from academics, including many early career researchers.\n\nThe engagement, collaborations and other outputs entered for this report give an indication of workshops, keynotes, posters and talks that have helped to promote the resource amongst teachers who are interested in research. It is used for research methods training for students, and also in workshops to engage teachers with research. \n\nIRIS has been cited by others (practitioners and academics) in many different forums: publications, presentations, magazines, practitioner publications, and links to IRIS have been established from several other sites. See Other Outputs and Knowledge/Future Steps.\n\nThe initial funding has also led to other projects to engage teachers with research (both doing it and consuming it). These are listed in the 'Further Funding' sections.\n\nIn addition, IRIS is currently being used as a model for a similar project in Science Education (to be submitted to the ESRC), and features in two other proposals currently under review (EPSRC and AHRC). It has also been cited by several others independently in their applications for funding as a forum that will host their materials, as no other such forum exists.

The IRIS repository holds materials that have been tried and tested (i.e. used in peer-reviewed published work) to collect data for research. Such materials includes questionnaires, language tests, software scripts, observation schedules, pictures and sound files to elicit language, interview protocols, amongst many other tools and instruments. \n\nThe resource is useful for many reasons. Data collection tools are extremely time consuming to create and require a high level of research training and expertise; the IRIS resource therefore maximises the potential of past investments made across the globe into language related research. It gives open access to research instruments, allowing others to use them and adapt them to their own needs. \n\nIRIS holds 927 unique files, bunched into 349 bundles of data collection materials (e.g. a listening test and its transcript would be one instrument). They cover a wide range of methods and theoretical approaches, represent the work of 278 researchers, are cited in over 83 publication outlets (comprising 100s of references to individual publications). \n\nIRIS has had over 5700 downloads, about 1/5 of which are from practising teachers and teacher educators, 3/5 from students, and a 1/5 from other academics, including many early career researchers. This resource is used in many different ways by different audiences. \n\nWe seek usage data from those who leave their email address upon downloading. These indicate that the materials are being used to inform the design of future research, for research methods training, and helping researchers to understand past research more thoroughly. \n\nTeachers and teacher educators have used the resource to download examples of research materials to either use directly in their own research or to inform their thinking and understanding about their practice.\n\nJournal editors direct their authors to IRIS to upload their data collection materials there. \n\nTotal number of downloads: 5732\nHits on the IRIS site since January 2012: 15479.\nAbout 1/5 of the downloads are from teachers and teacher educators; 3/5 from students; and 1/5 from researchers. \n\nPlease see the Engagement Activities and Other Outputs &amp;amp; Knowledge sections for details.
