{"id":"6AA35295-6F16-47E6-9CBB-48407997515B","title":"Plastic Packaging Recycling using Intelligent Separation technologies for Materials (PRISM)","abstractText":"PRISM is a new way of rapidly sorting packaging based on intelligent labels with invisible markers that can be detected and\nsorted using existing high-speed optical sorting systems used in MRFs with minor modifications. The labels and the\nmarkers are removed completely by the recycling process. This technology uses commercial labelling and decoration\nmethods which are coded with high performing luminescent compounds to sort targeted streams including food-contact\nplastics, bioplastics, chemical packaging, automotive plastics, black plastics and different grades of one plastic. Sorting is\naccomplished using modifications to existing NIR sorting machinery. The new technology can boost recycling plant yields\nwith efficient ways of sorting materials such as PP packaging used for food, HDPE milk bottles and sleeved PET and\nincrease recovery of food grade plastics and open up new markets for recovered plastics. This technology will be\ncompatible with all NIR sorting equipment. It will help brand owners to ensure that packaging reaches the recycling loop\nand boost UK recycling performance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508974/1","grantId":"EP/N508974/1","fundValue":"166566","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jack  Silver","coPersons":["George Robert  Fern","Karnik  Tarverdi"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
