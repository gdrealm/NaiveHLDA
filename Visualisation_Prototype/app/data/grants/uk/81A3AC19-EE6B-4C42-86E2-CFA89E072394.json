{"id":"81A3AC19-EE6B-4C42-86E2-CFA89E072394","title":"Energy Storage Network","abstractText":"The field of energy storage is broad and complex, encompassing a wide range of potential energy storage technologies and applications. Energy storage can include the storage of electricity (e.g. batteries, supercapacitors), heat (e.g. phase change materials, hot water, cryogenic cycles), chemical energy (e.g. hydrogen), gravitational potential energy (e.g. pumped hydro) and mechanical energy (e.g. flywheels and compressed air). Applications range from small batteries (W's) for consumer goods, through engineered battery packs (kW's) for hybrid and electric vehicles, to large scale energy storage for grid integration (&gt;MW's), and with energy requirements that also depend on the application.\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a research network in energy storage for the UK. The network will consider all the potential storage approaches, with applications focussing in particular on those important to the provision of future low carbon energy systems, so electric and hybrid vehicles and grid scale applications. These are also areas where the UK has a strong research and technology interests. The network will link the academic, industrial and policy communities together, and will be guided by an advisory board with representatives from each of these sectors. \n\nThe network will organise a series of meetings and workshops over a three year period to help develop a more integrated energy storage research community in the UK, and to raise the profile of UK energy storage research both nationally and internationally. Key outcomes and learning will be disseminated via a dedicated website, including research reports arising from workshops and meetings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J021695/1","grantId":"EP/J021695/1","fundValue":"493814","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This is a network proposal.
