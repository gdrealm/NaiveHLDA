{"id":"DDAEA9EE-2066-4885-BE9A-1D6DA079795C","title":"Improving speech intelligibility using acoustic source separation with audio frequency","abstractText":"Isolating a single target voice in a noisy environment is a challenging problem, especially forpeople with some degree of hearing loss. This project employs a novel solution that, for thefirst time, utilizes a compact microphone array, works in real-time and in real-life workingconditions with low computational requirements to separate a single voice from a mixture ofvoices and other unwanted sounds. This will improve the intelligibility of speech for peoplewho are hard of hearing with consequent functional and quality of life benefits. Audiofrequency induction-loop systems are the most-widely used assistive technology due to theirearly standardization and simplicity. This project will develop a prototype of an audioprocessing system that can be used immediately with existing induction-loops without theirmodification and will be the first of a series of products for this market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H502335/1","grantId":"EP/H502335/1","fundValue":"73548","fundStart":"2010-04-27","fundEnd":"2010-12-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been published, patented and are now being actively licensed to be included into products.

The tests were conducted in collaboration with RNID This system is usful in hearing aids, conference call environments, mobile phones etc which the university is actively considering licensing agreements. The university of surrey has patented the technology, produced a working prototype and now actively involved with licensing this technology.
