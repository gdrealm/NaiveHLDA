Research users are being drawn into the research process at different stages and the boundary between the creators and users of knowledge and evidence is being redrawn. However, as lay knowledge is being incorporated into research approaches, scientific knowledge has become increasingly systematised and selective with the emergence of evidence-based medicine and management/policy.</p>\n\n<p>The co-applicants investigated meanings of evidence from interdisciplinary, professional and lay perspectives. A total of 3 seminars took place at the Universities of Aberdeen; St Andrew's and Bristol respectively between 2009-2011.</p>\n\n<p>The series created a unique collaboration between four academic leaders from multiple disciplines who would not usually have the opportunity to work together. It also explored issued relating to knowledge translation across academic and research-user audiences.</p>\n\n<p>The overall feedback was excellent.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0487","grantId":"RES-451-26-0487","fundValue":"18601","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Inspired a series of research articles.
