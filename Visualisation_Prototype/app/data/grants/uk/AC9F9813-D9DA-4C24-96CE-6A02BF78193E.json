{"id":"AC9F9813-D9DA-4C24-96CE-6A02BF78193E","title":"13 ERA IB: ProSeCa - Recovery of high value Proteins from Serum by innovative direct Capture techniques","abstractText":"Many pharmaceutical drugs are made by extracting them from natural sources. However, many of these extraction methods are old-fashioned and inefficient. An example that we will be working on in this project is the extraction of veterinary drugs from equine (horse) serum. Current methods are complicated and cannot generate large yields of these veterinary drugs in a cost- and time-efficient manner. In addition, some current methods can damage the drug products, further lowering yields.\n\nWe aim to use magnetic technology to separate products from horse serum for use in veterinary medicine. We will develop methods to efficiently purify these products using a variety of approaches, all centred around the use of powerful magnets. The overall objective of the project is to develop these methods to a point where they can be applied commercially; this will be achieved by the design and development of procedures and equipment that can be implemented in a commercial setting. The overall objective is to decrease the overall time and cost of production of veterinary drugs; methods and techniques developed in the project may also be applied for the manufacture of human medicines, leading to benefits to the general public and medical profession.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M00483X/1","grantId":"BB/M00483X/1","fundValue":"418714","fundStart":"2014-06-02","fundEnd":"2017-06-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  At this early stage of the project, project findings have not been used outside the realm of the project and its partners.

These bacteria are hard to grow, so developing methods for their intensified growth is important so that they might be used industrially. We have also laid the groundwork for genetic manipulation in this organiasm. At this early stage in the project, our findings so far are mainly going to be used by ourselves and our project partners through the rest of the project, underpinning later work packages.\nIt is envisaged that the later work packages will have impact on the pharmaceutical and industrial biotechnology sectors, so currently findings will underpin these later impacts.
