{"id":"2BD266D3-5F82-4C6C-A65E-F6585EA7C176","title":"Renewal of the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Co-operative","abstractText":"Over the last decade CFAS has collected data from the older population in six sites including biological tissue. A unique group of scientists and social scientists from across the UK are actively working together to learn as much as possible from this study to inform current and future research and policy. Examples of the output so far are the exact number of people we would expect to develop dementia in England and Wales each year and population levels of disability free life expectancy for those aged 65 years and above. New data will tell us whether people coming into the older age groups now have the same patterns of mental function and disability as those who went before. The study will continue to provide many types of output including use of the Internet, giving presentations, producing public reports (including local PCT reports) and producing newsletters. We aim to increase accessibility to the results through further development of Internet technology including health observatories. We have sought to create a website which can provide the appropriate level of detail about the study. The Eastern Regional Observatory provides a link to our site, and hence to all other observatories. Further long-term development of our website will facilitate more detailed access to the information about the study.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9901400","grantId":"G9901400","fundValue":"2239140","fundStart":"2001-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Carol  Brayne","coPersons":["Ian Grant McKeith","Michael  Dewey","Paul Geoffrey Ince","Stephen B Wharton","Angus  McDonald","Cherie Frances McCracken","John  Bond","Carol  Jagger","Bronwyn Catherine Parry"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
