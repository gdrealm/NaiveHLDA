The aim of this project is to establish how professionals working in regeneration and renewal fields (such as town planners, housing managers or regeneration workers) learn to adapt their ways of working and how these lessons are remembered in the multi-disciplinary teams in which they work. Given that learning ‘on the job’ is a significant source of learning, it is vital to understand how professionals learn in teams and as teams in everyday environments. </p> \n<p>The research will work with a small number of professionals in multi-disciplinary teams to see what is learnt and how learning is remembered by individuals and teams building sustainable communities. The project will work with the RTPI and the regional centre of excellence in the South West (Creating: Excellence) in building a better understanding of the conditions under which learning on the job occurs and hence will help to inform how professional bodies (such as the RTPI) might think about lifelong learning in the built environment.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-182-25-0021","grantId":"RES-182-25-0021","fundValue":"72042","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Stewart  Smith","coPersons":["Ron  Griffiths","Anthony John Bryan"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
