We will focus our efforts on searches for BSM processes in the Higgs and top sectors for ATLAS, in the kaon sector for NA62, and in the charm and beauty sector for LHCb. We are simultaneously entering a major construction phase where synergies have been established between our ATLAS, LHCb and ILC detector developments. We anticipate that MICE will demonstrate ionization cooling as a major step towards a neutrino factory and Japan, with the international community, will decide to build the ILC. We have developed detector development and construction capacity to contribute to this future programme and have built up our technician and engineering effort in a carefully planned approach. Improved analysis techniques, well-calibrated detectors, increased computing power and theoretical input will be essential and we are at the forefront of the required developments in these areas.\nAll academics are heavily involved in the LHC programme and our strategy is to generate leading-edge physics results from three experiments (ATLAS, LHCb and NA62) based upon expertise developed in those experiments. We will provide timely first results in Higgs H-&gt;bb modes for ATLAS, based upon our current expertise. Having secured high-quality completion in Run 1, we will ensure that this experience will underpin future ATLAS publications. Based on our earlier work, we will be key players in answering questions concerning the origin of mass and the nature of CP violation. For LHCb, we will measure rare two body B decays, search for CP violation in charm and make precision measurements of CP violation in the Bs sector. We will measure the CKM angle gamma from loop-mediated processes which offer significant new physics sensitivity. We will perform new measurements and search for new states in the spectroscopy of charmed baryons and excited beauty mesons. For NA62 we will maintain the UK expertise in measuring the ratio of kaon decays to electrons and muons, establish measurements of the ratio of kaon and pion decays and search for dark photons.\nWe continue to invest in and promote a world-class Detector Development activity to enable longer-term initiatives and our Grid strength is aimed at maximising our impact in LHC physics as well as promoting new areas such as the linear collider. We additionally lever significant support through the College in these areas. We have set up physics analysis streams for each experiment, using the Grid, and will continue to fully exploit the LHC Run 2 data. We will also maintain our involvement in longer-term initiatives where we have leadership roles. We presently have leading roles in the ATLAS and LHCb upgrades, the linear collider and future neutrino initiatives. We anticipate greater involvement in these forward-looking programmes, based upon discoveries made at the LHC. Over the next four years we will develop these areas and progress those where early investment will become most productive, consistent with our highest priority of LHC physics exploitation.\nTo enhance the priority programme, we will be supported via the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance (SUPA). This will ensure that we can meet our priorities in silicon detector development via support of the LHC upgrade and other programmes. We anticipate working with the IGR where we gain from joint facilities. This strategy is well suited to the skills and capacity of our core group. The associated responsive effort will be essential at a critical point in the evolution of UK particle physics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N001176/1","grantId":"ST/N001176/1","fundValue":"37750","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Doyle","coPersons":["Aidan  Robson","Andrew  Buckley","Mark Andrew Owen","Valentine  O'Shea","Paul  Soler","David  Britton","Lars  Eklund","Craig MacLeod Buttar","Peter John  Bussey"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
