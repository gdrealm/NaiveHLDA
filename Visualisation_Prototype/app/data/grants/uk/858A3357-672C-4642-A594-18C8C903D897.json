The Grid – or the e-Infrastructure as it is now commonly known – is shorthand for the emerging computing tools and services being developed to facilitate collaboration and simplify the sharing of data resources and analysis routines.<br /><br />Created in 2004 to develop UK e-social science, NCeSS has a distributed structure, comprising a coordinating Hub at the University of Manchester and a network of seven major research Nodes in universities across the UK. As well as coordinating NCeSS research activities, the Hub has responsibility for promoting e-Social Science and supporting its users. This capacity-building award - a supplement to the Hub continuation award - is focused on outreach, enabling the Hub to effectively disseminate the outputs of the research programme and support the adoption of new methods by the social science research community.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Further information </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>NCeSS contact: Professor Peter Halfpenny<br />Email: <a href=\"mailto:peter.halfpenny@manchester.ac.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">peter.halfpenny@manchester.ac.uk</a><br />Telephone: 0161 275 2493<br /><a href=\"http://www.ncess.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NCeSS website</a></li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F034989/1","grantId":"ES/F034989/1","fundValue":"215555","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Halfpenny","coPersons":["Rob  Procter"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
