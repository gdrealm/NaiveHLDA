This proposal is to develop a virtual model of the BCG vaccine strain of the TB bacillus in a computer. The model will provide important insight into how this pathogen grows and replicates. The model may also be used to perform virtual experiments that would be very hard or impossible to perform in the real world. For instance, it is difficult to study the behaviour of the TB bacillus when it is growing inside patient's lungs. But if we can identify the metabolic pathways that are active then we can perform easily virtual experiments that will, for instance, investigate how the bacillus will respond to a new antibiotic whilst it is living in the patient's lungs. The virtual TB may also be used to screen new compounds for activity against the TB bacillus: the effect of various antibiotics can be tested in the virtual TB cell far more quickly than with live cells (and with no possibility of the experimenter catching TB). But probably most importantly, the virtual TB cell can be used to invent new antibiotics, by identifying pathways, or groups of pathways, that are essential for growth. This model will first be built using DNA sequence data from the genome. However, to make the virtual cell more realistic, we must incorporate biological data. We will therefore grow the real life organism (actually the vaccine strain of the TB bacillus) in highly defined conditions in the laboratory and perform chemical analysis of what goes in and what comes out of the cell. A remarkable mathematical technique, known as metabolic flux analysis, can then be used to estimate the flux of metabolites through each central metabolism pathway inside the cell. This information will be incorporated into the virtual cell to make its behaviour correspond more closely with the biological organism. The next stage of the project is testing our virtual cell. To do this we will identify which pathways are essential in the virtual cell and then inactivate those pathways in living cells. We will then see if the growth (or absence of growth) of the real life cells matches the predictions of the model. These tests will be used to refine and improve the model that may thereafter be used in drug development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D007208/1","grantId":"BB/D007208/1","fundValue":"435837","fundStart":"2006-01-19","fundEnd":"2009-06-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The principle outcome of this research was the construction of a genome-scale metabolic model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
