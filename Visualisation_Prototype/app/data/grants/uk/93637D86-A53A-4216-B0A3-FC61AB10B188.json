Our five research themes for Phase Two are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Understanding green growth and climate-compatible development: what constitutes ‘green growth’ or ‘climate-compatible development’ in industrialised and developing countries?</li>\n\n <li>Evaluating the performance of climate policies: how can we assess the performance of different forms of climate policy, and how can we understand the scope for policy learning within and between contexts?</li>\n\n <li>Managing climate risks and uncertainties and strengthening climate services: how can we promote new approaches to the assessment, management and communication of climate risks and uncertainties, and how might these inform the provision of improved climate services?</li>\n\n <li>Enabling rapid transitions in mitigation and adaptation: in case of slower than anticipated progress, how can we understand the scope for rapid transitions to dramatically cut emissions and adapt to significant climate change?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006576/1","grantId":"ES/K006576/1","fundValue":"4343060","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Dietz","coPersons":["Nicholas Herbert Stern","Jouni Juhani Paavola","Samuel  Fankhauser","Andrew  Gouldson"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
