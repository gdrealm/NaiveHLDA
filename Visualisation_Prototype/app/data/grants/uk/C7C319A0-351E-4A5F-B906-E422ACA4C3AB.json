For many years the Institute has maintained a strong visitor programme with a healthy reputation and this creates a significant 'mulitplier effect' by which yet more distinguished visitors are attracted to visit on their own funding. The Institute is a key partner in many national and international projects, all of which will both attract active visiting scientists and benefit from the overall visitor programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H004912/1","grantId":"ST/H004912/1","fundValue":"102039","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Robert C  Kennicutt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
