For several decades, laboratories worldwide have developed the necessary skills to manufacture and operate SRF cavities with significant success (i.e. CERN, DESY and Jlab). Shakespeare Engineering, through the Faraday Partnership, have developed significant capability and understanding of precision machining and handling of manufactured parts to be used in high power RF applications. With this background, their proven capability in mass manufacturing and their inherent desire to expand into this new scientific market becomes an excellent opportunity for collaboration on this enabling technology. With the experience gained, the UK will be placed in an excellent position as a UK vendor for SRF structures worldwide. Such technology has a wide range of applications; 1) Medical applications - such as hadron therapy, 2) Energy - for the development of sub-critical reactors, 3) Homeland security - for the generation of terahertz radiation for imaging 4) Particle Accelerators - for the accelerating structures of many proposed facilities. Due to the nature of the technology there is a large variety of skills required to design, manufacture and test Superconducting RF structures. This includes, RF engineering, cryogenic engineering, chemistry, vacuum science, surface science and mechanical engineering. Due to this there is a clear absence of commercial companies offering this technology. The basis of this project would be to work seamlessly together through each of the stages for the production of a superconducting RF cavity. This will provide an excellent means for the transfer all of these skills and experiences required to commercialise this technology to Shakespeare Engineering. The key deliverables to quantify the success of this project are; 1) Design of cavity, support structures and testing apparatus 2) Manufacture and processing of an SRF cavity 3) Validation of the cavity by high voltage tests 4) Shakespeare Engineering trained in the full cavity production process Also within the remit of this proposal is to investigate alternative manufacturing techniques for the RF structures that could provide either economic reductions in the cost of the structures or an improvement of the performance to the cavities. Presentation of these investigations at the world Superconducting RF conference would also be timely for the dissemination of this project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H504338/1","grantId":"ST/H504338/1","fundValue":"47100","fundStart":"2009-12-04","fundEnd":"2010-08-03","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Shakespeare","coPersons":["John  Everard","Carl David Beard","Swapan  Chattopadhyay","Peter Alexander McIntosh"],"organisation":"Shakespeare Engineering Components","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
