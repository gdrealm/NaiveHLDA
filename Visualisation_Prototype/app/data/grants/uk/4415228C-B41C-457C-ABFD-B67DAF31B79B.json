First, research students were provided with subject-specific training at a level and intensity not typically available within their own institutions, nor through any other regional or national programme. Second, the programme has provided students and researchers with opportunities for establishing and maintaining lasting and potentially collaborative networks at both the national and international level. Third, by targeting supervisors and other researchers as well as research students, the programme has contributed to the research infrastructure in finance in the UK.

The programme covered three core areas of finance: asset pricing, corporate finance and financial econometrics. Through a series of focussed and intensive modules extending over three years, the programme provided participants with access to sustained advanced level training from experts who are internationally recognised in their respective fields, drawn from both the UK and abroad. The research students, supervisors and other researchers who attended the programme have acquired subject-specific skills and knowledge in three core areas of finance. These skills can be directly used in research, either in academia or industry. Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy","dataset":"gtr"}
