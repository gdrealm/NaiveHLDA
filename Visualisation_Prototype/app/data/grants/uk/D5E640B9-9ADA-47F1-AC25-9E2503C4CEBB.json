The book presents first hand evidence systematically collected from in depth oral history interviews with approximately 90 married men and women from contrasting social groups drawn from both the middle and the working classes living in very different communities in the north and the south of England.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D501016/1","grantId":"AH/D501016/1","fundValue":"20397","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Richard Szreter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
