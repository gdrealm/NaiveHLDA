{"id":"EEBA6F37-60A5-42C9-B78C-908EE71DA78F","title":"A Theoretical Investigation of Positron Annihilation in Molecules","abstractText":"The result of the proposed research will be a general purpose, ab initio positron-molecule code that will be made available to the atomic and molecular physics community. This code will explicitly include the positron-electron interaction coordinates in the wave function. This is something that is essential for reliable treatments of positron scattering but has only previously been done for very simple target systems. The primary aim is to determine why exceptionally high positron annihilation rates are observed in positron collisions with some molecules at thermal energies. This is one of the most interesting current problems in atomic and molecular physics. There are several models for the annihilation process but no rigorous theory. A secondary aim is to extend the ab initio theoretical treatment of positron-molecule scattering to include positronium formation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C548019/1","grantId":"EP/C548019/1","fundValue":"75583","fundStart":"2006-03-08","fundEnd":"2010-03-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  Armour","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
