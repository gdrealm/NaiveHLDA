Humans and mammals have a highly developed immune system to contain and eliminate infectious agents. While most immune responses are beneficial for the body, uncontrolled responses during chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis result in destruction of tissues and organs.\nSeveral different cells types with specific roles form part of the immune system. Interactions between different immune cells take place in a coordinated manner to produce the proper immune response to deal with the infecting pathogen. Such cell-cell interactions must be orchestrated in specific environments that are part of organs called lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes. Stromal cells form the supporting structure of the lymph nodes and contribute to immune responses and inflammation. Our previous work has demonstrated that a specific signal is necessary for lymph node stromal cells to mature and form these organs. More recently we have shown that the signal mentioned above is sufficient to induce changes in fat cells present in adipose tissues to become part of the lymph nodes. The current project would study how this signal is transmitted inside the fat cell and the reprogramming effects in its genetic information that results in the loss of characteristics of adipose cells and the appearance of new features proper of lymph node cells. \nOur findings suggest that fat cells can change their properties and support inflammation and immune responses. Thus the importance of this project is based on the understanding of the signals and mechanisms that can induce adipose tissue cells to change their features resulting in the induction of inflammation characteristic of obese patients. \nAs a result of this project we will identify modifications in genetic information in fat cells induced by specific signals. These changes will be analyzed and compared to the effect of similar signals in vivo in situations were a large number of fat cells are present and thus contribute to inflammation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K009400/1","grantId":"BB/K009400/1","fundValue":"442219","fundStart":"2013-11-18","fundEnd":"2016-11-17","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jorge  Caamano","coPersons":["Peter William Hewett","Laura Patricia O'Neill"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
