Not only do the politics of global deals need research but so also does the micro-economic activity that produces and mitigates emissions. Our project is India-based, yet two-thirds of India's economy is unregistered, 'informal' and out of direct policy control. Very little is known about the informal economy as a polluter, yet a low-carbon transition would have to involve it. An holistic and transdisciplinary approach to measurement and trade-offs between material, social and economic aspects of the informal economy is therefore needed both analytically (to understand) and normatively (for policy). \nThis project successfully developed and piloted a new methodology to measure materiality (gaseous waste), economic returns and livelihoods in the informal economy. Using rice as a case study industry it combined Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with Value Chain Analysis (VCA) and Multi-Criteria Mapping (MCM) so that trade-offs between different indicators can be quantified and potentially mitigated. The MCM application is also novel in using two languages and involving highly and poorly educated, urban and rural subsets of expert stake-holders. The case of rice was studied systemically (through production and distribution) and extensively (through four production systems (intensive-HYV; systems of rice intensification(SRI); organic and rainfed) and through three marketing-cum-distribution systems (small retail, large retail and the state's Public Distribution System(PDS)). Over 2012-13, four regions were studied in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Samples were selected to match local landholding structures from the Agricultural Censuses. \nSelected results: Our field research has generated rich and unique substantive results. For instance simulating a shallow water-table (7m), all four production-methods generated approx. 1 kg of GHG per kg of paddy; though the composition of GHGs differed considerably between production-methods. HYV and organic rice use 5 tonnes of irrigation water per kg paddy; SRI halved this. GHG emissions from rice are dominated by production not processing or distribution. Production dominates ground water use, energy use and demand for labour. The quality of jobs is highest for men in transport and women in large retail. Rates of return were maximised in organic rice production and in large mills.\nThe core research is unique in evaluating trade-offs. For example SRI had the lowest emissions per unit of grain, but also reduced total labour demand, and skewed the remaining labour demand towards men, reducing employment for female landless labourers. Per kg of rice, large retail firms had far higher energy and GHG costs compared to the PDS or small retail, paid similar wages as the PDS, and required only 1/60 of the labour compared to the PDS. Multicriteria evaluation of four mitigation options emerging from the measurement research confirmed SRI as a win-win-win option.\n\nDemand for further applications: the new method is already being applied and developed in other sectors (livestock intensification; looms; inland fisheries; marine fishing; the materiality of schools and of sewerage). The MCM method has been demanded by local NGOs.\nThe second dimension of our research examined informality through: \ni)field studies of the politics across formal-informal 'frontiers' of policy (landuse, transport and rice milling) and modes of informal regulation; \nii) a field-based 'labourist ' approach to the supply chain and \niii) a field-study of innovation in the informal economy.\nDemand for further applications: \ni)VCA labour studies have benefitted the New Trade Union Initiative which has trained fieldworkers for further applications; \nii) there's interest worldwide in 'innovation in the informal economy' (see below);\niii) a doctoral project (Amsterdam/Bangalore) on the informalisation of policy in land use planning and construction directly results from this project; \niv) results on policy informalisation have been discussed in international fora and applied in policy training at Jindal Global University,Sonipat and Tata Institute of Social Science, Hyderabad. We defined impact clearly through learning: short-term dissemination and further medium-term applications. \nThis research has been engaged in the process of impact from the start (a detailed Impact Diary is available (5k word document)). \nThree sets of potential users were identified in the proposal:P (policy process); R (rice supply chain/innovation technology) AE (advocacy, activists, research and education). \nWe planned/ have used/are using the following 'pathways to impact/exploitation routes' to exploit the methods and results:\na)from start of project and into future\ndevelopment of expert P,R,AE network(s) (with Institute of Human Development New Delhi ); journalists and media; politicians; research scientists; meetings and correspondence (with innovators/technologists); website.\nb)short-term during project: \nlearning workshops; learning by doing; dissemination / feedback / training workshops; international symposium (IHD) all involving P,R and AE; other conference presentations; special invited lectures; integration of results into higher education; engagement with civil society; high visibility publications.\nc) medium term during and after project (though no project funds available for afterwards):\nconference presentations and lectures; interactive collaboration; networking and workshops; successful new proposals / research initiatives; academic publications in high quality outlets.\nWe abandoned the planned bulletins, blogs and local-language publications for lack of appropriateness and time. Our proposed link with SciDevNet was severed by David Dickson's death and policy changes in Scidevnet. It is replaced by a set of hierarchized 100 and 500 word summaries/policy briefings linked to website reports (in hand through IHD, NewDelhi)\nOur Impact Diary gives full details of the project's achievements.\nsee link at the foot of this page:\nhttp://www.southasia.ox.ac.uk/policy-engagement-and-likely-impact-resources-greenhouse-gases-technology-and-jobs-indias-informal\nThere is no single 'user' 'community' for this research. We have defined three types of user in the original proposal (see 2, above).\nFor P: interest in the informal economy, innovation, informalisation of policy, and the implications of the results for agricultural policy and climate change mitigation. In addition further research groups' use of this method for applications in other industries/contexts will generate useful results for decision-making in a wide range of scenarios\nFor R: interest in low C technologies and in multicriteria evaluations\nFor AE: aspects of the entire project\n\nEconomic impact (NB: our research would be one input among many)\nStrengthening SRI, organic and rain-fed rice; expanding subsidies for solar irrigation pump technology; support for transmission and distribution loss-reduction from the electricity grid.\nSocial impact (NB: unlikely, due to lack of political backing)\nResults fed into a low carbon transition in India or elsewhere Agriculture, Food and Drink,Construction,Education,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail,Transport,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
