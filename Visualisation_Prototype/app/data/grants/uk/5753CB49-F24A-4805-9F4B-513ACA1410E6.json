It will review pertinent local datasets and narrative accounts of rural development in one state (Bahia), against a comprehensive regional mapping of census and survey based indicators of municipal changes in economic growth, poverty and inequality over a 10 - 15 year period. </p>\n\n<p>A cluster of municipalities showing positive improvements will be selected and specific hypotheses developed about the roles played by changing power relations, alliances and institutions. Systematic field investigation of local social and economic actors' perspectives will capture the diversity of forces and institutions shaping territorial development and inform a critical perspective on the utility of available quantitative data. </p>\n\n<p>The research will shed light on the roles of endogenous territorial identity, innovation, social alliances, economic forces and institutions, in contributing to more inclusive and sustainable rural development, and their interaction with broader regional policies, history and geography.</p>\n\n<p>As part of a programme of case studies of rural territorial dynamics in ten Latin American countries using similar methods, it will generate conclusions of relevance for policy interventions to address rural disadvantage. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3234","grantId":"RES-000-22-3234","fundValue":"85187","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Julian Francis  Quan","coPersons":["Ruiz  Olalde"],"organisation":"University of Greenwich","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
