In particular they strongly influence the distribution and motion of the interstellar medium, the gas that fills the space in between stars and from which stars are formed, and cosmic rays, charged particles that fill the Galaxy and travel at close to the speed of light. These observations with the Parkes radio telescope in Australia form part of the most comprehensive survey of magnetic fields in the Milky Way ever undertaken; the Galactic Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS) is a collaboration of 13 scientists from 6 countries. GMIMS will lead to a significant advance in our understanding of cosmic magnetic fields.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I002790/1","grantId":"ST/I002790/1","fundValue":"1720","fundStart":"2010-08-27","fundEnd":"2010-11-26","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Radio observations part of survey of polarised emission of the southern sky.

The work will be useful for cosmologists who wish to measure the polarisation properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation. It is essential that they can accurately remove the polarised signal from our Milky Way in order to reliably detect the cosmological signal fro the early universe. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
