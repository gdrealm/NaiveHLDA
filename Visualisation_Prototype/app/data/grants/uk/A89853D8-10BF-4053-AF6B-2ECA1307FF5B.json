{"id":"A89853D8-10BF-4053-AF6B-2ECA1307FF5B","title":"Participating in Search Design: A Study of George Thomason's English Newsbooks","abstractText":"This project aims to understand how search is used within humanities research methodology and to use this knowledge in the design of better search interfaces for online resources which genuinely meet the needs of the research community. Data searching is now a core activity within humanities research and, given the vast evidence base which is now available to scholars in a digital form, the design of search has a significant impact on research results. However, the research community is rarely consulted when content providers are designing online resources and there tends to be an assumption that the search needs of humanities research are the same as those for other disciplines or non-academic knowledge gathering activities. This project will survey current practices in order to establish existing search methodologies and their deficiencies before using this knowledge to design a user interface for our test dataset and evaluate its impact on research in the field. The project will involve collaboration between the University's departments of History, English and Sociological Studies, the Humanities Research Institute and the content provider ProQuest. The test dataset will be approximately 50,000 pages of sixteenth-century newsbooks by George Thomason, currently only available as digitised images via ProQuest's EEBO. Test research questions for addressing the potential impact of the search design will revolve around understanding the role of newsbooks as the drivers of community formation. The project will explore the use of Participatory Design in developing search tools for the arts and humanities community. The aim of this methodology is to ensure that the design of ICT meets the needs of users by involving users in the design process and the ideal outcome of this project is to develop a test research resource which genuinely meets the needs of its users.\\n\\nConventional technical development processes often involves consulting users at an early stage (but after data creation) in order to ascertain requirements and then conducting user testing towards the end of the development cycle. The problem with this approach is that the user's involvement is reactive and not immersive or creative and, as such, the technical development can quickly become divorced from the user's needs. By contrast, our Participatory Design methodology will explore the improvement of search through the following development process:\\n\\n1. A landscape survey of current search practices within arts and humanities research methodology.\\n\\n2. Development of a search interface for our test dataset using a Design Group which includes users throughout the entire development cycle.\\n\\n3. Final evaluation of the search interface using the test research questions.\\n\\nThe outputs from the research will be as follows:\\n\\n1. A White Paper will document current research practices and search needs, identify the impact of current search design upon research outcomes and make recommendations for improving access to online resources through better search design.\\n\\n2. An edited volume of essays on Thomason's Newsbooks will presents new research contributed by the participants of the Design Group.\\n\\n3. A peer-reviewed article will explore the methodological implications of good and bad search design for humanities research.\\n\\n4. A peer-reviewed article will reflect on the merits of Participatory Design as a methodology for the digital content sectors.\\n\\n5. A new interface will provide full-text, searching of 50,000 pages of Newsbooks within ProQuest's EEBO.\\n\\nThere are two speculative aspects to the proposed research:\\n\\n1. The acquisition of knowledge about search use within humanities research methodology and recommendations for improvement. We do not know the answers yet.\\n\\n2. The use of a Participatory Design methodology in developing better search. This is a new methodogical approach and we cannot guarantee that it will result in a better search interface.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J002631/1","grantId":"AH/J002631/1","fundValue":"160477","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"M  Braddick","coPersons":["Marcus  Nevitt","Bridgette Anne Wessels"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
