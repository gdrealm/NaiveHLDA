{"id":"82EB2460-8A0C-4479-AFDB-584923CF5F8A","title":"Healthy Ageing in Residential Places (HARP)","abstractText":"<p>Active, healthy ageing is not often regarded as relevant to the residents of care homes and the aim of health and social care policies is to keep people out of care homes so as to remain active in their own homes. However, care homes remain an important element of care systems and have the potential to promote healthy active ageing.</p>\n\n<p>Based on a broad view of health that includes mental, physical, emotional, social and spiritual aspects, this project aims to develop new definitions of active, healthy ageing which include men and women who live in care homes and will identify strategies that enable residents to live more fulfilling lives. It will also identify strategies that promote the health of the labour force in care homes. We will explore the potential of such strategies to save resources by reducing the amount of medical and other care required as well as levels of staff sickness.</p>\n\n<p>This international project will use comparative case studies led by experienced national teams that will produce valuable data on the conditions that are the most promising in promoting healthy active ageing for residents and staff in specific care facilities in Canada, the UK, Sweden and Norway.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010964/1","grantId":"ES/K010964/1","fundValue":"118716","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ruth Elizabeth Lloyd","coPersons":["Janice Lee Thompson"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" project is still ongoing We hope that we will inspire service providers and commissioners to expand their expectations of what can be done in care homes with no added costs involved.
