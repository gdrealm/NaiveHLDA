{"id":"CF31BBFA-A743-42B1-BC52-6E8658AC4460","title":"Reversible Temperature-triggered Particle Capture by Modified Surfaces","abstractText":"Our previous EPSRC-funded 12 month project established the feasibility of using an electrode modified with deposited clay platelets containing grafted temperature-responsive polymer chains to capture dispersed colloid particles using temperature as the trigger. This continuation proposal aims to maximise temperature-triggered particle capture and release through improvements in our understanding of the underlying principles and to use this new technology to construct Janus particles. Janus particles are advanced colloid particles that have a diblock structure with each of the blocks having different surface energies. They are the best known stabilisers for emulsions and will also enable construction of nanoscale, functional devices. This project presents, for the first time, a method to produce Janus particles that has potential to be used on an industrial scale.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E001319/1","grantId":"EP/E001319/1","fundValue":"169972","fundStart":"2007-03-12","fundEnd":"2009-03-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian  Saunders","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
