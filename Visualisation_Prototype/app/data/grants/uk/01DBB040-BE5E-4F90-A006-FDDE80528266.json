Understanding the processes that drive the fast flow of these glaciers is crucial because a growing body of evidence points to a strong, but spatially varied and often complex, response to both oceanographic and atmospheric forcing. While the bed of glaciers elsewhere is known to strongly influence the flow of ice, no observations have ever been made from beneath a marine-terminating glacier in Greenland; a potential and likely cause of significant error in current predictions of sea level rise. This project will correct this paucity of observational constraint by gaining access to the bed of a major marine-terminating outlet glacier (Store Gletscher) in West Greenland, in order to observe and characterise the basal interface. With instruments deployed at the bed and on the glacier's surface and forefield, the project will fully resolve the basal control on ice flow and the glacier's response to iceberg calving, including the effects of meltwater input to the bed. The observational outcome will inform the glacier's sensitivity to atmospheric as well as oceanographic forcing while also enabling numerical ice flow modelling of unprecedented detail and accuracy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K005871/1","grantId":"NE/K005871/1","fundValue":"257028","fundStart":"2013-11-21","fundEnd":"2017-11-20","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This project is currently in its early phase, which means it is too soon to state how outcomes from hot-water drilling and instrumentation in boreholes drilled to the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet in a region of fast flow will affect the wider scientific community, policymakers and the public. \n\nNevertheless, two articles based on numerical modelling and oceanographic observations in front of Store Glacier have already been published. The former demonstrates how melting at the ice-ocean interface promote calving of icebergs into the sea (O'Leary and Christoffersen, 2013). The other characterises the oceanography in front of the glacier on which boreholes are being drilled (Chauch? et al., 2014).

Achievements include four boreholes drilled in 2014 to the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet in a region of fast flow. The team of investigators is now studying ice and basal conditions via sensors and instruments deployed in three of the four boreholes. Data, which are currently being collected, include temperature, tilt, water pressure, electrical conductivity and turbidity. Although it is currently too early to report findings, the successful drilling of multiple 600 m+ boreholes in 2014 and the current acquisition of borehole data are anticipated to produce new, significant, high-impact project outcomes, as no one have previously been able to drill to the bed of of a fast-flowing marine-terminating glacier in Greenland.
