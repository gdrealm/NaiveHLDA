Although this walk was one of the most eye-catching episodes in Jonson's life, we have had little knowledge of exactly when it was undertaken, why, and what might have transpired along the way. The 7,500 word account promises to change this situation profoundly. Entitled 'My Gossip Joh[n]son his foot voyage and mine into Scotland', it appears to have been written by a hitherto unsuspected companion. Furthermore, it provides a day-by-day narrative of the travellers' adventures, including crucial information on where and with whom they dined and stayed, and their adventures along the way. Given the rarity and academic value of such a source, and it is of the utmost importance that a fully annotated text is made available to all those to whom it might be relevant as quickly as possible. For this reason, Loxley and Julie Sanders have undertaken to collaborate on the production of such an edition.\\n\\nBut the account presents substantial challenges. For a start, the manuscript's provenance is uncertain, and in form and content it is quite unlike the items that make up the rest of the collection in which it was found. The account is unsigned, and there is no internal evidence that would allow us easily to determine its authorship. It is also not certain that the hand in which it is written is that of the traveller himself. So significant archival and palaeographic work is necessary to explore these questions. The profusion of names in the account presents a further challenge: more than 240 separate individuals are mentioned, many of whom are neither well known or well documented in secondary sources. Full investigation of these people will allow the editors and future researchers to draw out potentially significant patterns of association and affiliation. Our research will therefore require substantial work on archival sources in order to allow us to annotate these names as thoroughly as possible.\\n\\nThe project will also seek to set the account in a series of relevant contexts, in order to establish its significance for an academic audience that includes not only Jonson scholars, or specialists in early modern literature, but also those with interests in cultural geography and the history of the people and places visited. The critical edition will therefore be published with contextual essays, addressing the cultural significance of walking in early modern England, the influence of this journey on Jonson's work, the light it shines on non-metropolitan social networks, and early modern literary celebrity. In undertaking this contextual work, the team will take due account of recent interdisciplinary developments in the study of early modern travel, and in particular in their theoretical and methodological implications; we will also ensure that our work is informed by the extensive research undertaken for the new Cambridge edition of Jonson.\\n\\nBut we also want to ensure that such an engaging account is made available to a wider range of beneficiaries. The narrative identifies the places visited by Jonson and his companion, and gives intriguing details of their activities at many of them. A large proportion of these places are now in the care of heritage bodies, or are the object of historical interpretation for modern visitors by owners and custodians. This account illuminates the history of those sites in themselves and as places to visit, and could add colour and detail to their interpretation. Working with a specialist consultant, we will convene a presentation and workshop to disseminate our discoveries to custodians and interpreters, to discuss with them the relevance and usefulness of such sources to their interpretative work, and to feed into resource packs which we will provide to participants and others for use in developing their own materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I000135/1","grantId":"AH/I000135/1","fundValue":"321594","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The discovery and elucidation of the Foot Voyage account of Ben Jonson's walk to Scotland has already had a significant impact on research into Jonson's life and work. Ian Donaldson's definitive and well-received biography, Ben Jonson: A Life (OUP, 2011), drew on my published and unpublished research, and the book's use of this new source was something particularly noted by reviewers. Similarly, the new information provided by the Foot Voyage has made an impact on relevant aspects of the editorial labour of the new CUP edition of the Works of Ben Jonson (2012).\n\nOur findings have also already fed into the interpretation of Edinburgh Castle provided by Historic Scotland, and we are proactively contacting the custodians of other appropriate sites. Our exploration of the connections between literature and location also led to a cross-professional conference, 'A Place for Words', held in April 2013 - participants included heritage interpretation professionals, librarians, and academics. Our findings also underpinned a virtual re-enactment of Jonson's walk in summer 2013, which gained widespread media coverage and public interaction via blogs and social media.

We have produced an accurate transcription of the manuscript, and a modernised text; we have produced extensive annotation of the text, and written three lengthy contextual essays for publication with it. We have also created dynamic and static maps of the itinerary described in the account. Our findings add new information and evidence for a range of academic disciplines, including British and Scottish history, architectural history, historical and cultural geography, as well as literary studies. They also provide new information which can feed into the visitor interpretation of the many historic sites mentioned in the account. Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
