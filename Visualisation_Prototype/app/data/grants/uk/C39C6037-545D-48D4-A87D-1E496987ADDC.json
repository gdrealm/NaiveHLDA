The biological catalysts or enzymes that speed up the reactions in which sugars are linked to other molecules are known as glycosyltransferases. Although these enzymes and are industrially and biologically important, they have not been extensively studied because they are difficult to produce in large amounts. In this project we will take advantage of our ability to produce significant quantities of glycosyltransferases that catalyse the transfer of the sugar mannose onto other molecules. The three dimensional structure of these enzymes will be determined and the information will be used to synthesise inhibitors of these biological catalysts and to use molecular engineering techniques to manipulate their biological properties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E000568/1","grantId":"BB/E000568/1","fundValue":"320503","fundStart":"2007-02-15","fundEnd":"2010-02-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  It is not clear that there have been any non-academic impacts from this grant.  Economic","person":"David  Bolam","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" We showed that mannosylglycerate synthase, unusually for a glycosyltransferase, displays a preference for group II metals such as magnesium and calcium, over trace metals such as manganese, nickel and cobalt. Mutation of the key coordinating Histidine abolishes the ability of the enzyme to use group II metals but increases kcat when trace elements are used. The structure of the enzyme shows that the histidine is on a mobile loop that contributes to both donor and acceptor binding. A combination of biochemical and structural data, together with the altered metal preference, provides novel insight into the mechanism by which metals contribute to the action of glycosyltransferases. Understanding the detailed mechanism of mannose transfer has implications for our understanding of several serious congenital diseases and could also underpin development of novel glycoconjugates for a range of applications (e.g. medical, biotech).
