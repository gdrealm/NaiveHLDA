The immune/inflammatory system also controls repair, whether activated after microorganisms have been killing our cells, or induced because of physical damage such as cuts and wounds even if not accompanied by infection. \n\nThe immune/inflammatory system is organised for defence, white cells circulate in your blood &quot;on patrol&quot; constantly on alert for invaders with base depots called lymph nodes, where they can be marshalled in large numbers and sent out for attack. Some white cells produce antibodies and some produce substances that kill microorganisms directly. The immune/inflammatory system is divided into 2 parts, innate and adaptive. The adaptive part learns to recognise the invading microorganisms, and makes special antibodies tailored to each disease-producing microorganism. For a more rapid response a front line defence is needed. This is the innate immune/inflammatory system. \n\nIn so called inflammatory diseases, activators of these systems get produced without injury and infection and white cells are called into healthy tissue, and damage it. This occurs for example in heart disease and is the underlying mechanism inducing damage to joints in the disease called arthritis. To treat these diseases we need to find ways of shutting off the message to the activated cells. This project is the continuation of work we have been doing for many years on an inflammatory inducer called interleukin-1, which is particularly potent, and is known to contribute significantly to tissue damage. \n \nIn our earlier studies we have identified a novel regulator of the defence system, which significantly enhances activities induced by interleukin-1. We have demonstrated that this regulator is present in various types of inflammatory cells including those that can potentially damage healthy tissue. In addition, we have shown that in order to increase interleukin-1 activities the novel regulator binds to a so called &quot;signalling receptor&quot;, which is located on the surface of the cell, and controls inflammatory activities through the cell.\n\nIn this project we are investigating how this new regulator interacts with the signalling receptor and how it changes its function. We are going to use this information to identify the events it triggers inside the cell, and which lead to changes in cell behaviour. This will improve our understanding of how signals by cytokines such as interleukin-1 are regulated, and how they increase activity in inflammatory cells. Such information will contribute to our knowledge of how these activities are controlled, how to moderate their effects, and ultimately how to develop specific treatments for inflammatory disease. \n\nSpecific intervention is very important in controlling these events, as we need to have a certain level of functioning inflammatory responses in case of bacterial infection and/or we are in need of tissue repair. By moderating the novel regulator, we have the possibility of leaving the main system intact and functioning normally. We have recently obtained detailed information about which parts of the regulator are particularly potent. In this project we will use this information to investigate the consequences of activating and blocking this regulator and determine what cellular functions will be disturbed through the different parts of the protein. This will make it possible to ultimately design specific treatments for diseases characterised by abnormalities in these functions. \n\nState-of-the-art computational modelling will provide much clearer insights into the many processes involved in this very complex system, and predictions from the models will give us information, which we will use in future experimentation and drug development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J009687/1","grantId":"BB/J009687/1","fundValue":"553186","fundStart":"2012-09-03","fundEnd":"2015-09-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Eva Elisabet Qwarnstrom","coPersons":["Endre  Kiss-Toth","William Michael Holcombe"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" This project assesses the impact of the co-receptor TILRR on IL-1RI function and inflammatory signalling. Experiments on receptor function, have demonstrated the role of TILRR in adapter protein recruitment and signal co-ordination. The analysis has identified a range of novel events involving receptor crosstalk, which will be analysed further together with out collaborators in Cambridge. \n We have used siRNA knockout to determine the impact of TILRR expression on receptor function, inflammatory signalling and gene activation profiles. These show effects on a number of receptor systems involved in control of inflammatory responses, which are relevant to fundamental regulatory events related to host defence mechanisms, and include alterations known to be significant in disease development. \n 3-D modelling has been used to select TILRR mutants, with predicted effects on TILRR/IL-1RI association and/or receptor conformation. These have been screened in functional assays. \n In addition, ongoing experiments are investigating the mechanisms controlling the interaction of the TILRR glycosaminoglycan chain with the extracellular matrix, and the impact of this interaction on signalling receptor function. \n We have successively expanded our agent based computational model to reproduce TILRR control including novel mechanisms and signalling intermediates, as well as structural components. As data from the in vitro experiments are confirmed, results are incorporated in the model, which is verified, and predictions tested in biological assays. We have demonstrated that the model accurately reproduces the biological system, and allows us to explore signal sensitive regulation of NF-?B and to consider the impact of crosstalk on IL-1-induced responses. In addition, the computational model has been used to identify a novel mechanism for structural control of the NF-?B pathway and to define a role for this process in pathway calibration. These aspects will be further expanded in the remaining tenure of the grant when additional biological data will be included and we expect to derive a comprehensive and accurate in silico representation of mechanisms underlying controlled modulations of signal amplification. Identification of novel regulatory mechanisms of the NF-kB pathway and the relevance of TILRR in host defence mechanisms and disease are expected to be of interest.\nExpansion of the agent based model and the use of the FLAME framework will inform future large scale modelling of biological systems.
