All three of these are incredibly dense by our standards, thousands of times denser than lead for instance. Many examples of such objects are known, and they are often far from being inactive as they can be so closely paired up with other stars than we can see the effects of gas transferring from one star to the compact object. In such a process the gas can be heated to many millions of degrees making these object efficient X-ray sources. Furthermore, both white dwarfs and neutron stars can show explosive effects as material accreting onto them sparks into uncontrollable fusion, generating vast amounts of energy within seconds or minutes. Our work centres on trying to understand such processes and how the various objects that we see relate to one another. The purpose of this grant is to support the travel needed to observe these objects on ground-based telescopes where we carry out observations of the high-speed processes that occur as material crashes onto these remarkable objects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G004269/1","grantId":"ST/G004269/1","fundValue":"38310","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Marsh","coPersons":["Danny  Steeghs","Andrew James Levan","Boris  Gaensicke","Peter James Wheatley"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
