How does a salamander regenerate its limb and why can we not do this? Our research is studying some of the critical components that underly limb regeneration, and in particular the ones that are found in salamanders and not in us. The salamander and human genome projects provide important resources for identifying such components. If we understood how they worked this would provide a new impetus for trying to enhance our own abilities to regenerate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000870","grantId":"G1000870","fundValue":"1983980","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy Patrick Brockes","coPersons":["Anoop  Kumar"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
