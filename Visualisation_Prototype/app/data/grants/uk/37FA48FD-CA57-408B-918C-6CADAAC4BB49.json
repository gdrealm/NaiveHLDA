Like other plants, phytoplankton require sunlight and nutrients to grow and flourish. However, in the ocean sunlight is confined to the upper few tens of metres, while nutrient concentrations are low at the sea surface and greatest at depths of a kilometre or more. The growth of phytoplankton is thus fundamentally dependent on processes that transfer nutrients from depth up to the sunlit surface.\n\nOver the mid latitudes the problem of acquiring nutrients appears to be particularly stark. The winds at mid latitudes provide a widespread downward transport of water, which inhibits the transfer of nutrient-rich deeper waters up into the sunlit, surface waters. Thus, one might expect much of the mid latitude ocean to be a desert due to a lack of nutrients. However, phytoplankton growth in the mid latitude ocean is more than might initially be expected, and is globally very important as it drives about half of the oceans' biological removal of carbon out of the atmosphere. Oceanographers have calculated the amount of nutrient required to support this growth, based upon the concentrations of inert tracers in the upper ocean. However, adding together the known nutrient supplies falls significantly short of this total nutrient requirement. Hence, there is a conundrum as to how the biological growth over the mid latitude ocean is sustained. If we want to understand how carbon is cycled between the atmosphere and oceans, and how it affects our climate, we need to answer this problem.\n\nIn this proposal, we address the problem of how deep nutrients are transported into the surface waters in mid-latitudes. We propose to test a new view: tides passing over the mid-Atlantic ridge generate enhanced turbulence and mixing, which in turn provides a nutrient supply to the upper thermocline waters. These nutrients are then transported horizontally along density surfaces over the western side of the basin, probably being swept along the Gulf Stream and eventually passing into the winter mixed surface layer. When this surface layer shallows and warms in spring, the nutrients are then available to the phytoplankton. The work plan involves two main components. We will carry out a field programme collecting measurements of the turbulence and nutrient concentrations over and adjacent to the mid-Atlantic ridge. This fieldwork will involve collecting data from a novel long-term moored array of instruments on the ridge along with a focused 5 week research cruise. Our work involves sampling sufficiently quickly to be able to resolve tidal changes in currents and mixing over the ridge: this has never been done before, and we have brought together scientists with expertise in tidal measurements in shallower shelf seas with others who are expert in deep ocean mixing and transports in order to do this. The 2nd component of our work will use computer models of circulation in the Atlantic to explore the wider implications of the fieldwork observations, allowing us to decide whether or not mixing over the mid-Atlantic ridge really does provide enough nutrients to explain the phytoplankton production in the mid-latitude N Atlantic.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L003449/1","grantId":"NE/L003449/1","fundValue":"221495","fundStart":"2014-11-30","fundEnd":"2018-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Alberto  Naveira Garabato","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
