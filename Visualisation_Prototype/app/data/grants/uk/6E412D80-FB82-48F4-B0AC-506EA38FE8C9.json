This project aims to develop new interpretations of this internationally famous monument through analysis of its chronological and spatial relationships with other monuments and features in its landscape. Within an integrated programme of landscape study and excavation, the project explores the local and regional context of Stonehenge, dating key phases, and providing new perspectives on prehistoric Britain. This is a pivotal moment in the appreciation of this landscape when new interpretations can transform public engagement with this locality and its prehistory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119217/1","grantId":"119217/1","fundValue":"498241","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Parker  Pearson","coPersons":["Julian Stewart  Thomas","Carl Joshua Pollard","Christopher  Tilley","Kate  Welham","Colin  Richards"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" Stonehenge is one of the iconic monuments of the world, inspiring substantial public interest and generating multiple archaeological interpretations. One of the unexpected outcomes of my project in Madagascar was a new perspective on Stonehenge and Neolithic monumentality. This led to the development of a major field project in 2003, the Stonehenge Riverside Project, funded by AHRC, the British Academy and the National Geographic Society among others, investigating Stonehenge within its wider landscape, especially the role of the River Avon in linking it with contemporary monuments at Woodhenge and Durrington Walls. The Stonehenge Riverside Project began in 2003 with investigations of Britain's largest henge, Durrington Walls, less than 2 miles from Stonehenge. Over the next four seasons we uncovered remains of Neolithic houses dating to the same period as Stonehenge's second stage of construction, around 2500 BC. We realized that this huge settlement was probably where the builders lived when putting up the huge stones at Stonehenge. We also found that Durrington Walls has its own solstice-aligned avenue leading to the River Avon. Another surprise was that, where Stonehenge's prehistoric avenue meets the river, there lies a long since dismantled stone circle, 'Bluestonehenge'.\n\n\n\nAs PI and project manager, I co-ordinate a large multi-disciplinary team whose other directors are Prof. Colin Richards and Prof. Julian Thomas (Manchester University), Dr. Josh Pollard (Southampton University), Prof. Chris Tilley (UCL) and Dr. Kate Welham (Bournemouth University). The high quality of results from SRP led me to initiate a new project, Feeding Stonehenge (AHRC-funded), on which I was joined by CI's Dr. Umberto Albarella (Sheffield), Prof. Jane Evans (BGS) and Dr. Oliver Craig (York). This has focused on the resourcing of Stonehenge's construction, including the study of livestock mobility through isotopic analysis, culinary practices from lipid analysis of ceramic residues, and seasonality. I was also PI on Stonehenge-under-the-Earth (Google-funded), a project managed by Dr. Welham to provide a Google Earth application of our research results to the public, launched on the web in 2011. Since 2011 I have also been leading the Stones of Stonehenge Project, to investigate the sources of the Stonehenge monoliths in Wales and north Wiltshire. Since starting research in 2003, our results have revolutionised our understanding of Stonehenge and have made a major contribution to knowledge of the Neolithic. The project was the subject of two American and two British TV documentaries. It also received worldwide publicity in newspapers, television items and web interest. The results are being incorporated into the new Stonehenge Visitor Centre. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
