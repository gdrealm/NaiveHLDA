In Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) the microstructures of the porous composite anode and cathode are particularly critical as they determine the electrochemical, electrical, mechanical and transport properties of the electrode, and of current distribution to/from the electrode/electrolyte interface. Current state of the art SOFC electrodes rely on a largely empirical understanding to establish the electrode microstructure, and its influence on key performance characteristics, including long term durability. But recent work by the proposers has established a new suite of tools and techniques that offer the prospect of moving towards a design led approach to manufacture of improved electrodes, based on our ability to image, model, simulate and fabricate new electrode structures with controlled properties. This proposal seeks to develop and demonstrate this, further improving and validating our analysis and modelling tools, using these design optimum structures, fabricating these using three novel processing techniques established by the proposers, and then measuring device performance to feedback into the design process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M014045/1","grantId":"EP/M014045/1","fundValue":"1247370","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel Peter Brandon","coPersons":["Paul  Shearing","Alan  Atkinson","Kang  Li","Daniel  Brett","Jawwad  Darr"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
