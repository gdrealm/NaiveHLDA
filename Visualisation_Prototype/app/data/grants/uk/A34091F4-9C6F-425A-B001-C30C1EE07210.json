Studies of entrepreneurial networks reveal their importance, emphasising that what occurs within networks is critical.&nbsp; Non-executive directors (NEDs) are a specific type of potentially important network support for SME owners.&nbsp; <br /><br />The 1992 Cadbury report emphasised the benefits for all companies to utilise a NED.&nbsp; However, despite government encouragement for NEDs, smaller firms remain less likely to have NEDs. Interestingly, small businesses with an NED have been found to grow faster and to extract a premium upon business sale.&nbsp; <br /><br />This project will investigate how interactions within entrepreneurial networks affect innovation by studying a small business support programme (GOLD) that simulates both having and being a non-executive director.&nbsp; <br /><br />In GOLD, SME owner managers work in a simulated board structure, with cohort members operating as non-executive directors to each other in self-managed groups.&nbsp; Using qualitative methods, our research seeks to explore the impact on SME networks of simulating having, and being, a non-executive director (NED), and the effects of this on the entrepreneurs, their businesses, and innovation and growth.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I016465/1","grantId":"ES/I016465/1","fundValue":"70768","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mary Brennan Rose","coPersons":["Magnus John George"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
