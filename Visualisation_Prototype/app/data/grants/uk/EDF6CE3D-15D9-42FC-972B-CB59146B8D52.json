As this flows into the solar system it interacts with planetary atmospheres and magnetic fields, and changes the surfaces of planets from their original make up. The Solar System Physics group at Aberystwyth aims to answer outstanding questions at each stage of this interlinked system, including: - why eruptions and solar wind outflow occur on the Sun, and how these eruptions affect the surrounding solar atmosphere; - how the structure of the solar wind, and transients within it, evolve as they travel out into space; - how this solar wind interacts with planetary atmospheres and magnetic fields, and how this differs from planet to planet; - what is the composition of the Moon, and what does this tells us about the formation of the Earth-Moon system; - how can robots best be used to explore other planets. In order to understand these linked processes, we need to make state of the art measurements of the environments of the Sun, the Planets and the Space in between. These include optical and radio experiments on Earth, and data from space probes that investigate the Sun, Moon and planets. Using these observations we can build the theories needed to explain these connections, and how they affect our solar neighbourhood. For example at Venus the synergy of our remote sensing of the heliosphere, in situ measurements and innovative modelling strengthens our understanding. We have formal links to many of these probes, and are lead investigator of the X-ray instrument on the Indian Chandrayaan-1 mission, as well as co-investigators of instruments on other probes such as STEREO, Venus Express, and Mars Express. In addition to exploiting current observatories and probes, we are strongly involved in producing the technological advances required for future exploration of our solar system. This includes creating the software to exploit the next generation of radio telescopes, and researching the robotic techniques for autonomous identification of interesting science targets and sample acquisition by future planetary rovers, which will dramatically improve their scientific return. To support the robotic research at Aberystwyth, we have built a Planetary Analogue Terrain Laboratory, with a simulated Martian surface and an experimental rover. This robotics programme has led to our involvement with the forthcoming ExoMars mission where we are lead investigator of the Robotic Inspection Mirror, and co-investigator of Panoramic Camera and the Rover Operation Control Centre, and will lead to future involvement in many other missions and terrestrial spin-offs. Our observational work is linked to computer models, where physics-based simulations are constrained by observed quantities to help deduce the underlying science. This includes the modelling of solar magnetic fields, and the behaviour of plasma around the Sun and planets, and the space in between. This work is backed up by supercomputing facilities and 3D visualisation equipment that is housed within the Institute of Mathematics and Physics at Aberystwyth. Our programme lends itself to engagement with the wider community and public, and knowledge that we generate is highly applicable to non-space and commercial exploitation. The Solar System Physics group at Aberystwyth is unusual as our expertise covers a continuous chain of interaction linking the Sun, Earth and Planets. This puts us in an ideal position to understand how events in the inner solar system shape the environment in which we live.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H002634/1","grantId":"ST/H002634/1","fundValue":"536598","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Manuel  Grande","coPersons":["Anthony  Cook","Sian Eleri Pryse","Xing  Li","Balazs  Pinter","David  Barnes","Andrew Robert Breen","Huw  Morgan"],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
