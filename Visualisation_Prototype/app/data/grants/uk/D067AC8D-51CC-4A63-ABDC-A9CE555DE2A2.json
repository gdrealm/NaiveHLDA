One family of such mutated genes is known as histones. DNA is packed in the nucleus and this structure is known as chromatin. Histones are involved in coding for the basic building blocks of chromatin. The recent finding that histones are mutated in cancer has changed the way that scientists think about how human cancer develops. \n\nThis proposal aims to define how histone mutations alter the normal development of the bone/cartilage and how these changes can lead to cancer. We also want to define similarities and differences in the mechanisms by which these mutant histones drive bone/cartilage and brain tumours. Overall, this work will increase our understanding of how cancer develops: it is likely that the information will have an impact beyond bone and brain tumours. The findings in turn will help identifying novel targets for drug development, which may be valuable for treating more than one tumour type.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M00094X/1","grantId":"MR/M00094X/1","fundValue":"464091","fundStart":"2014-09-15","fundEnd":"2017-09-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paolo  Salomoni","coPersons":["Adrienne Margaret Flanagan"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
