The idea that data mining offers the preemptive solution to problems of security risk has quickly established itself at the forefront of the ‘war on terror’. This means that data previously held only by commercial institutions, such as banks and airlines, now becomes deployed for state security purposes. With a specific focus on data deployed to govern the mobility of people and the mobility of money, Data Wars is concerned with the societal implications of what are often considered ‘smart’ security solutions. \n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;The project has the following objectives:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ol>\n <li>To generate new empirical knowledge about the ways in which data-led risk technologies are deployed in the war on terror in Europe.</li>\n <li>To analyze the emergence of new spaces of transatlantic governing in which data-led security decisions are authorized.</li>\n <li>To advance theoretical understanding of the role of preemptive risk management in the war on terror.</li>\n</ol> \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E024106/1","grantId":"ES/E024106/1","fundValue":"269824","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Louise  Amoore","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
