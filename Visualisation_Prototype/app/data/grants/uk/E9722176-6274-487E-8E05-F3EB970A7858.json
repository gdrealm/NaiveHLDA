{"id":"E9722176-6274-487E-8E05-F3EB970A7858","title":"Microsystems for coupled expression and electrophysiology of ion channels","abstractText":"Single-channel electrophysiology is the gold standard for investigating the function of ion channel proteins and their modulation by pharmaceutical drugs, but requires the expression and purification of these channels from cell cultures, which is a notoriously difficult and low-yield process. As an alternative approach, cell-free expression of channel proteins is relatively straightforward, but because of the high cost of the required cell extracts, it is only feasible to obtain very small amounts of expressed protein, insufficient for purification. This proposal aims to develop a new platform for microscale electrophysiology that enables the characterization of ion channels from microliters of a cell-free expression reaction without any purification step.The project will systematically work towards proof of concept, i.e. extensive electrophysiological characterization of a cell-free expressed voltage-gated potassium channel. The main objectives are: 1) the fabrication of elastomeric microwells for the formation of an interdroplet membrane in which ion channels can be incorporated, 2) systematic optimization of the stability of this membrane so that it can be in direct contact with cell-free reaction mixtures, and 3) membrane incorporation of cell-free expressed KvAP for electrophysiological characterization, including drug screening.Ion channels play a central role in many diseases, including seizures, cystic fibrosis, myasthenia gravis, and generalized epilepsy. Many of these channelopathies are chronic conditions which impact heavily on the quality of life. New drugs to treat these diseases or alleviate their symptoms are hence of great value. This project directly addresses a major bottleneck in the drug discovery process by developing a novel method for obtaining pure ion channels that can be directly investigated with microscale electrophysiology.This technology has the clear potential to accelerate ion channel research and drug screening and will benefit biomedical researchers, pharmaceutical companies and the general public. Maximum impact of the research will be realized by professional press releases and by actively approaching the major electrophysiology companies, which have the resources and expertise to commercialize the technology, at specific national and international conferences with an established industry presence.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I029036/1","grantId":"EP/I029036/1","fundValue":"101936","fundStart":"2011-06-23","fundEnd":"2013-11-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This grant finished on 29 November 2013, with its main findings published in October 2013.

To achieve this, we have developed a protocol to obtain interdroplet membranes that are stable in the presence of the protein-rich cell-free protein expression medium. We established that the optimal method to form stable interdroplet bilayers is to bring two droplets together by dielectrophoretic or mechanical manipulation. The use of deformable elastomeric structures that restrict the contact area between two larger water-in-oil compartments proved to be disadvantageous because the desired small size of the interdroplet lipid bilayer membrane cannot be maintained, probably because of oil adsorption by the elastomer. Once incorporated in the interdroplet membrane, the cell-free expressed ion channels could be investigated by electrophysiology. The KcsA and hERG pore domain channels were shown to be functional and the response of KcsA to a potassium channel blocker could be established. In summary, we have demonstrated that the use of commercially available cell-free expression mixtures enables electrophysiological characterization of ion channel activity without any time- and material-consuming ion channel purification steps, exploiting expression mixture-facilitated spontaneous membrane incorporation of this important class of drug targets. The potential use of this technology is high-throughput screening of ion channel modulators for the discovery of new pharmaceutical drugs for ion channel-based diseases such as cystic fibrosis, myasthenia gravis and epilepsy. To achieve this, two developments are required: 1) demonstration of ion channel incorporation, into model membranes, from cell-free expression mixtures, for a larger number of ion channels than those studied in our project, with subsequent drug screening of ion channel activity, and 2) the development of multi-droplet measurement systems with automated formation of interdroplet membranes. The first development concerns academic research, which we have promoted by international conference presentations and by our two publications in the international scientific literature, and which we will also pursue ourselves. The second development requires involvement from companies in the high-throughput electrophysiology arena, in collaboration with academia. During the project we have engaged with an appropriate commercial partner. The pharmaceutical industry could drive this research and development once proof-of-concept for an important drug target is demonstrated.
