{"id":"AD08A906-C6DF-45D2-A91B-93F6AD48930C","title":"Next Generation Bio-Inspired Sensors and Smart Materials","abstractText":"Complex biological systems have evolved to produce extremely effective and robust sensory, control and signal transmission systems. It can be observed that these mechanisms are almost entirely due to chemical diffusion and reactions in aqueous solutions and are separated from the structures which give the system mechanical integrity ie the skeleton. However, when man-made sensors and electronic devices are manufactured for robust sensing and communications eg PCs, burglar alarms etc, external solid-state solutions are the preferred option. Although, chemical sensing interfaces are common, the charge transfer necessary for signal transmission is quickly transferred to a solid medium for external transmission and display and processing. Thus, the rapid evolution of solid-state man-made technologies could be creating a barrier to interfacing with complex biological systems eg animals and humans. The research group set up via this funding mechanism will address this issue with the aim of producing the next generation of biomedical and analytical sensing solutions.Thus, this project will draw upon research into biological receptors to investigate state-of-the-art sensing and signal transmission mechanisms which could eventually be integrated within the body. To give a strong focus to this overriding challenge it is proposed that investigations in the first instance are confined to a specific bio-mechanism, stretch and pressure receptors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F01189X/1","grantId":"EP/F01189X/1","fundValue":"1047570","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sherri  Johnstone","coPersons":["Ritu  Kataky","Susan  Pyner"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
