Pragmatic decisions about effectiveness usually involve complex knowledge-claims about the world and the effects of intervention within it, and criteria for success in non-profits defy easy calculation. This study focuses on human rights organisations, Christian churches and conservation organisations, all organisations that pursue particularly boundless values. The project investigates how ideas, management tools, controversies about knowledge and organisational constraints affect provision. It contributes to debates about global governance, and it seeks to offer new understandings of how territoriality and space is managed by non-state organisations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009982/1","grantId":"ES/K009982/1","fundValue":"225375","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Monika  Krause","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
