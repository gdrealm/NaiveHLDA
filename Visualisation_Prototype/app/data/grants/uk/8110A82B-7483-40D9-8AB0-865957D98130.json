Differences in cell types (e.g. neurons as compared to muscle cells) arise because different parts of the genetic material are read out. RNA polymerises (RNAPs) are a crucial part of the cellular machinery involved in the selective reading mechanism and it is therefore important to understand their molecular structure and function in considerable detail. RNAPs can, however, not carry out this function on their own &iquest; they rely on the assistance of basal factors that help them to bind to the right places of the genetic material. We are using a class of simple microorganisms (archaea) that, amazingly, contain an RNAP and basal factors that are very similar to those found in higher organisms, including humans. By studying the biochemical properties of these archaeal components we hope to gain a better understanding of the function of basal factors and how they guide RNAPs to the correct starts sites. An additional advantage of the chosen archaeal model system is that these archaea grow under biologically extremely hostile conditions (in salt-saturated lakes bombarded with high intensity sunlight). By studying organisms that are capable of withstanding such environmental challenges we also gain insights how living systems could evolve and function on other planets and thus provide the basis for understanding extraterrestrial life forms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D523000/1","grantId":"BB/D523000/1","fundValue":"214847","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert O.J.
