The role of higher education institutions (HEIs) is a particularly interesting one, and is less well understood in the context of regional socio-economic development. </p>\n\n<p>This research starts with the assumption that it is of great long-term significance to regional and sub-regional socio-economic development that localities are able to retain the stock of human capital they have, develop it, and add to it from the annual additions of HEI graduates. Thus it is important to understand what factors attract students to study in a particular locality in the first instance and then establish what factors influence their subsequent employment decisions and what impact this has on cities. </p>\n\n<p>Using student destinations data, this research will consider how three broad factors influence human capital flows into and out of cities, namely; university quality; local labour markets, and; quality of life. It will then seek to establish what economic impact net flows of graduates has on cities, in particular in terms of innovative capacity.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E017975/1","grantId":"ES/E017975/1","fundValue":"20720","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marc  Cowling","coPersons":["Emma  Pollard","Peter  Bates"],"organisation":"Institute for Employment Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
