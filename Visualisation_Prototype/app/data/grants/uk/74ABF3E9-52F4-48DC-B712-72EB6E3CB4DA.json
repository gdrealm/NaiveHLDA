{"id":"74ABF3E9-52F4-48DC-B712-72EB6E3CB4DA","title":"Psychoacoustics of normal and impaired hearing and applications to hearing aid design and fitting","abstractText":"In recent years many improvements have been made in the quality of hearing aids provided to hearing-impaired people. The majority of hearing-impaired people are now being fitted with digital hearing aids that offer great flexibility for tailoring the sound to best fit the residual hearing capacity of the person. However, even the best current hearing aids do not restore auditory perception to normal, and many users of hearing aids complain of difficulty in understanding speech, especially in noisy situations. Our goal is to make hearing aids work more effectively for hearing-impaired people, who constitute approximately 7% of the population in the UK. We also aim to develop ways of fitting hearing aids more effectively, so as to optimise the benefit to each individual.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701870","grantId":"G0701870","fundValue":"1978880","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian Cecil Moore","coPersons":["Brian  Glasberg","T  Baer","Michael  Stone"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
