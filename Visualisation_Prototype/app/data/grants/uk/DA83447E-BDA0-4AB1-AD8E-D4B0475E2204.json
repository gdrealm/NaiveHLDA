{"id":"DA83447E-BDA0-4AB1-AD8E-D4B0475E2204","title":"The Rising Powers, Clean Development and the Low Carbon Transition in Sub-Saharan Africa","abstractText":"<p>This interdisciplinary research project seeks to examine how, why and to what extent the Rising Powers (specifically China, India and Brazil) are enabling the transition to low carbon energy systems in Southern Africa. The project will explore the range of actors, institutions, partnerships and policy-making processes involved in these contemporary forms of ‘South-South’ co-operation and technology transfer and aims to identify the key interests and beneficiaries being served here. Empirically focused on case studies of Mozambique and South Africa, the project will assess the implications of the growing involvement of the Rising Powers in Southern African energy systems for the affordability, accessibility and sustainability of energy services in the region and will analyse how the Rising Powers are shaping the provision of energy services for productive uses (e.g. cooking, lighting and mobility). The project also seeks to assess the implications for the wider governance of energy and climate change at the local, national, regional and global scales. Using a combination of semi-structured interviews and community-based participatory research methods the research will also explore the dynamics of the low carbon transitions being created and enabled by the Rising Powers in Southern Africa, which are uneven and differentiated technically, socially and spatially. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J01270X/1","grantId":"ES/J01270X/1","fundValue":"582179","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marcus John Power","coPersons":["Jim  Watson","Wei  Shen","Adrian Paul Smith","Yibing  Duan","Peter John Newell","Gisela  Prasad","Harriet Ann Bulkeley"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
