Citizens' European Identity and Parties' Vision on the Future of EU Citizenship","abstractText":"<p>For the first time, 'Feeling European' will tell us how ''European'' citizens feel across the 27 member states of the European Union using a series of brand new questions to be asked in a mass survey, which will be carried out in the hours that will follow the European Parliament elections in June 2009. </p>\n\n<p>The survey will also evaluate the impact of European identity on citizens' behaviour in the elections, as well as the relationship between European identity, democratic preferences, and political protest. </p>\n\n<p>It&nbsp;will also ask citizens questions about what new rights and duties they would like to see associated with European Union citizenship. The same questions will then be addressed to political party leaders in nine countries in a series of in-depth elite interviews to be carried out in 2009-2010.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G03253X/1","grantId":"ES/G03253X/1","fundValue":"191689","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Bruter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
