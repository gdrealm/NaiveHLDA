The AO development roadmap identifies various forms of laser guide star (LGS) AO, in particular, to be both challenging technologically and critical for the proposed ELT instrument suite. The innovation and difficulty of several crucial LGS AO technologies is indeed such that on-sky verification will be required. Whilst some verification will be provided by the VLT multi-LGS AOF (Adaptive Optics Facility), several key technologies will require prototyping on other facilities. We propose the development of a new laser AO test laboratory, DU-GALL, which will be usable both in the laboratory and on-sky on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope, and which will subsume our existing WHT laser AO test system, the Rayleigh Technical Demonstrator (RTD). DU-GALL's purpose will be to investigate laser guide star (LGS) adaptive optics technologies required for the E-ELT and future ESO and Gemini AO facility upgrades. We focus particularly on Laser Multi-Object AO and Laser Tomographic AO, but the proposed system will be inherently capable of testing other ELT AO roadmap technologies, and we propose this through collaborative links and FP7 funding. DU-GALL will provide key support for the UK in taking an important role in the next generation of LGS AO-optimised instrument design.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E007651/1","grantId":"PP/E007651/1","fundValue":"757544","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Yes, the funding secured the UK leadership of the CANARY UK-France project, with myself as overall PI.

CANARY has achieved the following world firsts, which are fully consistent with the goals of this funding:\n\nLaser Multi-Object AO (MOAO) demonstrated on-sky\n - this is a technology required for the MOS (Multi-Object Spectrograph) on the forthcoming European Extremely Large Telescope. The technology will allow, for example, a survey of the first galaxies to form in the universe, exploring the mechanisms which give the universe its particular form. It overcomes the effects of atmospheric turbulence on ground-based telescopes and does so over a very wide field of view. Artificial stars, produced by powerful lasers, are used to sense the atmospheric turbulence above the telescope and and to correct its effects.\n\nLaser Tomographic AO (LTAO) demonstrated on-sky\n- this is an atmospheric correction technology required by the UK-led HARMONI first-light instrument on the forthcoming European Extremely Large Telescope.\n\nFull Linear Quadratic Gaussian Conreol demonstrated on-sky\n- optimally removes the effects of windshake on telescope images.\n\nAO feed of a photonic lantern spectrograph demonstrated on-sky\n\noptimal feeding of a new photonic technology spectrograph using adaptive optics\n\nArtificial Neural Net tomographic reconstructor demonstrated on-sky,\n- technology allowing adaptive optics turbulence correction to adapt automatically to changes in the atmospheric configuration\n\nCuReD and HWR wavefront reconstructors demonstrated on-sky\n- new high-speed computational methods for adaptive optics for exoplanet imaging.\n\nMOAO and LTAO are required for the ELT-MOS, ELT-IFU (HARMONI), METIS, and possibly HIRES.
