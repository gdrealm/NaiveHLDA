These groups make the compounds soluble in water. Many dye and drug molecules are of this type. They are disc-like or plank-like in shape and have a strong tendency, even in dilute solution, to form long stacks, though layered phases have also been reported. These stacks may be positionally disordered (N phase) or they may be arranged in hexagonal patterns (M phase). Often the stacks are simple columns, though water-filled hollow chimney structures have also been proposed.The relationship between the molecular structure and the phase behaviour is very obscure. Seemingly small structural differences can have large effects on the phase diagram. This has practical implications, for unwanted aggregation of dye and drug molecules can render promising new formulations useless.In this proposal we seek to obtain a quantitative understanding of the structure-property relations of these chemicals. We will synthesise a series of naphthylamine sulphonic acid derivatives in which the chemical groups and the geometry are varied in a systematic way. We will experimentally examine the phase behaviour (varying also the salt concentration and the pH) and we will carry out computer simulation studies on state-of-the-art atomistic simulation models. We will also seek to develop simple theories to provide an underpinning framework to interpret these data. By combining synthesis, phase characterisation, simulation and theory in this systematic study, we aim to uncover the basic rules that govern the aggregation and phase properties of this important and fascinating class of molecules.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E019404/1","grantId":"EP/E019404/1","fundValue":"208332","fundStart":"2007-04-16","fundEnd":"2009-04-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew John Masters","coPersons":["Gordon Joseph Tiddy"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" 1) A wide range of chemicals from the Balaban and King set were studies and found to show no liquid crystalline behaviour.\n\n2) Edicol sunset yellow (ESY) was studied in detail and the detailed stacking pattern elucidated by X-ray and NMR studies.\n\n3) Th effects of salt on the aggregation and phase diagram were reported. Surprisingly at the temperatures studies, salt destabilises the nematic phase.\n\n4) Nylomine Red and ESY were shown to be miscible, even in the nematic phase. This supports the unexpected hypothesis that these molecules mix within the stacks. Some papers are still being written, but currently we have publications in J. Phys. Chem. B and Liquid Crystals. Our Durham collaborators have a paper in JACS. As yet no commerical exploitation is envisaged. Chemicals","dataset":"gtr"}
