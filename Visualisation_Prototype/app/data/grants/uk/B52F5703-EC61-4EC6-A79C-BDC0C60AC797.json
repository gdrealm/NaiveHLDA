Understanding the basic causes will aid in diagnosis and counselling and in some instances even treatment. From our understanding of germ cell development in lower organisms we have chosen to study one interesting group of genes, those involved in the exchange and partitioning of genetic information, changes in which are a potential source of infertility. The work proposed is designed to test this idea. A second goal is to develop a model organism as an experimental system for understanding the why changes in these genes are a source of human infertility. A third goal is to study the control of the exchange of genetic information in normal sperm development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300468","grantId":"G0300468","fundValue":"544078","fundStart":"2004-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rhona Harriet Borts","coPersons":["Christopher  Barratt"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
