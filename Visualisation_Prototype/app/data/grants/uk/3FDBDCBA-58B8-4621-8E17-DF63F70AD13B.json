Recognition as a dramatist and poet, however, has seen his work as a visual artist and director to a secondary position. This research project examines Lorca's production history both in Spain and abroad, positioning him firstly as a significant theatre artist within the climate of pre-Civil War Spain and secondly, as a key influence on subsequent generations of directors and dramatist who have used his stage plays for some of the most exciting theatre experiments of the century.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111775/1","grantId":"111775/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Delgado","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
