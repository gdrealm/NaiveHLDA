It is thinning sufficiently rapidly along its outlet glaciers to contribute an estimated 0.75 mm/yr to global sea level rise. About half of that signal is a result of an increase in the amount of melting over the surface of the ice sheet in summer, while half has come from acceleration in the flow of a number of major outlet glaciers that drain ice from the interior of the ice sheet directly into the ocean. While the increase in melting has been caused by changes in atmospheric conditions over the ice sheet surface, the latter process is less well understood. The acceleration of the glaciers appears to be linked to changes at the downstream end, where the glaciers come into contact with the ocean. At times in the past, the larger glaciers appear to have had short tongues of floating ice at their termini, and recent thinning or break-up of those tongues seems to have precipitated the accelerations. It is generally assumed that the thinning and retreat of the floating ice tongues was triggered by some change in the oceanographic conditions within the fjords into which the glaciers drain. However, prior to the recent changes almost nothing was known about the oceanography of the fjords, so although observations are now beginning to be made, we can only guess at what the fjords looked like when the floating tongues were intact, and how the fjord waters and floating ice interacted. At present there are only a couple of floating ice tongues of any size that still survive, and that still seem to be in something close to a steady state. It is crucial that we make observations of those fjords and glaciers now, while they still exist, so that we can learn about the physical processes that must have played a role in the destruction of those that have been lost in recent years, and so that should a similar fate befall the few survivors in future we will be able to say with certainty what changes led to their destruction. Improving our knowledge of the interaction between the floating ice tongues of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the seawater within the fjords in which they float, and in particular developing our skills in modelling these systems, will be a major step towards understanding what controls the pace and ultimate extent of the changes currently underway in Greenland's outlet glaciers.\n\nThis project forms part of an intensive observational research campaign focused on ocean-ice shelf interactions in Petermann Fjord, the site of a major outlet glacier, Petermann Glacier, draining northwest Greenland. Most of the fjord is still covered by a 55-km long floating ice tongue, which forms both the primary interest in the region and the largest obstacle to detailed observations of the fjord. The collaborative, interdisciplinary effort consists of coordinated ocean and glacier studies conducted by groups at two UK and five US institutions plus international partners from Canada and Denmark. The unique contribution of this particular project is to determine the shape of the ocean cavity beneath the floating ice tongue and the distribution of water properties within it. The key tool with which the necessary observations will be made is an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (Autosub3), configured and run in a manner analogous to that used for an earlier, highly successful campaign in which it completed 500 km of along-track observations beneath the 60-km long floating tongue of Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. A detailed understanding of the ocean circulation and melting beneath Petermann Glacier will generate insight into ocean-ice interactions that will be relevant to many other sites in Greenland and Antarctica, and will advance our developing knowledge of ice sheet discharge and its future effect on sea-level rise.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J023108/1","grantId":"NE/J023108/1","fundValue":"346117","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Adrian  Jenkins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"NERC British Antarctic Survey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
