This will include requesting imaging sequences of rings and small satellites, seeing such requests through the integration process, designing the parameters of such sequences and finally using the returned data. Reduced satellite orbital data will be forwarded to the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I000739/1","grantId":"ST/I000739/1","fundValue":"71402","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Carl  Murray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
