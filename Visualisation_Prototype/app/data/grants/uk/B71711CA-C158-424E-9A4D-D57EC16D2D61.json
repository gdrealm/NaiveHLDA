These special cells have the capability to grow into many different types of other cells such as bone cells, cartilage cells and muscle cells. In order to do this, these cells need certain types of stimuli. One of these types of stimuli is mechanical force. Very little is known about how mechanical forces affect mesenchymal stem cells. This project aims to analyse in detail, the effects of three different types of mechanical force on these cells over time periods of ten minutes to two weeks. Different types of mechanical forces (such as fluid flowing over a cell or stretching a cell by growing it on a plastic membrane and then pulling the membrane) causes the cell to react and adapt differently to their environment. This project will identify how these cells react to each type and length of force application and ultimately what type of cell it will then be destined to grow into as a result of the force.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D000548/1","grantId":"BB/D000548/1","fundValue":"269849","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Harriet Cartmell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
