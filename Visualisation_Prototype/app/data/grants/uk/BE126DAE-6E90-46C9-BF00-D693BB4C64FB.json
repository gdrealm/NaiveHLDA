{"id":"BE126DAE-6E90-46C9-BF00-D693BB4C64FB","title":"The Detection of Ambivalence Toward Children with Implicit Measures","abstractText":"<p>Wealthy societies are confronted with a range of issues surrounding the status of children in society, including the roles of government, families, and law in childcare, education, and child protection. These and many other issues make it important to examine adult views of children. Consistent with evidence of institutional biases against children, it is plausible that the modern social context and evolutionary pressures cause people to associate children with feelings and beliefs that are both positive and negative. Moreover, people might not be conscious of this ambivalence. Across three large experiments, implicit measures of attitudes are used to test these predictions. Implicit measures can assess attitudes toward children indirectly, by accessing the automatic associations between children and positive and negative views about them. In each experiment, adult parents and adult non-parents will complete the implicit measures and a variety of self-report measures of attitudes toward children, relationship attitudes, and psychological well-being. Analyses will test whether any of the obtained correlations with the implicit measures of child attitudes are at least somewhat independent of correlations with the explicit measures of child attitudes.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0548","grantId":"RES-062-23-0548","fundValue":"177917","fundStart":"2007-09-15","fundEnd":"2009-09-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gregory Richard Maio","coPersons":["Elspeth  Webb","Johan  Karremans"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
