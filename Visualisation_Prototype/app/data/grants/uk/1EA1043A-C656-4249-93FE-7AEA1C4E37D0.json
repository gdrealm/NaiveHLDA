{"id":"1EA1043A-C656-4249-93FE-7AEA1C4E37D0","title":"Brighton Fuse 'FuseBox' Knowledge Exchange Project","abstractText":"This project will:\n1. Create a new innovation curriculum at the creative and digital economy incubator Brighton Fusebox developed out of the Brighton Fuse Project. The curriculum will be directly informed by the main findings of that project which are that arts, humanities and design knowledge and expertise are major drivers in businesses in the Brighton creative and digital cluster. The development of the innovation curriculum will involve a new kind of knowledge exchange research connecting academic approaches to learning with entrepreneurial business strategies aimed at creating value. The work will involve academics observing and engaging in a range of ways in the day to day operations of the Fusebox and will include crowd sourced ideas generation, interviews and workshops with its members. The new curriculum can be applied in other incubator and related contexts but can also inform curriculum developments within arts and humanities education and research. The research represents a practical and applied way of exploring innovation, how it happens, and where academic expertise and insights can be instrumental in creating business value. Its knowledge exchange approach recognizes the importance of the cross-flow of insights from the new creative and digital business sector into the academy to enhance arts and humanities researchers' awareness of the importance and roles of their work in economy and society and different forms of creativity aimed at creating value within them. The informal, flexible and continuous learning enabled by the new economy are strong elements that can feed back into arts and humanities orientations and practices from the entrepreneurial work and culture of the Fusebox. The knowledge exchange approach will seek to mirror the peer to peer emphasis, experiential and playful dimensions of the creative and digital economy as a new environment for production and consumption as well as learning. In this way the new knowledge generated by the project is anticipated to potentially inform theory and practice in the academy as much as in the market place.\n2. Produce a commentary on developing effective models for engagement between the FuseBox and Higher Education including a critical analysis of current knowledge exchange approaches and reflections on how AHRC activities (research, hubs, events, etc) can more effectively support successful business activities in the SME creative and digital economy sector. This will enable those operating within and across the academy and business to see more clearly how arts and humanities are supporting and driving the creative and digital economy. \n3. Prepare a report on the FuseBox for the AHRC which compliments and enhances the work of the Brighton Fuse project to develop understanding of the fusion of knowledge, skills and capabilities that creative businesses need in a fast changing digital economy and the role of arts and humanities research collaborations in supporting and developing this. Outputs from the project will aim to fuse arts and humanities and innovative business knowledge and skill sets and will generate new or adapted concepts and language reflecting such fusion to feed into current debates about digital literacy relevant to wider focus on innovation not only in Research Councils UK but also key agencies such as the Technology Strategy Board. This focus addresses the transition from an industrial to a creative and digital economy and new understandings of the material world in networked intelligent and big data contexts. Outputs from the project will link to this focus and illustrate how arts and humanities perspectives feed into thinking about the Internet of Everything and the social and cultural transformations it entails.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L504014/1","grantId":"AH/L504014/1","fundValue":"78798","fundStart":"2014-02-03","fundEnd":"2015-04-02","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Gillian  Youngs","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
