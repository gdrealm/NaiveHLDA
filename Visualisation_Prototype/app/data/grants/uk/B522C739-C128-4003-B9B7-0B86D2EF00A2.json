In spintronics the quantum-mechanical angular momentum, or spin, of the electron is used as a two-state variable for encoding, transporting, manipulating, and sensing digital information. Since the advent of spintronics hard disk readback sensors evolved through several generations of `magnetoresistance' technology. Magnetoresistance describes a large change in electrical resistance in response to a magnetic field which encodes data onto the disk. The current state-of-the-art device is a planar structure consisting of two magnetic layers separated by an insulating layer less than 1 nm thick, with sensing properties determined by the detailed physical layer structuring of the device, and its constituent materials, at an atomic level - the crystalline structure is key to the functionality. However, the ever-increasing data storage density demanded for modern applications means that this technology is nearing its limit. Further improving this technology to accommodate data density beyond 1 Tb/sq-in requires smaller devices and lower device resistances, in order that the head may sense smaller data bits at a higher data throughput. Achieving both of these goals together necessitates reduction in the thickness of the insulating layer. As this layer is only a few atoms thick in state-of-the-art devices, this will soon no longer be possible; the rapid increase in digital data storage density demanded by technologically advanced society can no longer continue unless a new sensor technology is developed. A novel candidate technology has been suggested, based upon theoretical prediction of novel physics - quantum-coherent spin-dependent electron scattering resulting in the `quasimomentum-filtered giant magnetoresistance' (QF-GMR) effect. QF-GMR also depends intimately on the atomic scale structure of a hybrid device, now consisting of two magnetic layers, separated by a nanoscale non-magnetic spacer, and deposited onto an engineered semiconductor electrode; it is the logical next-generation spintronic device paradigm. Electrons emitted from the semiconductor have constrained lateral wavevector, or quasimomentum, due to the low semiconductor carrier density. This `filtered' quasimomentum results in strongly spin-selective transmission across the structure, producing orders-of-magnitude larger magnetoresistance. The absence of an insulating layer reduces the device resistance sufficiently for increasing data density; readback sensors based on QF-GMR should enable the continued increase in digital data storage density for years to come - 'more-Moore' improvement, continuing Moore's law. In addition to readback heads there are many areas of technology where devices based on QF-GMR may find application; potentially providing 'more-than-Moore' performance gains via novel functionality or architectures. Efficient microwave and spin-wave generation for 'magnonic' computing, spin-transfer torque diodes for sensitive radio-frequency current detection, and novel metallic devices based on quantum-well resonances are such potential applications. So-far no experimental demonstration of the predicted QF-GMR effect exists. This project primarily aims to provide such a demonstration, gain further understanding of the novel physics behind the QF-GMR, and advance sensor devices based on QF-GMR from theory toward future technological application. This research will demonstrate that QF-GMR devices may be a cost-effective solution to the problems in increasing data storage density which the hard disk industry will soon face, and also for future memory, radio-frequency and spin-wave communications and processing technologies based on quantum-wells and spin-transfer torque.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L000121/1","grantId":"EP/L000121/1","fundValue":"93149","fundStart":"2014-01-31","fundEnd":"2016-01-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Aidan Thomas Hindmarch","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" So far we have developed instrumentation to examine crystal structure of nanometer-thick films during a technologically relevant vacuum fabrication process.
