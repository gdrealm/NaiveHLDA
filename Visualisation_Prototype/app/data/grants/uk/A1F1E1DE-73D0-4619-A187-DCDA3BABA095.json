{"id":"A1F1E1DE-73D0-4619-A187-DCDA3BABA095","title":"Book entitled: Creative Etruscans: Pottery, Imagery and Society","abstractText":"Etruscan pottery has both aesthetic and archaeological importance. It embraces a wide variety of fabrics and decorative techniques. No book in any language has fully presented its whole range in the period of Etruscan civilization of c. 675-275BC. This study will concentrate on the fine wares but will also take in coarse wares where appropriate.\\n\\nIndividual sections of the study will deal with the history of excavation and collecting and the early confusion of Greek and Etruscan products, and the development of incised, relief and painted wares. Of particular importance and innovation will be chapters on the themes chosen for representation, both imported and local, on the shapes (and their Etruscan names) and their functions; on international trade; and on the contexts in which pottery has been found: sanctuaries, tombs and sites of habitation.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E004911/1","grantId":"AH/E004911/1","fundValue":"31080","fundStart":"2008-02-06","fundEnd":"2008-06-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Tom  Rasmussen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
