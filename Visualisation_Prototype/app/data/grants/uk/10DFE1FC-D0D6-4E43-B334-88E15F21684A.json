These diseases affect many of the crops we depend on for food, such as wheat, rice, barley, potatoes, and important fruits and vegetables. To control crop diseases, farmers currently plant new crop varieties which have been selectively bred to be disease-resistant, or spray their crops with modern systemic fungicides. Neither of these control measures are completely effective, however. Disease-resistant crop varieties are normally overcome by disease within 2-3 growing seasons, and fungicides are expensive, can be environmentally damaging, and fungi tend to develop resistance to new chemicals very quickly. Because of these problems, we need to think of new ways to control plant diseases. These new disease-control measures will have to be environmentally safe, economically viable and above all, highly effective. To develop new disease-control strategies for curing plant diseases, we first need to understand the biology of the fungal agents that cause plant diseases. This project is concerned with understanding the biology of rice blast disease, which destroys enough rice every year to feed 60 million people. The aim of research n my laboratory is to understand this disease and the fungus that causes it and to develop control strategies to fight the disease. The thread-like cells formed by the fungus that causes rice blast are very effective at colonising plant tissues and can do so without the plant immune system being immediately activated. When fungal pathogens invade living plant tissue, we believe that they secrete proteins that help them to evade the plant's defences, alter plant cell signalling, and subvert plant metabolism. Identifying these fungal proteins, and understanding the process of fungal secretion during rice blast disease, are important aims of this project. If we can understand the fungal secretory process and how it functions during plant infection and induction of the plant's defence reactions, then this will provide a means of potentially controlling the spread of the disease","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E005195/1","grantId":"BB/E005195/1","fundValue":"307078","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas Jose Talbot","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" The most significant achievement of this project was the demonstration that the Magnaporthe oryzae P-type ATPase, Mg Apt2, is involved in polarised exocytosis during appressorium-mediated plant infection and plays a role in elaborating penetration and invasive hyphae. We demonstrated that P-type ATPase activity of MgApt2 was essential for its biological function and found evidence for its involvement in effector delivery during host cell colonization. We extended this study to examine the spatial organisation of the polarisome, a group of proteins that are responsible for co-ordination of polarised growth, and the exocyst, responsible for exocytosis. Interestingly, the spatial organisation of these complexes differs markedly between vegetative hyphae and invasive hyphae, showing that the molecular control of fungal growth during plant infection is distinct from normal saprotrophic growth. This is an exciting discovery that will be published in the near future in a high profile journal. Two other publications are planned from the project and data contributed to a publication in PNAS in 2009 on infection-associated autophagy.\n\n\n\nThe specific objectives of the project were:\n\n1. To determine whether Avr-Pi-ta is delivered to plant cells in an MgApt2-dependent manner\n\nWe constructed an AvrPi-ta-GFP gene fusion to test this idea and showed that the avirulence protein appeared to be secreted sub-apically from invasive hyphae during plant infection and that this did not occur in a _mgapt2 background. However, we were not able to discern whether this was due to the role of MgApt2, or the fact that the gene was so pivotal in development of invasive strructures. We also examined Avr-Pii-GFP, Avr-Pia-GFP and two other effector gene fusions and showed their spatial patterns of secretion during plant infection. We were able to demonstrate that these were distinct from the normal sites of polarized exocytosis, consistent with a different form of secretion operating during plant infection. We are carrying out final experiments with more components of the exocyst (Sec4, Sec6) to verify this result before publication. Objective met.\n\n2. To determine the function of MgApt2 in trans-Golgi network function in M. grisea\n\nWe used site-directed mutagenesis to generate an allele of MgApt2 encoding a protein lacking P-type ATPase activity and showed that this necessary for plant infection. We localized MgApt2 to the Golgi using a GFP fusion. We also functionally characterized MgApt1, MgApt3, and Pde1 and showed that they have overlapping function in Golgi function and in the plasma membrane. There were no endocytic defects associated with these proteins. Objective partially met.\n\n3. To identify the cargo of secretory vesicles in the MgApt2-dependent secretion pathway\n\nWe carried out proteomic analysis of developmental mutants of M. oryzae, including _mgapt2, during plant infection and have characterized 600 proteins associated with appressorium-mediated plant infection. Many of these are likely cargo proteins, which is currently under investigation. We have been carrying out systematic gene deletion studies of 50 of the corresponding genes, many of which are predicted to encode effector proteins, and will shortly publish this large-scale experiment. Objective met, but through an alternative strategy. This research is fundamental research that is being further exploited in current work funded by the European Research Council and the Halpin Trust.
