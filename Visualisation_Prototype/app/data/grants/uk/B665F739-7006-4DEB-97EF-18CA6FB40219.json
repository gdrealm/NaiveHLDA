Success in this area will bring direct benefits to patients, economic relief to the NHS and taxpayer, and will provide significant opportunity for industries who take up the challenge of producing organs to order. \n\nExisting work in the biotech industries has centred mainly on making clinical grade stem cells and setting them up to make specific tissues. The gap between cultures of stem cells, which are essentially un-arranged, and the highly intricate anatomical arrangements of complex organs such as kidney remains unbridged. Until the gap is bridged, stem cells will be of only very limited practical use for patients with serious organ failures.\n\nWe have recently developed and published a novel engineering technique for turning a simple suspension of individual foetal stem cells into a 'mini-kidney', essentially identical to a real foetal kidney except that it has no blood system. We now propose to engineer in a blood system, and to test the ability of our engineered kidneys to filter blood and excrete substances as a normal kidney would. We also propose to test how robust our method is (how well it corrects errors automatically, as we expect it to).\n\nThe direct impact of this project will be to provide an engineering technique by which kidney stem cells can be used to build real organs, potentially useful for transplants. In addition, we expect our technique to be applicable to other organs and tissues, so it may have a much broader impact in the general area of biological engineering.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K010735/1","grantId":"MR/K010735/1","fundValue":"364700","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jamie  Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
