At the forefront of these developments has been the ability to trap, cool and control dilute atomic alkali gases. Over the course of just ten years, experimentalists have achieved several significant milestones including atomic and molecular Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), Fermi condensation, and the crossover between the two. At the same time, in the field of semi-conductor quantum optics, experimentalists have reported the first signatures of quantum degeneracy in polariton (coupled exciton-light) systems providing evidence for BEC in the solid state environment. Motivated by these developments, we have proposed a complementary programme of research which addresses and exploits novel aspects of coherence and condensation phenomena in these systems ranging from studies of non-equilibrium and mesoscopic phenomena, as a separate part of the programme, we have proposed a project on wave propagation in open random media and its application to the problem of wireless communication.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E018130/1","grantId":"EP/E018130/1","fundValue":"459419","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research has been cited by other researchers working in the field.

In particular, we have investigated the correlation of Bose-Einstein condensates to a cavity light field. This work has particular application to ultracold atom systems confined to a cavity, a system known as cavity QED. This work may have application to the generation of devices for quantum computation. The work has been disseminated through scientific publications. Education,Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
