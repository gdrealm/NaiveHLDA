{"id":"3FB49376-BF43-48C9-A457-3F0D8424C47A","title":"The Politicisation of AIDS Activism in Tanzania","abstractText":"<p>This research aims to increase our understanding of the interplay of stigma and violence, HIV-positive status, and AIDS activism in Sub-Saharan Africa and beyond. The research will examine how everyday violence and stigma shapes and impacts on a) the experience of participation in AIDS activism in Tanzania, and b) organisations of people living with HIV/AIDS and their involvement in responses to AIDS. The relationship between organisations of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) and local, regional, national and international governmental as well as nongovernmental partners, benefactors, and policy makers is central to this research.</p>\n\n<p>Participatory and ethnographic methods will be used to examine the dynamics between personal testimony and collective experience. Being part of the Non-Governmental Public Action research programme, this research will contribute to theoretical development and empirical knowledge with regard to AIDS activism, stigma, and violence, and will directly feed into local and global AIDS activist networks.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E006744/1","grantId":"ES/E006744/1","fundValue":"158018","fundStart":"2006-11-16","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jenny  Pearce","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bradford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
