Renaissance Italian thinkers in particular began to portray the Ottoman state as a faceless, featureless and essentially timeless set of institutions in which human agency played a minimal role. The proposed study intends to restore the human face to the Ottoman polity by examining the ways that family and personal networks (both dyanstic and province-centred) influenced the distribution and sharing power in the Ottoman state.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112629/1","grantId":"112629/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rhoads  Murphey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
