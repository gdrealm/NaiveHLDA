As cells divide, their chromosomes must be copied and correctly positioned in the two new daughter cells. Incorrect copying or positioning can result in genetic disease, aging or cancer. We plan to study how cells ensure that copying occurs correctly and is not impeded by DNA damage. To do this, we will purposefully break chromosomes using DNA palindromes or damage chromosomes using repetitive DNA and visualise repair under the microscope as well as at the level of the DNA molecule itself. We also plan to understand how the cell positions the two new chromosomes as the cell divides. For this purpose, we will need to identify components of the protein machinery that separates and positions chromosomes and will do so by isolating mutants with incorrectly positioned chromosomes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901622","grantId":"G0901622","fundValue":"1750220","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Leach","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
