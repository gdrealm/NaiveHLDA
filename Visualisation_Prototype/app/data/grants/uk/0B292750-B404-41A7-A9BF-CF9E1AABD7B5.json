{"id":"0B292750-B404-41A7-A9BF-CF9E1AABD7B5","title":"Doing and Sharing Criminal Wrongs","abstractText":"Establishing when a person has done or shared in a criminal wrong can involve complexity and uncertainty arising from the current state of the law relating to principal offenders, accomplices, inciters and conspirators. In order to reduce complexity and uncertainty, a broader view of when it can be said that one person has causally influenced the conduct of another person will be advocated and justified. This will allow a more straightforward account of doing and sharing in wrongs, replacing the current law, leading to a more elegant and useful scheme of wrongdoing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112740/1","grantId":"112740/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"George  Sullivan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
