{"id":"E6AE2186-1BD5-4407-A3C7-CC3D444584B9","title":"Code Acts in Education: Learning through code, learning to code","abstractText":"<p>Computer software is interwoven with contemporary collective life. The significance of computer software, and the codes and algorithmic processes in which it is written and programmed to act, is particularly vivid from an educational perspective. Technically, code instructs software how to act, but as code increasingly comes to saturate our world, as an invisible presence in everyday life, it also instructs people to do things. Code acts back on us as the lessons written down in the languages of computer programming, and as an algorithmic curriculum instructing us in new ways of thinking and acting.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Code Acts in Education seminar series focuses on education as a specific field in which the problems associated with code are now part of an emerging public policy agenda and media debate. Over a series of six events, the seminar series will provide a critical exploration of computer code in order to build greater public awareness of its influence on how we act, think, and conduct ourselves, and to inform and augment the existing debate about the importance of teaching children and young people to be able to program and understand computer code.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001160/1","grantId":"ES/L001160/1","fundValue":"29702","fundStart":"2013-11-04","fundEnd":"2015-11-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ben Patrick Williamson","coPersons":["Si√¢n  Bayne","Richard  Edwards","Tara  Fenwick"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
