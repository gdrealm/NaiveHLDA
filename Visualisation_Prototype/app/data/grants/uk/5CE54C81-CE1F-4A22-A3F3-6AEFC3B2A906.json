Whilst it has been widely recognised that the lives of many AS/R are characterised by high unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and destitution there is no robust research documenting their experiences of forced labour and the reasons why they may be engaged in it, despite much anecdotal evidence that AS/R are touched by forced labour. </p>\n\n<p>The concept of precarity (ie lived experiences that are characterised by uncertainty and instability) will be used to help understand the key factors and processes that render AS/R vulnerable to forced labour. </p>\n\n<p>A range of qualitative methods will be used from socio-legal mapping, interviews with key informants working with agencies and in-depth semi-structured interviews with AS/R themselves. Findings will be disseminated to policy makers, users and academic and migrant audiences.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2895","grantId":"RES-062-23-2895","fundValue":"178213","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Louise  Waite","coPersons":["Peter  Dwyer","Stuart  Hodkinson"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
