{"id":"EDFDAE80-8DCE-4DAD-A586-7C16F8B7EBE7","title":"Concrete and Culture","abstractText":"Within little over a century, concrete has become the most widespread construction material, found in almost all parts of the world. Annual production of concrete is now second only to that of water. While the consequences for construction are reasonably well understood, the consequences for culture have barely been considered. This historical study investigates the global implications, for culture, for social relations, and for the environment, of this very rapid introduction of a wholly new medium into everyday life.\\n Hitherto, almost all research into concrete has concentrated upon its technical aspects, or been concerned with the take-up of new techniques and processes. Some work has been done on the way individual architects and engineers interpreted the new medium, but very little attention has been given to the reception of concrete outside architecture and engineering circles. The present study aims to redress this, and make clear that the use of concrete is not limited to architects and engineers, but includes politicians, artists, writers, photographers and film-makers, whose interpretations have been no less significant than those of the form-giving professions. \\n While architects and engineers have been passionately enthusiastic about concrete, because of the constructional freedoms it has made possible, the medium has been less well received by the general public. The discrepancy between professional enchantment and popular indifference - or hostility - has been a recurring feature of concrete, and one not to be dismissed, but incorporated into any account of the medium. The study is not an apology for concrete, but acknowledges its repulsiveness at the same time as recognising the benefits achieved through it.\\n This is a worldwide study of concrete as a global medium. The approach taken is that concrete is not only a substance, but also a process, requiring the combination of natural resources, human labour and human ingenuity. Variations in the way these elements have been combined at different times and places gives rise to substantial differences in the medium: contrary to what is often said, concrete is not the same everywhere. Likewise, whether for reasons of cultural tradition or political ideology, concrete is not perceived equally everywhere. Through investigations of the medium in various different parts of the world / Italy, Brazil, Japan, USA, USSR - the study explores how concrete has both erased, but sometimes contributed to, the establishment of geographical identities. \\n Within the practices of architecture and engineering, concrete has called into question a number of conventional aesthetic principles. The use of concrete has only been reconciled with these articles of professional belief through the production of various myths, such as the recurrent view that concrete has no history but only a future. A major theme of the study is to explore the origins and persistence of some of the many myths attaching to concrete.\\n Contrasting with most existing historical studies, which tend to focus on the earlier, pre-1939 development of the medium, the emphasis of the project is on concrete after 1945, since when the extent of its use, and its impact on social and cultural life, has been greatest. \\n Recent revival of the architectural use of exposed concrete makes the present study timely. Current works of architecture reveal different approaches to concrete (such as use for purely decorative, as distinct from structural, purposes) that call into question some of the assumptions and prejudices previously adhering to concrete.\\n Ambitious, and necessarily selective, the aim is not new in-depth knowledge about concrete, but rather to reflect upon the cultural questions that its superabundant presence raise for us. The future of the medium, and of historical and critical debate about it,relies upon knowing better what it is/and at present no such comprehensive account exists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G005486/1","grantId":"AH/G005486/1","fundValue":"31888","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John Adrian Forty","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
