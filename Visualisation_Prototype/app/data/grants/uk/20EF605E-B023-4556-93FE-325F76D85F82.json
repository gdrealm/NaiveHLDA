Pharmaceutical companies spend billions of pounds ensuring newly developed drugs are safe. This process is extremely expensive because there are many steps involved in this assessment, e.g. testing for toxic side effects. Because the liver is the body's main processing factory for drugs, side effects on the liver a major focus of safety testing. Accodringly, before these 'candidate' drugs can proceed to early clinical trials in humans, scientists perform drug testing either in animals or in the laboratory - in culture dishes containing liver cells.\n\nThese tests involve seeing if the drug is processed by the liver normally, without any side-effects, or if there is measurable damage to the liver tissue. The liver is the largest internal organ in the body, containing billions of specialized liver cells, called hepatocytes, which are responsible for over 500 metabolic and detoxification functions. Liver damage caused by toxic drug by-products can be very serious and even lead to death.\n\nThe best liver cells to use in the lab for drug testing are normal human hepatocytes, isolated from donor human livers. Unfortunately the shortage of human donor organs means very few livers are available for this purpose. As such scientists are developing and exploiting other types of hepatocytes for use in the lab. Drug companies often use rodent hepatocytes for drug toxicity testing. However, due to differences between species, data from any drug toxic effects are not exactly the same as in human liver, potentially missing unsafe side-effects before human drug trials. In addition, human 'immortalized' cell lines are used (hepatocytes derived from sick liver tissue) which are very easy to grow and use for testing in the lab. However, again these cells do not function as healthy hepatocytes do in the liver and therefore, like animal liver data, can fail to predict potential drug-induced liver toxicity. Pharmaceutical companies are therefore constantly searching for other types of hepatocytes for use in drug toxicity testing.\n\nIn our project, we will use a novel type of human liver cell line called 'HepaRG'. These cells are special because they form two types of liver cells in lab culture dishes: Hepatocytes plus supporting cells called 'cholangiocytes'. This is very important since as in your own liver, hepatocytes perform best when they are in contact with their neighbours. This actually allows HepaRG cells to perform many biochemical and detoxification functions very similar to the normal human hepatocytes mentioned earlier.\n\nOur main aim in this project is to use HepaRG cells to develop a human 'liver-on-a-chip' device for rapid safety testing of drugs. Scientists know that in the liver, hepatocytes actually respond also to their microscopic environment - even at the nanoscale (one millionth of the thickness of a human hair) - to function better. In our lab, we have shown that cells cultured on special 'nano-patterned' culture slides respond to this environment by changing or even improving their functional properties or rate of growth.\n\nUsing different nano-scale patterns we will test many slides to find the pattern which best supports and improves hepatocyte function and appearance. Using the best, or optimal nano-patterned slides, we will then test these using a range of drugs, which are known to be toxic to the liver, to see if they respond in a manner similar to normal human hepatocytes.\n\nUsing this information, will then allow us to combine the best nano-patterns into a novel 'BioChip' device, which is compatible with rapid (robotic) drug toxicity testing using special automated cell imaging techniques. Liver BioChips could then be used to test drug safety, reduce drug development costs and specifically reduce the use of animals in drug research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L023687/1","grantId":"BB/L023687/1","fundValue":"242981","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Hayes","coPersons":["Steven Douglas Morley"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
