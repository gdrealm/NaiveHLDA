{"id":"CD13BC1B-CCDE-4A1D-9B89-9BB2E7CC51B7","title":"Using cell surface antigens for the isolation of human photoreceptor precursor cells for retinal stem cell therapy","abstractText":"Diseases of the retina resulting in the death of the light-sensing photoreceptor cells are the leading cause of blindness in the developed world. These conditions affect 1 in 3000 people from birth and more than 10% of the ageing population. They are currently untreatable and irreversible. We recently demonstrated in proof-of-concept experiments in mice that replacing lost photoreceptors by cell transplantation is a feasible clinical treatment strategy. We discovered that by transplanting immature photoreceptor cells, these cells can make new functional photoreceptors in the diseased retina, and restore some visual function. To translate our findings to a human therapy we need to isolate equivalent human photoreceptor precursors from stem cell cultures grown in the laboratory. New three-dimensional retinal culture methods can produce large numbers of new retinal cells. Our hypothesis is that photoreceptor cells generated from these stem cell cultures will be effective and safe for human therapy provided they are treated so that they reach exactly the right stage in a cell culture dish and provided only these correctly-staged cells are transplanted. One critical challenge therefore is developing methods to identify and collect correctly-staged human cells to transplant into the diseased retina. We will develop live cell sorting methods using antibodies that bind to special markers on the surface of the immature photoreceptor cells providing a tag to isolate them with. The efficacy of isolated cells for retinal repair will be tested in transplantation experiments in animal models of retinal disease. This study will develop cell isolation protocols for human photoreceptor precursor cells, which is a requisite step towards development of clinical trials for incurable retinal diseases causing blindness.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M015688/1","grantId":"MR/M015688/1","fundValue":"825710","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane C Sowden","coPersons":["Robin Raihan Ali"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
