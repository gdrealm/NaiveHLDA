Its chronological span covers the era of the first post-Roman, 'Western European Union' under the Carolingian Frankish kings, to the 'Feudal' Age of the Plantagenet Empire and Capetian France. The project represents the final publication stage of four years of research, funded predominantly by the British Academy. It brings to an English-speaking audience, for the first time, the results of a comparative review of recent archaeological research on the period from the 7th to 13th centuries AD in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and northern Germany and Denmark, alongside new material from the British Isles. In the light of this review, and new survey and excavation data conducted by the author and others, existing 'grand narrative' explanations of social change produced by archaeologists, mainly from the Anglo-American world, are re-assessed.\\n\\nAnalysis proceeds on the basis of thematic chapters, divided into two chronological periods: firstly, between AD 600 and 900; and secondly, between AD 900 and 1200. The themes can be summarised as follows:\\n\\n-From Late Antique to Feudal Europe: past perspectives and new directions\\n\\n-Northwest Europe from Late Antiquity to 'Western European Union' under the Carolingians, AD 350-800: New discoveries\\n\\n-The rural world, AD 600-900: Lifestyles, identities and hierarchical social relations\\n\\n-Central places and exchange in northwest Europe, AD 600-900: dispelling some myths\\n\\n-Place, role and world view, AD 600-900\\n\\n-Scandinavian, Arab and Central Asian influence, AD 650-1050\\n\\n-Transformation of horizons in the rural world, AD 900-1200\\n\\n-Townscapes as catalysts for social change, AD 900-1200\\n\\n-Plantagenet, Capetian and Salian Europe and the creation of western Christendom, AD 900-1200.\\n\\nA series of strands is explored, running through most of the thematic chapters. These comprise consideration of lifestyles, reflections of identity and group affiliation, social relations, sense of place, and catalysts for social change within each particular social and chronological environment analysed. Pursuit of these strands is based on integrated analysis of material culture profiles, derived from structural, artefact and biological remains.\\n\\nThe end result of the project will be a book that confronts existing 'top-down' models of social evolution and control, based on textually-led and anthropological frameworks, with results of new, detailed research at regional and local levels, and from specific topographical and social situations. Thus, the long-assumed role of elites in promoting social change is balanced and challenged alongside the archaeological evidence for stimuli from more poorly studied 'actors' and dynamic groups, within and beyond the boundaries of northwest Christendom, between AD 600 and 1200.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E000495/1","grantId":"AH/E000495/1","fundValue":"22271","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Paul Loveluck","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
