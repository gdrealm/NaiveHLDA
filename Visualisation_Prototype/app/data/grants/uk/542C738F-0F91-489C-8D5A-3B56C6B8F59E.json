In order to diversify their functions, proteins use additional molecules called cofactors, of which there are many types. Heme is one such cofactor; it is an organic chemical with an iron atom in the centre and has many essential functions in different cellular processes. Many proteins that contain heme undergo a process after they are made in the cell in which bonds are formed between the protein and the heme; these are called cytochromes c and are essential in respiration and in reactions that involve the transfer of electrons. In animal cells there are two c-type cytochrome molecules which are both found in the mitochondria. These cytochromes play a key role underpinning the mitochondrion's role as the powerhouse of the cell. Additionally, one of these cytochromes c can be released from the mitochondrion under certain conditions as a trigger for the process of programmed cell death. In other cases, heme associates with proteins without forming bonds with them, for example in hemoglobin, which uses the heme to bind oxygen in blood. In the case where the heme cofactor becomes bonded to the cytochrome, other proteins are needed to assist in this reaction, which is not spontaneous. In animals a single protein speeds up the covalent attachment of heme to protein to give a cytochrome c. Our proposed research seeks to understand how this protein functions, using a variety of experimental approaches and techniques. It is also important to understand the process of making cytochromes c as a fundamental and central biological process, in order to complete a description of the essential biochemical reactions that constitute life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H017887/1","grantId":"BB/H017887/1","fundValue":"371575","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The grant has only just finished and so the use of the findings has yet to be seen.

","person":"Stuart John  Ferguson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" A protein called cytochrome c is vital for animal respiration. It contains a smaii molecule called heme that is covalently bound to the protein. How it becomes covalently bound has been a matter of conjecture. We have shown that the enzyme that catalyses the attachment recognised just a small part (a few residues in the N-terminal region) of the apo-cytochrome (the protein before the heme is attached). We have also shonw that other features of the protein long assumed to be important for attachement of heme are unimportant. We have also identified a pivotal intermediate in cytochrome c assembly in bacteria Despite the work of our competitor in the USA we are still some way from understanding how heme is attacehd to proreins in c-type cytochrome biogenesis. Both the USA competitor and other reserch groups in the field will use our findings to guide their furture research. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
