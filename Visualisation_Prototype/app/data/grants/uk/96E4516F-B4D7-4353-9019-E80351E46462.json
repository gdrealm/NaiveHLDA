Cochlear implantation (CI) has been shown to facilitate the development of spoken language and there are now claims that children with implants also find the process of learning to read and spell more straightforward. However, findings about literacy have been inconsistent, and the main aim of this project is to carry out a systematic study of attainment. The study will focus on reading and spelling ability among adolescents, since a key issue is whether reported early successes in literacy are sustained until school-leaving age. Reading levels will be assessed using standardised tests and a picture-spelling test will assess spelling. Comparisons will be made between CI users implanted early in life and those implanted later and also between CI users and users of conventional hearing aids. The project will also investigate reading strategies in these groups to see if they differ, using lexical decision tasks in which participants make speeded judgements about whether strings of letters form an English word. Comparisons will also be made with the performance of hearing children who are reading at a similar level.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2947","grantId":"RES-000-22-2947","fundValue":"79602","fundStart":"2009-01-05","fundEnd":"2010-03-04","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret  Harris","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
