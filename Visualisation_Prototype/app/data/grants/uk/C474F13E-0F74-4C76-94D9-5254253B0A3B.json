Using time series modelling, the project will chart these trends generally as well as exploring the impact of the growing existence and tolerance of economic inequalities since the 1970s on a range of key processes related to crime (such as, for example, popular sentiments towards the treatment of offenders).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006398/1","grantId":"ES/K006398/1","fundValue":"262405","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Farrall","coPersons":["Colin  Hay","William  Jennings"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
