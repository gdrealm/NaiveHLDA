{"id":"8ED33190-A088-4526-BB70-E489C7BBD8D8","title":"Medieval Song Network","abstractText":"The basis of the Medieval Song Network is the recognition that the study of medieval song requires input from a wide range of academic disciplines as well as from performers who communicate the music to contemporary audiences. When they were written down, medieval songs were rarely gathered together in 'song-books' but occupied a remarkable array of manuscript contexts, from books of sermons and devotional writing, books on law and medicine, romances, historical and political texts, to courtly anthologies of prose and verse. Even investigating medieval song in its written forms, then, requires expertise from a wide spectrum of scholars in languages and literature, music, history and art history. Going beyond the written sources to the original performance traditions and sound-worlds of medieval song involves further specialist attempts to bring them to life from various kinds of descriptive and pictorial evidence.\\nThis project aims to bring together researchers who often work in isolation, to pool knowledge and share ideas, and to generate new research initiatives that will enable research in medieval song to be carried out in richer, more efficient, interdisciplinary collaborations. Communication between members will be carried out through an email discussion list, through newsletters and postings on the group's website, and through three events which will enable face-to-face contact. The first two events will be scholarly workshops, spaced a year apart, to generate proposals for specific research projects and to develop them further with the unique benefits of wide consultation across the group. The third event will be performance-based, in which specialist performers of early music will build on the research in progress to present a programme of medieval song to a public audience. Feedback from the performers and audience will lead to further discussions in the ongoing communications of the Network.\\nThe project will focus initially on medieval song in England, which raises a number of specific problems that the group will be well placed to address. Most importantly, medieval England was a tri-lingual society, and songs were written in Latin, French and English. Manuscripts regularly contain songs in all three languages, and numerous translations of songs between languages were also made. Much earlier work on songs has been divided up along linguistic lines, creating artificial divisions between the experiences of medieval audiences and readers. The Network will facilitate the sharing of literary expertise in different languages that is necessary to understand this significant literary-musical culture. Numerous connections between England and the Continent in the domain of song can also be traced though, and the Network aims to go on to explore these connections further, marshalling its uniquely comprehensive body of expertise to make possible cross-disciplinary, international collaboration that has never before been attempted. \\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I000232/1","grantId":"AH/I000232/1","fundValue":"36840","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ardis Ruth Butterfield","coPersons":["Helen  Deeming"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
