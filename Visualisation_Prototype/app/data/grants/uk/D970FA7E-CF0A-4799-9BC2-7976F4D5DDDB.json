In a more indirect way, social processes shaped by African actors are generating new areas of interdependence between the continent and outside powers in the form of 'new' transnational issues - migration, displacement, environmental degradation and health.</p>\n\n<p>This seminar series overturns the conventional approach to understanding Africa in international relations (which asks how external actors and events impact upon the continent) by asking instead how rising African activism in international politics impacts upon our understanding of the international system and the implications for the policies and decision-making processes of western powers and international institutions.</p>\n\n<p>The series looks at negotiation and diplomacy in trade, aid and climate change; new security threats; conflict resolution; and conceptual debates on agency and how smaller, less powerful states are accounted for in international relations theory over a range of seminars held in the UK and South Africa.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0810","grantId":"RES-451-26-0810","fundValue":"15962","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sophie  Harman","coPersons":["William  Brown"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
