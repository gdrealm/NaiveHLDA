{"id":"EA3A575A-FEBD-4019-9461-449BEAECC883","title":"Patron-Client Relationships and the Perfromance of Edinburgh Family Businesses and Business Families","abstractText":"<p>This study gives an historical and comparative perspective on family businesses and business families, examining the vertical relations of asymmetrical reciprocity (clientelism) among top ranked Edinburgh-based family firms through the post-war period. </p>\n\n<p>It compares the performance of family businesses which participate in a clientelistic network with that of others unengaged in such relations. Crucial to the analysis are the reasons found for high or low, stable or fluctuated performance of family businesses, and social reproduction or decline of business families over the post-war period and how both contribute to the growth of the Scottish economy.</p>\n\n<p>The study triangulates archival work in Companies House with findings from five key-informant interviews, oral history interviewing of thirty Edinburgh-based family businesses and three case studies of business families.</p>\n\n<p>The study seeks to investigate the extent of the emergence of a new type of clientelism in the post-industrial business family context performing an important function in the flow of societal resources and building a structural advantage across the lifecourse of family businesses. It also aims to offer an understanding of how new family relationships affect family business performance and to add to the debate on the competitiveness of family business in a global economy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2378-A","grantId":"RES-000-22-2378-A","fundValue":"56291","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Zografia  Bika","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
