Evaluating Micro-Enterprises in Adult Social Care","abstractText":"<p>Are care services best delivered through very small, locally-based services that are 'close to the user' or do large organisations offer more efficient and effective care? This project aims to test the relationship between size and performance in organisations providing adult social care to see if micro-enterprises outperform larger care providers in delivering:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>&nbsp;valued</li>\n\n <li>innovative</li>\n\n <li>personalised</li>\n\n <li>cost-effective services to users.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Using interviews and surveys with 108 people using services and carers in 27 case study organisations, across three English local authorities, this research will compare outcomes and value for money across micro, small, medium and large care providers (categorised by the number of staff working in them).The project will recruit and train people using services and carers as co-researchers, involved in research design, interviewing, data analysis and dissemination.</p>\n\n<p>The project aims to produce findings that are of direct relevance to local authorities, service users and other organisations as they commission care services, and to social entrepreneurs as they develop provision. It also aims to deepen social scientific knowledge of the relationship between organisational size and performance in welfare services, of relevance to academics working in fields such as social policy and public management.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002317/1","grantId":"ES/K002317/1","fundValue":"357581","fundStart":"2013-04-15","fundEnd":"2015-07-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Elizabeth Needham","coPersons":["Steve  McKay","Joanna Louise Ellins","Jon  Glasby","Kelly  Hall"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
