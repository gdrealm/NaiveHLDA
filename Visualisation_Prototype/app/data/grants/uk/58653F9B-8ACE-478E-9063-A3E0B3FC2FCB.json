{"id":"58653F9B-8ACE-478E-9063-A3E0B3FC2FCB","title":"Animal Welfare Research Network","abstractText":"Animal welfare is of high importance in the public mind; 34% of approximately 29,000 EU citizens rated the protection of welfare in farmed animals as being of the very highest importance (10 on a scale of 1-10). Within the UK, this proportion was even higher (38%) (EU 2007). This evident societal concern about animal welfare can lead to debates across society on a range of welfare related issues. However, decisions by government and other stakeholders for future directions need to be based on information that is as unbiased and objective as possible. This information comes from systematic and scientific animal welfare research. A strong and sustained animal welfare research community is thus essential to underpin well-informed decisions that maintain and improve welfare. \n\nThe UK has a strong tradition of animal welfare research that stretches back to the parliamentary Brambell Report on The Welfare of Animals Kept under Intensive Livestock Systems (Brambell 1965). The UK is at the forefront of animal welfare research and highly respected globally in the field, and both the main academic society for animal welfare scientists and the world's first animal welfare journal (Animal Welfare) have UK roots. Despite this success, the UK animal welfare research community, which is probably the largest of its kind in the world, is small compared to many other scientific disciplines, and a number of challenges and opportunities for welfare research have been identified, including: (i) the community being made up of many different, relatively small, specialised research groups, with differing ultimate aims and species of focus; (ii) the rise of mathematical and computational biology, and other scientific developments which present exciting prospects for animal welfare researchers; (iii) the increasing awareness of the mutual benefits of industry and stakeholder interaction and involvement in research and the discussion of future research strategy; (iv) an increasing focus on 'sustainable intensification' with its emphasis on increased production efficiency which presents both risks and opportunities for animal welfare research; (v) the need for more young academics to successfully establish themselves as lead investigators within the community and sustain the UK's leading role in the field; (vi) the existence of several key areas of research which have been relatively under-studied, unexplored or have yet further potential for exciting developments; (vii) a potential funding gap within UK animal welfare research as a result of decreases in Defra's funding of more strategic/ applied projects. \n\nThe AWRN will address these challenges and opportunities in order to realise its vision and meet its objectives through a series of activities and actions including: (i) a start-up meeting followed by 3 further annual meetings designed to bring the community together and use keynote speakers to stimulate discussion about topics of importance to the future of animal welfare research, and to generate research plans, networking, collaborations and funding opportunities; (ii) community-led workshops that focus on: topical areas of research (including interactions with other research disciplines); interactions with industry to identify research needs; and training of AWRN members and especially early career researchers (ECRs) in research and generic skills such as grant-writing; (iii) a website that acts as an information and communication hub for the Network community and highlights the strengths and qualities of UK animal welfare research to the general public and academic community; (iv) annually updated overviews of the UK animal welfare research landscape, associated gaps and opportunities, allowing future research priorities to be identified; (v) a network approach to supporting ECRs, including researcher-exchange and cross-institute PhD training and mentoring.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N010760/1","grantId":"BB/N010760/1","fundValue":"102279","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Mendl","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
