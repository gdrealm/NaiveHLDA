The new e-infrastructure, built on existing core systems, will support a multi-tier storage architecture for: efficient data access for local processing; secure on-site storage; high-speed file transfer to the end user, to public repositories (e.g. European Nucleotide Archive) and to cloud computing resources (e.g. Cloud Bio-Linux); and fast data upload to NBAF servers. The assets will consist of network and server-attached storage, and industry leading Aspera file transfer technology to deliver speeds many times faster than FTP or HTTP.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L01288X/1","grantId":"NE/L01288X/1","fundValue":"142112","fundStart":"2013-10-28","fundEnd":"2014-02-27","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Karim  Gharbi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" This award supported the development of an informatics platform for storing and sharing high-volume DNA sequencing data for the NERC research community.
