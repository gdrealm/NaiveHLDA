{"id":"7D4ACCDD-5F48-45C0-8438-E9D3DF3BF6F7","title":"New Directions in Materials Characterisation Using Vortex Electron Microscopy and Spectroscopy","abstractText":"I will advance the most profound development in electron microscopy in the past decade - the prospect of vortex electron microscopy and spectroscopy (VEMS) - to study chiral and magnetic devices. VEMS is a nascent technique that uses phase-plates to modulate the plane-wave beam of a standard electron microscope into a helical wavefront, the vorticity of which establishes orbital angular momentum in the microscope's probe. Unlike the well-studied orbital angular momentum states of light - the vortex's electronic charge imbues a tunable and quantised magnetic moment that provides a completely unexplored degree of freedom for diffraction and spectroscopy within the electron microscope. Thus far, international research has focused on the production of free electron vortex beams. My aim is to explore the interaction of these beams with samples developed during my fellowship. VEMS is intriguing principally because the new magnetic degree of freedom may impart sensitivity to magnetic and chiral media in scattering and diffraction, thereby enabling the study of material properties that have previously only been accessible at international x-ray or neutron facilities. For example, VEMS could yield unprecedented insight into magnetic and charge ordering at oxide interfaces and confer a genuine world lead in the characterisation of these technologically-relevant materials. In addition, I will explore the new direction of applying VEMS to the study of plasmonic metamaterials - devices with wide-ranging applications including bio-sensing and electromagnetic camouflage. The helical nature of the VEMS probe is expected to couple strongly to chiral electric fields established within metamaterials, producing a unique, spatially resolved characterisation tool that will yield new insights into metamaterial design. The project has the triple prospects of providing a new avenue of research, improving my international reputation and substantially enhancing our understanding of the materials already being explored in my fellowship. It capitalises on notable advantages in infrastructure and expertise at the University of Glasgow and will build new collaborative opportunities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L001969/1","grantId":"EP/L001969/1","fundValue":"244186","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Donald A MacLaren","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
