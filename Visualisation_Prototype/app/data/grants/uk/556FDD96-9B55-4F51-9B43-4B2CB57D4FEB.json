Arthropods are common throughout marine, freshwater, terrestrial, and even aerial environments. They include four groups: insects (e.g. flies and beetles), crustaceans (e.g. shrimps and lobsters), chelicerates (e.g. spiders and scorpions) and myriapods (e.g. millipedes and centipedes). There is a long-standing debate on the internal relationships of arthropods. Traditionally, myriapods were thought to be the closest relatives of insects. However, recent comparison of the sequences of similar genes in all arthropod groups resulted in a different hypothesis: insects are more closely related to crustaceans than to myriapods. Interestingly, data on the development of the nervous system in all four groups support this hypothesis and in addition even support a close relationship of chelicerates and myriapods. In contrast to insects and crustaceans, neural stem cells that divide and generate all the cells of the nervous system are absent in chelicerates and myriapods, rather, the area from which the nervous system develops consists of many more cells that directly develop into nerve cells. Despite these differences similar genes control the formation of the nervous system in insects, chelicerates and myriapods. However, their activity and function is adapted to the specific mode of nervous system formation. Crustaceans show the greatest diversity in shape and development among arthropods and therefore it is not clear if all crustacean groups share a common ancestor or if some groups, like the higher crustaceans (e.g. crabs, lobsters), are more closely related to insects while others are not. In addition, the similarities to insects have only been demonstrated in higher crustaceans. Except for two genes, neural development genes have not been identified in crustaceans yet. In the proposed project we will therefore analyse two representatives of crustaceans, the higher crustacean or malacostracan, Orchestia cavimana (a shrimp-like crustacean) and the basal branchiopod, Daphnia magna (a water flea). We will analyse the whole process of nervous system development from the generation of neural stem cells up to the formation of neural networks. On the one hand we will identify genes that are involved in the generation of neural stem cells and study their activity and function. On the other hand, we will verify if neural stem cells are present in the water flea and compare the number and positions of individual stem cells to Orchestia and to insects. Furthermore, we will analyse which nerve cells and support cells are generated by individual stem cells in both crustaceans by single cell labelling of neuroblasts that are adjacent to the ventral midline. In addition, this method will enable us to study the formation of neuronal networks, since the whole cell bodies including the long thin processes that connect individual nerve cells are labelled. The proposed project will (1) contribute substantially to our knowledge on crustacean neurogenesis, (2) contribute to the resolution of arthropod relationships and (3) contribute to the understanding in what way the developmental mechanisms leading to the formation of the nervous system have been modified during evolution in the individual arthropod groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F021909/1","grantId":"BB/F021909/1","fundValue":"414556","fundStart":"2008-05-19","fundEnd":"2011-11-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Angelika  Stollewerk","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
