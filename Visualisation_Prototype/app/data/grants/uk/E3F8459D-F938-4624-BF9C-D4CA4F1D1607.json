One of the tasks facing cognitive psychologists who study language is to understand what stages of processing occur when we recognise a word. Models of the processes that underlie word recognition are influenced heavily by experimental research, and one of the most robust findings is that frequently used words (e.g., &quot;house&quot;) are recognised faster than rare words (e.g., &quot;larch&quot;).\n\nBecause of its reliability, this &quot;frequency effect&quot; has played a central role in the development of models of word recognition. However, there is still disagreement over its exact nature, and recent studies have come to very different conclusions as to whether it reflects the earliest stages of word perception or is rather something which influences later processing, for example when we make a decision about whether or not a word is real.\n\nThis project ran a series of studies using a &quot;dual-task&quot; method. In all studies, participants performed two tasks in quick succession, with one of those tasks involving word recognition. There has been a recent interest among language researchers in using this technique because, by analysing the reaction times of the participant, it allows us to investigate the degree to which word recognition requires attention. Through manipulation of the frequency of the words presented, the technique was used to investigate the role of frequency at different stages of word recognition and the degree to which visual and spoken word recognition place demands on central attentional resources. \n\nThe objectives of the research were:\n(1) To examine the role that word frequency plays at different stages of word recognition, and the implications this has for current models of word recognition.\n(2) To investigate the extent to which word recognition places demands on central attentional resources and whether this differs for spoken and visual word recognition\n(3) To understand why word recognition studies in the existing literature have reached conflicting findings, and provide some reconciliation between them\n\nA clear pattern emerged across the five studies; word recognition was always influenced by frequency during the earliest stages of processing, and this was the case for both visual and spoken word recognition. However, we also found some additional evidence for a later role of frequency, influencing stages of word recognition associated with decision-making. These findings are consistent with models of word recognition that postulate an early locus for frequency effects, as long as these models can be modified to allow a later role in decisional processing as well. The findings also suggest that previous studies that appeared to show conflicting patterns of results may in fact have tapped into different aspects of the frequency effect. The findings will largely be of interest to people working in the field of psycholinguistics. For example, the PI and a new collaborator (Dr Graham Scott, University of West of Scotland) have developed the methods used to look at the processing of emotional language.
