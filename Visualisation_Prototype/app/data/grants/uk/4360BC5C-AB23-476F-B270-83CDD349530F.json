{"id":"4360BC5C-AB23-476F-B270-83CDD349530F","title":"Fundamental Implications of Fields, Strings and Gravity","abstractText":"Newtonian physics describes our universe well, provided the objects of interest are not too small, do not move too fast, or are not too dense. At a small length scales, Newtonian physics is replaced by quantum physics. In addition, if interactions involve speeds close to that of light, then quantum physics is replaced by quantum field theory (QFT). This theory is a milestone of scientific discovery and underpins all experimentally verified particles and interactions. The standard approach to QFT relies on perturbation theory, which assumes that all interactions are weak. There are many situations where that is not the case, and the resulting theory is said to be strongly coupled. In the theory underlying the standard model of particle physics the interactions are generally not weak. This prevents us from explaining phenomena such as the confinement of quarks to form the protons and neutrons that make up matter. This is a conceptual problem, and a major limitation for phenomenological applications.\n\nWhat about if we are dealing with extremely dense objects? For example, if all of the matter inside the Earth were compressed to fill a sphere with a radius of a few millimetres, then the above theories would break down. In this case, one would need to incorporate Einstein's theory of general relativity with quantum field theory. However, there is no completely consistent way to do this, leaving a gaping hole in our understanding of the universe. \n\nThe only theory that successfully combines QFT with general relativity is string theory. Self-consistency of the theory demands stringent mathematical conditions be imposed. For example, there must exist six extra spatial dimensions in addition to the three spatial dimensions we are accustomed to. To resolve this, one must ``compactify'', i.e. posit that the extra dimensions span curled geometries, not visible to present day experiment. A rough analogy is with a hose: from a distance it looks one-dimensional, but on closer inspection there is an additional circular direction. Describing the physics of the observable universe becomes a problem closely tied to the geometry of certain spaces.\n\nRemarkably, string theory has led to new ideas concerning the description of strongly coupled QFTs. One such tool, known as holography, represents the idea that our space-time encodes information of a higher dimensional one, much like a hologram is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional picture. It turns out that the strongly coupled QFT in four-dimensions relates to a weakly coupled five-dimensional gravity theory in which we may apply perturbative techniques to perform computations. Over the past decade, this idea has led to many new and exciting developments in theoretical physics. It has also been used to understand experimental results obtained under extreme pressure and temperature conditions (quark gluon plasma). \n\nThe aims of this project are two-fold: to use these new tools from string theory to understand the strongly coupled regime of QFT; and to use string theory to model the four-dimensional space time observed today. For example, many of the ideas and concepts within string theory have drastically changed the way we think about strongly coupled QFTs. There are also new examples of strongly coupled QFTs, in which calculations have become tractable. Although not realistic models, they share with the real world many common qualitative features, which are otherwise hard to understand. By studying these new examples we hope to shed light on how obscure mechanisms such as confinement work in theories of experimental interest. By utilising these developments in quantum field theory we hope to undercover the exact conditions required to reproduce the string compactification that describes modern particle physics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L000490/1","grantId":"ST/L000490/1","fundValue":"271118","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"James Dodds Ellis  GrantKonstadinos  Sfetsos","coPersons":["Jan Bernard Gutowski","Alessandro  Torrielli","Martin  Wolf","Sara  Pasquetti","Jock  McOrist"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
