But although short term recall relies heavily on phonological coding, it is also influenced by linguistic knowledge. Thus, one of the most potent determinants of recall accuracy is lexicality; words are generally much better recalled than nonwords. Furthermore, memory is better for &quot;wordlike&quot; nonwords; ie nonwords with structural features that commonly occur in words.</p>\n\n<p>This property of nonwords can be assessed in terms of neighbourhood size, defined as the number of words that can be created by substituting a single phoneme. Nonwords with large neighbourhoods are easier to recall than those with small neighbourhoods. </p>\n\n<p>The present research extends this finding through a series of experiments that will assess differences in the extent to which recall of monosyllabic nonwords is influenced by the neighbours that differ in terms of the initial or final consonants, or the medial vowel. These data will provide insights into an important aspect of linguistic knowledge; namely, the way in which lexical phonology is represented in long term memory.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G005605/1","grantId":"ES/G005605/1","fundValue":"70733","fundStart":"2009-03-16","fundEnd":"2010-04-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Annabel  Thorn","coPersons":["Clive Richard Frankish"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
