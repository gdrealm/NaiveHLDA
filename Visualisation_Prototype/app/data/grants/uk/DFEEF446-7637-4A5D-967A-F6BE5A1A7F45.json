Developmental defects in blood cell formation can result in various disease manifestations including anaemia, recurring infection and even cancers. In spite of its critical functions, we have very little knowledge about the regulation of blood cell development. The aim of this research is to study and characterize the role of a molecule, call Prmt1, in blood cell formation. Prmt1 is a protein with a specific enzymatic activity that regulates the expression of other genes, some of which are important for blood cell development. Prmt1 has also recently been implicated in leukemia, and inhibition of Prmt1 activity can specifically suppress a specific type of leukemia. However the function of Prmt1 in normal blood cell development in not clear, which limits the potential development and application of Prmt1 inhibitor in cancer. By characterizing the normal function of Prmt1, this research should give significant insights into underlying mechanisms for blood cell development, which will also provide useful information for future drug design that targets Prmt1.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800892","grantId":"G0800892","fundValue":"443116","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Eric  So","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
