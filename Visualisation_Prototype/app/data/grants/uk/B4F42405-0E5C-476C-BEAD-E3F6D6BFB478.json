This will be the first meeting on expansion held in the UK and one of its main aims is to popularize this rapidly evolving subject to the UK mathematical community. Expander graphs have proved to be an immensely useful concept, both in Pure Mathematics and in Computer Science. On one hand they provide models for efficient and robust networks and very fast algorithms for solving computational problems. On the other hand expanders and more generally expansion properties in groups have been the subject of much recent research in Pure Mathematics involving tools from group theory, combinatorics, representation theory, analysis and number theory. More concretely deep connections have emerged between expansion and properties of generating sets of simple groups, sum-product results in additive combinatorics, 3-dimensional topology, measurable group theory. One cannot help but think that the major results in this area are still to be discovered. Some of the leading experts have already accepted to speak and attending Ph. D. students will be exposed to the latest methods spanning a large selection of topics. The other aim of the workshop is to stimulate discussion among its participants and further research in this exciting area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H043349/1","grantId":"EP/H043349/1","fundValue":"15333","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nikolay  Nikolov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" The purpose of this grant was to organize a two day workshop on expansion in groups in Imperial College in April 2010. This was the first meeting on expansion held in the UK and one of its main aims was to popularize this rapidly evolving subject to the UK mathematical community. In this aspect the meeting was a big success: Despite having to cancel the initial date because of the volcanic ash disruption it was rescheduled for May and attracted 50+ participants, of which half were PhD students and young postdocs.\n\n\n\nExpander graphs have proved to be an immensely useful concept, both in Pure Mathematics and in Computer Science. On one hand they provide models for efficient and robust networks and very fast algorithms for solving computational problems. On the other hand expanders and more generally expansion properties in groups have been the subject of much recent research in Pure Mathematics involving tools from group theory, combinatorics, representation theory, analysis and number theory. More concretely deep connections have emerged between expansion and properties of generating sets of simple groups, sum-product results in additive combinatorics, 3-dimensional topology, measurable group theory. One cannot help but think that the major results in this area are still to be discovered. \n\n\n\nThere were 9 talks by the leading experts in the subject, with about 20% of the time devoted to presenting introductory material for the benefit of the newcomers in the area. \n\n\n\nThe other aim of the workshop was to stimulate discussion among its participants and further research. For example there has been spectacular recent progress in understanding expansion in simple groups of Lie type by Breuillard, Green, Helfgott, Pyber, Szabo, Tao and this event provided a place where a subset of these authors met and discussed their results so far and future work. By 2012 no less than 10 articles have been published which are based on research discussed during the workshop. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion this was a very successful, well attended and timely workshop on expansion, which hopefully will be followed by other events in this area in the UK.
