This makes it an inherently flexible technique that is particularly well-suited for rapid prototyping. An example of a direct write technology is the inkjet printer which, since its invention over a quarter century ago, has become widely pervasive, from office to laboratory, as well as the manufacturing shop floor. However, its operational capability has restricted its use to low temperature printable materials, primarily polymer solutions and solders , with corresponding limitations on the stability and power handling of the devices that can be realised. Glasses, on the other hand, with their durability and excellent optical, mechanical and electrical properties, underlie most of the important applications of photonics and electronics, from communications through displays and biomedicine to dielectrics in integrated circuits. In some micro geometries, they are readily formed, and this has resulted in their dominance in some well-known applications, e.g. in optical fibre transmission, where the cylindrical structure of the fibre lends itself naturally to fibre drawing. In general, though, glasses are not easy to form in small structures, and a new technique for doing so would be dramatic in its impact. We propose to take a leap forward and create a new and flexible fabrication platform capable of realising glass microstructures down to the sub-micron domain: the glassjet printer.The concept of glassjet printing, in which a melt is processed to give defined microstructures in the same way as inks and solutions, is intriguing and potentially far-reaching. A direct write technology that includes glass as a printable material will contribute not only improved stability, optical and dielectric properties, but also semiconducting glasses with mobilities comparable to many polymers, potentially creating a robust and complete electronic and photonic system. The fabrication of complex structures will be transformed from a slow lithographic/etch process, restricted to planar substrates, into a versatile rapid prototyping technology that can operate on 3-D structures, serving the needs of both researchers and industry. Although the concept of a glassjet printer might appear daunting at first, a consideration of some of the underlying issues suggests that it is actually likely to be quite feasible, given the current state of technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G029458/1","grantId":"EP/G029458/1","fundValue":"318643","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Hutchings","coPersons":["E John Hinch"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The project explored the challenges involved in attempting to use inkjet printing methods togenerate small drops of a viscous liquid such as a molten glass. Methods investigated included electrostatic droplet generation (so-called electrospray) as well as capillary breakup of a continuous liquid jet with an external gas sheath. Major outputs from the project were: an understanding of the precise conditions within a wide parameter space under which a discrete cylindrical jet of liquid will break up into multiple drops; and experimental confirmation for the first time of the way in which the neck of fluid between a liquid filament and a drop collapses. These results, which have been published in high-impact scientific journals and also received some press attention, are widely applicable in understanding the behaviour of liquid jets and drops in many applications. They are thus relevant in the biological field (e.g. in some animal defence and attack mechanisms) as well as in geology (the formation of fine lava filaments from volcanos), fluid engineering (e.g. fuel atomization and crop spraying) and materials processing (e.g. material atomization and paint spraying). \n\n\n\nA further important output from the project has been the development of a novel method of generating liquid drops which is currently being evaluated for patent protection. The method has some significant advantages over conventional methods of operation for inkjet print-heads and will be the subject of further publications.
