{"id":"C5DCC48B-B151-422B-B9F6-B4B7860FB5C5","title":"Writer in Residence at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory","abstractText":"Overall this project aims to develop a new approach to public engagement at MSSL through a one-year 'writer in residence'. We have recently developed a relationship with the award-winning poet Simon Barraclough and wish to capitalise on this to enhance and improve our public engagement programme by having Simon spend a year at MSSL. Although MSSL already has an extensive public and schools engagement programme that reaches thousands of people annually, we wish to improve our current programme by providing opportunities for staff and students to develop new skills and adopt a more creative approach to engagement activities. \n\nDuring the project Simon Barraclough will be based at MSSL where he will collaborate with staff, students and members of the public to develop new poetic and creative written work inspired by the STFC-funded research carried out here. Four public events will be held over the course of the year involving readings, artistic collaborations and involvement from staff and the public. These public events will feature other poets and artists and will be held in the grounds of the MSSL where possible, in public venues close to MSSL and in schools where MSSL has an existing link. Simon will write and perform new work related to the research and interests of every level of staff member at MSSL and will be available to work with staff and students who wish to collaborate on artistic projects. For example, poetry surgeries will be held for those interested in writing creatively about MSSL and the research carried out here. \n\nIt is envisioned that the project will culminate in the creation of a 'poetic inventory' of MSSL that is developed by Simon Barraclough, taking into account the history of the site, the amazing historical artefacts it contains, and its current and future work. This inventory will be published in pamphlet form and online and will be a lasting legacy of the project. In addition, an anthology of all work written during the residency will be published in pamphlet form or online, depending on resources. Simon Barraclough will also maintain an engaging and informative blog of the whole residency year. \n\nThe aims of the project are:\n\n- to develop a warmer relationship between MSSL and the public, fostered through joint events and collaborative work.\n- a more democratic approach to public engagement where people share their passions and interests in space science through a medium that provokes a move away from the more traditional 'expert' scientist conveying information to a 'non-expert' audience through the mutual creation and enjoyment of written work.\n- an increased understanding and awareness of the research carried out at MSSL on a local and national level.\n- new ways of thinking and writing, which may enhance the ways in which MSSL staff work and communicate.\n- an increase in the presence of poetry around the MSSL site: both physically and electronically to inspire and invigorate staff and students.\n- an increased understanding of the history and current work of MSSL for staff, students and the public.\n\nIn summary, this project aims to challenge the current concept of what constitutes excellence in public engagement and broaden our horizons whilst creating democratic dialogue opportunities about space science. The project will add to the life and spirit of MSSL introducing new and creative ways of looking at the institution and thinking about its work, history and its future plans. The involvement of the public and schools in this process will improve communication and understanding between the MSSL and a variety of audiences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L005492/1","grantId":"ST/L005492/1","fundValue":"9628","fundStart":"2014-01-29","fundEnd":"2015-01-28","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Lucie  Green","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
