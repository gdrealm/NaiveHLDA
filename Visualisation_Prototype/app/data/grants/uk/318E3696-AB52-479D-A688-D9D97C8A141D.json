Building on previous work in my book, Understanding Human Goods (Edinburgh UP 1998) and in articles since, I shall first lay out the theory's structure, and then argue for value ethics by comparing its performance on a series of different issues with these three and other alternatives. The issues will include egoism, objectivity, dilemma, alienation and self-effacingness, demandingness and the internalism / externalism debate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111765/1","grantId":"111765/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  In philosophical and public debates about demandingness.
