For more than a century, glial cells were thought to play the role of structural and nutritional support neurons. Even their name means 'glue' (in Greek). Glial cells outnumber neurons 10:1 and this gives rise to the popular clich&eacute; that 'we use the potential of our brain only for 10 %'. The view on the function of glial cells / astrocytes and oligodendrocytes has undergone revolutionary change in recent years. Today glial cells are recognized as competent participants of brain communications and the interest of neuroscience laboratories in astrocyte and oligodendrocyte studies is rapidly growing. Glial cells have also become new targets for developing therapeutic agents for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. My project will study signals generated in cortical astrocytes by glutamate - a very important transmitter of neuronal communications. Data obtained in the last decade have demonstrated the capability of glial cells to generate and receive signals mediated by 'classical' neurotransmitters such as glutamate. The actions of glutamate as a transmitter are mediated by several types of receptors. Of these, one of the most important is the NMDA receptor. These are critical for many brain functions, like memory and cognition and many brain pathologies such as ischemia and various neurodegenerative disorders. Until recently, NMDA receptors were thought not to be very important for the function of glial cells. The few groups who have undertaken work in this area have provided new insights. They have shown that glial NMDA receptors have properties different from neuronal ones and contribute to signaling between neurons and glial cells. Glial NMDA receptors may also be promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic agents for neurological disorders. However, this is hampered by incomplete current knowledge about theproperties and functions of astroglial NMDA receptors. My project will provide the first detailed investigation of properties of NMDA receptors in the cortical astrocytes and their role in the astrocyte signalling. The outcome of my research will be new understanding of the pharmacological and functional properties of glial NMDA receptors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F021445/1","grantId":"BB/F021445/1","fundValue":"382537","fundStart":"2008-11-03","fundEnd":"2011-11-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our publications have been repeatedly cited and we received a few requests for the offprints from researcher working in pharma industry (including Merck and Astra Zeneca), indicating a strong interested for our results.

It was discovered that density of functional NMDA receptors expressed in the cortical astrocytes and their contribution into astroglial signalling undergo dramatic changes with ageing, steadily increasing towards the mature adult age and rapidly declining after then. \n\n\n\n2. It has been shown that cytosolic Ca2+-elevation in the cortical astrocytes, including the NMDA receptor-mediated component, can trigger the exocytosis of ATP. The astrocyte-driven ATP was found to down-regulate the activity of neuronal GABA receptors and affect the induction of synaptic plasticity in the neocortex. The age-related changes in the glial signalling may therefore affect the function of aging brain.\n\n3. The difference in pharmacological and functional properties of glial and neuronal NMDA receptors was discovered, in particular much higher sensitivity of glial NMDARs to subunit-specific blocker UBP141 and therapeutically-used antagonist memantine. It was shown that astroglial NMDA receptors most likely have tri-heteromeric structure composed of NR1, NR2/C and NR3 subunits Results of our study will be helpful in search for strategies to maintain mental health during againg and to address an impairment of brain function in brains disoredrs, such as ichemia and Alzheimer's Disease. Results can be used by pharmaceutical industry for the development of novel therapeutic agents specifically targeting glial signalling.\n\nReports of our results on distinct pharmacological properties of glial NMDA, including high sensitivity to therapeutically-used antagonist memantine, attracted attention of pharmaceutical companies. Currently we are discussing collaboration in research aimed to development of glia-specific therapeutics. Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
