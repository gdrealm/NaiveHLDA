Now, however, the process has been scrutinised and a new law has been passed in the form of the Human Tissue Act. This opens the way to the legal and ethical use of retained brain tissue samples for research purposes for the potential benefit of all. It is to be hoped that BRAIN UK will be seen as a positive outcome of the close public scrutiny of the retention and use of human tissues.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701018","grantId":"G0701018","fundValue":"149386","fundStart":"2008-10-20","fundEnd":"2011-10-19","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"James Alan Nicoll","coPersons":["David  Hilton"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
