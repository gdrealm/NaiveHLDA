{"id":"DAF243B2-6777-4BE0-9C3D-948B90290DAA","title":"Shock-induced separation of hypersonic transitional boundary layers","abstractText":"At high supersonic and hypersonic speeds, surface friction and surface heat transfer (kinetic heating) are dominant effects. These are consequences of the boundary layer, the thin layer of retarded flow near the body surface that arises through the action of viscosity. The limit states for a boundary layer are either the smooth-flowing laminar state or the random fluctuations of a turbulent boundary layer. Laminar boundary layers are characterised, amongst other properties, by low heat transfer and low skin friction. In a turbulent boundary layer typical values may be of order five times larger, so that it is critical to understand the likely boundary layer state. The phenomenon of transition is the process by which an initial laminar boundary layer changes to a turbulent one. Transition itself is a pacing item in aerodynamics and many aspects of transition are still not properly understood. A special feature of hypersonic flows is that the transition region may be very substantial in extent; it may cover a significant extent of the body surface so that critical flow interactions then occur in this transitional state. The effect of shock waves provides one such critical interaction. Shock waves, themselves, are an almost inevitable feature of supersonic flows. They arise when the flow is turned in such a manner as to raise its pressure significantly and are features of many practical configurations such as: intakes to air-breathing engines; deflection of control surfaces; the flow approaching leading edges of aerodynamic surfaces. If the pressure rise generated by a shock wave is sufficiently strong it can then generate a so-called separated flow. In this case the boundary layer no longer follows the surface; instead it rises above the surface with a 'trapped' recirculating flow beneath it. This is a complex flow; it may be unsteady and it is characterised, amongst other factors, by surface heat transfer rates that rise significantly above those of the attached boundary layer. Laminar boundary layers are much more readily separated than turbulent boundary layers and produce much larger separation zones. Transitional boundary layers therefore, potentially, occupy a midway state. Given that a transitional boundary layer may, in effect, be switching between laminar and turbulent states, the separated flow is likely to respond strongly to the instantaneous state of the approaching flow.This proposed study is therefore focussed on a benchmark experimental investigation of the separation of a transitional boundary layer by a shock wave. This is an interaction that can commonly occur but which, because of the challenging nature of transitional flows, has so far received only the most modest of attention, either experimentally or computationally. The objective here is to establish both the transitional boundary layer and the shock wave system with as high a precision as possible and in a manner that aids experimental repeatability; this requires the most careful design and management by the experimentalist. The ultimate objective is to generate high quality benchmark data that explains the basic flow physics and produces a well-defined test case for computational simulation and contributes to the engineering design database.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H020853/1","grantId":"EP/H020853/1","fundValue":"564840","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Hillier","coPersons":["Bharathram  Ganapathisubramani"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" (1) The basic model is a blunt-nose circulat cylinder, with its axis aligned parallel with the free stream. This case was chosen by comparison with previous work to produce a regime where extensive lengths of transitional boundary laler were likely. This has been proven and documented by detailed surveys using surface thin film heat transfer gauges. By combined use of CFD and experiment we have then determined a suitable angle, for a flare to be positioned on the cylinder, that will both produce a substantial size shock-induced separated zone, which permits good spatial resolution of data, and which also becomes fully established during the steady run time of the tunnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) The number of data sampling channels has been increased by 64, permitting us to sample up to a maximum of about 90 channels if required. We have manufactured multi-sensor heat transfer modules, and purchased new pressure transducers. Simultaneous multi-channel data acquisition is critical for studies such as ours, where flow field unsteadiness is a central part of the study and where simultaneous data acqisition is necessary. We have used this multi-channel and simultaneous data acquisition, to record flow field schlieren videos simultaneously with measurement of surface heat transfer and pressure time-histories, providing simultaneous pressure or heat transfer profiles through turbulent spots as they convect along the surface.\n\n\n\n(3) We have measured detailed surface pressure and heat transfer distributions for the fully laminar flows, producing very good agreement with our parallel CFD study. This established a clear reference benchmark laminar flow..\n\n\n\n(4) We have recorded high speed schlieren, and transient surface heat transfer and pressure data, for the passage of turbulent spots through the separation zone. We regard this data - taken under controlled conditions - as unique.\n\n\n\n(6) The data show a clear collapse of the separation zone as the spot convects past, producing instantaneously a turbulent fully attached flow. This is then followed by a re-establishment of the separated flow once the spot has convected past. Our intermittency levels, for the approach stream of spots, is high, so that at present the separated flow never has the time to recover completely to the steady laminar case..\n\n\n\n(7) The alternative configuration, to the flare geometry, to produce a shock-induced separation is the impinging shock case. We have therefore completed an extensive CFD study (laminar), for the case of a cowl located concentrically around the test geometry, to radiate a shock wave onto the test surface. We have completed a CFD design exercise to produce the cowl geometry and position that produces a (laminar) separation closely matching that in scale and position that produced by the flare case. This has now been manufactured, and will be tested shortly, and will compliment the flare data as well as providing, potentially, a more flexible configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n(8) Most of our efforts on non-intrusive measurements have focused on the development of a new toluene-based Laser Induced Fluorescence method, which was identified during the early stages of the project as a potential application to obtain temperature data of a plane in the flow. This would at the same time be complementary to the surface heat transfer measurements obtained with thin-film sensors, where heat transfer was recognised as the most critical property in our studies. A specialised mixing system was first developed to inject a controlled toluene/nitrogen mixture into the gun tunnel barrel, where the test flow is initiated. New specialised windows and the corresponding laser optics were also installed in the test section. A preliminary study was initially performed using the main blunt cylinder/flare model. This demonstrated that the fluorescence signal was sufficient for the present application and that the mixture of toluene and nitrogen was of good quality. A purpose-made calibration rig was developed and a spectrometer calibration was performed.  Aerospace/ Defence and Marine","dataset":"gtr"}
