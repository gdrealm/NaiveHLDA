{"id":"CFA134F8-855F-422F-BDB4-80E9F6919456","title":"Empty Names, Fiction, and Existence","abstractText":"The question of how we are to understand such apparently meaningful and true sentences as 'Pegasus does not exist,' 'Raskolnikov is a fictional character,' and 'Sherlock Holmes was a detective,' perennially plagues philosophers. On the one hand we are uncomfortable accepting the existence of such entities as Pegasus and Zeus. But on the other hand the truth and meaningfulness of such sentences seems prime facie to require that the terms 'Pegasus' and 'Zeus' refer to something. \\n\\nOne solution to this problem, suggested by Kendall Walton, Gareth Evans, Fred Kroon, and others, is to regard assertions of the problematic sentences as being made within the scope of a game of make-believe in which we pretend that there are such things as Pegasus and Zeus. Thus, for example, on this account, when we deploy the existence predicate we engage in a special pretence in which we pretend that our domain of discourse contains not only the denizens of the real world but also fictional objects from various fictional worlds. We use our existence predicate to mark this distinction. \\n\\nI will primarily be concerned with three classes of sentences: (a) Object-Fictional sentences such as 'Sherlock Holmes was a detective' which attempt to characterize the world of a fiction from an internal perspective without explicitly indicating the fictional status of their subject matter, (b) Meta-Fictional sentences such as 'Raskolnikov is a fictional character' which attempt to characterize a fiction from an external perspective that reveals the fictional status of their subject matter, and (c) Existence sentences, such as 'Kaplan exists' and 'Pegasus does not exist.' \\n\\n \\nI motivate a pretence-theoretic approach to all three classes of sentence by a number of means. \\n(i) I argue that (a) we should adopt a pretence-theoretic account of Object-Fictional sentences just in case we adopt a pretence-theoretic account of Meta-Fictional sentences (b) we should adopt a pretence-theoretic account of Meta-Fictional sentences just in case we adopt a pretence-theoretic account of Existence sentences, and (c) we should adopt a pretence-theoretic account of Object-Fictional sentences.\\n (ii) I criticize alternative accounts of these sentences including, in particular, Fictional Realist accounts that postulate the existence of fictional objects.\\n (iii) I argue that we can motivate a pretence-theoretic account of Meta-Fictional sentences by considering the nature and function of Meta-Fictional discourse.\\n(iv) I argue that we can motivate a pretence-theoretic account of Existential sentences by considering the nature and function of Existence discourse.\\n(v) I employ the cognitive account of pretence recently developed by Shaun Nichols and Stephen Stich to show that the attitudes we express using Object-Fictional sentences, Meta-Fictional sentences, and Existence sentences, are better understood as cases of pretence than belief or acceptance. \\n\\nAlthough pretence-theoretic accounts of such sentences are in many ways attractive, the existing pretence-theoretic accounts have had only sketchy and suggestive things to say about what the relevant pretences are supposed to involve and how, precisely, they are supposed to convey information about the real world. By employing the cognitive framework developed by Stich and Nichols I offer a precise and detailed account of what it is that we do when we pretend that our domain of discourse contains Pegasus or Zeus. And by employing the semantic framework developed by John Perry I offer a precise and detailed account of how the utterances we make within this pretence may allow us to convey information about the real world.\\n\\nI conclude by defending the proposed account against some of the challenges to pretence theoretic accounts of various phenomena recently mounted by Richard, Stanley, and Szabo. \\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E003974/1","grantId":"AH/E003974/1","fundValue":"24129","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Julian Everett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
