Natural photosynthesis uses solar energy to generate dioxygen and carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water, but the targets of artificial photosynthesis can be more diverse. Our vision is to create a solar nano-device which will drive the coupled photo-conversion of methane and carbon dioxide into methanol and carbon monoxide respectively. This challenging target differs fundamentally from the familiar one of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. Our target offers products both on the oxidation and the reduction sides that are significant fuels or feedstocks. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and oxidation of alkanes represent long-standing goals of great complexity, but we base our concepts on well-established principles. We break down the goals into individual components, each of which is highly challenging within its own right and delivery of each would constitute a major breakthrough. The challenges will be met by a team of scientists, integrated across the four centres of Manchester, Nottingham, York and Norwich, who lead teams with expertise in photophysics, nanoscience, photochemistry, electrochemistry and synthesis. Thus these researchers will seek to establish the science required to underpin technologies that will allow the conversion of abundant and environmentally damaging feedstocks into products of high economic value by constructing a new class of solar device capable of driving green chemical reactions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F04772X/1","grantId":"EP/F04772X/1","fundValue":"306409","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Work done under this grant was selected by\nthe Royal Society to exhibit at the Royal\nSociety Summer Science Exhibition 2011\n'Putting Sunshine in the Tank - using\nNanotechnology to make Solar Fuel', exhibit\nvisited by 13,800 members of the general\npublic, school children and Fellows of the\nRoyal Society (PI Wendy Flavell).\nThis activity generated a significant number of\narticles in the blogosphere, coverage on the\nBBC News website and a number of specialist\nmagazines.\nA number of associated schools' talks, family\nfun days (e.g. at the Manchester Museum of\nScience and Industry in August 2010) etc. took\nplace during the grant period and are\ncontinuing.

Here we describe the progress made under the grant to the University of Manchester. This work was focussed\non the physics of the light-harvesting elements (in particular the QDs), and on establishing the degree of success of the\ngrafting chemistry linking the catalyst or porphyrin molecules to the nanoparticle surfaces. We have used ultrafast laser\nspectroscopies to measure the current carriers that are created in the QDs when light is absorbed. The material of most\ninterest to us is InP (which is relatively non-toxic, and absorbs sunlight strongly). We have been able to demonstrate that\nInP QDs show a phenomenon called 'carrier multiplication', where one incoming photon of sunlight can create more than\none set of current carriers. This is important because it can improve the efficiency of light harvesting - and this is the first\ntime this effect has been demonstrated in relatively non-toxic QDs.\nMeanwhile, our collaborators at the Universities of York and UEA have synthesised catalyst molecules for the target\nreactions (with considerable success, particularly for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction; this work will be described in\ntheir final reports). The next stage of the work (at UEA) was to attempt to graft these molecules onto the surfaces of the\nQDs and the gold nanoparticles. It was then crucial to establish that the molecules were grafted to the nanoparticle\nsurfaces, and to measure the composition of the nanoparticle-molecule system. The University of Manchester team used\nsoft X-ray synchrotron radiation (at MAXlab, in Sweden) to perform a non-destructive depth-profiling analysis that allows us\nto determine the chemical composition of the surface layers of the nanoparticles. For example, we have been able to\ndemonstrate that porphyrin molecules have been successfully attached to the surfaces of polymer-coated gold\nnanoparticles. Thus parts of our overall concept design are now functioning.\nDuring the project we have also used EPSRC Pathways to Impact support (to the University of Manchester) to develop\nhigh quality public engagement activities directly linked to the SolarCAP project. Ours was one of 21 projects (from 97\napplications) selected for exhibition at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in July 2011. Further development of the 'oxidation' end of the nanocell.
