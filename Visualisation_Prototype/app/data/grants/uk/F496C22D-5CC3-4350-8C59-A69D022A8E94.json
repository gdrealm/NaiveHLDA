This notion is based on a premise about the importance of knowledge in contemporary social and economic development. Within this frame of reference, higher education systems and institutions are viewed as 'engines' of development for economic competitiveness and social progress. Such changing missions and roles for higher education imply major changes in&nbsp; traditional arrangements for governance, academic practices, research orientation and social partnerships and networks. </p>\n\n<p>The CINHEKS project is a collaborative multi-country investigation into how higher education institutions are networked in knowledge societies in 3 regions: Europe, the USA and Japan. The research focuses on the concrete linkages among academics, institutions and external role-players in different knowledge societies, the impact of such networks on academics, institutions and society, and the basis of distinct differences between knowledge societies. The methodology includes comparative historical analysis, analysis of policy trends, institutional case studies, an internet survey, and a correlation of theoretical analysis and empirical findings with contemporary policy discussions about knowledge societies. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G032890/1","grantId":"ES/G032890/1","fundValue":"186640","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mala  SinghJohn  Brennan","coPersons":["Brenda  Little"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
