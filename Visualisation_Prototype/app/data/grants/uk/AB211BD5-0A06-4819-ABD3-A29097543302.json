{"id":"AB211BD5-0A06-4819-ABD3-A29097543302","title":"Improving the efficiency of human somatic cell nuclear transfer","abstractText":"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the potential to repair damaged tissues and organs and present a potential cure for many grave diseases. However, as with organ transplants, transplantation of cells derived from ESCs can invoke an immune response that may lead to rejection. This problem could be overcome by creating ESCs from other cell types, such as a skin cell, by reversing the genetic changes that give a skin cell its characteristic features. This process, which is called nuclear reprogramming, can be achieved by transplanting the skin cell nucleus into an egg from which the genetic material has been removed. An artificial stimulus is then required to initiate embryonic development leading to the production of ESCs. \n\nThe main aim of this project is to optimise the stimulus required to initiate embryonic development. We use mouse and human eggs for this purpose. However, research progress has been hampered by the scarcity of good quality human eggs. We therefore aim to increase the availability of human eggs by offering IVF patients the opportunity to donate eggs to this research, in return for a contribution towards the cost of their treatment.&nbsp; The project will advance progress in techniques for producing patient-specific ESC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601157","grantId":"G0601157","fundValue":"542423","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mary  Herbert","coPersons":["Alison  Murdoch","Gordon Ronald Strathdee"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
