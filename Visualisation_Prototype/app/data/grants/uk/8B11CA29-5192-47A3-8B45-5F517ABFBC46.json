It is designed to provide high sensitivity and high angular resolution observations of the cold gas dust in the Universe to study the origins and early evolution of galaxies, stars and planets. The work done under this application will support UK astronomers wishing to use ALMA, allowing them to extract the maximum possible science from this transformational telescope.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M000982/1","grantId":"ST/M000982/1","fundValue":"632074","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Gary  Fuller","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
