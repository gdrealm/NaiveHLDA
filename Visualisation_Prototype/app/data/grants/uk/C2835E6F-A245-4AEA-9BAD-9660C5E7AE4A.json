{"id":"C2835E6F-A245-4AEA-9BAD-9660C5E7AE4A","title":"Adoption dynamics in network industries: A theoretical investigation under asymmetric information","abstractText":"<p>A good or service exhibits network effects if the benefit to the users increases as more people use/adopt it. In addition to traditional areas with network effects (such as telephone and fax), many additional markets with network effects have evolved in recent years owing to the advances in the digital/information technology.</p>\n\n<p>A well-known problem in network is coordination failure: the consumers may be trapped in an equilibrium in which no one adopts, even though there are better equilibria in which a group of consumers adopt (because the beliefs thereof are self-fulfilling). In many real-world situations, the adoption process is dynamic and the agents' preferences are unknown. </p>\n\n<p>This research aims to extend our understanding of this issue to such realistic situations, and tries to shed new lights on how dynamic adoption process might resolve the coordination problem via intertemporal coordination, and what kind of dynamic incentive schemes or policy measures might be useful to enhance the efficiency of network markets. Specifically, a game theoretical analysis will be conducted on how the consumers would behave in a model where they have private information on their own preferences and make adoption decisions based on other consumers' behaviour up to then.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E001688/1","grantId":"ES/E001688/1","fundValue":"80042","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"In Uck  Park","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
