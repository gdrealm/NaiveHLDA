A recent European report of leading scientists concluded that lameness and mastitis of cows were the most important factors in reducing the welfare of dairy cows due to the pain associated with these conditions. Unfortunately, the Farm Animal Welfare Council in the UK also reports that the dairy industry has made little progress in addressing these problems, mainly due to a reduction in profitability affecting investment and the lack of welfare surveillance systems available. A major challenge in improving the welfare of food production animals is in developing methods of automating the detection of such welfare problems. Such detection systems should be able to operate as early warning systems and detect the early signs of disease or illness within dairy herds and individual cows.\n\nThanks to new technological developments there are potential solutions. Until recently, it has not been logistically possible to monitor the complex behaviour associated with animals kept in large social groups, such as sheep, pigs or cows. However, novel local positioning wireless sensors such as those designed by our project partner, Omnisense, can be deployed over large networks of animals and give accurate positioning information for individuals over long periods of time. For the first time we will be able to record large quantities of data regarding the behaviour and social interactions in a whole herd of dairy cows.\n\nResearch studies have shown that diseases such as lameness in dairy cattle can affect general behaviour, such as how long cows spend lying down. Similarly, social interactions between individual animals, such as how much time they spend close to each other or how closely they synchronise their behaviour, have been suggested as possible measures of animal welfare. However, it is a non-trivial problem to determine and quantify changes in individual and social behaviour and subsequently to use such changes to predict the onset of disease. \n\nIn this project we will be using automated data collection techniques to record patterns of space use, movement, and social interactions within commercial dairy herds. In the first year, the behaviour of animals with lameness, mastitis or metabolic disease will be compared with healthy animals to determine differences in behaviour. In year two, a full dairy herd will be monitored for an extended period from calving to measure changes in their behaviour with the natural onset of disease in order to identify early changes that might be used to subsequently predict disease occurrence. In year three, the study will be repeated on three other farms to test whether such predictions are still relevant on different intensive dairy units.\n\nThe behavioural data will be analysed using cutting-edge mathematical and statistical techniques. Using information about the observed changes in both individual cow behaviour and herd social structure we will develop a predictive model for the onset of disease and other welfare changes within individual cows. This will lead to the development of an on-farm automated 'early warning' system for disease detection. Such a system would be invaluable for improving the welfare and productivity of dairy cows.\n\nUsing the techniques we develop for predicting the onset of disease we will also determine if it is possible to use behavioural changes to identify other important welfare changes in dairy cattle, in particular the onset of oestrus and the time of calving.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K003070/1","grantId":"BB/K003070/1","fundValue":"28039","fundStart":"2012-11-19","fundEnd":"2015-11-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas James Bell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Veterinary College","findingsText":" We aim to develop an early warning system to detect health and welfare issues in dairy cows, through remote tracking of their movement and behaviour.
