All the above ground parts of the plant are ultimately derived from these primordia. Most plants grow vegetatively first, making stems and leaves, before initiating flowering. In the laboratory we study the development of a small plant called Arabidopsis. Although it is just a weed, Arabidopsis has many advantages for scientists to work on it, and we believe that what we learn about Arabidopsis will be relevant to many other plants. When arabidopsis grows, the first 15 or so primordia that are initiated are vegetative, that is they make leaves. After this time, if the conditions are right, the plant will make flowers instead of leaves. This developmental decision to make leaves or flowers is very important, and controlled by many factors. We want to understand more clearly how the switch from making leaves to making flowers works in plants. We have identified a mutant, fdp-1, where the switch is damaged, and as a result the plants make flowers much earlier than they should. Indeed, in the fdp-1 mutant, many genes are expressed where and when they shouldn't be. This gene therefore represents an exciting tool to understand in molecular terms aspects of how plants control the switch from making leaves to flowers in the primodia. We shall use a combination of different approaches to understand this problem. We wish to discover what other genes are affected by FDP. We will do this using microarrays. We also wish to discover the mechanism of FDP signaling, is it direct, or does it act through a repressor? Finally, we wish to do genetic screens to identify other genes involved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D010047/1","grantId":"BB/D010047/1","fundValue":"255987","fundStart":"2006-10-24","fundEnd":"2010-11-23","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Anthony Wigge","coPersons":[],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
