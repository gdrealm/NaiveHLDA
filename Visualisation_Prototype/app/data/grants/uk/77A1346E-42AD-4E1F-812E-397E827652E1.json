Chemical compounds excreted from the human body are believed to reflect certain metabolic conditions as well as the blood gas content. The changes in concentration of some compounds, referred to as biomarkers, and chemical composition in human samples such as breath, blood, urine, sweat and saliva can be linked to particular diseases and have been intensively used in medicine for early and minimally invasive diagnosis. There is considerable interest in the development of sensor devices to identify compounds both in vivo and ex vivo that can facilitate non-invasive diagnosis. \n\nSensing techniques based upon the use of optical fibre devices to probe the optical characteristics of nanomaterials that exhibit changes in their optical properties upon exposure to targeted chemical species are particularly attractive, in light of their potential high sensitivity, selectivity, the ready ability to multiplex arrays of sensors, and the prospect for remote sensing. Optical fibre grating devices, which are based upon a periodic perturbation of the refractive index of the core of the optical fibre, will be exploited as the sensing platform.
