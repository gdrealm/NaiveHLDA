However, the first seminar on child friendly justice prompted the Council of Europe to commission the European Children's Rights Unit, in collaboration with the UK children's rights charity, Investing in Children, to develop a child friendly version of their Child Friendly Justice Guidelines. We are in the process of completing this piece of work in collaboration with a group of young people who were also involved in the first seminar. In completing this work, we aim to demonstrate to the Council of Europe how children can be engaged as partners in research, truly leading the process and developing the outcomes, whilst also evaluating the quality and impact of European measures from their own perspectives.

Seminars completed to date have addressed European responses to: Child Friendly Justice (1); Violence Against Children (2); Children's rights as consumers (3) and Child Poverty (4). Remaining seminars will cover child migration (5) and child labour (6). The final seminar will sum up the main conclusions arising from the seminar series and suggest ways forward. Full details of all of the seminars, including a summary report for each event, are posted on the website (see link below) We have actively involved a range of stakeholders in the seminars, particularly those directly responsible for children's rights policy development in the Council of Europe and the European Union. We are in the process of completing our first edited collection to be published in the Spring 2015, and are planning 2 further special issues: one on 'Children as consumers: a rights-based perspective'; and one on 'Children's Rights as an Economic Investment'. All of these contain contributions from the seminar series. Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
