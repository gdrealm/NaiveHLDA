Yet, many of her ideas centre on questions of space, time and gender, suggesting that her work would also relevant to the study of time-based media artefacts. To this extent, it is surprising that her work has not been taken up substantially in relation to cinema, where a great deal of work on feminist theory and feminist cultural politics has been undertaken.\\n\\nMy research relates the work of Luce Irigaray to feminist film theory and criticism in order to demonstrate the textual-political value of her thought. It focuses upon what it is possible to understand by the term 'feminine subjectivity' and the ways in which this finds new avenues of expression and reception through recent films made by women. The project addresses both narrative content and film form to highlight the importance of reconceptualising the theorisation of the feminine in cinema. Significantly, it also considers the impact of contexts of cinematic direction, production and consumption on our understanding of the relationship between femininity and film. In addition, there are discussions about the specificity of women's political engagement with cinema. Detailed textual analyses of a range of films produced in the global context of independent films directed by women are considered in the project. This provides a useful snapshot of the gendered space afforded by world cinema for politically inflected films. The selected texts for analysis provide a framework for the project and include:\\n\\nOrlando (Sally Potter, UK, 1993)\\nThe Piano (Jane Campion, NZ, 1993)\\nThe Silences of the Palace (Moufida Tlatli, Tunisia, 1994)\\nAntonia's Line (Marleen Gorris, Netherlands, 1995)\\nFemale Perversions (Susan Streitfeld, US, 1995)\\nUnder the Skin (Carine Adler, UK, 1997)\\nThe Apple (Samira Makhmalbaf, Iran, 1998)\\nFaithless (Liv Ullmann, Sweden, 2000).\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F002904/1","grantId":"AH/F002904/1","fundValue":"26312","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline  Bainbridge","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Roehampton University","findingsText":" This project was the first to use the work of Luce Irigaray to interrogate themes of femininity in films made by women.
