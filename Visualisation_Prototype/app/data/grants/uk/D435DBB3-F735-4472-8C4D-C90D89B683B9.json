Diamond as a material is intrinsically radiation harder due to the higher atomic bonding strength compared to conventional Silicon. \n\nThe project aims to develop a novel particle detector technology that is based on diamond as a detector material and in-bulk electrodes in the form of graphitic wires to reach ultra-high levels of radiation tolerance. The concept of in-bulk electrodes has been deployed previously in Silicon detectors and has proven to raise the radiation hardness by one order of magnitude. Since the increase in radiation hardness is due to the geometrical arrangement of electrodes and independent of the material, the same principle is applicable to diamond. This will consequently lead to a technology providing particle detectors with unprecedented radiation hardness, benefitting key projects in the STFC roadmap, namely in the areas of Particle Physics for experiments at the energy frontier, and for diagnostic devices in the area of radiation therapy for cancer treatment. \n\nThe success of the project will be demonstrated by the proof that 3D diamond detectors can be made in a reliable process and that the radiation hardness meets the expectations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M003965/1","grantId":"ST/M003965/1","fundValue":"258056","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander  Oh","coPersons":["Bruce  Hamilton","Li  Lin"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
