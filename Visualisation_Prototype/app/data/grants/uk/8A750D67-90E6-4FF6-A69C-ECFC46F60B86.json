What is apparent, however, is that this development not only altered the way people interacted with their environment, but also the social structure within communities, ultimately leading to the development of complex societies. \n\nDespite the importance of the Neolithic in southwest Asia, archaeological sites, particularly those from the earlier Pre-Pottery Periods (c 11,700-8250 cal BP), often prove difficult to interpret due to their ephemeral nature and the scarcity of biological remains. \n\nIn order to gain a greater understanding of such sites, we will develop and validate a method based on more durable forms of evidence that are often the result of human activities, i.e. phytoliths (bodies of silica that form in and around plant cells) and geochemical elements (traces of chemicals in soils, e.g. phosphorous, calcium and manganese). The aim is to determine if different areas have specific phytolith and geochemical signatures which can be used to recognise these same areas archaeologically.\n\nThis will be achieved through ethnographic research using two settlement types: Bedouin tent sites and abandoned mud and stone constructed villages. These have been chosen because they provide the best available analogies for the Neolithic sites which will be analysed as part of this project. The Bedouin tent sites will be the ethnographic analogy for the small scale, ephemeral, pastoralist, and seasonally occupied sites of Wadi el-Jilat and Azraq, while the abandoned villages near Shawbak on the Jordanian plateau and the village of Shammakh, north of Wadi Mousa will be the comparison for the more substantial, stone and mud brick constructed sites of Ain Ghazal, Beidha, and WF16. \n\nLimited existing ethnographic research (conducted in other geographical regions) has focused either on phytoliths or geochemical elements but not both. They demonstrated that these methods are informative about the use of space within settlements. This project will be the first large scale ethnographic study to integrate these two types of analysis. It will also be the first to explore how much taphonomy (i.e. the processes assemblages go through from creation to analysis) affects the composition of phytolith and geochemical assemblages.\n\nAs Principal investigator, Jenkins will be supported in this research by a number of eminent and experienced researchers, namely:\n \nDr Carol Palmer (Director of the British Institute in Amman, Council for British Research in the Levant-CBRL), who will be a Project Partner. Palmer originally took the majority of the Bedouin camp samples, will assist with the ethnographic work and archaeological sampling and, as Amman Director of the CBRL, is in a unique position to arrange the fieldwork from within Jordan \n\nProf John Grattan (Pro Vice Chancellor, Aberystwyth University) who will conduct the geochemical analysis and subsequently act as an advisor\n\nDr Helen Smith, (Visiting Research Fellow, Bournemouth University) who carried out the Bedouin camp sampling with Palmer and will also advise on the ethnographic aspects of the project. \n\nThis represents a strong and experienced multi-disciplinary team with an established history of conducting research in Jordan (although not previously together). This project is a natural culmination of the participants' interests and expertise. Furthermore, as much costly fieldwork has already been undertaken, and, as Palmer and Grattan are giving their time on a non-stipendiary basis, this research offers the AHRC excellent value for money.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K002902/1","grantId":"AH/K002902/1","fundValue":"156056","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  We predict that once our findings are complete they will be used by other archaeologists. \nFurthermore, the former residents of one of our ethnographic sites Al Ma'tan, have requested the results of our work on this site.

For example, animal penning deposits are high in chlorine, phosphorous and potassium.\no Other areas are less distinct geochemically but are likely to prove more identifiable through phytolith analysis, for example roofs which are often constructed out of reeds a taxa with specific phytolith forms. \no Not only are elevated geochemical element levels of importance, but also the reductions in specific elemental concentrations can be indicative of human alteration of the natural soil geochemistry. This issue has not been previously addressed in any detail before and represents an important component of this study\no Taphonomy has a dramatic effect on the phytolith and geochemical assemblages from one of our ethnographic type sites, the Bedouin camp sites. Analysis has shown that even over a short period of site abandonment the phytoliths and geochemical elements can be lost. This has implications for the ephemeral archaeological sites we are studying such as the Wadi Jilat and Azraq sites but is less of an issue for the more substantial mud and stone constructed sites which offer more protection for these micro-signatures. The results of our combined phytolith and geochemical analysis of the ethnographic sites can be used by others to help interpret how settlements were used from any site which is constructed in a similar way to our ethnographic sites. Our method, therefore, can be useful to archaeologists working outside the Neolithic of southwest Asia both temporally and geographically.
