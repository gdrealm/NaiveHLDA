Our programme of research will show:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the type of person who loses or gains the most well-being when socio-economic events take place</li>\n\n <li>the psychological reasons as to why people’s well-being changes after such events. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>We explore five key questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Do well-being reactions to socio-economic events depend on a person’s personality characteristics prior to the event occurring? </li>\n\n <li>Does personality change in predictable and meaningful ways?</li>\n\n <li>Are people’s health and well-being affected by how much they actually earn, or how their income ranks amongst others?</li>\n\n <li>Do losses in income have a proportionally greater impact on well-being than an equivalent income gains?</li>\n\n <li>Do people have lower levels of well-being in less equal societies? </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Our aim in answering these questions is to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>contribute new answers to old theoretical questions</li>\n\n <li>encourage interdisciplinary collaboration in understanding the influences on well-being</li>\n\n <li>feed into policy debates</li>\n\n <li>suggest an increased role for psychologists to work alongside other social scientists in informing policy.&nbsp; </li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00588X/1","grantId":"ES/K00588X/1","fundValue":"306128","fundStart":"2013-11-30","fundEnd":"2017-05-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alex Mathew  Wood","coPersons":["Eamonn  Ferguson","James  Banks"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
