As such, when learning tasks as simple as tying one's shoes or as complex as performing heart surgery, we learn by watching others, from childhood through to old age.</p>\n\n<p>Many researchers from the behavioural and brain sciences suggest that observational and physical learning share common features. What remains unknown is how our brains and behaviour change when learning by observation across the lifespan, as well as how age impacts the efficacy of observational learning.</p>\n\n<p>To address these questions, this project measures the impact of observational learning on behaviour and brain activity among children, young adults, and older adults. An innovative training paradigm featuring dance learning in conjunction with Xbox Kinectâ„¢ technology is used with each age group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The objective is to teach participants dance sequences either via physical practice or observation, and to use brain imaging in conjunction with multivariate analytical approaches to map out how both kinds of learning impact brain activity and physical performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The ultimate aim is to develop a means of identifying factors associated with observational learning success, which in turn will inform observation-based interventions used in education and therapeutic contexts.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001892/1","grantId":"ES/K001892/1","fundValue":"173451","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-03-18","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emily Suzanna Cross","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
