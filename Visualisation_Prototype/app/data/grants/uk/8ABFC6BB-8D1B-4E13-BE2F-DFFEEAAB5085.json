This project will explore the chemistry of such radicals with the particular objective of identifying and optimising free radical addition reactions which will be beneficial in organic synthesis. Organic synthesis driven by heterogeneous photocatalysis is environmentally and economically attractive, and has the potential to achieve higher selectivity to desired products than conventional routes. We propose to explore a wide range of free radical addition reactions initiated by the known photo-Kolbe reaction of carboxylic acids over titania surfaces. Reactions showing the most promise will be examined in more detail, using in particular in-situ EPR spectroscopy (to observe the initially generated free radicals), in-situ NMR spectroscopy (to identify intermediates and products), and time resolved optical spectroscopy (to observe short lived species) to determine the reaction pathways. Initial studies will be made with TiO2, but we will also explore improvements in performance by adding metals to enhance hole:electron separation, or nitrogen dopants to achieve visible light activation. Visible light activation will also be attempted with other semiconductors. A crucial component of the project is the design and construction of reactors for scaling up promising reactions to a scale attractive to the pharmaceutical industry. The project team has wide experience in photocatalysis, free radical chemistry, in-situ spectroscopic methods and photocatalytic reactor design and construction. Advice and assistance in selection of target reactions relevant to the pharmaceutical industry is provided by GlaxoSmithKline. A successful outcome of the project could bring about a paradigm shift in technologies for high value organic synthesis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I003479/1","grantId":"EP/I003479/1","fundValue":"290884","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Larger scale reactors under construction at Robert Gordon University for potential use with our systems in clean preparations of fine chemicals Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Societal,Economic","person":"John Christopher Walton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":" Our new unconventional titania photocalyses work with with unprocessed carboxylic acids. As a heterogeneous catalyst titania is cheap, easily separated by filtration and safe; no hard UV is needed. The carboxylic acids can be used directly without any special functionalization so the syntheses are very user-friendly. In exploring this chemistry we uncovered several interesting and intriguing aspects. Used without a reaction partner, carboxylic acids decarboxylated and then selectively produced high yields of homo-dimeric products. Alkoxymethyl and aryloxymethyl radicals were generated particularly efficiently. We successfully deployed them in convenient alkylations of electron-deficient alkenes. We also discovered a remarkable cascade reaction in which phenoxyacetic acid reacts with maleic anhydride or a maleimide to yield chromenedione derivatives. Furthermore, by judicious modifications of the catalyst and reaction conditions, this process could be directed either to yield the chromenediones or to produce the alkylated alkenes. In short, we showed that our &quot;clean&quot; anaerobic TiO2-based method has great potential for original syntheses and for making many of the molecules usually associated with toxic organotin methodology.
