{"id":"C097505D-A961-4995-98B9-258AE5FFAEDE","title":"Tomographic Imaging","abstractText":"Computed Tomography (CT) is a powerful non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique for producing 2-D cross-sections and 3-D images of an object from a series of 2D projections (shadowgraphs). \n\nCritical to the process is the computer algorithms that are able to pre-process and then reconstruct the 3D images from many (often over thousands) shadowgraphs. There are three critical steps to obtaining useful information from tomography i) the correction and calibration stage starting from initial image capture, ii) the reconstruction of a 3D image from these 2D projections and iii) the analysis and quantification of features in the 3D object. \n\nWhile the techniques are rapidly growing in popularity, most users have fairly limited options when trying to recover the 3D image and are able to write only fairly primitive computer programs to extract key features from the images. The aim of this CCP is to establish a framework within which different reconstruction algorithms, artefact reduction codes, and image analysis procedures are made available to all.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M022498/1","grantId":"EP/M022498/1","fundValue":"238693","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2020-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Withers","coPersons":["Manuchehr  Soleimani","William Robert Lionheart","Peter David Lee"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
