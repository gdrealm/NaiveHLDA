In biology, organisms can be thought of as imperfect self-replicators, which produce closely related species, allowing for selection and evolution. Autocatalysis is also an important part of many other biological processes. \n\nThis project aims to develop new autocatalytic reactions where two simple chemical building blocks come together to give a more complex product, and then the product aggregates to give primitive cell-like structures or &quot;protocells&quot; such as micelles or vesicles. The protocells allow the starting materials to mix more efficiently, speeding up the reaction in time and giving rise to complex behaviour of the protocells. A new ultra sensitive microscope will be used to monitor the formation and dynamics of the protocells in real time. These reactions will serve as model systems which we hope will contribute to understanding how complex cell-like systems can emerge from much simpler chemical components and may be relevant to understanding the principles of how life started on earth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M025241/1","grantId":"EP/M025241/1","fundValue":"580471","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2018-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Patrick Fletcher","coPersons":["Philipp  Kukura"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
