{"id":"FC322B79-3A82-4C1A-97C8-F1AD88C342DD","title":"MRC Centre for Immune Regulation","abstractText":"The immune system plays a vital role in protection against infectious disease caused by a range of micro-organisisms including viruses and bacteria. These responses are normally tightly regulated but when they run out of control they can also cause damage that leads to disease. These diseases include arthritis and inflammatory damage in the liver, kidneys and blood vessels which are a major contributor to the causes of ill health. It is therefore very important to understand how the immune response is regulated and controlled and what happens when this goes wrong. The MRC Centre brings together a series of internationally recognised research groups investigating different aspects of immune system control. These groups study basic mechanisms and apply this knowledge to selected diseases with the aim of identifying improved methods of treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9818340","grantId":"G9818340","fundValue":"5648180","fundStart":"1999-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Eric John Jenkinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
