Use of structured products to manage risk, raise funding and to economise on regulatory capital has become extensive. For many banks (especially in the US but increasingly in Europe), the majority of the loans they make are now packaged up and sold to the market through securitizations. This development has revolutionised risk management practises in banks and completely altered the landscape of defaultable fixed income debt securities available to investors.</p> \n<p>This project will develop new theoretical models for pricing and analysing risk in pools of defaultable claims and apply these to data on structured product spreads and loss rates on loan pools. In particular, we will focus on dynamic models of loan losses formulated using hazard rate and latent variable models of default on individual securities and then employing Law of Large Number arguments to derive loss distributions. Most models currently in use are essentially static, on-period models, a feature that prevents convincing empirical implementations. Using high quality data on structured product spreads and pool performance not so far available to academic researchers, we shall implement and test these models.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1711","grantId":"RES-000-22-1711","fundValue":"45042","fundStart":"2006-04-02","fundEnd":"2008-04-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"William Robert Maurice  Perraudin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
