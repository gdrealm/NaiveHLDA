{"id":"E4EE2A30-1AD6-4721-A9CE-451D6FE3C7AC","title":"Neuropathological Substrates of Dementia after Stroke","abstractText":"Dementia is a major health problem which is increasing with the rising numbers of older people. Research effort in this field has focused largely on mechanisms that damage nerve-cells in disorders such as Alzheimer?s disease. Recent evidence suggests that impairments in blood supply to the brain may cause or accelerate these so-called ?neurodegenerative changes?. We have shown that 10% of patients who survive a stroke without severe memory problems, develop dementia in the following year. We have also highlighted possible risk associated with rapid changes in blood supply to the brain caused by disorders of cardiovascular regulation. The relationships between impaired blood supply, neurodegeneration and dementia are poorly understood. We propose to elucidate these, and identify the underlying mechanisms in older people who (a) have had a stroke and experience reduced blood supply to key subcortical regions of the brain. We will perform repeated clinical, psychological, cardiovascular and brain imaging assessments in these patients, to enable us to relate changes in memory and attention to structural damage to the brain. Most patients in our studies consent to brain donation at death, and we will compare pathological features with changes seen on brain imaging, and identify the molecular substrates of this damage. Our studies will advance understanding of the importance of how impariment occurs in stroke patients and in blood supply to the brain in dementia, and how this is affected by age. They will enable us to make more accurate, early diagnoses and identify those at risk of cognitive decline, and inform the development of therapies to slow or prevent such changes.\nOur findings will be disseminated in many different ways, including: (i) publication in scientific journals; (ii) development of professional guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of dementia and related medical conditions; (iii) inclusion in lay information bulletins and ?fact sheets? produced by bodies such as the Alzheimer?s Society, and US Alzheimer Association ;(iv) presentation at public lectures, workshops and carers support groups run by such organisations; and (v) through collaboration with Newcastle University?s Institute for Policy and Ethics in the Life Sciences (PEALS) whose main mission is to promote public engagement. Older people and representative voluntary organisations are involved in the strategic direction of research within the IAH and the management of facilities such as the brain tissue bank.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500247","grantId":"G0500247","fundValue":"548793","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Raj  Kalaria","coPersons":["John Tiernan O Brien","Tuomo  Polvikoski","Simon  Bamforth","Rose Anne  Kenny"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
