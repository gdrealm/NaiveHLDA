Recent examples are the discoveries linking differences in gene sequences to a number of diseases including certain types of cancers, diabetes, bipolar disorder and rheumatoid arthritis. These differences in gene sequence are translated into differences in protein structure and it is these small differences in protein structure (and therefore function) that result in differences in metabolism or signalling in the cell which are the root causes of the various disease states. Protein X-ray crystallography is a very efficient method that can be used to determine the 3D structure of these proteins and in Edinburgh there is an urgent need to upgrade our equipment to generate more results in this area. A significant amount of basic research in medicine, biology and chemistry is being driven by the new information from gene sequences. A common strand in this research is the expression and purification of the proteins derived from these key genes. At Edinburgh University we have founded a new Centre for Translational and Chemical Biology with central resources to facilitate the efficient production and purification of proteins. Over 50 independent research groups working on a wide range of medically and biologically important problems have pooled resources to speed up the process of producing and characterising proteins. Obtaining an accurate picture of the detailed structure of the protein (or protein complex) of interest provides a wealth of biologically important information that leads amongst other things, to the more efficient design of drugs. Thus, a clear picture of the molecular structure is an important research goal for every protein-based project. In order to examine the increased numbers of proteins generated at Edinburgh, we need another X-ray generator. This need is particularly urgent as one of our two generators has now failed irreparably. The data collection equipment (the image plate system, a kind of reusable X-ray photographic plate) is however still fully functioning and could be used on another X-ray source. We would like to buy a generator that can produce a more powerful beam so that we can collect better data from smaller crystals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F010974/1","grantId":"BB/F010974/1","fundValue":"165211","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Malcolm  Walkinshaw","coPersons":["Christopher Gavin Mowat","Paul  Taylor","Lindsay  Sawyer"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
