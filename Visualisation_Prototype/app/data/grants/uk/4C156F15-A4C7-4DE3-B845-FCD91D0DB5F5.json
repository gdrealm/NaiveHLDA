{"id":"4C156F15-A4C7-4DE3-B845-FCD91D0DB5F5","title":"The Tenth Muse: Cinema and Literature in the Early Twentieth Century","abstractText":"The project examines writing about the cinema in the early twentieth century (1895-1940). It explores the ways in which early writers about film - reviewers, critics, theorist - both developed aesthetic categories to define and accommodate ' the tenth muse' and found discursive strategies adequate to the representation of this new art and technology. It also examines literary responses to film in this period. It argues that 'discourse about the cinema' in the silent period functioned as a form of 'talking in the cinema' whereas the coming of sound in the late 1920s altered both the discursive forms taken by writing about cinema and the understanding of the film-literature relationship.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112813/1","grantId":"112813/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Laura  Marcus","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
