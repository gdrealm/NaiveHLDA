After trauma it is the commonest cause for chronic neurological disability in young adults. Although the cause of the disease is unclear it is well known that genetic factors influence susceptibility to the condition. We believe that identifying the relevant genes will provide invaluable information about the nature of the multiple sclerosis, which will ultimately lead to more effective treatments or perhaps even enable us to prevent the disease.\nFinding the handful of genes that influence susceptibility to multiple sclerosis is a little like looking for a needle in a haystack; the effects of each relevant gene are modest while the number of potentially relevant genes is large (there are around 30,000 human genes). In the past researchers were only able to look at a few genes at a time and were therefore forced to try and predict which genes were most likely to be relevant, this strategy did not prove to be at all successful. Fortunately advances in technology mean that it is now possible to be considerably more systematic and interrogate many thousands of genes simultaneously. Anticipating that this would become possible the Medical Research Council (MRC) previously funded us to collect DNA from a set of patient volunteers. Using these and other samples we joined the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) and tested 15,430 so called ?single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)? in these samples. An SNP is a change in the genetic code of a gene. These SNPs were carefully chosen and come from all over the genome. As part of the WTCCC team we tested 994 patients and 1,476 controls with these variants, a total of 38 million individual analyses. Comparing cases and controls for each of the SNPs has enabled us to identify 729 showing evidence of potential relevance in multiple sclerosis. It represents a huge effort to get to this stage.\nIn this proposal we are asking for support to test these 729 short-listed SNPs in a new set of cases (1,000) and controls (1,500) in order to refine the list and finally identify genuinely associated genes. We will then interrogate the most strongly implicated gene in fine detail in a third set of 1,000 trio families (an affected individual and their parents).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700061","grantId":"G0700061","fundValue":"255356","fundStart":"2007-10-02","fundEnd":"2010-10-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alastair  Compston","coPersons":["Alasdair  Coles","Stephen James Sawcer"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
