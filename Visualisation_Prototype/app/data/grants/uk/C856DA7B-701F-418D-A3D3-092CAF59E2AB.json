It will promote their accelerated adoption, with increased reliability, within a complex global marketplace with increasing cost constraints. Therapies and devices which facilitate the regeneration of body tissues offer the potential to revolutionise healthcare and be a catalyst for economic growth, creating a new business sector within healthcare technology. The IKC RTD will build upon the culture and research landscape of the University and its partners (industry, NHS and intermediaries/users) through the development of new innovation infrastructure and practices which deliver major clinical, health and industry outcomes.In the first year of operation the IKC has:1. Recruited and established a core innovation team to manage and grow the activities of the IKC.2. Established academic supply chain, new centre with 160 researchers.3. Won 50m new research income, funding over 120 research projects.4. Defined a new strategic framework for innovation.5. Established an innovation pipeline with stage gates and criteria for progression.6. Defined and developed the IP portfolio through definition of the unique capabilities.7. Established a pipeline of 63 collaborative innovation projects.8. Engaged with 26 different companies in collaborative innovation projects.9. Established a wider network of 80 plus companies.10. Contributed to nine new products that have reached the market.11. Defined a model for sustainability of IKC RTD.12. Received significant national and global recognition through political visits and extensive media coverage for research and innovation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I019103/1","grantId":"EP/I019103/1","fundValue":"2761090","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  High quality research and innovation platform\n&pound;95m new research income\nEstablished academic supply chain and translational capability across 250 researchers\nActive collaborations and technology validation with 9 UK HEIs, 18 academic and clinical partners\nNew Medical Technologies building and a new post of Director of Innovation in Medical Technologies\n\nSuccessful sustainable innovation\nDefined robust sustainability model \nStrategically identified and prioritised key market sectors that offer significant opportunity\nDeveloped a culture of innovation across academic, industry and clinical partnerships\nSharing innovation good practice with 9 UK HEIs and other innovation hubs at Leeds\n166 collaborative projects, 66 industry co-investors\n\nEstablished profile and reputation\nRobust brand identity and reach across the UK and beyond through targeted marketing and communications\nStrategic alignment with Regener8 giving access to a 240 industry members, 328 academics and 21 clinicians across UK\nHigh profile events with national partners to engage the community in issues that impact on medical and regenerative technology innovation.\nSignificant political visits and media coverage\n\nSuccessful innovation and translation \nEstablished Innovation system, pipeline, stage gates and criteria for progression \nDefined IP portfolio and directly funded 42 Proof of Concept and 6 Co-Development projects \nPipeline of 166 collaborative innovation projects with industry, of which 48 directly IKC funded\nContributed to the development of 46 new products that have reached the market. \nGenerated &pound;57m investment in private sector partners for development of our IP/technology and a further &pound;30m plus investment in private sector for development arising out of collaborative projects Healthcare Societal","person":"John  Fisher","coPersons":["E  Ingham","Stephen  Smye","Julia  Brown","Richard  Thorpe","Denise  Bower","Christopher J McCabe","Jennifer  Kirkham","Christopher  Clegg"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" High quality research and innovation platform\n&pound;95m new research income\nEstablished academic supply chain and translational capability across 250 researchers\nActive collaborations and technology validation with 9 UK HEIs, 18 academic and clinical partners\nNew Medical Technologies building and a new post of Director of Innovation in Medical Technologies\n\nSuccessful sustainable innovation\nDefined robust sustainability model \nStrategically identified and prioritised key market sectors that offer significant opportunity\nDeveloped a culture of innovation across academic, industry and clinical partnerships\nSharing innovation good practice with 9 UK HEIs and other innovation hubs at Leeds\n166 collaborative projects, 66 industry co-investors\n\nEstablished profile and reputation\nRobust brand identity and reach across the UK and beyond through targeted marketing and communications\nStrategic alignment with Regener8 giving access to a 240 industry members, 328 academics and 21 clinicians across UK\nHigh profile events with national partners to engage the community in issues that impact on medical and regenerative technology innovation.\nSignificant political visits and media coverage\n\nSuccessful innovation and translation \nEstablished Innovation system, pipeline, stage gates and criteria for progression \nDefined IP portfolio and directly funded 42 Proof of Concept and 6 Co-Development projects \nPipeline of 166 collaborative innovation projects with industry, of which 48 directly IKC funded\nContributed to the development of 46 new products that have reached the market. \nGenerated &pound;57m investment in private sector partners for development of our IP/technology and a further &pound;30m plus investment in private sector for development arising out of collaborative projects Exploitation and commercialisation by our industry partners Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
