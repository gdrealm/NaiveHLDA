Special consideration will be given to the impact of the Minstrelsy in Germany through the study of its reception and translation during Scott's lifetime. \nWe also aim to create a user-friendly website, containing visual images, audio files of ballad performances, contextual discussion and commentary. \nOur 21st-century approach to Scott's Minstrelsy will not only secure the first historical critical edition of one of the key texts in Scottish literature but will also lay the foundation for future use in media and education.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I500596/1","grantId":"AH/I500596/1","fundValue":"181617","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  In 2012, an educational website on Scott's Minstrelsy was created based on findings from the project, which is Open Access. \nThe project findings have been used to inform educational workshops e.g. Reiving and Bereaving and Bonnier than Moonlight (2012-13) which have involved live performances from Border singers.\nTwo large-scale concerts will take place in 2014-15 (funded by the Impact Fund, LLC, University of Edinburgh), and short films will also be made relating to performances of the Border ballads in context.

The Minstrelsy is a complex work of nearly a hundred poems and songs, many of them containing fascinating narratives of death, murder and abductions. In his extended essays on history and the supernatural, Scott gives the background to the ballad narratives - opening up a window into the life of the Scottish Borders around 1800. The edition presents Scott's original text in a new critical way, and also tells the stories behind the stories, naming the sources and singers, identifying places and bringing alive the cultural background. For the first time, the vitality of the Scottish culture and narratives of the Borders are brought to light through the research undertaken on this iconic text in Scotland's cultural memory.\nThe extraordinary range of Scott's interests have been a challenge and the work on this will contribute to the wide range of the appeal of the finished edition. \nThe edition fills a gap in three key areas of Scottish literature and culture.\n(1) Although most of Scott's work has been given full literary attention, this work, which laid the foundation of his literary career, has not been allowed to contribute to our overall understanding.\n(2) Although ballads and songs have been a central element in Scottish culture, Scott's Minstrelsy has lain outside the fold as a result of no critical edition being available.\n(3) The inclusion of the music in the edition broadens its reach, and we have been very fortunate in being able to use the tunes from the Sophia Scott manuscript, as sung in the drawing room at Abbotsford. This has previously been unavailable to scholarship. \nClose attention to the Minstrelsy reveals the roots of Scott's massive impact on Romantic perceptions and on the creation of an imagined Scotland. \nThe edition highlights the dynamic of Scott's development between his earliest attempts at poetry and the appearance of his novels.\nAn important feature of the edition is that it settles the question of authenticity in the case of each ballad by showing the relationship of Scott's published versions to the sources and parallels available to him. The educational website is already been used by schools and in university teaching. We plan to broaden its audience and its reach through an online forum and blog which will be hosted on the University of Edinburgh website commencing in November 2014, managed by Katherine Campbell and run by Kaye McAlpine and Lucy MacRae. We also hope to interest Education Scotland in the site. These initiatives, we believe, are helping to foster an interest in Scott's life and work, particularly amongst young people. \n \nThe critical edition we hope will form the foundation of much future debate and scholarship on Scott's Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and on Scott's role more widely. Until now, the lack of such an edition has prohibited this kind of discussion from taking place. Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
