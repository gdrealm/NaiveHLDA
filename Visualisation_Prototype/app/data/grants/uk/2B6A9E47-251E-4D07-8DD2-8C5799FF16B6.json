Pico (short video at http://mypico.org), under development at the University of Cambridge, is a novel system that lets you log in by waving an electronic device at your screen, without remembering any secrets or typing anything. The main problem faced by Pico is deployment: how to convince the major web sites to support it?\nThe proposed research consists of deploying Pico onto an existing high-traffic web site in the Alexa top 1000, http://gyazo.com, which already has a population of 7 million users, and to learn useful practical lessons from this deployment. These will inform and inspire further development of Pico. The experience gained will make it easier to persuade other existing sites to support Pico alongside passwords.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M019055/1","grantId":"EP/M019055/1","fundValue":"59942","fundStart":"2015-03-25","fundEnd":"2016-09-24","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Stajano","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
