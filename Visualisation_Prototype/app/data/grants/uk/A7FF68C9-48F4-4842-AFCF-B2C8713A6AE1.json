{"id":"A7FF68C9-48F4-4842-AFCF-B2C8713A6AE1","title":"Microporous materials based on Organic Molecules of Intrinsic Microporosity","abstractText":"It will be established that rigid organic molecules of concave shapes pack space very inefficiently resulting in microporous materials. This concept will be explored by linking components of well-defined shape (trigonal, cruciform, tetrahedral and octahedral) via fused rings to prepare Organic Molecules of Intrinsic Microporosity (OMIMs), which are predicted to possess a unique combination of properties (microporosity, tailorability, homogenenity, solubility in organic solvents, relatively small molecular size, fluorescence, etc.). The concept will be extended to the preparation of dendrimers derived from similar conponents and assembled using the same chemistry. It is anticipated that some of these discrete, highly defined, molecules will form organic microporous materials of surface areas in excess of 1000 m2/g as determined by gas adsorption. A network of collaborators will explore the physical properties of the OMIMs and assess their potential for a number of applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H024034/1","grantId":"EP/H024034/1","fundValue":"324136","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  McKeown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
