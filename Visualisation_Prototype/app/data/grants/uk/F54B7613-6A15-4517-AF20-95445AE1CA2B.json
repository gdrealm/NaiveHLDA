{"id":"F54B7613-6A15-4517-AF20-95445AE1CA2B","title":"Fixed-parameter algorithms and satisfiability","abstractText":"Propositional satisfiability (SAT) is the classical computationalproblem that provides a powerful and general formalism for solvingvarious important problems including hardware and softwareverification. SAT is hard to solve in the worst case; it is the firstproblem that was shown to be NP-complete by Cook in his famous 1972paper. The successful performance of today's SAT solvers is usuallyexplained by the presence of a hidden structure in problem instancesthat arise from practical applications.This project will research on algorithmic techniques for identifying ahidden structure in a problem instance, and on possibilities ofexploiting identified hidden structures for solving the instanceefficiently. We will consider a hidden structure in terms of small backdoor sets as proposed by Williams, Gomes, and Selman, 2003. Our research has theoretical and practical objectives. Our theoreticalobjectives entail the design and analysis of algorithms for backdoorset detection. In particular, we will study backdoor set detection inthe framework of parameterized complexity (Downey and Fellows1999). Practical objectives entail the implementation of thealgorithms and empirical studies of benchmark instances. A furtherobjective is to extend the research on backdoor sets to problems thatare related to or generalise SAT; that includes counting problems andconstraint satisfaction problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E001394/1","grantId":"EP/E001394/1","fundValue":"205811","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stefan  Szeider","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
