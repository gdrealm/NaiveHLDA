{"id":"FB4E388D-FC7E-4455-84F7-B672AD587AAD","title":"Penality and the Social Construction of Gender in Post-Soviet Russia: the impact prisoners' relatives of their encounters with penal Russia","abstractText":"There is a large corpus of literature about the history and culture of imprisonment in Russia and the former Soviet Unon that draws on the testimonies of former prisoners and detailed analyses of archival sources. In this literature the presence and importance of the relatives of prisoners - their wives, partners, siblings and parents - whilst acknowledged, are generally not the focus of interest even though their experiences may be no less important in shaping the understanding that Russians have of their penal past and present than those of the prisoners' themselves. Prisoners' relatives, occupying a space between 'incarceration' and 'freedom', are a type of 'quasi-prisoner', drawn into the penal system but never wholly part of it. The proposed research project will bring to foreground the experiences of this group of people, examining the nature of their encounters, both real and imagined, with the penal system and the transformative affect of these have on individual and collective identities in post-Soviet Russia. Inevitably, the research will take and historical and cultural approach since, despite the Russian government's avowed commitment to introducing into its penal institutions international standards for the humane treatment of prisoners, penal practices in the Russian Federation have strong continuities with the Soviet past, just as have popular attitudes to imprisonment. As an example, the geographical distribution of prisons in the Russian Federation laid down during the Soviet period when prisoners were used to mobilise resources in the peripheries of the state means that visitors, predominantly women, have to endure long journeys to reach penal colonies in which their relatives are incarcerated. These journeys continue a more-than-century-long tradition of women following their 'husbands' to their place of exile, a tradition that continues to shape gender identities in Russia today. Women today are less likely than some of their forebears to re-locate to places of penal exile, but the decision to undertake the journey to the penal colony, as in the past, involves a choice about whether to submit to the disciplinary control of the penal authorities. By the same token, although not courting the same dangers as in the past, the decision about whether to tell their friends, neighbours and children about their situation is a difficult one for women in Russia today, as, indeed, it is for the relatives of prisoners in other high imprisonment societies. The project is, therefore, informed by the idea that Russia's carceral archipelgo extends well beyond 'the prison walls' and is implicated in the forging of Russian culture. The project will use various accounts and representations (including fiction, documentary, popular, internet, and interviews) to explore how the experiences of quasi-prisoners have been transformed, reproduced and contested in the 20th and 21st century. Many of the sources relating to the Soviet period are available in the UK or in Russia. For the current period, the two sources key to the success of the project are a self-help website for prisoners and their families that includes postings made over a five year period in the early 2000s by visitors returning from visits to penal colonies all over Russia of which PI already has a copy, and interviews with prisoner relatives that will be conducted by a team of researchers in Russia experienced in ethnographic interview methods. The project will draw on debates in the humanities and social studies about penality, social marginalization, gender and human rights. It is cross-disciplinary, drawing upon Areas Studies background of the PI and the experiences of the research assistant in literary and historical analysis. The research will mainly take place in the UK but will require a visit to Russia for library and archive work. The principal output of the research will be a monograph, Russian-language report and dissemination workshops.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H008349/1","grantId":"AH/H008349/1","fundValue":"223817","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith  Pallot","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
