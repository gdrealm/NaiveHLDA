{"id":"85B9848E-A18D-490F-9D26-FDEAA0888AAC","title":"The Politics of History in Anglo-Norman England","abstractText":"The Politics of History in Anglo-Norman England will produce the first book-length study to provide a comprehensive overview of and an explanation for the renaissance of historical writing which took place in England between 1066 and 1140. In particular, it examines hitherto unexplored connections between the numerous saints' lives produced in this period and the much better known histories, such as those by William of Malmesbury and Geoffrey of Monmouth, arguing that these historians derived much of their politics and some of their rhetorical methods from the hagiographers who preceded them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111855/1","grantId":"111855/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Antony Hayward","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
