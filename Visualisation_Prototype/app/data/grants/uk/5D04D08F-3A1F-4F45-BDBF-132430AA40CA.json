It may cause significant economical losses to the farmers due to decrease in milk yield, abortions, infertility problems in males and females, and a loss in body weight and the value of hide. In endemic countries the loss of production, the costs of control and eradication programmes and, restriction or ban on the international trade of live animals or animal products following an outbreak are substantial. In general, poxviruses have been shown to enter the host through the skin or respiratory tract. Direct contact between infected and susceptible animals is considered to be a relatively inefficient route of the transmission of lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV). The virus is secreted in saliva, ocular and nasal discharges, and semen of the infected animals and therefore contaminated food or water and artificial insemination may serve as a source of infection. The occurrence of the disease is closely connected to warm and wet weather conditions and the abundance of insects. However, little is known about the importance of the different insect vectors in the transmission of LSDV during natural outbreaks. So far, no studies on the potential role of hard ticks in the transmission of LSDV have been carried out. In late 2008 a pilot study on the potential role of hard ticks in the transmission of LSDV was undertaken by the Capripoxvirus Reference Laboratory, IAH, UK and the Department of Veterinary Tropical Diseases, University of Pretoria, South Africa. LSD viral antigen was demonstrated in mouthparts, salivary glands and gut of three tick species, commonly found in Africa, post-feeding on the skin lesions of experimentally infected cattle. The viral antigen was also demonstrated in skin biopsies collected from the feeding sites of the infected ticks on non-infected recipient animals. In addition, viral DNA was demonstrated in eggs laid by female ticks previously fed on the skin lesions of infected cattle. Although these findings do not prove that the virus found in the ticks was still infective, it suggests that the mechanical, transstadial and transovarial transmission of LSDV may occur and further investigations are required. The aim of this study is to investigate the transmission of LSDV by three African ticks species. Laboratory-bred larvae, nymphs and adult ticks will be placed to feed on the skin of cattle experimentally infected with LSDV. Post-feeding partially engorged adult males and females or larvae hatched from eggs laid by females previously fed on LSD skin lesions will be placed to feed on the skin of non-infected animals. Nymphs will be allowed to develop to adults and then the unengorged adults will be transferred to feed on the skin of noninfected animals. The recipient animals will be closely monitored for clinical signs of LSD, samples will be collected at different intervals to detect viraemia, seroconversion and the presence of live virus in the skin of the non-infected animals. Detailed studies will be carried out on the persistence of the virus in different cell types of larvae, nymphs and adult ticks. Also, the effect of the severity of the infection in the host and of the environmental variables (temperature and humidity) on the transmission of LSDV by tick vectors and on viral multiplication rates and dissemination in ticks will be studied. The impact of the study will include the improved control of the LSD and therefore the improved welfare of the farming communities, families, nutritional and education status of the children in endemic countries. In addition, it will affect governmental policies on the international trade of live ruminants and on the potential spread of the disease caused by climate-change and an increase in abundance of tick populations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H009361/1","grantId":"BB/H009361/1","fundValue":"332236","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This study has a significant impact on better understanding of the epidemiology and transmission of lumpy skin disease affecting the control and eradication measures of the disease. In addition, the data on the role of tick vectors for LSDV have been used to suggest new recommendations set for the international trade of live cattle from infected countries given by the OIE Manual Code. Cattle in Africa are kept not only for the production of milk and meat or draft power; the socioeconomic impact of LSD for the wellbeing of poor rural communities is therefore substantial due to the total loss of production of infected animals. The control of LSDV in endemic countries is therefore of paramount importance.

Mechanical transmission of lumpy skin disease virus from the experimentally infected to naive animal was demonstrated via the mouthparts of Rhipicephalus appendicultaus male ticks \n2. After feeding on infected cattle Boophilus decoloratus females were able to pass the virus via their eggs to subsequent larvae. When these larvae were transferred to feed on naive animal it became viraemic and developed skin lesions from which viral DNA was detected using a PCR method\n3. Using PCR and virus isolation, the presence of the virus has been detected in experimentally-induced saliva samples collected from A. hebraeum and R. appendiculatus males after feeding on LSDV-infected cattle\n4. Evidence of vertical transmission of the virus by R. appendiculatus was obtained\n5. The presence of the virus was also demonstrated using immunohistochemical staining in various tick organs including midgut, salivary glands, ovaries, testes, and fat body, demonstrating that the virus was able to pass from the midgut into the haemocoel The role of ticks in transmission of LSDV should be taken into consideration in control and eradication of LSDV in infected countries and when requirements are set for the importation of live cattle from affected countries Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
