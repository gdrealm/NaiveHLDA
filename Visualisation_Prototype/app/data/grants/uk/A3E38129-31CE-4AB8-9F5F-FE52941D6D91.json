These gates play a vital role in a range of physiological processes and form a key element in the development of new drugs and delivery methods. At the moment, voltage-gated ion channel activity is controlled by thrusting an electrode into a cell excised from a human or animal in order to activate the channel and record electrical activity. This is, however, a thoroughly invasive process and it is a difficult technique to master. This proposal will investigate the use of a laser source to open voltage-gated ion channels in a minimally invasive manner. By shining the laser source - which is effectively a very high electric field - onto the cell, sufficient voltage to activate the ion channel will be provided. We will investigate Ca2+-activated K+ ion channels, but the proposed minimally-intrusive method will have potential application across a wider range of voltage-gated ion channels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E025048/1","grantId":"EP/E025048/1","fundValue":"541029","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gail  McConnell","coPersons":["John Gerald McCarron"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
