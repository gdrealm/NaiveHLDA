Political leaders generally only have a broad grasp of the range of applied issues involved in making policy - such as how to put together legislation, organisational budgets or instructions to those charged with implementation.&nbsp;They must delegate much of this policy work to bureaucrats.&nbsp;This research looks at how such delegation works in six jurisdictions - the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Germany, the United States and&nbsp; the European Union.&nbsp;It explores the development of a sample of administrative regulations in each jurisdiction and talks to the people who wrote them.&nbsp;The patterns and norms of supervision and approval as well as the basis on which such officials exercise discretion when developing policy will be contrasted to explore cross-national variations in the conflict between hierarchy and expertise highlighted in the theoretical work of, among others, Max Weber and Alvin Gouldner.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1451","grantId":"RES-000-22-1451","fundValue":"20358","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward Charles Page","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
