Underpinning this ability are mental representations for things, events, properties and abstract notions. While the representation of concrete objects and physical actions is at least partly understood, far less is known about how abstract words and concepts are represented. Understanding how abstract words are represented (and learnt) is critical because it is the existence of culturally-bounded abstract concepts, expressed in different languages with words that often cannot be easily translated that makes social groups different from one another. Moreover, the ability to understand abstract words is crucial for scolastic achievement given that it is a prerequisite to understanding a large number of concepts both in the sciences as well as in the humanities.\n\n\n\nThe present project investigates how the meaning of words, both words referring to concrete objects and actions as well as words referring to abstract entities, are represented. It sets to investigate especially the degree of embodiment in language (i.e., the extent to which motor, sensory and affective experience needs to be engaged in order to understand language. \n\n\n\nThe specific questions addressed are: (1) Is experiential information foundational (primary and necessary) to semantic representation? We assess the extent to which access to linguistic meaning implies automatic access to non-linguistic perceptual and affective information. As reviewed and discussed in Meteyard et al (2011), the answer to this question is that experiential information is necessary, but without engaging low-level systems. Nonetheless, it is the case that even for abstract words and concepts experiential affective information is retrieved during preconscious processing of words.\n\n\n\n (2) Does the role of specific types of experiential information (sensory/motor vs. affective) differ across domains of knowledge (concrete vs. abstract)? We contrast hypotheses according to which abstract knowledge, just like concrete knowledge, is crucially linked to the sensory-motor system to hypotheses in which it is, instead, primarily linked to the affective system. Our work clearly supports a view in which abstract concepts and words are grounded in our affective system. This, however, does not imply that there is no connection with sensorimotor systems. It is the case, in fact, that motor system engagement for abstract words and concepts might come about as a consequence of engaging motivational systems driving approach and avoidance behaviours. \n\n\n\nThis work has clear potential implications for education: we hypothesised that the observed relationship between abstract concepts and emotion is there because children begin to develop the ontological distinction between concrete entities (those occurring in the physical environment outside) and abstract entities (those occurring inside the individual) by realising that some words trigger an emotional response in their caregivers, hence they are linked to internal states. If this is the case, then it is possible that emotional development is a prerequisite to learning abstract words and concepts. We have recently begun a new project, sponsored by the Nuffield Trust that investigate precisely this idea in children (typically developing, autistic and with specific language impairments). The current project has been essential in securing the initial evidence that has led then to the more directly applied research we are conducting now into the role of affective development for abstract knowledge. The ESRC funded project has provided the critical initial evidence for a role for emotional development in learning abstract concepts. This hypothesis is currently under scrutiny in a project sponsored by the Nuffield Foundation. The outcomes of this latter project may have direct implications for educators.
