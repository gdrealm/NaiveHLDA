The device will both keep the cells alive indefinitely and also be able to detect the level of fluorescent green colour they produce in order to measure the concentration of the chemical weapons.\n Chemical weapons remain a danger in mainland Europe as a legacy of World War II and today the governments of several countries, including Belgium, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom remain actively engaged in locating and destroying old weapons and unexploded ordnance. Outside Europe many countries, ranging from developed (USA) to developing (Angola) typically retain chemical weapons capabilities measured by tonnage. As such there is an increasing need to detect the presence of chemical warfare agents in a manner that is sensitive, robust and reliable enough to safeguard as many lives as possible. \n Currently most devices used by the military to check for the presence of chemical weapons work by using non-living material such as small chemicals, DNA or antibodies to detect chemical weapons in similar way to how pregnancy tests work. \nDrawbacks to this 'molecule-based' approach are limited sensitivity, shelf-life and limited flexibility due to the need to often combine recognition of a particular chemical and detection within the same molecule. Living cells can detect compounds with extremely high sensitivity, the most famous example being sniffer dogs, but even their highly-sensitive sense of smell is eclipsed by that of bears who can reportedly detect food 18 miles distant.\n We seek to directly harness the detection abilities of cells by actually having living cells resident within our proposed detection device. We will, for the first time, integrate three different technologies to build a 'living biosensor' device:\n\n- Bioreactors allow cells to be grown and stimulated in a finely defined manner by providing a closed, controlled environment. This is used at large scales to grow cells to high density when making biological medicines such as hormones or antibodies. We have miniaturised bio-reactors down to a 'micro-' scale where controlled-environments cell growth chambers can be added to desktop or laptop-sized devices. \n\n- The patterns of genes within cells can now be re-designed to make networks to give cells abilities chosen by the designer. We propose designing such a gene network that allows living cells to function as a component of a desktop or laptop-sized device. The 'synthetic' gene network will enable the cells to respond to the presence of chemical warfare agents by producing a fluorescent green protein or, in future, any other response that best suits the overall design of the detection device. \n\n- The miniaturised, 'micro-scale' bioreactor will also require microscale plumbing and electronics to enable it to keep the cells alive and reliably detect levels of the fluorescent green protein. This requires cutting-edge micro-scale fabrication technology to make components at this scale for the first time. \n\nCombining these three approaches in a unified goal of improved worldwide chemical weapons detection is a new approach and the technical insights that come from our efforts is likely to underpin many other new applications of these technologies in areas such as medical diagnosis and detection of contamination in food, medicines or clothes manufacture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J020605/1","grantId":"BB/J020605/1","fundValue":"76355","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are exploring the use of the developed device with a CPI in the UK.
