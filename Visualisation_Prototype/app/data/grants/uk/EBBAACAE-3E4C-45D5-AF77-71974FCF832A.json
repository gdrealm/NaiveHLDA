{"id":"EBBAACAE-3E4C-45D5-AF77-71974FCF832A","title":"The Making of Charlemagne's Europe (768-814)","abstractText":"The reign of Charlemagne (768-814) saw the incorporation of most continental Western regions into the Frankish empire, resulting in the establishment of new forms of rule and a new kind of political culture, with far-reaching implications for later European history. 'The Making of Charlemagne's Europe' project is intended to document this change not simply from the perspective of central Frankish authority and the rarefied realm of high politics, but on the ground and in the localities, in an effort to grasp its practical and material impact.\\n\\nThe only way to achieve this is to look to the only type of source capable of conveying information at both ends of the scale, from the royal to the local: documents known as charters. Some of these, termed diplomas by modern scholars, were issued by rulers, but the vast majority, termed private charters, were issued by non-royal persons, including some churchmen, but more often laypeople. Whereas narrative sources, such as annals, hardly ever mention anyone outside the immediate entourage of the king, charters allow access, often of a very direct and personal kind, to broader sections of the population from regional elites to local peasant landowners.\\n\\nLand transactions were crucial in forming and maintaining relationships between institutions, families and individuals, and therefore belong in the social and political realm as much as in that of economic history. The predominance of monastic archives gives a distinctly ecclesiastical slant to the surviving record, but this makes it no less illuminating: monasteries, far from being withdrawn from politics, were the front-line representatives of Carolingian power as well as some of its main beneficiaries, and temporary grants from church and monastic lands were an important way of rewarding followers and sustaining secular rule.\\n\\nCharlemagne's reign corresponds to an exceptional peak in the documentary record, with some 4,500 surviving documents - more than for any other early medieval reign. Though their distribution is patchy, charters have been preserved from all the main regions of Charlemagne's empire. Bringing them together will allow genuine cross-regional comparison, something which has never been done before in a systematic way. This will give the project the combination of a high level of precision in local detail and a bird's eye view of the whole empire required to answer some of the most important questions related to Charlemagne's empire: above all, what made it an empire after the initial stage of conquest? What impact did it have on the ground?\\n\\nThe project will seek to answer these questions through the creation of a database extracting information from all surviving documentary sources from the reign of Charlemagne, in a fully relational, searchable format. This will make this material comparable in a way that simply reproducing the Latin text would not. It will not only facilitate the exploration of personal and political networks for particular individuals, but also bring to light more complex patterns through the development of mapping and statistical tools, to allow questioning on more structural lines (to answer questions such as, for example: were there regional differences in the types or the extent of property transacted by women?). We will therefore be able to test and evaluate the issue of regional difference with far greater rigour than has so far been possible.\\n\\nBeyond serving our own research objectives, the database will also constitute a lasting resource open to many different avenues of questioning. It will be accessible, online and for free, to anyone interested, whether academics, graduate or undergraduate students, A-level pupils or members of the public. As well as answering crucial questions on the nature of empire-building in the early middle ages, it will be a genuinely democratic resource, presenting in immediately usable form an extraordinarily rich and rewarding type of material.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I026677/1","grantId":"AH/I026677/1","fundValue":"666975","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alice  Rio","coPersons":["Janet L Nelson","John Douglas Bradley"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
