We are exposed to nanoparticles in busy streets as they are present in traffic exhaust produced from combustion of fuel and these nanoparticles are considered to be important in causing the harmful effects of air pollution. There are other situations where nanoparticles are found in the air because of the normal chemical reactions that occur in air, in plumes of volcanic ash and in some dusty workplaces. However, a new source of novel types of nanoparticles has arisen with the rise of nanotechnology. Part of nanotechnology aims to design and develop new nanoparticles, because they have properties which make them attractive to industry for a range of purposes. This has caused alarm bells to ring since perhaps some of these new types of nanoparticles could be harmful. For these reasons there is a need for testing of these new nanoparticles. The huge number of nanoparticle types and their variants in size and coatings mean that there are a huge number of particles to be tested and new ones are being produce all the time. However, there is huge ethical pressure against animal testing and so short-term tests that use cells instead of animals are needed. To carry out such testing it is necessary to know which tests to carry out and a thorough knowledge of how particles cause cell damage and disease would greatly help in choosing the tests. This project puts forward a study that aims to relate the physico-chemical characteristics of the particles, such as size and surface chemistry, with the activation of the process of inflammation. Inflammation has been chosen because it is key response seen when there is injury to the body and inflammation itself plays a role in leading to disease. This approach, trying to relate chemical structure to cellular response, represents an approach that could provide the essential information on how we can test the large number of nanoparticle types that need to be tested.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701323","grantId":"G0701323","fundValue":"456222","fundStart":"2008-11-24","fundEnd":"2011-11-23","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kenneth  Donaldson","coPersons":["Ian  Megson","William  MacNee","Mark  Bradley"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
