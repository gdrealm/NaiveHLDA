Moreover, in general, recursive query plans are\nneeded to provide the maximum information as answer to a query. In the project\nLIQUID (Logic-based Integration of Unindexed Internet Data), we address the\nproblem of integrating Deep Web sources and making them queryable through a\nglobal schema, representing all underlying data. The global schema employs\nconstraints to model properties of the domain of interest, which are not\nnecessarily reflected by the data stored at the heterogeneous sources. In this\nproject we plan to study formalisms to represent Deep Web integration systems,\nand to devise scalable query processing techniques for such systems. We plan\nto study static and dynamic techniques to reduce the query processing cost, by\nemploying logic-based reasoning techniques on constraints and access\nlimitations. We plan to build a prototype implementing our findings. LIQUID\nwill face ambitious challenges, due to the variety of formalisms and problems\ninto play.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L003260/1","grantId":"EP/L003260/1","fundValue":"89494","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The current findings, at the present stage of development, haven't yet been used in real-world scenarios.

More results are on the way, which will be disseminated later in the course of the grant schedule. We plan to employ our findings in several scenarios, including (but not limited to) semantic search on the Deep Web (integrated with Linked Data sets) in the agricultural sector, to improve the matching of demand and supply in electronic marketplaces. The applications are potentially manifold, and they will further studied later in the grant schedule.
