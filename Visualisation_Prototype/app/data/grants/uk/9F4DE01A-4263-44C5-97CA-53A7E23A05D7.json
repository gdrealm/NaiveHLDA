The Politics of Educated Unemployed Youth","abstractText":"<p>An increase in individuals' investment in schooling combined with a shortage of salaried jobs has created a crisis of educated unemployment in the global South.The rise of the &quot;educated unemployed youth&quot; raises pressing questions about politics, social change, and the role of education in development. But these questions have tended to be only the subject of journalistic conjecture.The project goals are therefore:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>To provide one of the first ethnographic examinations of educated unemployed young people's political practices in South Asia to contribute to scholarly literature on young people, civil society, education, globalisation, and &quot;youth&quot; as a political category.</li>\n\n <li>To develop a new paradigm for analyzing the political practices of youth, one that examines durable social inequalities as well as surprising cross-class mobilisation.</li>\n\n <li>To move beyond media stereotypes of youth - for example as &quot;heroes&quot; or &quot;villains&quot; - to publicise the diverse roles played by young people in processes of democratic change.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The six project team members will achieve these goals by conducting a comparative ethnography of educated unemployed youth politics in north India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. They will employ varied research methodologies, including semi-structured interviews, focus groups, participant observation and life histories. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J011444/1","grantId":"ES/J011444/1","fundValue":"943926","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We have given seminars on our work in South Asia, engaged with NGO actors, given papers at major conferences, and published research articles connected to our research.

These findings have major implications for academic and public understanding of youth across the world and South Asian young people in particular (who constitute a staggering 10% of the world's population if defined as those aged 10-35). We are currently analyzing and writing about much of our research - reflecting the fact that the grant still has two years to run - but we have already begun to produce high impact outputs, including several research papers, n award-winning documentary film, numerous pieces for the broadcast media, seminars with practitioners, and articles in major newspapers.\n\nAmong the key findings of the intensive social research that we have conducted in South Asia are the insight that educated unemployed youth are involved in a range of entrepreneurial activities at the ground level, often surviving economically through combining legal and illegal, local and non-local, and paid and unpaid work. One interesting dimension of this entrepreneurial activity in the north Indian case is educated unemployed young people's involvement in collecting caterpillar fungus which is sold to traders and used in Chinese traditional medicine, see http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18735544\n\nEducated unemployed young people are centrally important, too, in a social sense, offering relatives, friends, and wider sections of their village communities or urban neighbourhoods with assistance with regard to issues relating to education, health, infrastructure, and work. These processes play out differently in Sri Lanka, India and Nepal but are observable in all three places, and they fundamentally challenge some of the North Africa and Indian depictions of youth as aimless or engaged only in 'timepass'.\n\nThe involvement of young people in politics varies more markedly, but in none of our research sites do unemployed youth participate in the type of destructive and violent politics that sometimes feature prominently in academic and media depictions of this population. In Nepal youth youth are sometimes heavily involved in formal political activity and politically-motivated NGOs (as Amanda Snellinger's work has shown) and India, where youth are more involved in everyday forms of politicking (often community-based activism), and Sri Lanka where educated unemployed young people's involvement in politics is closely circumscribed by the state. This necessarily interim set of reflections will no doubt be modified in the light of further analysis and reflection, including discussions we will have at a major conference on our work in May 2015 in Oxford. The manner in which our findings will be taken forward in the future is the key question that we will be addressing during the final two years of the project, not least through writing new grant applications. \n\nIt is nevertheless possible to note in a preliminary manner some of the general ways in which this project will contribute to academic knowledge of South Asia and 'the public good' much more broadly conceived. Our research findings are already being used to enhance children's learning in schools in the UK and USA. We are contributing to public understanding of youth in South Asia via our work with the media. We are shaping policy through the manner in which disseminate results among practitioners, and at a more mundane level we are using our research findings to inform and further our work as teachers within our respective universities.
