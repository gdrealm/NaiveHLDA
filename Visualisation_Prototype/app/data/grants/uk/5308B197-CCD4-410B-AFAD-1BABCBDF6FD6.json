Others, by contrast, maintain casual drug use, but ultimately stop before incurring serious damage. Although the risk of becoming addicted largely depends upon whether one has an ?addictive personality?, the exact nature of this personality remains unclear. To improve our understanding of the risk factors for addiction, we plan to test whether addicts, in contrast to casual users, are less able to inhibit drug seeking behaviour in the laboratory in the face of knowledge that this behaviour is no longer rewarding, is actively causing harm, or is inappropriate in the context. Such experimental data would confirm the clinical impression that addiction is caused by an inability to inhibit drug seeking in the face of knowledge of the negative consequences of this behaviour. In addition, the laboratory methods developed in the project could provide a screening instrument for the addictive personality, and the insight gained into addiction would justify funding for treatments that target addicts? perception of drug harm.\nThe frontal cortex is a brain region that sits just behind the eyes, where options are considered before action judged beneficial is undertaken. It has been suggested that addicts have damage in this area, which reduces the weight given to the negative consequences when considering whether to engage in drug seeking. To test this hypothesis, we will measure activity in the frontal cortex while addicts and casual drug users consider undertaking drug seeking that is potentially harmful. If addicts show a reduced signal for this harm compared to causal users, which predicts the continuation of drug seeking despite the harm, we will be able to conclude that a flaw in the frontal cortex confers a neurobiological risk factor for the addictive personality and addiction. This conclusion would support pharmacological treatments that seek to correct this brain abnormality. \nThe final part of the project aims to test whether our laboratory measure of the addictive personality provides an accurate screening instrument for adolescents who are at risk of becoming drug addicted. These data would support a prevention strategy that identifies and informs these adolescents of their susceptibility before they become addicted, and in particular, seeks to enhance their understanding of the negative consequences of drug seeking.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701456","grantId":"G0701456","fundValue":"353325","fundStart":"2008-10-20","fundEnd":"2011-10-19","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Lee  Hogarth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
