{"id":"3BC9136A-29F7-49AA-99C1-D1D9896A3950","title":"Delivering low-cost, high-throughput root phenotyping screens for arable crops","abstractText":"Plant roots are essential for the uptake of water and nutrients from soil. Consequently, root growth has significant effects on crop establishment and yield. Previous work by the project team, and others, has shown strong relationships between early root growth traits and the performance of arable crops in the field. However, measuring roots and selecting varieties with improved root systems in the field is time consuming, laborious and expensive. Using laboratory techniques, root growth can be measured quickly and cheaply - for 1000s of plants a year. Genotypes with better root growth and root architectures can be identified in the laboratory and assessments of selected plants can be made under field conditions to validate laboratory screens and assess field performance.\n\nIn this proposal we will use low cost, high-throughput methods to define the early root system of &gt;1,600 different oilseed rape (OSR), barley and wheat genotypes in the laboratory. The roots of individual plants will be imaged at two time points. These images will then be analysed to determine the number of roots, root branching rates, root lengths, root growth rates and root angles. To validate and test the utility of measurements made in the laboratory, we will compare them with (1) measurements of root systems made in the field, and (2) data collected from new and legacy field trials assessing large numbers of new crop varieties for National and Recommended Lists to identify root traits correlated with establishment and yield for breeding.\n\nRoot growth and architecture are genetically controlled. We will identify genetic loci in large populations of OSR, barley and wheat affecting root growth and architecture traits that correlate with resource acquisition, establishment and yield in the field. An understanding of how best to combine beneficial alleles will be assessed through modelling approaches. To identify genetic targets for breeding we will develop mathematical models describing root growth and architecture in OSR that incorporate the effects of genetic variation. These mathematical models will be extended to predict the effects of root architecture on P acquisition and, thereby, identify potential genotypes with improved rooting and greater P acquisition for sustainable agriculture.\n\nIn summary, this proposal will deliver low cost, high-throughput platforms for root phenotyping. These will be of direct benefit to the breeding industry, allowing them to assess germplasm for root growth and architecture that correlate with improved establishment and yield. Genetic loci affecting root growth and architecture will be identified to accelerate the breeding of new varieties. Mathematical models will allow genotypes associated with improved root systems to be identified.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J019631/1","grantId":"BB/J019631/1","fundValue":"261006","fundStart":"2012-11-19","fundEnd":"2015-11-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Thehigh-throughput root phenotyping screen that we are deploying in our project is starting to be used by various agricultural companies to assess early-stage root traits.

We have phenotyped &gt;25k individual Brassica napus plants (&gt;900 accessions; n=24 replicates). These accessions include the 'ASSYST' population (&gt;400 accessions) that is enabling Association Transcriptomics within a strategic LoLa grant. Wheat root phenotyping of ~90 elite varieties began ahead of schedule in Sept. 2014. The elite varieties were selected following industry consultation. Phenotyping of these elite varieties will be completed in early 2015. At the James Hutton Institute (JHI), the juvenile root systems of &gt;600 barley genotypes have been phenotyped using a higher-throughput system that was used previously to phenotype roots of Brassica napus accessions. Using the same germination paper, we have also developed a higher-resolution phenotyping system using flatbed scanners (Adu et al., 2014). This lower-throughput technique is effective for capturing dynamic root systems required for modelling. This technique has also been calibrated with soil-based rhizotrons.\n\nSuccessful field experiments have been completed at two field-sites in 2012/13 and 2013/14 (Bingham, Notts.; Deeping St. Nicholas, Lincs., trials conducted by Elsoms Seeds). A third season of field experiments was drilled at two sites in Lincs. in Sept. 2014 (one near Grantham and again at Deeping St. Nicholas). Triplicate plots of 10 m x 1.8 m (32 varieties, mostly Recommended List) were drilled. Plants (n=&gt;5) were sampled from each plot at ~6-leaf stage; roots were washed, imaged and measured. We observed significant correlations (r=0.4-0.5) between field plot yields and root phenotypes observed on filter paper for three of the four site/year combinations. Field emergence at Bingham correlated with root phenotypes on filter paper. Larger-scale root-phenotyping was conducted at flowering in April 2014 at Bingham. The samples were collected in acetate tubes (5 cm diameter, 100 cm length) and frozen. A core-break method has been developed to image and count roots at 5 cm intervals in the soil profile. Differences between genotypes have been identified during method development, and will be explored further in the coming year and with at least one of the additional field trials in 2015.\n\nA database for images/data has been established at JHI. This includes a primary image database of raw and processed images for running automated root-architectural analyses. Another database is being established to store root-architectural data from individual plants in preparation for statistical analyses and root modelling.\n\nAll root modelling is on schedule as per the original objectives. A model framework has been developed and is being parameterised using project data. \n\nMarkers and transcript data for QTL and eQTL genetic mapping analyses have been developed for Temple x Canard (TC) mapping population (~150 lines). Leaf RNA was extracted and library construction/sequencing was completed by The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC). We have identified &gt;14k SNPs (in collaboration with Jay Moore and Graham Teakle, at the University of Warwick) and a genetic map for this population should be completed by December 2014. This map will be used for (1) root and shoot trait QTL analyses, and (2) expression QTL analyses (eQTL; in collaboration with John Hammond at the University of Reading). In the Tapidor x Ningyou-7 (TN) population, putative loci affecting root traits under low and high phosphorus (P) supply have been identified using a new SNP-based map provided by Shi Lei (Huazhong Agriculture University; project partner not funded directly by CIRC) and these are being fine-mapped. Novel genetic loci associated with root-architectural traits will also be identified in the ASSYST population of Brassica napus using Association Transcriptomics. The project is ongoing, we are hoping that findings will be taken forward following future dissemination activities. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
