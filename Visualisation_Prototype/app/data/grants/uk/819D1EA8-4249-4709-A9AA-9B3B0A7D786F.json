In this research we propose the construction of a new biocompatible hybrid material made of the protein apoferritin and a semiconductor nanocrystal (quantum dot) that has better fluorescence properties than currently used fluorescent dyes. This could be used as a tool in the study of both healthy and diseased cells to identify fundamental biochemical processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601768","grantId":"G0601768","fundValue":"104201","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil R Thomas","coPersons":["Amalia  Patane"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
