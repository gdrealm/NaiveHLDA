Consequently it is capable of protecting itself against infections entering from the blood by mounting a vigorous immune response. The earliest response triggered is called the 'innate immune response' and this is very old in evolutionary terms. We believe that this response will be critical in determining the outcome of liver damage. Such responses may be effective at removing the infectious organism but in the process may cause 'collateral' damage to the liver and to counteract this the liver can regenerate and thereby restore normal tissue architecture and function. If the balance between the immune response and the repair response is not carefully controlled the result is persistent, irreversible tissue damage, scarring and eventually cancerous change. The liver cell types most commonly targetted in these process, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes contribute to persistent damage by secreting factors that promote continuing activation of the immune system which leads to more damage and eventually to the development of a cancerous transformation of the liver cells. We propose that a family of proteins called tumour necrosis factor receptors found on the surface of liver cells are critical in determining whether injury results in removal of the injurious factor, regeneration, repair and full recovery or continuing damage, scarring and cancerous change. These receptors are activated by specific factors (ligands) in the local environment and the outcone of such activation is important for a wide range of cell functions including determining whether a cell dies or proliferates. If a cell continues in the proliferative state control is lost and it can become a cancerous cell. Thus how, when and where these receptors are activated will determine the balance between resolution/regeneration on one hand and persistent damage and cancerous change on the other. We have developed techniques to grow human cells out of liver tissue that is removed during liver transplantation allowing us to set up systems to study these processes using human liver cells rather than relying on animal models which do not always accurately represent what takes place in humans. We shall now use the human cells in tissue culture to investigate how the tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFr) determine the balance between liver damage and repair and their involvement in cancerous change in the liver. We plan to carry out specific experiments to determine a) the factors that control whether TNF receptors are present in the liver b) how these receptors control the fate of liver cells c) how the 'innate' immune system can activate these processes. d) whether this response can lead to cancerous change in liver cells These studies will tell us a great deal about how the liver responds to injury and the role of the innate immune system in this process. The results will not only provide new information on how the normal liver functions and responds to damage but may also suggest new approaches to developing therapies in which the liver response to injury can be manipulated in favour of regeneration and repair without risking cancerous change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E017096/1","grantId":"BB/E017096/1","fundValue":"383430","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Afford","coPersons":["Stephen Peter Young","Jorge  Caamano","David Harvey Adams"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
