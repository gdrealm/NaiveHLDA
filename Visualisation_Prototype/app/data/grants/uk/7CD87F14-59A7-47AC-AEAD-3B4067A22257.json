{"id":"7CD87F14-59A7-47AC-AEAD-3B4067A22257","title":"So Exotic, So Homemade: English Surrealism and the Photographic Documents","abstractText":"The book examines the relationship between documentary photography and Surrealism in England in the 1930s and 1940s. It will focus on the ways these elements come together in the work of artists such as Paul Nash, Eileen Agar, Bill Brandt, Roland Penrose, Lee Miller and Humphrey Jennings. The study will continue through the Second World War, when it will focus on the photography representations of the Blitz, and conclude in the post-war years, as those relationships shift in a period of great change in English culture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112807/1","grantId":"112807/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2006-04-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Christopher Walker","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Wales, Newport","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
