{"id":"2E05F8A6-5DAC-4310-B62E-F7FBB0BF49A8","title":"The Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics","abstractText":"The goal of the Centre is to understand the genetics of a range of common causes of psychiatric disorders and dementia and to use this understanding to improve the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. Genes play an important role in disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, attention deficit disorder, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. The genetics of these common disorders is complex and it is likely that many genes are involved. However, using modern genetic methods it is now possible to begin to identify the specific genetic abnormalities that underlie common diseases. The core of the Centre?s mission over the next 5 years will be to continue work aimed at identifying genes underlying all of the above disorders. However, there will be an increasing emphasis upon using the knowledge gained to benefit patients via improved understanding of disease mechanisms, better diagnosis and ultimately the development of new treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801418","grantId":"G0801418","fundValue":"2493180","fundStart":"2009-08-03","fundEnd":"2014-08-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael John Owen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
