{"id":"DF9616BB-4442-42A5-A3A3-5D0F64C21DAB","title":"Exploring cultural impact on segmentation and first word recognition","abstractText":"<p>Like Dutch and Parisian French infants, British 7.5-month-old infants familiarised with isolated two-syllable words with the accentual pattern most typical of their language fail to recognise (segment) these words when they are embedded within sentences. However, North American infants (learning English in the US or Canadian French in Montreal) are reported to segment passages with familiarised words at this age, using the same paradigm. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that differences in the input to American as compared with British infants may lead to these observed differences in experimental findings.</p>\n\n<p>The study will explore how differences in the Infant Directed Speech (IDS) to which American and British infants are exposed (based on audio recordings) may relate to differences in their performance on perception experiments (using the Head Turn [HT] paradigm). The specific objectives are to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Establish the basic group-age profile for infant segmentation and isolated word form recognition in the UK and the US.</li>\n\n <li>Establish characteristics of IDS as regards quantity, structure and prosody in each country.</li>\n\n <li>Explore the link between the differences in performance on the HT task in the two locations and the differential characteristics of IDS. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3331","grantId":"RES-000-22-3331","fundValue":"82146","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tamar  Keren-Portnoy","coPersons":["Rory  DePaolis","Marilyn  Vihman"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
