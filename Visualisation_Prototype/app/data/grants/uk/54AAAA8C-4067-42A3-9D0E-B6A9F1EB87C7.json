Fatal disease in domestic animals results in severe economic losses; the bacteria can also persist undetected in food animals causing very serious problems to the food industry due to the high incidence of food poisoning. So far it has been difficult to control Salmonella infections using hygiene and biosecurity measures and an increasing number of salmonellae are becoming resistant to numerous drugs. Some of the currently used vaccines against S. enterica, that have been generated mainly though empirical research, confer a moderate, albeit suboptimal, level of protection against colonisation and/or disease. Recent advances in immunology and bacterial genetics offer the possibility to improve vaccine design and delivery, and this process would be empowered by a thorough understanding of how the infection process develops in the presence of different types of immunological pressure. We propose a novel multidisciplinary approach to analyse, in vivo, how different classes of vaccines and types of immune response affect bacterial growth, death, spread and distribution (population dynamics) in the host. The work will develop through different levels of complexity spanning from the analysis of the effects of vaccines and immunity on the direct interactions between individual bacteria and host cells (focal dynamics) to the analysis of how individual molecularly tagged populations of bacteria spread and grow into and between different organs (global dynamics). The interactions between bacteria and cells at the level of individual infection foci (focal dynamics) will be captured by advanced microscopy techniques that allow the observation of fluorescent S. enterica in cells and tissues. The global dynamics of the infection will be studied by monitoring the numerical and spatial fluctuations of distinct bacterial subpopulations each carrying individual DNA tags ('molecular labels') in their genome. This biological research will be integrated with the predictive and resolving power of mathematical models in a series of iterative processes whereby biology and mathematics will synergise and inform each other for a truly advanced understanding of the infection process. The novelty of the biological and mathematical approaches that we shall use is in the unraveling of the infection scenarios across different scales (systems biology research). This will lead to the analysis and reconstruction of the infection processes from their individual biological elements and to the creation of a new paradigm for the study of within-host dynamics of infection that will be extendable to a broad range of pathogens in many animal species and in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I002189/1","grantId":"BB/I002189/1","fundValue":"670382","fundStart":"2011-03-18","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The work has not had an impact beyond academia due to the seminal nature of the research.

We have found that a live Salmonella vaccine significantly reduced bacteraemia during a secondary challenge and restrained inter-organ spread of the bacteria in the systemic organs. Further, fitting mechanistic models to the data indicated that live vaccine immunisation enhanced both the bacterial killing in the very early stages of the infection and bacteriostatic control over the first day post-challenge. T-cell immunity induced by this vaccine is not necessary for the enhanced bacteriostasis but is required for subsequent bactericidal clearance of Salmonella in the blood and tissues. Conversely, a non-living vaccine while able to enhance initial blood clearance and killing of virulent secondary challenge bacteria, was unable to alter the subsequent bacterial growth rate in the systemic organs, did not prevent the resurgence of extensive bacteraemia and failed to control the spread of the bacteria in the body. This work will have important implication for the choice of vaccines to be used in systemic salmonelloses. The work illustrated that it is necessary to develop better live attenuated vaccines because there are superior to non-living preparations.
