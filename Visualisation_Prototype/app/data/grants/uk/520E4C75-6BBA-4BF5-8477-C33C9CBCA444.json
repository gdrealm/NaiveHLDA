{"id":"520E4C75-6BBA-4BF5-8477-C33C9CBCA444","title":"Monitoring your local environmental change (Fife)","abstractText":"<p>Monitoring Your Local Environment (MYLE) - Engagement of the general public, including school pupils, with scientific topics, such as the outcomes and effects of climate change, is a challenging task. One way to develop an understanding of science, and for example explain the impacts of climate change, is to engage young people in research projects; this project focuses on monitoring and investigating the local and familiar environment in which school pupils live. By empowering pupils to design and undertake a local research project, pupils will develop more independent learning skills and will specifically understand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>what science is and how it is conducted</li>\n\n <li>how to set up hypotheses to test</li>\n\n <li>how to collect good quality data</li>\n\n <li>how to analyse data</li>\n\n <li>how to present results</li>\n\n <li>how to construct a discussion and defend results. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project is intended to be long-term and continue after duration of this grant, and the expected outcome is that research projects will be handed on to younger pupils year after year, and the datasets collected will develop into time series of changes in their environments.</p>\n\n<p>The project wil support the purchase of hand-held GPS systems for use in secondary schools, and training will be provided in research design, global positioning systems (GPS),&nbsp; use of basic hand-held GPS systems, and how to collect a diverse suite of data that allows them to monitor their environment and how to analyse data in a&nbsp; basic Open Source Geographical Information Systems (GIS) system.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0133","grantId":"RES-168-26-0133","fundValue":"1953","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ruth Alison Robinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
