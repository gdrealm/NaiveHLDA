The requirement for the cleanliness of steels has increased drastically due to the development high speed transportation and smart devises. The conventional clean steel processing technologies cannot meet the new requirement and are also energy intensive. The proposal will develop a novel processing method for the production of super clean steel with significantly reduced energy cost.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J011460/1","grantId":"EP/J011460/1","fundValue":"295990","fundStart":"2012-10-14","fundEnd":"2015-01-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The samples have been examined by TATA Steel technology centre.
