Proof of principle study","abstractText":"One in six women will suffer a miscarriage during their lifetime. Some women have repeated miscarriages which can be devastating both emotionally and physically. Caring for women with miscarriage is also very expensive and estimated to cost the NHS over &pound;250 million per year in England and Wales. \n\nSome miscarriages may be due to vaginal or genitourinary infections spreading up into the womb. New research suggests that infection with recently discovered chlamydia related bacteria which cause cows to miscarry might do the same in humans. But we do not know how common these infections are in healthy pregnant women, nor whether women who are infected really are more likely to suffer a miscarriage.\n\nThirteen years ago, 1200 newly pregnant women attending general practices and family planning clinics in south London agreed to help in our research looking at infections and miscarriage. They provided self-taken vaginal samples and urine specimens when they were less than 10 weeks pregnant, and completed questionnaires both at 16 weeks and after the birth. The questionnaires asked about miscarriages or the baby being born early - before 37 weeks of pregnancy. We found that a vaginal infection called bacterial vaginosis was associated with late miscarriage at 13-15 weeks. This important finding was published in the British Medical Journal. As a result some women with bacterial vaginosis may now be treated with antibiotics to try to prevent them from miscarrying. We now want to see if the same may be true for chlamydia related bacteria.\n\nWe still have stored frozen urine samples provided by 915 of the women. We have checked a few of the samples to make sure they are adequately preserved and that we can detect chlamydia related bacteria. We now want to test all the samples to see if women infected with chlamydia related bacteria were more likely to suffer a miscarriage before 16 weeks than those who weren't infected. The study will also provide important information on how comon these infections are during pregnancy, which women are more likely to be infected, and whether the infections may also be associated with babies being born too early.\n\nThe strengths of the study are that it is based in the community rather than in hospital, the women were only just pregnant-average 7 weeks, over 99% of the women followed up at 16 weeks, and we will be using exciting new tests. As we already have the samples and have shown that the tests work well, the study is also relatively low cost and low risk.\n\nIf we find that chlamydia related bacteria are associated with miscarriage, further research might show whether testing and treating women for these infections may prevent some miscarriages. Ultimately this might lead to changes in clinical practice both nationally and internationally, benefit the health of women and their babies, and save healthcare costs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K027050/1","grantId":"MR/K027050/1","fundValue":"62147","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Pippa  Oakeshott","coPersons":["Fiona  Reid","Phillip  Hay","Jorgen Skov Jensen"],"organisation":"St George's University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
