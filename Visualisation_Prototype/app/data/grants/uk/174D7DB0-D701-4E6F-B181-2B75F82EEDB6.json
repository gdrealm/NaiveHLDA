The available evidence strongly indicates that the IMM is a region in which information about the imprinting stimulus is stored as a result of learning. Recent research supported by the BBSRC has shown that sleep during a period shortly after training is required for stabilization of neuronal responsiveness in the IMM to an imprinting stimulus, and also for consolidation of memory for the imprinting stimulus. The project will determine which phases of sleep are important for the memory consolidation and enquire whether mild, non-invasive electrical stimulation of the brain can reverse the effects of sleep disruption on memory and neuronal tuning in the IMM to the imprinting stimulus. The project seeks to extend our understanding of memory mechanisms and in consequence may provide a rational basis for potential treatments of memory disorders. Memory and sleep are of paramount importance to human life, and research at both the behavioural and the neurobiological level is essential if these phenomena are to be understood satisfactorily. This understanding is particularly important if the many clinical neurological disorders that involve memory impairment are to be treated effectively. It is sometimes desirable to enhance memory and at other times to reduce it, as in the case of persistent aversive memories that may be associated with certain psychiatric disorders. A possible outcome of this work is the identification of sleep phases, the modification of which may therapeutically enhance or reduce memory, and a sound understanding of the neurobiological basis of such therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H018948/1","grantId":"BB/H018948/1","fundValue":"479561","fundStart":"2010-11-22","fundEnd":"2014-05-21","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian John McCabe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" BACKGROUND\nMemory mechanisms, and the effect of sleep on them, were investigated by studying visual imprinting in the domestic chick. Imprinting is a process whereby a chick learns about a visual stimulus (the imprinting or training stimulus) by being exposed to it. The intermediate and medial mesopallium (IMM) is a memory system for imprinting in the chick forebrain. Neuronal responsiveness in the IMM to a visual imprinting stimulus is enhanced after imprinting training. Both this enhancement and maximal memory for the imprinting stimulus require uninterrupted sleep in a six-hour period shortly after training; in addition, 4-6 Hz (theta) electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the IMM is enhanced during this period if sleep is undisturbed. These characteristics indicate that imprinting may be used to study how sleep enhances memory, a phenomenon in human subjects, the mechanism of which is not understood. The project objectives were:\n- To investigate the effect on memory of disrupting specific phases of sleep.\n- To investigate the effect of disruption on IMM neuronal responsiveness to the imprinting stimulus.\n- To determine the effect of transcranial electrical stimulation at theta frequency (implicated by previous work) or at 0.75 Hz (effective in enhancing human memory).\n\nFINDINGS\nTo date, the main results have been published in abstract form. Disturbing sleep contingent on theta EEG activity did not significantly affect memory for the imprinting stimulus; however, disrupting sleep in this way significantly increased theta activity; such a &quot;rebound&quot; has been described for human sleep. In contrast, disrupting sleep contingent on 0.75 Hz EEG activity significantly impaired memory, suggesting that different EEG frequencies are associated with different memory processes. The data are being analysed further to elucidate the role of theta activity. Transcranial electrical stimulation at theta frequency and at 0.75 Hz protected memory from impairment by random sleep disruption. Taken together, the results suggest that at least two frequency-related processes contribute to memory consolidation. Descriptions of electrical activity after imprinting in the IMM, and in two further forebrain regions, the hippocampus and the hyperpallium apicale/dorsale (a thalamofugal visual projection area) have also been reported.\n\nInformation complementary to the above results has also been obtained during the grant period. Expression of a neuronal activity marker (Fos) in the IMM was found to be enhanced by sleep shortly after training. Evidence was found that the efficacy of oxidative metabolism is lateralised in the IMM, and that phosphorylation of glutamate AMPA receptors is enhanced in a learning-related manner in the IMM after imprinting. Three review articles on imprinting have been published. Further electrophysiological studies of neuronal activity in the IMM and its relation to imprinting have been published by Stephen Town, a BBSRC-supported PhD student supervised by McCabe. The PDRA (Nicol) has published on a technique for the analysis of unit activity recorded from neuronal ensembles. The results offer the opportunity to increase understanding of the role of sleep in memory consolidation. The effects of EEG frequency-specific sleep disturbance and of brain stimulation have features in common with the results of similar experiments on memory in human subjects. It is therefore possible that the further investigation of the IMM in the chick will yield insight into consolidation mechanisms of human memory.
