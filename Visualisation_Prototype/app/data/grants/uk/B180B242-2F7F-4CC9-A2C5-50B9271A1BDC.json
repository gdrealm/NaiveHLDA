The disease has no cure and is a major cause of disability and early death worldwide. A recent breakthrough has lead to the discovery that mutations in a gene called LRRK2 can cause Parkinson?s disease in humans. The LRRK2 gene encodes for an enzyme. It is not known how the LRRK2 enzyme works in human brains and how its mutation causes Parkinson?s disease. The purpose of this application is to undertake studies that define how LRRK2 works in the brain. We also aim to learn how mutations in LRRK2 might cause Parkinson?s disease. Moreover, this research will provide knowledge and methodology to facilitate the development of new drugs that target the LRRK2 enzyme for the treatment of Parkinson?s disease ? and possibly dementias such as Alzheimer?s disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700656","grantId":"G0700656","fundValue":"254088","fundStart":"2008-01-07","fundEnd":"2011-01-06","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dario Renato Alessi","coPersons":["Alastair  Reith"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
