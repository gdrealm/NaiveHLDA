To assist with finding an evidence-based approach that takes into account the views of all sectors, NERC-CEH, together with other partners in the Natural Capital Initiative, is organising three workshops in 2010. These will address some of the most urgent and cross-cutting challenges for the potential large scale implementation of biodiversity offsetting in the UK. 22nd June - practical challenges for the implementation (Workshop 1) 29th September - scientific knowledge and environmental data needs (Workshop 2) 7th December - how offsetting might be account for ecosystem service provision (Workshop 3) Workshop 1 involved 41 external participants representing all relevant sectors and disciplines. Workshops 2 and 3 will involve a similar mix of scientists and &iquest;end users..
