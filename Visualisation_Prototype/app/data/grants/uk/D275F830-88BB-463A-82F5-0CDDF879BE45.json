Analysis of large scale secondary data sets (the National Diet and Nutrition Survey, Health Survey for England and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) will examine associations between diet and parental employment status while an intensive study of 48 higher and lower income working families sampled from the NDNS will explore the meanings and uses of food in working families, the embodiment of food practices and their embeddedness in different social contexts. </p>\n\n<p>This part of the study will employ a range of qualitative methods, including interviews, drawing and photo elicitation, with parents and children aged 2 to 10 to understand the social processes which influence healthier and unhealthier diets of children within and outside the home. It will thereby seek to provide explanations for statistical associations found (or not found) in the survey data. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-190-25-0010","grantId":"RES-190-25-0010","fundValue":"301712","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Refinements to the NDNS including the addition of new variables from 2015 on maternal education and hours of employment Other Societal,Policy & public services","person":"Rebecca Elizabeth O'Connell","coPersons":["Ann  Mooney","Julia  Brannen"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":" Key findings from Phase 1 of the study were announced at a conference for policymakers and practitioners at London Canal Museum on 3rd October 2011.
