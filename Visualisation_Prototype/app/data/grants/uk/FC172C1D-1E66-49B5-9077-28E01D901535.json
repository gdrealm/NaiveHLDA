This new process will provide the electronic sector in the UK with a simple, low cost, flexible and environmentally friendly production method for low volume, high value PCBs. In addition to depositing the conductive tracks the LPE process could be used to deposit layers of dielectric or protective materials, solder for connection of devices and also print legends on boards. In this way the new process provides a one stop solution for the production of PCBs","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G000514/1","grantId":"TS/G000514/1","fundValue":"76345","fundStart":"2009-01-05","fundEnd":"2011-01-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Wimpenny","coPersons":[],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
