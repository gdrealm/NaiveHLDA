{"id":"C7DB1D97-62C0-4124-AF6C-B0E0407BF4E8","title":"Valuation and hedging of insurance derivatives","abstractText":"We consider a general multi-state model where the insurance policy moves in between a finite set of states (for example, 'active', 'disabled', 'dead'). This model allows for quite general forms of benefit and premium payments. General life assurances pay benefits immediately upon a transition between two different states. General life annuities are paid continuously at a certain rate or in the form of lump-sum annuity payments as long as the policy is sojourning in a certain state. Moreover, all payments can be linked to the performance of some financial index. The resulting market typically contains multiple sources of risk and is incomplete. The main goal of the proposed research is to value and to hedge general insurance contracts and their embedded financial options. Another very important related issue, in particular in connection with general life assurances, is systematic mortality risk. Here the mortality intensity (respectively the transition intensities) is modelled as a stochastic process. One can either specify the dynamics of the intensity directly (corresponding to a market model approach) or start with some parametric specification and take the parameters as being random. Here the goal of the proposed research is to explore the transfer of systematic mortality risk to the financial market via the design of mortality derivatives, and to study their risk management.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E013120/1","grantId":"EP/E013120/1","fundValue":"161635","fundStart":"2007-06-29","fundEnd":"2009-09-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Thorsten  Rheinlander","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
