These cells form part of the immune system and their activation is known as an immune response. Certain types of white cells, known as regulatory T cells, are believed to dampen down immune responses that are considered harmful ?these may be immune responses directed towards normal, uninfected tissues. Since tumours arise from normal tissues, it was considered possible that these regulatory T cells inhibit immune responses to tumours. Several laboratories have shown that the cells do indeed inhibit immune responses to tumours, responses that could otherwise promote tumour destruction. \n A two-pronged approach is now warranted to find out how this information can be harnessed for the purposes of treating people with cancer. Firstly, the immune responses capable of promoting tumour destruction must be identified and secondly the precise way in which regulatory T cells act to stop these responses working effectively must be discovered. This approach will allow us to determine how the immune system can be manipulated for the treatment of a wide variety of cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801190","grantId":"G0801190","fundValue":"476808","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Awen  Gallimore","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
