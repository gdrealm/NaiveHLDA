These networks are composed of neurons, specialized cells that carry electrical information. Neurons within networks communicate with one another by releasing neurotransmitters, small chemical messengers, across specialized junctions called synapses. By using a combination of electrical and chemical signalling, neuronal networks of the adult brain can process and respond to a wide spectrum of information from the environment. Until recently, it was believed that the embryonic brain does not generate activity before sensory systems develop. However, recent research has demonstrated that this is not the case. Immature neuronal networks spontaneously generate patterns of electrical activity in the absence of sensory input. This activity is unique to developing networks, bearing no resemblance to activities seen in the adult brain. Such spontaneous activity is observed in the brains of virtually all developing animals. Whilst it is known to be important for maturation of nervous tissue, its role during early development remains poorly described. We will address this problem by studying network activity during development of the zebrafish embryo. The zebrafish, a small freshwater cyprinid, is ideal for developmental studies because fertilization occurs externally so that steps during embryonic development can be easily monitored. In the zebrafish embryo, before sensory systems are established, immature neuronal networks generate spontaneous activity. It is our goal to establish precisely how such activity is generated and how it influences the early stages of development. Our work has two broad goals. The first is to understand how the immature network produces activity. To do this we will monitor electrical properties of developing embryonic neurons. We will examine how these neurons are able to spontaneously generate electrical activity in the absence of external input. Our second goal will be to determine developmental roles of early activity in the zebrafish embryo. We will use molecular genetic methods to disrupt electrical signals and determine how this influences network maturation. We will focus on the neuronal network that generates swimming as it can be used as a simple model network for the study of behaviour. In this way we will be able to examine how early network activity affects many aspects of development, from the growth of individual neurons through to the maturation of adult behaviours. Our work will cast new light on the importance of electrical activity in the embryonic nervous system and may provide important clues about how aberrant activity causes developmental disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F01516X/1","grantId":"BB/F01516X/1","fundValue":"309917","fundStart":"2009-01-07","fundEnd":"2012-05-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Robert McDearmid","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":" 1) Our first objective was to identify the cellular mechanisms underpinning SNA by examining physiological properties of spinal cells. This has resulted in the identification of a cell class with autonomous pacemaker properties, to our knowledge a first in the vertebrate motor control field. We have identified the mechanisms that engender pacemaking finding it arises from a subset of sodium channels with unique gating properties. Moreover, we have determined how pacemaker cells adapt to accommodate the changing needs of the developing motor circuit. We have found that after SNA terminates and the spinal network acquires locomotor capacity, pacemaker cells generate a new form of intrinsic bursting activity that serves to control the duration of motor episodes. This work, which describes novel functional roles of a spinal neuron class, represents a major step forward to our understanding of how intrinsic properties shape motor output. \n\n\n\n2) Our second goal was to determine functional roles of SNA. To address this issue we have screened for pharmacological reagents that inhibit the pacemaker sodium channel. We have found that riluzole acts as a highly selective blocker of this channel. We have thus conducted a series of experiments examining the developmental consequences of riluzole-mediated abolition of SNA. We have has found that SNA serves to control the growth and arborisation of motoneurons, suggesting that SNA has key roles during early stages of nervous system development. \n\n\n\n3) Finally we have found that pacemaker sodium channels act extracellular calcium sensors. We have shown that reducing calcium levels enhances the voltage sensitivity of this channel and potentiates SNA. In contrast increasing extracellular calcium has the converse effect. By swimming stages, upregulation of this current evokes a new form of SNA that matches the periodicity and duration of swim episodes. This phenomenon suggests that pacemaker sodium channels act as the kernel of motor networks: during swimming local changes in external calcium will modulate the pacemaker channel and promote autonomous pacemaking that sculpts the waveform of ongoing motor episodes. This work is basic neuroscience research that could instruct future strategies for treatment of developmentally related motor disorders. This work furthers understanding of the role of pacemaking in motor networks and provides evidence that early activity influences nervous system development. It could thus instruct future strategies for treatment of developmentally related motor disorders. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
