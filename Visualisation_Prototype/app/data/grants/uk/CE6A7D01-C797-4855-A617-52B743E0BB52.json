Research at the University of Manchester has led to the development and preliminary commercialisation of an acoustic based system for detecting blockages and leakage in pipelines filled with static gas. An important benefit of the technique is that it is non-invasive and only requires access to one end of the pipeline. The project proposed here will extend the technique further by developing a prototype system that will be suitable for liquid filled pipelines and pipelines containing flowing gas or liquid.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I500944/1","grantId":"EP/I500944/1","fundValue":"93743","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings from this work have been used to develop new techniques for detecting and locating blockages in gas filled pipelines.
