{"id":"19194A25-3F6E-4A5F-B4DA-BEB0813DB63A","title":"Legal Reasoning in Economic and Social Rights Cases","abstractText":"In 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Council decided to draft an Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) to provide a right of individual petition. The debates surrounding this question have been often largely taken up with the question of whether economic and social rights are capable of being adjudicated in contentious procedures, rather than being implemented exclusively through state reporting procedures. This debate has obscured the examples of systems, both at the international level and under national constitutions, where an economic and social rights jurisprudence is being developed. In the literature on justiciability, legitimate difficulties in adjudicating economic and social rights in contentious cases have been identified: the issue of resources; difficulties in setting the appropriate standard to be met by states; the need to balance individual against collective interests. Nonetheless, in practice these difficulties are overcome, or at least mitigated.\\n\\nWhile attempts have been made to distil the principles relating to the implementation of economic and social rights, these have largely been developed in the context of international monitoring bodies whose main or exclusive role is the review of state reports. These include the General Comments by the Committee implementing the ICESCR, reviews of practice by the European Committee on Social Rights which monitors the implementation of the European Social Charter and the Limburg and Maastricht Principles on the implementation of economic, social and cultural rights. These principles are not entirely appropriate for contentious cases.\\n\\nIn systems where economic and social rights have been made justiciable, the justiciability debate has become irrelevant. It is instead necessary to identify the principles used in the practice of courts and international human rights monitoring bodies which are dealing with economic and social rights cases. This can be done through a detailed analysis of the case law of judicial and quasi-judicial bodies which apply economic and social rights. Notable amongst these are the European Committee of Social Rights applying the European Social Charter and the South African courts, particularly the Constitutional Court, applying the South African Constitution, which includes economic and social rights. In addition, some limited application of economic and social rights is achieved through the use of generalised non-discrimination provisions in constitutions and international human rights instruments.\\n\\nThe principles being applied can be divided into two types: the values being protected, which include human dignity and equality and the assessment of the acceptable degree of state interference, including adapted versions of the principles of reasonableness and proportionality. In economic and social rights cases it is also necessary for courts to define the limits of state discretion in expending resources in these areas.\\n\\nThis project will be of interest to legal academics and practitioners in a range of areas: human rights, international organisations and comparative constitutional law. In addition, human rights specialists outside the legal field will find questions of the principles of applying human rights important to an understanding of the nature of economic and social rights. The realisation of economic and social rights will also be of interest to development studies specialists and those involved with social policy.\\n\\nThe main academic output from this project will be a book-length evaluation of the principles of adjudication concerning economic and social rights. In addition, two or possibly three articles will be produced: from the two main case studies of application of economic and social rights (Council of Europe; South Africa), and from the analysis of using discrimination rules to realise economic and social rights.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F00558X/1","grantId":"AH/F00558X/1","fundValue":"21568","fundStart":"2008-01-14","fundEnd":"2008-04-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Holly  Cullen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
