{"id":"DAE7DD5D-AD31-4BB3-9C1D-07093CC91EFE","title":"Impacts of policy change on farm incomes and biodiversity in the uplands: a knowledge transfer project.","abstractText":"<p>This short project builds on a RELU-funded project which developed a series of mathematical models showing the relationships between upland livestock farming and biodiversity&nbsp;- in this case, as measured by the diversity and abundance of moorland birds.</p>\n\n<p>These models were constructed for a case study based in the Peak District. Working with three main stakeholders (Natural England, the Peak District National Park Authority and the National Farmers Union), a series of&nbsp; &quot;policy briefings&quot; will be produced, which explain in non-technical terms what our models predict about a series of possible changes to agricultural and rural policy in the uplands. These briefings will be made available on the Moors for the Future website. </p>\n\n<p>The predicted impacts range from effects on farm incomes and land use, to changes in moorland birds. These changes include loss of the Single Farm Payment, and the re-design of agri-environmental schemes.</p>\n\n<p>A one-day workshop with a wide range of stakeholders in the Peaks will be arranged to discuss what important research questions remain unanswered on the future of upland farming and its links with biodiversity. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H021639/1","grantId":"ES/H021639/1","fundValue":"30185","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nick  Hanley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
