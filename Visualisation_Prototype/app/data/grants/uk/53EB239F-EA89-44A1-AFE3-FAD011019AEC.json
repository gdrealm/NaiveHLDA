{"id":"53EB239F-EA89-44A1-AFE3-FAD011019AEC","title":"Workshop: Ergodic Theory and Geometry","abstractText":"The workshop aims to provide an international forum to discuss the latest developments on the interface between statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems, geometry, and quantum chaos. It will be particularly focused on encouraging interactions between researchers and the transfer of methods between different topics, aimed at facilitating further progress.Chaotic dynamical systems have an extremely complicated orbit structure. Rather than trying to understand every orbit, it is more fruitful to adopt a statistical viewpoint and try to understand typical behaviour. At this level, chaotic sysyems exhibit a considerable amount of structure and there has been great progress in understanding this over the last few years. This manifests itself in such phenomena as decay of correlations, statistical limit laws, classification of invariant measures, asymptotic formulae. The area has immediate applications to the quantum theory of chaotic systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F037805/1","grantId":"EP/F037805/1","fundValue":"16426","fundStart":"2008-03-30","fundEnd":"2008-06-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Sharp","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
