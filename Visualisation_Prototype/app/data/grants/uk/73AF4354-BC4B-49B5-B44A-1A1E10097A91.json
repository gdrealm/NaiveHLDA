{"id":"73AF4354-BC4B-49B5-B44A-1A1E10097A91","title":"Writing Across Boundaries: Explorations in Research, Writing and Rhetoric in Qualitative Research","abstractText":"<p>The survey into training need and provision carried out by the National Centre for Research Methods (NCRM) identified the need among early stage researchers for training in advanced qualitative analysis. In particular, researchers expressed the desire for activities that put into practice skills and competencies learnt at initial stages of training and that go beyond training in the use qualitative software. This project seeks to contribute to the emerging agenda in advanced training by focusing on the writing up of qualitative data for formal examination, publication and other forms of dissemination. This aspect of the professionalisation of researchers has received relatively little attention and will be developed through a series of annual workshops and follow-up support. The programme will be run at regional level in years one and two, and nationally in the third year of the project, and will provide a forum for PhD students in the latter stages of their research to engage with critical themes and issues in writing-up qualitative data in the social sciences. The long-term aim is to establish a permanent training forum in the Northern Region, and a blueprint for academic colleagues to adapt to their own circumstances in other regions of the UK.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E006086/1","grantId":"ES/E006086/1","fundValue":"56063","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  o The Workshops - the workshops have been a pleasure to be involved with and the feedback is among the most positive we have received for any teaching events. This in turn is a reflection of the particular need we were able to fulfil for these students at this point in their studies. The gradual extension of the catchment beyond the North-East, to the rest of the UK and eventually to Europe worked well and resulted in some excellent cohorts to work with. \no The Website - the website has provided a major focal point for the project and reached a wide audience [See appendix seven for Google analytics]. The website contains major sections on: Drafting and Plotting, the Data-Theory Relationship, Narrative, Rhetoric, and Representation. We have also included a general section containing Hints and Tips on Writing. These pages contained a large volume of essays, articles, bibliographies and links which are relevant for writers in the social sciences. \n\n Within the website we have developed a section entitled Writers on Writing for which we invited a number of social science luminaries to contribute a short piece in which they reflected on their own experience of writing. The results were intriguing and have been widely accessed by students and researchers. The contributors to date include: Marilyn Strathern; Irving Horowitz; William Outhwaite; Liz Stanley; Julian Le Grand; Norman Denzin; Bryan S. Turner; JP Roos; Arthur Kleinman; Alan Mcfarlane; Ken Plummer; Harry F. Wolcott; Alan Walker; Jaber Gubrium; Howard S. Becker; Patrick Sullivan; Arthur W. Frank; Tim Ingold; Harvey Molotch; Roy Wagner; Catherine Finer Jones; Shulamit Reinharz; Paul Nchoji Nkwi. . \nAlso within the website we have developed a section for research postgraduates researchers to submit short articles to us on any aspect of the process of writing in postgraduate study.

Specifically, \n\n? the involvement of a wide range of disciplines has ensured that this training is beyond either generic or subject-specific skills.\n \n? We have met a recognisable need and, through the development of the proposed DTC, we have contributed to a regional training infrastructure in the social sciences. \n\n? the WAB initiative has met the RDI's objective of enhancing transferable skills by providing training of a kind that is not found elsewhere within university programmes and to do so through innovative and experimental training. \n\nEvaluation:\n\nEvaluation has taken place in three stages:\n\n1) at the workshop we had two participant observers who took notes and discussed what was going on with participants. Short reports were produced by the participant observers following the workshops. \n\n2) Immediately after the workshop all the participants were asked to fill in a short questionnaire on Blackboard The overall response rate across the three years was 82%. The responses were overwhelmingly positive and indicated that participants not only enjoyed the workshop but that it also had a significant impact on their capacity to write. We have included this feedback at the end of this Report, in its entirety. \n\n3) Six months after the workshop we undertook telephone interviews with participants and their supervisors [Response rate 53% for students and 50% for supervisors]. These responses were similarly positive and highlighted some of the ways in which the workshop had helped [gave confidence, enabled reframing to take place, gave clearer understanding of writing as a skill]. o Generally, we have been taken aback by the success of this venture. It feels as though we identified a genuine gap in doctoral training provision and provided exactly the kind of response that was needed. The effect has been very gratifying.\n\no We are interested to note that since the appearance of the WAB workshop there has been an increased interest in writing more generally with several courses being offered supporting researchers in their writing.\n\no In the development of the joint Durham/ Newcastle bid for an ESRC recognised Doctoral Training Centre, the WAB project provided something of a model for how regional collaboration in advanced training could operate. Furthermore, the WAB initiative is likely to feature as a sustainable element in the running of the proposed North East DTC. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
