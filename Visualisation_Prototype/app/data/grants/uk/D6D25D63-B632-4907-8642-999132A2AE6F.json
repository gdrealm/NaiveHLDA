This project critically examines the existence and nature of metacognitive abilities in non-human primates and develops comparative knowledge of metacognitive processes, by exploring how similar these capacities are in non-human animals, human children and human adults.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E511155/1","grantId":"AH/E511155/1","fundValue":"37164","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  They might be useful for foundational work in the future.

Both philosophical and empirical work on metacognition can build on the foundational work that I have done. For instance, empirical work on metacognition needs normative benchmarks to be tested against--which is what my work supplied.
