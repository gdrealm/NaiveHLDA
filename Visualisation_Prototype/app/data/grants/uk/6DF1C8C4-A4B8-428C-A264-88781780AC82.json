A nucleic acid-based hereditary unit, the gene, carries this information and the characteristics of an organism are defined by its set of genes. Over the last century a number of exceptions to Mendel's Laws have been identified, but a new challenge to the dogma that all inheritance is nucleic acid based has recently arisen from the discovery of prions. Although prions have been intensively studied as the disease-causing agents associated with 'Mad Cow Disease' and the human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), there is now a considerable body of scientific evidence that prions might actually represent an entirely new form of heredity, based on a protein molecule rather than a nucleic acid. This evidence comes from the analysis of novel prion-based 'genetic' determinants in Baker's Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) one of which (the so-called [PSI+] element) is being studied in this project. Our aim is to fully understand how such a protein-based determinant is generated de novo and then replicated aand passed on to other yeast cells when they grow and divide. We know that this requires cells to produce prion seeds which can be passed on to other cells and it is our objective to define the molecular composition of these seeds. Uisng advanced genetic and biochemical methods we will study different yeast prions and look in particular at the type of physical changes they go through in taking up their prion form. One outcome of this research might be identifying steps in the prion cycle that can be targetted by new drugs to block the formation of prion seeds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D018242/1","grantId":"BB/D018242/1","fundValue":"313422","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Academic impact to date only.

A nucleic acid (normally DNA)-based hereditary unit, the gene, carries this information and the characteristics of an organism are defined by its set of genes. However, over the last 20 years we have seen a challenge to the dogma that all inheritance is DNA or RNA based; this has emerged from the discovery of prions. Although originally studied as novel disease-causing agents associated with 'Mad Cow Disease' and the human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), there is now a considerable body of scientific evidence that prions might actually represent an entirely new form of heredity, based on a protein molecule rather than a nucleic acid. Prions are formed when a protein in a cell takes up a new three dimensional structure that then drives (i.e. ‘seeds’) further misfolding of other molecules of the same protein. The key supporting evidence for this novel form of epigenetic inheritance comes from the analysis of novel prion-based 'genetic' determinants in Baker's Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) one of which (the so-called [PSI+] element) was the subject of our project. \n\nThe overall aim of our project was to better understand how a protein-based infectious element is generated spontaneously in a cell i.e. de novo, since this would provide us with new insights into what triggers the underlying molecular event that leads to the key protein misfolding event. To address this we took several different approaches and amongst our main findings were:\n1. The [PSI+] prion arises de novo in a yeast cell without any underlying and heritable change in this organisms’ genome. This included an analysis of any changes either within the gene encoding Sup35p, the protein that gives rise to the [PSI+] prion, or other genes that might impact on prion formation.\n2. Chemical agents that are known to trigger protein misfolding were shown not to stimulate de novo prion formation arguing that the trigger for prion formation is not a spontaneous protein misfolding event.\n3. We were able to clarify the physical nature of yeast prions in vivo by undertaking a series of biochemical experiments to describe the relationship between the size of prion particles in cell lysates and properties of prions such as infectivity and seeding. The approach was complementary to the genetic approach we took as part of work funded by BBSRC grant E18382, where we developed a novel method to count the numbers of prion particles (propagons) in yeast cells. Our most significant finding was that prions exist in vivo as very large complexes comprised of smaller SDS-resistant sub-particles and that the large particles appear to harbour the activity of the prion.\n4. We identified a physical interaction between the Sup35p and a second prion-forming protein known as Rnq1, the prion form of which (called [PIN+]) is required for de novo prion formation in yeast. Our findings have allowed us to better understand the key stages of the prion's 'life cycle' and in particular the process by which they form and are then transferred to other cells. This information will now allow us to identify steps or molecules that may be targetted by drugs that might block the formation of new infectious prion seeds. This also has implications for other 'protein misfolding' disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
