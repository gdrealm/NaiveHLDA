CEWN 2 will continue to develop its portfolio of collaborative work through strengthening and furthering existing projects and by developing new ones, resulting in a pipeline of collaborative R&amp;D projects at various stages of maturity.

The demand for project support that has been submitted to CEWN has in indicated that there is significant potential for KE between creative academics and businesses across Wales. CEWN2 will overcome these challenges and maximise benefit from opportunities by:\n\n Holding 3 facilitated KE events based for HE and the Creative Industries based on themes of 'Open innovation- applying creativity across boundaries'; 'Creative Tourism'; and 'Living longer, living well'.\n Knowledge exchange through interaction at the events and through detailed bespoke funding scoping.\n Evaluating and further developing existing projects to develop a pipeline of projects with different stages of maturity. &pound;30,000 funding from the AHRC will support the cost of the pilot projects. In addition the project will seek to lever in at least another &pound;60,000 of funding to support the development of projects.\n Continued co-funding via A4B funding from the Welsh government to provide support for KE activity across Wales\n Further understanding of the Creative Industries in Wales and KE opportunities through analysis and critique of outcomes of business and academic surveys based on Creative Canvas (CEWN 2012-13). This will identify barriers to collaborative working and making recommendations on overcoming these.\n Partnering with BBC/S4C within the Higher Education elements of the Connected Studio initiati, through CEWN2 becoming the gateway for HE involvement in the Studios.\n\nCEWN2 will further consolidate activity and form a legacy by providing a platform for the development of a &pound;5-10m funding proposal that will create a KE Hub for the Creative Industries in Wales.
