Forms of participation in SAFE will be diverse.&nbsp;Principally, core members will present ideas to seminars run by SAFE by invitation or by competitive submission of material, where the prime goal is the promotion of academic excellence.&nbsp;The pay-off will come in the clash of minds, the thrashing out of innovative, fresh research ideas, and the subsequent preparing of them for publication.&nbsp;However, this will all take place in a completely democratic forum. Even if individuals are not currently active research workers, and have not submitted papers, or have not had papers accepted, they will be able to participate fully, provided they are dedicated to the principle of the rational debate of ideas.&nbsp;The benefits of participation are manifold.&nbsp;They include, for the inexperienced or newcomer, seeking to be more active, the generation of new insights; and they will facilitate, for the seasoned research worker, more ambitious projects, such as the participation in panel discussions on contemporary issues, to influence the direction of policy; and the updating of knowledge and skills, from listening to and engaging in discussion.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4186","grantId":"RES-451-25-4186","fundValue":"15444","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Julia A Smith","coPersons":["Gavin Clydesdale Reid"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
