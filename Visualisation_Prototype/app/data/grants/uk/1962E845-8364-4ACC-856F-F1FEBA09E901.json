Much of legislation, policy, practice and research focuses on 'the care experience' itself, as distinct from young people's everyday lives and their connectivity with wider environments. Considerable lack of understanding remains about what being 'in care' means. This often results in prejudice and stigma. Groups set up specifically for LACYP offer opportunities to develop networks and relationships with adults and young people, and to raise awarenesses. Transitions may happen early and be experienced frequently by LACYP, however, they can offer new opportunities and positive relationships with different people. Meaningful participation in communities such as schools is an important factor in developing stability in relationships. Concepts of participation and empowerment form part of an ecological framework which locates the community context as central to building resilience for LACYP. What constitutes community cohesion and connectedness for LACYP requires a fine balance between the interests of protection and participation. Successful interconnectedness is a matter of shared concern for all. The key challenge remains that of identifying how stable community relationships for LACYP may be strengthened and supported to dynamic mutual benefit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J500980/1","grantId":"AH/J500980/1","fundValue":"31409","fundStart":"2011-03-31","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Leslie  Hicks","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Lincoln","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
