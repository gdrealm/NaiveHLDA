This flow scenario is very common over aircraft wings and turbine blades. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that active control of such flows is attempted worldwide. The current approach, which is based on the wall-normal velocity and vorticity formulation to derive a state-space system suitable for controller design, has several limitations. The new control framework will use instead the primitive variables, velocity and pressure. This formulation offers greater flexibility and, most importantly, makes the incorporation of the effect of free-stream turbulence straightforward. This choice of variables however introduces new challenges from the control perspective because the standard optimal control algorithms can not be applied. In the attached case of support, the limitations of the current approach are explained, the benefits of the new formulation are highlighted and the challenges that must be dealt with for the successful control of streaks are analysed. This work offers a unique opportunity to put the UK in a leading position in the new and rapidly developing area of active flow control.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I016015/1","grantId":"EP/I016015/1","fundValue":"374395","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The grant finished 2 months ago (end of August 2014) and our findings have not been used yet. \n\nWe met with many challenges during the research work, which we overcome successfully.

We achieve this by blowing and suction at the wall surface. If left uncontrolled, these structures will grow and interact, leading to transition and full turbulence. High levels of turbulence are associated with high drag and therefore fuel consumption. Despite its importance, control of flow structures that develop due to free stream turbulence has not received much attention in the literature. With the techniques we have developed in this grant, we expect that the onset of transition is delayed and therefore energy consumption and pollutant formation will be reduced. Our approach is rigorous and is based on the equations that govern the formation and growth of these structures. We reformulated and solved the control problem from scratch and derived new solutions that explicitly account for the forcing of the equations due to the presence of free-stream turbulence. We have developed the control techniques using a linear set of equations. Due to the presence of forcing and the fact that randomness enters the equations multiplicatively (not additively as in standard LQG control problem) we met many challenges which we successfully overcome. We even exceeded the original objectives and examined the effect of control on Goertler vortices that develop in curved walls (the initial objectives involved only flat walls).\n The next step is to apply our method to full non-linear flow problems and investigate the actual performance in delaying transition. Another interesting avenue is to couple with flow estimation based on parameters sensed on the wall, like pressure and shear-stress. Aerospace, Defence and Marine","dataset":"gtr"}
