The common causes tend to overlap, aren't well understood and have a similar appearance on imaging. Many of the imaging features are not well-defined. We are establishing a worldwide group of experts to create a common language for describing the imaging features and conducting imaging research in order to define the role of blood vessels in dementia.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J006971/1","grantId":"MR/J006971/1","fundValue":"20148","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanna  Wardlaw","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
