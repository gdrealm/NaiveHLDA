Visitors are essential to our expanding programme. New ideas, new models and computer simulations, and new data analysis techniques are being developed in studies of our Sun, the Solar System, the birth and behaviour of stars. A stream of visitors generates extra vitality to the astrophysical discussions, accelerates the output and quality of publications, improves the numerical, analytical and data analysis techniques we use and increases the number of national and international collaborations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H001921/1","grantId":"ST/H001921/1","fundValue":"12763","fundStart":"2010-05-17","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The results of the research carried out as part of this project has enhanced the UK creative output, raised the profile of UK cutting-edge science and maximised the return of the country's \ninvestment into basic research, in particular research into astronomy and related sciences.

The research output, as measured by our journal publications, reflects the high number of quality projects being undertaken within several fields.\nInvitations to our many collaborators have helped us maintain our success in established areas which include exoplanet studies, interpretation of our Sun and other cool stars, star formation, stellar evolution, numerical astrophysics and galactic astronomy. Due to the Observatory's relative geographical isolation\nand the multidisciplinary nature of its research, a continuing flow of visitors is an important factor in maintaining the high quality of our research output.\nTherefore we aim for a continuation of our visitor\nprogramme by applying to the relevant funding bodies.
