It is easy to find support for both immiseration and modernisation. This research project seeks to quantify how human welfare actually developed.</p>\n\n<p>This will be achieved by studying the imprint that nutrition and health conditions left in the body of those who were subject to colonial rule. Using weights and heights of no less than 135,000 African recruits to the colonial armies the study will map changes in human welfare for extremely small geographic units such as districts and towns. The study will cover the period 1860-1980; the period shortly before the colonial conquest and the period after independence will be used as a reference point to the colonial period (ca. 1890-1960). To explain the changes in human welfare, a statistical analysis will be undertaken correlating the measures of nutritional status with social, economic and political changes.</p>\n\n<p>The study examines a total of 18 mostly West African countries covering the diverse ecological zones and experiences of British and French colonial rule, representing approximately&nbsp;25 per cent&nbsp;of the population and 40 per cent of the land area in sub-Saharan Africa. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H01103X/1","grantId":"ES/H01103X/1","fundValue":"242804","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander  Moradi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
