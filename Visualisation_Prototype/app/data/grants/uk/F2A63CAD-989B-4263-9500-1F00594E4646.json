The aim of this project is to establish the extent to which perception is atypical in ASD, and how this may impact on behavioural and cognitive symptoms of the disorder. Specifically, the size of the visual field will be measured in children with ASD and typically developing children. This will be achieved by asking participants to look into a spherical dome which covers a large area of the visual field, and then flashing lights at defined points around the periphery. By measuring the position and luminance of the lights that are detected, the visual field can be mapped out. In addition, visual acuity, binocular vision and eye movements will be measured in each participant. Data arising from this project will help to establish the nature of atypical visual perception in ASD, and the frequency with which perception in ASD differs compared to controls. These data will then be compared to a behavioural and cognitive profile of each participant in order to establish how atypical perception relates to behavioural and cognitive aspects of ASD.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E004520/1","grantId":"ES/E004520/1","fundValue":"72094","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2007-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth Helen Milne","coPersons":["David  Buckley","Helen Jane Griffiths"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
