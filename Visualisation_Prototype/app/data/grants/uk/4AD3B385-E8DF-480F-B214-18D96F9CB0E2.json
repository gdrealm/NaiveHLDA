The purposes of the visit are: to establish a new collaboration between Bristol and Duke; to develop skills and understanding in the area of experimental design and testing of nonlinear energy harvesters; to develop mathematical models of the existing energy harvesters in Mann's lab that will provide insight for future design work; and to initiate a joint project around the use of mechanical nonlinearities for enhanced energy harvesting in the context of autonomous oceanographic sensor buoys.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H018107/1","grantId":"EP/H018107/1","fundValue":"7185","fundStart":"2009-10-26","fundEnd":"2010-03-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings from this research have been published in appropriate journals and the work used by other people around the world.

Outcomes of this collaboration include the following. (1) The effect of uncertainties (e.g., due to the manufacturing process) on the energy output from energy harvesters was quantified. (2) The control-based continuation method was tested on a range of new devices and produced high-quality results. (3) Further collaborative visits and projects have been initiated. The methodologies established are of general use to the (research) engineering community. Work is continuing to make these results as straightforward to use as possible.
