These signals are most often detected by receptors at the cell surface, which respond to the signal by altering their structure. This conformational change initiates a series of events inside the cell, ultimately changing the number and level of genes expressed. When such signals go wrong there can be serious consequences resulting in diseases like cancer for example. It will be evident that the more we understand these signals, the better we will be able to exploit the potential to manipulate them to our advantage. The aim of this proposal is to investigate the regulation of one such signal that mediated by a receptor called Notch. One way in which a signal can be regulated is to alter the transport of receptor within different locations in the cell. We have found that if the Notch receptor is trafficked to a particular cellular compartment then it is activated. We have found intracellular regulatory proteins that bind to Notch, modify it in a way as to send Notch to or divert it from this cellular location. This controls whether Notch is activated or not once it has been internalised into the cell. Notch is also thought to be activated at the cell surface by binding to ligands on an adjacent cell. We do not understand yet how these two modes of activation are related. Are they two different mechanisms of activating the receptor, or are they two different steps in the same molecular pathway? The work for this project aims to understand, at the biochemical level, the different types of modification of Notch that regulate its intracellular location and activation. We will also determine how the endosomal activation route is related to the normal mechanism of ligand-dependant Notch signalling. This work will be carried out within the Faculty of Life Sciences at the University of Manchester. Our experimental organism is the fruit fly, which is a commonly used organism because many of the signals controlling its development are also found in humans. The fly has obvious advantages in that it is easy to experiment with and because it breeds fast it is easy to identify mutations that affect the signals that we wish to study. It is by looking at what happens when things go wrong that we can find out how they work normally. This grants seeks support for a post-doctoral research scientist who has already performed important work in this area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E002285/1","grantId":"BB/E002285/1","fundValue":"262842","fundStart":"2007-04-23","fundEnd":"2010-04-22","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Baron","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" We showed that two different Nedd4 proteins, DNedd4 and Su(dx) can bind to Notch through a PPXY motif interacting through the C-terminal WW domains in the Nedd4 proteins. This represents an unusual class of WW domains in which a normally conserved Tryptophan is replaced by a Phenyalanine. The substrate recognition of this unusual type of WW domain had not previously been identified. We found that the alteration reduces affinity for the standard PPXY motif that is normally recognised by WW domains. However this was compensated for by additional contacts that were made with sequences that flank the Notch PPXY motif and contribute specificity to the interaction of the C-terminal WW domain. Because our data indicates that there is an indirect, PPSY-independent, association between Notch and Nedd4 proteins through the N-terminal pair of WW domains, we investigated what other proteins can associate with these domains. Different interacting partners were identified and it is possible that they may act as adaptors for one or more of the Nedd4 proteins in different developmental contexts. ZO-1 protein was identified as a direct protein binding partner of Su(dx), interacting through WW domains 1 and 2. We found that ZO-1 expression in cells recruited Su(dx) to the periphery of the cell and that Su(dx) targets ZO-1 for degradation. The two proteins have an antagonistic function on Notch. ZO-1 promotes Notch accumulation at cell-cell junctions formed with ligand expressing cells, while Su(dx) decreases junction formation. We further find that ZO-1 regulates Notch endocytosis and signal activation, resulting in a second indirect route by which Notch is regulated by ZO-1. Potential route to development of Notch regulating pharmaceuticals Identification of the peptide recognition site of Nedd4 WW domains with Notch offers the future possibility of designing ligand mimics which can disrupt this interaction and modify Notch signalling.
