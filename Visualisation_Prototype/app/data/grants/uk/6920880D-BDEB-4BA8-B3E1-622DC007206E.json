Client kings such as Herod the Great were local dynasts under indirect control of Rome and stoutly loyal to the emperor. Herod and his colleagues were prolific builders and have hence left an ample material record to study their self-representation, through portraits (on coins), royal tombs, palaces and temples. My study concentrates on the visual evidence for six local dynasties that have left substantial material remains: the Hasmonaeans and Herodians of Judaea, the Nabataeans of Petra, the Ituraeans in Mt. Lebanon, and the dynasties of Emesa in central Syria and of Commagene on the upper Euphrates.\\nIt is well known that Herod was unpopular among his own subjects in Judea. He therefore tried to turn public opinion in his favour by starting in a vast programme of public munificence. The design, style and (in visual art) iconography of these public buildings (Temple in Jerusalem) were carefully chosen by Herod and his circle, each expressing its own messages. A very different direction is seen in the private realm, the palaces of Herod (Jericho, Masada), which show a distinct preference for the most up-to-date Roman expertise and materials. Engineers and workmen shipped from Italy produced masonry of opus reticulatum and sophisticated hydraulic installations; Masada, for instance, was equipped with private baths when these were still a rarity in the Roman world. To the modern researcher, they can hence serve as historical documents in their own right.\\nThis is the first in-depth study of what is usually considered an ephemeral phenomenon (client kingship) at the fringe of the Roman empire. Exploring these visual manifestations and, for instance, revealing the distinct Augustan inspiration in Herod's many palaces, or the persistence of an Arabian tradition in the portraits of the kings of Petra, will allow to understand the royal agenda behind the visual evidence.\\nThe outcome will be a monograph of and 150,000 words, divided into seven chapters, which deal with each of the different media outlined above and then draw on the evidence to assess the 'visual programmes' that each dynasty constructed.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G009430/1","grantId":"AH/G009430/1","fundValue":"21571","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  cultural, societal or economic impact: enhances quality of life by widening knowledge horizons on ancient civilisations.
