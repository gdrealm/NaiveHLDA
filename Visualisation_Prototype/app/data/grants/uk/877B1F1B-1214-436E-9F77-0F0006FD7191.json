A series of 4 major experiments to investigate the changes in magic numbers and shell structure for very neutron rich nuclei, and other structural studies, has been approved by the GANIL PAC and is scheduled for running in 2007. Three of these experiments have principal spokespersons from TIARA. All of the experiments will be performed by bringing together equipment and personnel of TIARA and the other major group working in this area, MUST2. This campaign starting in September 2007 represents the first major step towards the building of a major international collaboration to study transfer, with the UK in a leading role.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/F001010/1","grantId":"PP/F001010/1","fundValue":"144876","fundStart":"2007-09-11","fundEnd":"2010-03-10","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Chapman","coPersons":["John Francis Smith","Xiaoying  Liang"],"organisation":"University of the West of Scotland","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
