{"id":"767C59D6-0242-4CF5-AA31-1076E35B7055","title":"MRC/University of Edinburgh Centre for Inflammation Research","abstractText":"Inflammation was first recognised and described in Roman times as redness, heat, swelling, and pain which together give rise to limited function of the affected part. A scalded thumb is a familiar example and emphasises that inflammation is a response to damaging influences. Indeed, in the 18th and 19th centuries it became clear that the cellular events of the inflammatory response were critical for protection against infection, white blood cells leaving the blood stream to reach damaged tissues in order to kill and remove invading micro-organisms. Unfortunately, inappropriately triggered or inadequately controlled inflammatory responses are now recognised as a major causative factor in disease such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, kidney failure and arthritis. Effective and specific treatments for these conditions have been difficult to find and there is also a need to improve prevention, diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory diseases. Recent advances in understanding the molecular basis of abnormal cell function within inflammed tissues, many made by Edinburgh doctors and scientists, promise a steady improvement in the clinical management of inflammatory diseases. This application seeks funds to continue to underpin a unique interactive grouping of leading researchers in the field of inflammation that has been assembled in Edinburgh for 5 years, strengthen the infrastructure needed to make the scientific discoveries that will feed through into the clinic and promote the training of young scientists and doctors in research into inflammation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9900991","grantId":"G9900991","fundValue":"2536100","fundStart":"2000-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Haslett","coPersons":["David  Porteous","John  Savill","David  Harrison","Neil  Turner","Sarah E M Howie","Hugh R Miller","Christopher  Gregory","John  Mullins"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
