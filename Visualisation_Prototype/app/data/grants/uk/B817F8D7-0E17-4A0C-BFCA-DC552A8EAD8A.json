{"id":"B817F8D7-0E17-4A0C-BFCA-DC552A8EAD8A","title":"MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling","abstractText":"The threat to human populations from new infectious diseases has been highlighted in recent years by the 2003 SARS epidemic, the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu strain and ongoing concerns about bioterrorism. Preparing for such eventualities is therefore a key priority for public health agencies and governments worldwide. In this context, computer modelling of epidemics coupled with scientifically rigorous data analysis have proven themselves as powerful tools for giving insight into the spread of disease outbreaks and how we can try and control the transmission of a new disease. The Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling aims to undertaking research in epidemic modelling, and apply the tools developed to priority disease threats of concern. The Centre will provide a core infrastructure - the Outbreak Analysis Unit (OAU) - for establishing long-term collaborative relationships with key public health organisations (e.g. WHO, UN, HPA) and for translating the fundamental epidemiological research of Centre researchers into real improvements in outbreak planning and response. In addition, the Centre will develop the first truly global epidemic simulator. Staff of the Centre will also have a key role in providing training to public health professionals and policy makers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600719","grantId":"G0600719","fundValue":"1911960","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Ferguson","coPersons":["Christopher John Rhodes","Nicholas C Grassly","Christophe  Fraser","Roy  Anderson","John  Edmunds","Geoff  Garnett","Christl A.
