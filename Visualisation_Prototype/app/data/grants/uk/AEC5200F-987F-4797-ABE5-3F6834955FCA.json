{"id":"AEC5200F-987F-4797-ABE5-3F6834955FCA","title":"Cult TV: TV Culture Network","abstractText":"Is television culture being digitally transformed? The huge range of websites dedicated to particular TV shows, the variety of television available on video-sharing sites like YouTube, and availability of recent programming on 'view on demand' (VoD) platforms suggest that the answer is yes. Advances in production, recording, and communication technologies have undeniably changed the way TV is produced, distributed, watched and discussed and a recent report suggests that we are watching more TV now than five years ago (Foster and Broughton, 2011). BBC data shows that iPlayer received 141 million requests for TV and radio programmes in April 2011 (BBC report, 2011); Foster and Broughton's analysis posits that around 5% of UK fixed broadband and mobile network income (approximately &pound;1 billion) can be attributed to video downloads and streaming; and all major content providers have their own VoD services and make content for mobile and other media. While a drama is off the air, minisodes released through the official website keep an audience engaged. Fan forums exchange the latest news about developing storylines or cast and crew changes. Ancillary materials (DVD extras or dedicated TV documentaries like Doctor Who Confidential) discuss special effects or action for HD, or how CGI is used to create the latest spectacular creature or place.\n\nMuch of this activity is a continuation from old media to new media. Cult TV scholars have experience in studying what place special effects have in television, how audiences consume their favourite show, or how TV is officially and unofficially discussed, debated and archived. The Cult TV: TV Cultures Network will bring together scholars with this experience, along with people who create and produce television, those who train the creative industries workforce, the museums and organisations charged with preserving television as part of our culture, and fan-scholars who, more unofficially, also debate, collect and archive TV cultureto discuss developments in digital-era television. Representatives from these various groups will identify key areas for debate and development, discussing who 'authors' or 'owns' television content and characters now they are spread across multiple media, or analysing ways that TV culture enriches social identity. The emphasis is on pooling knowledge and approaches in order to develop new ways of cooperating to tackle problems (e.g. fulfilling the demands of new TV industry for a range of skills in its workers) or developing future strategies (e.g. for archiving TV as cultural memory).\n\nPlanned activities such as workshops and symposia will encourage debate among different stakeholder groups, and some will be designed to engage the public, keeping the debates accessible. A directory of academic expertise aims to stimulate ongoing collaboration between academic researchers and anyone with an interest in producing, preserving or consuming television. An advisory paper will identify significant areas for development, and aims to shape the direction of future strategies for digital-era television. The input of non-academic participants will help ground the discussion and the network will benefit equally from academic expertise and from the mainstream address of TV fan-scholars and bloggers and other non-academic members, enabling publications arising from the network's activities to present complex ideas in language readily accessible to a general audience. The network has high potential to contribute to ongoing and vital debates about public policy on digital TV and its future development. Industry, the skills training sector, museums and archives, and the third sector will benefit from academic expertise that can enhance their own activities and planning around digital transformations. In more general terms, the project aims to draw attention to the significant place of television in society and in generational and cultural memory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K003844/1","grantId":"AH/K003844/1","fundValue":"22590","fundStart":"2013-09-23","fundEnd":"2015-03-22","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lorna Elizabeth Jowett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Northampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
