This project will assess the potential for reversing this effect; that is, for using marketing to encourage healthier eating. In collaboration with the Co-operative supermarket chain, researchers at Stirling, the Open and Dundee University will examine what happens when the tools of modern marketing - including price promotions, mail shots, and point of sale advertising ? are put behind healthy rather than unhealthy foods. Research will be conducted with customers to identify what sorts of marketing promotions would be most effective in encouraging them to buy healthier products. These promotions will then be used in a number of Co-operative food stores over a fixed period. The study will examine electronic point of sale (EPOS) data over several months to measure whether people?s shopping patterns are influenced during and after the marketing promotions. In addition, a survey of customers will be conducted to examine their views on and responses to the marketing promotions, and any impact this activity has on their knowledge and attitudes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501271","grantId":"G0501271","fundValue":"239474","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martine  Stead","coPersons":["Annie  Anderson","Anne Marie  MacKintosh","Leigh  Sparks","Douglas  Eadie","Anne  Findlay","Nick  Hanley"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
