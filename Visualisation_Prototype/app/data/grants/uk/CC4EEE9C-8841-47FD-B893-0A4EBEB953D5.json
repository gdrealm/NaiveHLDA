{"id":"CC4EEE9C-8841-47FD-B893-0A4EBEB953D5","title":"Mrs Thatcher's Criminological Legacy - A Secondary Analysis Scoping Project","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to assess the longterm impacts of neo-conservative social and economic policies on people's experiences of crime and insecurity. We do this through an examination of the Conservative Governments of 1979-1997.\n<br />\n<br />Mrs. Thatcher's government was elected in 1979. Howard Glennester described this period as representing &quot;the biggest break with social policy tradition since 1945&quot;. Although Thatcher did not remain in office past the Autumn of 1992, John Major continued in office until May 1997. These governments embarked upon a radical agenda of social and economic transformation, which included cutting back on welfare provision, selling council housing, restructuring the economy and rethinking education policies. In addition to this, there was a change in social values which placed an increased importance on individualism and private wealth, and eroded collectivist traditions in the UK.\n<br />\n<br />This grant will assess the feasibility of exploring the impact of these changes on the UK's experience of crime using existing data sets which have been collected since the 1970s. This study will not provide answers to questions about how these changes impacted upon people's feelings about crime or their involvement in it, but rather it will outline a robust methodology for doing so.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2688","grantId":"RES-000-22-2688","fundValue":"29144","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Farrall","coPersons":["Jonathan  Jackson"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
