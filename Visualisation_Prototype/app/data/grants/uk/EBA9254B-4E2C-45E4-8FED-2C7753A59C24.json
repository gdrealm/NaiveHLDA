{"id":"EBA9254B-4E2C-45E4-8FED-2C7753A59C24","title":"Extending UK manufacturing capacity through the introduction of continuous processing unit operations","abstractText":"A collaborative R&amp;D project to design, build and trial a modular unit for the continuous production of a range of market\nleading anionic surfactants, currently manufactured in the UK by Croda Europe Ltd. Based on patented Continuous\nOscillating Baffle Reactor (COBR) technology, the project will deliver a new process for the manufacture of existing\nproducts, with significant improvements in operational and capital costs and process sustainability without impacting\nproduct quality. Processes are specifically designed for integration with existing batch manufacturing assets to provide\nincreased capacity without the need for new supporting infrastructure and extended footprint.\nThe consortium believes that the 30% targeted reduction in operational costs, combined with reduced capital requirements\nwill make investment in UK manufacturing a competitive option in a global market. This industry led, four partner\nconsortium (Croda, CPI, University of Cambridge, Institute for Manufacturing and NiTech) will establish technical and\ncommercial viability of the concept; de-risking Croda future commercial investment in the proposed technology. The\nimpact of this strategy to create flexible manufacturing capacity on existing business models will be explored.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508949/1","grantId":"EP/N508949/1","fundValue":"100356","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  Evans","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
