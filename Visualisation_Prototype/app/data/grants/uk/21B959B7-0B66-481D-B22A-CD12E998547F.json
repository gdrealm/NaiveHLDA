The two proteins thought to cause Alzheimer's are called amyloid-beta and tau. The precise mechanisms by which these proteins aggregate into toxic forms are unknown, but there is accumulating evidence that the shape and size of forming aggregates is intricately linked to the onset and progression of disease. Yet there are no tools to study the growth of toxic aggregates in living cells, they are simply too small to be observed with traditional techniques. For the development of potential therapies against Alzheimer's, a microscopic understanding of the events leading to aggregation, and their consequence on affected cells, is crucial. Being able to observe protein aggregation in brain cells would permit us to relate the appearance of protein &quot;clumps&quot; with their toxic effect. Do affected cells malfunction? In what way? What aggregate species cause the cells to malfunction? Can we identify the toxic species leading cells to 'misbehave'? Can we inhibit the formation of &quot;toxic shapes&quot; in living cells through the addition of potential therapeutic agents? Can we stop the spreading of toxic species from cell-to-cell? Answers to these questions require radically new approaches to look into cells, at unprecedented resolution. In our group we have recently developed a new kind of microscope, a so called optical super-resolution microscope, that is so powerful that it is capable of visualising the shape of protein aggregates directly in cultured brain cells, which we use as model systems of disease. We were the first researchers to demonstrate that it is possible to obtain 'images' of toxic protein shapes in neurones, and here we propose to use this newly developed tool to shed new light on the mechanisms that lead to the onset and propagation of disease.\nThe aims of our proposed research project are: 1) to identify specific species of amyloid-beta and tau in neurones and other cells present in the brain and to relate the shape, and size of these species to the appearance of disease symptoms. 2) to study amyloid-beta and tau trafficking in and out of cells and to infer on the implications of this on the possible mechanisms of disease progression. 3) to see whether potential inhibitors of protein aggregation and propagation have an effect on what we observe within the cells we study. We will test several promising anti-aggregation anti-propagation compounds that our collaborators provide.\nThrough the development and application of advanced microscopic imaging techniques developed in our group we aim to gain insight into the molecular level processes that lie at the heart of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Our techniques enable us to investigate the mechanisms that lead to the misfolding and spreading of proteins and their aggregation into toxic structures in live cell model systems at very high resolution, giving insight into the mechanisms of disease and its propagation. This understanding may help in the future search for potential therapeutic agents. The knowledge and tools generated here will provide a rational basis for the development of biomarkers/diagnostics that will enable physicians to: 1) detect the disease in its earliest stages when only biochemical changes are apparent; 2) identify the stage of the disease in order to tailor therapies for individual patients; and 3) monitor response to that treatment. Knowledge of these pathways will also provide targets for therapies to repair these pathways, thereby preventing or even reversing the disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K02292X/1","grantId":"MR/K02292X/1","fundValue":"534095","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"  We were able to obtain valuable original insight into the structure and state of neurotoxic protein aggregates involved in neurodegenerative diseases by developing and using super-resolution imaging methods to observe these proteins under physiological conditions and in-vivo (EP/H018301/1). In this research programme we have built on this work by studying the mechanism of growth and propagation of these species using super-resolution and fluorescence lifetime imaging techniques. At this stage we have published 4 papers demonstrating strong and original evidence for the potential prion-like toxicity and propagation of these toxic species. As well as providing fundamental understanding into the mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases, which we share with the research community through close collaboration with other groups in the Cambridge Neuroscience consortium, we actively participate in media outreach activities to widen public knowledge of ongoing progress in understanding the mechanism of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
