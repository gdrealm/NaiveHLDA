{"id":"A2D4B0E0-3DFB-4ACA-859C-FF9FE46C66F2","title":"Training Researchers to Engage with Policy and Practice (TREPP)","abstractText":"<p>There is a growing commitment to a more evidence-informed approach to policy and practice in many sectors.&nbsp;The ESRC UK Centre for Evidence Based Policy &amp; Practice has run a series of training events since 2000, providing an opportunity for researchers to both contribute their knowledge and expertise to practical affairs and to secure new sources of research funding.&nbsp;Many researchers lack the skills to seize these opportunities; equally, many practitioners can gain from a better understanding of the research-policy relationship and the acquisition of relevant skills. Through these events the Centre has built up considerable expertise in training researchers to gain the necessary skills for conducting research that transfers into policy and practice; for improving their understanding of the research-policy linkage; for communicating their outputs more effectively; and for mastering the appropriate techniques and resources for identifying, accessing and assessing the existing research base in a wide range of fields.&nbsp;The Centre’s work within this Initiative will build upon this experience, providing introductory courses and advanced workshops together with an annual five-day postgraduate residential school. During the second year of the programme web-based interactive training resources will be developed and made available on the Centre’s Evidence Network website.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PTA-035-25-0002","grantId":"PTA-035-25-0002","fundValue":"96547","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ken  YoungCharlotte  Humphrey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
