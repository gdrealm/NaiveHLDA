Hole Systems Analysis: An integrated view of eTech element security and impacts, from deposits to products and beyond.","abstractText":"Will we be able to meet the UK's future demand for products and services based on E-tech elements? Between these services and the holes in the ground where minerals are extracted lies a complex supply chain, and the security of our mineral supply can only be assessed by a whole systems view linking our understanding of geological resources, mineralogy, metallurgy, processing, demand (design, manufacture and use) and environmental impacts. This proposal brings together four leading UK institutions, with initial support from businesses spanning this full supply chain, to work towards such an integrated assessment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L001632/1","grantId":"NE/L001632/1","fundValue":"87881","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This was a catalyst grant for 8 months designed to prepare us to develop a full proposal - which we submitted to NERC/EPSRC in July 2014.
