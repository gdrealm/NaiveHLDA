{"id":"3FCD2A93-6034-4C84-A804-FD0836EF4841","title":"Parameterized Algorithmics for the Analysis and Verification of Constrained Workflow Systems","abstractText":"Many business processes (or workflows) can be modeled as a set of\ncomputational tasks or steps. Some of these steps may be performed by a human\nagent (a &quot;user&quot;) or a software agent operating under the control of a user.\nThere may be some flexibility in the order in which those steps may be\ncompleted: one step, for example, can be performed in parallel with some\nother step(s), while another step may be required to be performed before some\nother step(s). In addition to such &quot;control flow&quot; constraints on a business\nprocess, we may wish to impose restrictions on the users who perform the\nsteps in the workflow. Some steps, for example, may be commercially sensitive\nand must be performed by a senior member of the user population. Requirements\nof this nature can be captured in an authorization policy stating which users\nare allowed to perform which steps. It is comparatively easy to ensure that\nsuch policies are enforced. However, we may wish to impose more complex rules\non the business process. We might require, for example, that the same user\ndoes not perform a particularly sensitive combination of steps; this is\nsometimes known as the &quot;two-man rule&quot; for &quot;four-eyes rule&quot;.\n\nThe combined effect of all these constraints on a business process is that it\nmay not be possible to allocate users to steps in such a way that all\nconstraints are satisfied simultaneously. It is known that determining\nwhether a workflow specification (defining the control flow and authorization\nconstraints) is satisfiable is a hard computational problem. Moreover, it is\nclearly important to determine whether a workflow specification is\nsatisfiable; there is no point in defining a workflow specification that is\nnot satisfiable. An algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of a workflow\nspecification (a static analysis) must run in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe development of efficient algorithms to determine workflow\nsatisfiability will be one of the objectives of the proposed\nresearch. In particular, we will examine the workflow\nsatisfiability problem (WSP) from the perspective of\nfixed-parameter tractability. A hard computational problem, such as\nthe WSP, admits no algorithm with run-time polynomial in the size\nof the input to the problem. Informally, fixed-parameter tractable\n(FPT) problems are hard problems for which there exist algorithms\nwhose run-time is exponential in only one of the parameters that\ncomprise the input to the problem. If that parameter is small in\npractice and the exponential function of the parameter is not\ngrowing too fast, then an FPT algorithm will be efficient. Wang and\nLi (2010) have shown that a restricted form of WSP is FPT, but\ntheir algorithm is too slow to be of practical value. We will\ndevelop faster FPT algorithms that can be used in practice.\n\nMany workflow specifications of practical relevance do not have the\nform studied by Wang and Li. Thus, another objective of this\nproject is to understand what other forms of WSP are FPT. This\nobjective includes the study of richer types of constraints and\nmore complex control flow patterns. Once we have an understanding\nof what forms of WSP are FPT we will then evaluate the performance\nof FPT algorithms against existing solutions.\n\nA novel aspect of our proposal is to view WSP as a type of\nconstraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Despite the fact that WSP\nexhibits features that make it unusual as a CSP, we expect that\ncomplexity results, techniques and algorithms for CSP will still\nprovide new tools for tackling WSP. We believe that the\ninvestigators' expertise and experience in workflow modelling,\nalgorithmics, parameterized complexity and constraint satisfaction\nwill yield fascinating insights into difficult theoretical problems\nand provide practical and relevant tools that could be deployed in\ncommercial business information systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K005162/1","grantId":"EP/K005162/1","fundValue":"602797","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  As far as I know, they have not been used yet, outside of research.
