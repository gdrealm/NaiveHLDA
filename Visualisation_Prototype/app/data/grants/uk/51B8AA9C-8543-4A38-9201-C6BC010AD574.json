Such flying discs are attractive because they can in the future lead to reliable and effective Miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which are important in a vast number of applications, including surveillance, reconnaissance and increased border security. Instrumented test-rigs will be constructed during the course of this project to study the control problems pertaining to powered flight of spinning discs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F06022X/1","grantId":"EP/F06022X/1","fundValue":"364939","fundStart":"2009-01-12","fundEnd":"2012-06-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The negative imaginary systems results developed during this grant have significant potential use in nanotechnology and the developed methods are currently being investigated in nanopositioning control of scanning probe microscopes, such as atomic force microscopes, using piezo-electric actuators/transducers and piezotubes.
