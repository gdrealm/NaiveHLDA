The widespread occurrence of microRNAs in animal and plant genomes was only discovered in 2001. The miRBase database was established soon afterwards to provide a range of services to the microRNA community. In particular, miRBase confidentially assigns names to novel microRNA discoveries before they are published in the scientific literature. This assures that the same microRNA receives the same name in each paper that describes it, and more importantly, that different microRNAs are never referred to by the same name. The independent management of a coordinated naming scheme has allowed the enormous growth of the field. miRBase also stores and distributes all published microRNA sequences, together with the references that describe them, their locations in the genome, information about their function, and other related sequences. These services have quickly become entirely essential to the microRNA community. The discovery of novel microRNA sequences has continued at pace, increasing significantly in recent months with the use of new sequencing technologies. The database currently contains over 8500 entries, an increase of over 4000 in the past 2 years. This proposal provides the resources to manage and drive the next phase of microRNA biological discovery. In particular, we will develop new interfaces that allow the microRNA biologist to contribute information about any microRNA to the database. We will expand the set of microRNA sequences in the database to include candidates and predictions that currently do not meet the strict criteria for inclusion, and provide specific information about their reliability. We will develop a system that assigns names to new microRNAs semi-automatically. Alongside the drive to discover all microRNAs in all genomes, the community is focused on establishing the targets of every microRNA. Relatively few microRNAs have experimentally validated targets, but several groups provide predicted targets via the web. We will develop a service that aggregates these predictions, together with the known target genes. We will also produce an interface that allows researchers to submit experimentally determined target genes to the database. All data in miRBase are available on the web, and for download by FTP. The website receives between 100000 and 300000 page views each week, and the papers that describe miRBase have been cited in over 650 scientific publications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G022623/1","grantId":"BB/G022623/1","fundValue":"473819","fundStart":"2009-12-07","fundEnd":"2014-12-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The miRBase database is used by &amp;gt;20000 researchers each month, from both academia and commercial sectors.

This database is the central repository for all new microRNA sequences and we are responsible for naming all microRNA genes as they are discovered. The work funded on this grant enabled a number of improvements to be made to the database and the website through which it is accessed. In particular, we incorporated novel data types, primarily deep sequencing data, to allow the user to query expression of microRNAs in different tissues, and to the judge the validity of previous microRNA annotations. The miRBase database is used by &amp;amp;gt;20000 researchers, in both academia and industry, every month. The uses are varied, including the commercial development of kits and tools for microRNA research, and testing of microRNAs for clinical applications. All such work world-wide starts from sequences available in the miRBase database. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
