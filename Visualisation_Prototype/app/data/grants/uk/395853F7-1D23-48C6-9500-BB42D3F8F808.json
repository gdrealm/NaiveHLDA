They have attracted considerable scientific interest over the last ten years as they are expected to contain unique microbial lifeforms and detailed records of past climate change. Examination of these contents requires scientists to penetrate into a lake, and measure and sample the lake water and sediment. No lake has yet to be explored in this way, however. This form of direct analysis can only take place once a lake has been characterised fully by geophysical methods (to uncover the morphology of the ice base and the water depth of the lake). Of the 145 known subglacial lakes in Antarctica none have been measured to the level required for meaningful direct analysis to take place. We propose to undertake a comprehensive geophysical exploration of a 10 km long subglacial lake in West Antarctica, near the Ellsworth Mountains, named Subglacial Lake Ellsworth. The result of the project will be the first fully characterised subglacial lake environment and the establishment of a candidate for future direct exploration. Data analysis and modelling will be undertaken at the University of Bristol, the British Antarctic Survey and Northumbria University. Ice thickness will be determined from ice-penetrating radar, water depths will be found using seismic exploration, and ice flow and accumulation will be obtained from direct surface measurements. A series of numerical models will be used to understand the history of the lake, the flow of ice across the lake and the circulation of water within the lake. Data visualisation will be undertaken in conjunction with Dr. Martin Jakobsson (collaborator). Following this project, the next step will be to send a probe into Lake Ellsworth. A UK-led team has been assembled to plan such work (see www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/ellsworth), and take on what is arguably the most eagerly awaited and high-profile scientific project in the history of Antarctic science. Hence, the geophysical work we propose here will be thought of, in years to come, as a hugely important first step towards the understanding of one of the greatest unexplored habitats on Earth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D008638/1","grantId":"NE/D008638/1","fundValue":"259343","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Martin John Siegert","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" We collected radar and seismic data, as well as GPS and weather information, over Subglacial Lake Ellsworth during two seasons in 2007/8 and 2008/9. The data represent the most detailed measurement of a subglacial lake in Antarctica, allowing us to form an accurate understanding of the size and shape of the lake, which we have used to evaluate the best location for direct measurement and sampling. We have also used the information to measure the surrounding subglacial topography, which shows evidence of major former dynamics ice sheet changes in centre West Antarctica. Given the unprecidented resolution of the data, we have been able to 'ground truth' some satellite observations of the ice surface, to interpolate basal topography in regions curently absent of radar data. We have received significant media and public interest in this work. We have serviced this interest through a poroject website, and in numerous appearences on TV, radio and newspapers.\n Given that there is a moratorium on exploitation of Antarctic resources, under the Antarctic Treaty, it is difficult to see how this will be advanced. However, all the data collected in the programme are available on the BAS web-based datacentre, and are freely available for anyone to access and use.
