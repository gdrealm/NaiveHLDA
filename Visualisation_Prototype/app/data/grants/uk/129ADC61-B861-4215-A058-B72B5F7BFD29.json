{"id":"129ADC61-B861-4215-A058-B72B5F7BFD29","title":"Examining brain structure and function in persistent developmental stutter","abstractText":"Stammering (also known as stuttering) is relatively common disorder of speech affecting about 5% of children and 1% of adults. During stammering, the flow of speech is often blocked or interrupted, and sounds or syllables are repeated or lengthened. \nPeople who stammer can speak fluently, however, if they hear their own voice fed back to them with a slight alteration either in timing or in pitch, if they speak as part of a group or if they sing. This suggests that the problem lies in the relationship between hearing one’s own speech and producing it. \nIn our study, we will use MRI to scan the brains of people who stammer and people who speak fluently. This will allow us to examine the areas of the brain involved in producing and listening to speech. We can also look at the connections between these areas, which provides an indication of how well these areas communicate. We will use functional MRI to look at the brain’s activity while people are speaking or listening to speech. We will compare the parts of the brain that are active when a person who stammers produces stammered speech with those active during fluent speech. We will then use another technique known as transcranial magnetic stimulation to stimulate these brain areas. This stimulation will tell us whether activity in different brain areas contributes to stammering or to fluency. \nThese studies represent the first steps in a program of investigation of people who stammer. It is hoped that they will shed light on the causes of stammering and help us to understand how different therapies work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400298","grantId":"G0400298","fundValue":"224355","fundStart":"2004-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kate  Watkins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
