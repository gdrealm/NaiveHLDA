It is therefore crucial to find new strategies to better prevent and manage T2D. This can be achieved by tailoring treatment to individuals, taking into account their genetic background in interaction with their lifestyle and global environment. Over the last 10 years, the gut microbiota has emerged as a mirror of all these interactions. Our body is inhabited by 10 times more bacterial than human cells, which represent a reservoir of over hundreds of thousands of unique extra genes that are potentially metabolically active. This hugely complex ecosystem bears the potential of new personalised medicine and prevention of metabolic disorders that develop as a result of gene-lifestyle-environment interactions. \nAlthough the gut microbiota has been under investigation for more than half a century, it is only now that new molecular tools, such as the development of high throughput DNA sequencing, enable to explore the mechanisms underlying their contribution to the host metabolism. To date, the detailed mechanisms by which the gut microbiota may influence the development of T2D remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that they exert multiple impacts on endogenous energy pathways, including production of short chain fatty acids and regulation of bile acid metabolism that both contribute to the balance of lipid metabolism. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the maternal and neonatal gut microbial environment influence the development of metabolic syndrome later in life, which ultimately leads to T2D, suggesting a programming influence of the gut bacteria on energy metabolism.\n Hence, this project aims at unraveling the biological mechanisms underlying the role of the microbial component that contributes towards the development of insulin resistance. We will use a well-characterised mouse model of T2D (db/db mice) in order to reveal the molecular processes underpinning the interaction between a genetic mutation causing an overeating behaviour and the microbial environment by isolating the specific metabolic contribution of each component.\nFor this purpose, we will cross homozygous wild-type and db/db animals twice to generate a range of genotypes that have been raised under two environmental conditions (control or diabetic microbial environments). This will enable to test the influence of maternal and neonatal microbial environments on heterozygous (db/+) animals, which are susceptible to developing T2D. We will also be able to assess the impact of the diabetic neonatal environment on the energy metabolism of control wild-type animals. Measurements of the microbe - energy metabolism interactions will be performed using a systems biology approach combining metabolic profiling, transcriptomics and metagenomics data. Upon completion, this original approach will provide new insights into the role of the maternal and neonatal microbial environment on metabolic programming of energy pathways and the aetiology of T2D. In addition, this project will generate unique animal models that are prone to developing T2D and which have been exposed from conception to birth to a diabetic microbial environment. These will enable to test new diet interventions of high interest for further research leading to the development of new prophylactic or therapeutic treatments to stop the progression of T2D.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M004945/1","grantId":"MR/M004945/1","fundValue":"417580","fundStart":"2015-08-03","fundEnd":"2018-08-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sandrine Paule Claus","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
