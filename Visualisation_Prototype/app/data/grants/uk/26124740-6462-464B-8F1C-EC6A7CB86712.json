Some of the most successful smoking prevention work in schools is already undertaken by pupils themselves in the lunch-hour and at a break-times. This study seeks to design and provide a preliminary evaluation of a schools-based, peer-led drugs education programme (similar to successful smoking programmes) that would train 12 year-olds (Year 2 in Scottish secondary schools) to intervene informally with their year-group peers to promote abstinence from illicit drugs. If the preliminary study in six schools is successful, then this will provide the basis for a full-scale trial.\nThe proposed research would be based at Glasgow University s Centre for Drug Misuse Research (with participation from experts in Bristol, Cardiff and Edinburgh).\nIn a controlled, experimental design involving six schools, pupils will be asked to volunteer for training from health promotion professionals on how to intervene effectively in everyday situations to promote abstinence from drugs among their Year 2 fellow-pupils. The year-group will then be followed up over time to see how effective the training has been.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601006","grantId":"G0601006","fundValue":"275415","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Bloor","coPersons":["James  McIntosh","Laurence Anthony Moore","Rona  Campbell","Candace  Currie","Neil  McKeganey"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
