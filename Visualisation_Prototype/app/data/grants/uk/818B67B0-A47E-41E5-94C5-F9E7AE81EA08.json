{"id":"818B67B0-A47E-41E5-94C5-F9E7AE81EA08","title":"Beyond Text in Legal Education","abstractText":"The use of texts continues to dominate both legal practice and legal education. Law students and legal professionals are obliged to learn and understand general rules and principles. There is no doubt that acquiring the skill to learn and manipulate texts is important for legal practice. It has, however, been recognised that the development of professional integrity in law schools and professional development programs has not been as effective as it could be. We hypothesise that this is because of the very limits of textual-based education: the development of the ethical imagination cannot rely solely on the skills acquired by an exclusively text-based education. \\n\\nOur project is based on the hypothesis that both experiencing the production of art (including both visual and movement-based art), and further reflecting upon that experience, including comparing it to other artistic productions, can lead to the more effective development of ethical perception amongst law students and legal professionals. In a similar (though not identical) way to that in which reading, producing and reflecting on literature can assist in developing ethical imagination, engaging in and reflecting upon art can, we hypothesise, assist persons to develop the capacity to see the many ethical dimensions of a given situation. \\n\\nThe first stage of this project will bring together three artists (a visual-based artist, a movement-based artist, and a curator) with legal professionals, legal scholars and legal education (both tertiary and professional) policy makers. The artists will lead three integrated workshops, focusing on both the production and appreciation of visual and movement-based artworks. These practice-led workshops will be held in a local art gallery. The three artists are all experienced in working with persons who have had no or little exposure to the production and/or appreciation of visual and movement-based art. Some of the activities held as part of these workshops will be recorded and will be displayed on the project's website.\\n\\nThe experiences acquired in these practice-led workshops will then form the foundation for reflection about the theoretical and practical implications for both tertiary and professional legal education. Theoretically speaking, we will engage with the literature examining: 1) the ethical imagination; 2) the role of the humanities and arts in the development of the ethical imagination; 3) and the aims, purposes and resources of tertiary legal education and professional development programs. \\n\\nThe participants in the practice-led workshops will return to Edinburgh to present papers at a mini-conference. The papers will compare and contrast their experiences in the practice-led workshops with the above-mentioned literature. The papers will be edited and collected together to form a book. \\n\\nThe particpants will also spend a day considering what policy implications may follow for legal education and professional development programs. Possibilities for enhancing tertiary legal education curricular with the use of non-textual resoruces will be of primary concern. A recommendations paper will be drafted and will form the foundation for dissemination in seminars with policy makers in legal education. \\n\\nThe project will involve collaboration between legal scholars, legal professionals and legal education policy-makers in the UK and the US. Both countries have recently been witness to a number of books and reports criticising the capacity of legal education systems in those countries to contribute effectively to the development fo professional integrity amongst lawyers. \\n\\nAn initial network of law firms, galleries, academies and policy institutes in the UK and the US has been established. This project will allow the participants to consolidate and further develop a common research base. The workshops will thereby allow for an innovative investigation of how legal education can go beyond text.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G000476/1","grantId":"AH/G000476/1","fundValue":"24887","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Zenon  Bankowski","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
