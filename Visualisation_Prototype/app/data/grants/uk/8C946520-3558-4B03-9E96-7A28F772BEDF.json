What happens when many simple objects interact? How does the behaviour of the whole emerge from the simple laws obeyed by its parts? The constituent objects range from electrons and nuclei to girders and cables, but the common aim is to predict the complex large-scale behaviour from the simpler small-scale behaviour. In essence, computers are used to build bridges between length scales.\n\nThe use of computers to simulate molecules and solids in terms of their constituent particles is a successful example of this sort of bridge building. The inputs are the identities of the atoms that make up the molecule or solid, and the outputs describe the behaviour of the assembly as a whole. Since the electrons that bond atoms together are quantum mechanical objects and behave more like waves than particles, these simulations have to solve the quantum mechanical Schroedinger equation.\n\nQuantum mechanical simulations are increasingly used across much of the EPSRC's physical sciences portfolio, including all of the following areas: quantum fluids and solids; magnetism and magnetic materials; functional ceramics and inorganics; materials for energy applications; electrochemical sciences; surface science; chemical structure; chemical reaction dynamics and mechanisms; plasmonics; light matter interaction and optical phenomena; photonic materials and metamaterials; cold atoms and molecules; chemical biology and biological chemistry; graphene and carbon nanotechnology; and catalysis. They have also had an impact on parts of the engineering portfolio. The practical importance of quantum mechanical simulation to many of these fields is still quite small, but it is growing fast and its success has been one of the most striking scientific stories of the past twenty years. Few other fields of research have done so much to revitalise and maintain the health of other disciplines.\n\nBy far the most common approach to quantum mechanical materials simulation is density functional theory (DFT). This offers a good balance between ease-of-use and precision, but is not quite accurate enough for room-temperature chemistry, biology and biochemistry. This has led to a widespread feeling that it is time to put effort into developing more accurate approaches. One of these is the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method that is the subject of this proposal.\n\nDMC simulations are much slower than DFT simulations but are more accurate and can be used to study large systems of several thousand interacting electrons. Furthermore, unlike DFT codes, a well-written DMC code will run with almost 100% parallel efficiency on even the largest of the world's parallel computers. Large-scale parallelism just happens to suit the method. This proposal seeks support to make CASINO able to run efficiently on the next generation of supercomputers, which will use GPUs (graphics processing units, originally developed for use in graphics cards for computer gamers) for most of the heavy computation. GPU programming presents new challenges and a great deal of work will be required to re-engineer CASINO to use GPUs efficiently. We will also work on making CASINO much easier to use, and further develop our ideas about how to optimize trial wave functions and calculate inter-atomic forces efficiently using DMC. Our aim is to make CASINO into a flexible, efficient, and easy-to-use tool capable of running almost anywhere. CASINO is already the world's most widely used DMC code. We would like the chance to make sure that it retains its lead as the use of DMC takes off over the next decade or two.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K038141/1","grantId":"EP/K038141/1","fundValue":"212518","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This grant has only been running just over a year so far.

This solves a problem that has been holding back the field for almost 20 years and has allowed us to complete the first ever diffusion-QMC-based molecular dynamics simulation of a chemical reaction. It has never before been possible to study the picosecond by picosecond progress of an interesting chemical reaction with such accuracy.\n\nWe have also developed a successful new interactive website for the CASINO project, incorporating access to the code, message boards, blogs, and other social networking goodness. The QMC molecular dynamics method is an important breakthrough but it will require a large and long-term effort to implement it in a robust and general way in all of the handful of widely used QMC codes globally. This type of &amp;quot;infrastructural&amp;quot; work is important for the progress of science but is not immediately related to applications of obvious financial value and therefore difficult to fund.
