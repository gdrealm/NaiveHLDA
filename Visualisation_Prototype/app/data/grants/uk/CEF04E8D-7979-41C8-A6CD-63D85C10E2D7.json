Analysis of generational change in social distances","abstractText":"<p>This project measures, and investigates trends in, ‘social distance’ in the UK.&nbsp; Using secondary survey datasets that feature information of social connections held by people (eg the UK’s British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society), it calculates dimensions of social distance on the basis of patterns of social interaction recorded between the members of groups, and these are traced across recent decades to explore if social interaction structures have altered in parallel with major demographic and other social changes (such as changes in family structure and employment patterns, and innovations in travel and communication). Ultimately, the analysis is designed to show whether there is evidence of growing social distance between groups over recent generations in Britain.<br /><br />The project builds upon previous work by the investigators and their colleagues concerned with depicting the social distance between occupational groups, but extends that both by using a wider range of statistical techniques, and by exploring social distance between other interesting social groups (for example the readers of different newspapers, members of different ethnic and religious groups, and supporters of different political parties and perspectives).
