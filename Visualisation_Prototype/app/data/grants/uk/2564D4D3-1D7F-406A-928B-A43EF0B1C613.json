{"id":"2564D4D3-1D7F-406A-928B-A43EF0B1C613","title":"The Impact Agenda","abstractText":"<p>This seminar series adopts an interdisciplinary perspective to examine and clarify the concept of ‘impact’ in the context of academic research in humanities and social science. Impact has become of increasing concern in academic life and these seminars aim to tease out how and why this has come about; the processes used by different disciplines and how academics can maximise the impact of their research. The first seminar explores the contemporary framing of the relationship between intellectual activity, academic institutions, and the public good.</p>\n\n<p>Seminars 2 and 3 explore the process through which impact is achieved. Seminar 2 considers how the impact of culture and cultural processes might be assessed and Seminar 3 focuses on the relationship between academia and government departments and processes by which knowledge is transmitted. Seminar 5, on new frontiers of impact, links closely to seminar 4 (on new kinds of technology) and also builds on seminars 2 and 3 by indicating how the relations between knowledge producers and users determine the way in which knowledge is used.</p>\n\n<p>The final seminar identifies successful examples of impact and provide some ideas for increasing impact. Non-academic participants are integral to the whole series.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0927","grantId":"RES-451-26-0927","fundValue":"18259","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Angela  Dale","coPersons":["Peter  Halfpenny","Nikos  Tzavidis","Celia  Russell","Ian  Miles","Peter  Wade","Rob  Procter"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
