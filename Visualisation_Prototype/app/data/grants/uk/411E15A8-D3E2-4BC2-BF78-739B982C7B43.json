{"id":"411E15A8-D3E2-4BC2-BF78-739B982C7B43","title":"UK-China Particle Technology Forum III","abstractText":"Particulate materials account for over 60% of all the industrial products and are of significant importance to the global economy, society and environments. Examples of these materials include dusts, pollutants, catalysts, protective coatings, composites, photocopy and printer toners, cosmetic pastes, pharmaceutical drugs, fertilizers, cement, solids fuels, and foodstuff. However, manufacturing, handling and processing of such materials still face numerous challenges. Both UK and China have developed large communities in particle science &amp; technology in the past few decades for addressing these challenges. In order to facilitate communications and to foster collaborations between the communities in the two countries, the UK-China Particle Technology forum, which is a non-profit event series and is run every two years in rotation between UK and China, was initiated in 2006. The forum aims at1) Enhancing communications between scientists and engineers from both academic institutions and industrial companies of the two countries;2) Establishing a platform to foster new and substantial collaborations to identify and address common challenges in particle technology.The UK-China Particle Technology Forum III continues the primary objective of the two previous forums, which were successfully held in Leeds, UK (2007) and Guiyang, China (2009), to provide opportunities for scientists and engineers to discuss recent advances, to share knowledge and to identify future collaborative research directions in the field of particle science &amp; technology and their roles in environment, energy, healthcare and other emerging applications. It also aims at consolidating the collaborations established through the two previous forums and fostering new collaborations between UK and China.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I030476/1","grantId":"EP/I030476/1","fundValue":"17270","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chuan-Yu  Wu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
