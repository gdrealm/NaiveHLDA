That project examines quality assurance and evaluation as a form of policy steering and/or ‘Europeanisation’ of education across the education systems of Finland, Denmark and the UK (England and Scotland).</p> \n<p>'Governing by Numbers' examines the ways in which data are constituted, produced and used in the quality assurance and evaluation process in compulsory schooling in England and Scotland. It explores the relationship between processes of data collection, selection and ordering and the negotiations around such processes at national, local and school levels in order to assess the extent to which data may be understood as a form of governing. The research maps the flow of data in increasingly networked systems, and explores the extent to which quality assurance and evaluation principles of synthesis and review are possible in practice. There is a strong inter-UK comparative element, to capture differences between England and Scotland in data production and use, and investigation of the impact of European data production and collection processes on national systems through this project and the associated collaborative ECRP proposal.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1385","grantId":"RES-000-23-1385","fundValue":"374125","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer  Ozga","coPersons":["Martin  Lawn","Robert  Lingard"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
