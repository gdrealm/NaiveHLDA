These events occur in specialized structures, synapses, where the release site and suitable ?receptor? are juxtaposed. It is imperative for compentent neuronal communication that the receptor be trafficked and targeted to the appropriate synapse. Furthermore, the number and stability of the receptors placed in the receptive zone needs to have some degree of ?plasticity? so that it is capable of accommodating different rates of delivery. If messages are transmitted at high frequency ?these might be important messages that need a special response and some mechanisms for recalling the importance of this particular message. In the case of excitatory neurotransmission, glutamate is the neurotransmitter and for moment to moment communication, the ?AMPA receptor? is the responsive element. How do the AMPA receptors get to the appropriate synapse and how are the number and stability of the AMPA receptors altered to interpret and respond appropriately to important messages? These questions form the basis of this project proposal. A family of proteins, the TARPs (Transmembrane AMPAR Regulatory Proteins) have recently been identified and shown to be important components of the protein machines that shuttle AMPARs from their site of assembly to their final destination in the excitatory synapse. But they don?t operate alone, many other proteins known and unknown are also required but what are they? When are they required? And what do they contribute to this whole complex process? This is what we hope to discover here. \nTo illustrate how important TARPs are consider the stargazer mouse, it fails to make one particular TARP family member,the TARPgamma2 variety. As a consequence the mouse develops absence epilepsy, motor co-ordination, balance and posture difficulties (ataxia) and inner ear problems. Furthermore, the proteins that they help to traffic and target are important in processes such as learning and memory ?dysfunctional TARPs may result in cognitive impairment. Our aim is to identify proteins that assist and regulate TARPs, establish how they know when to perform their tasks and how efficiently and hard they need to work.\nThis information will be transmitted to the public in oral presentations and posters at Durham?s Brain Awareness Week which I organise, Neuroscience-North East - a conference organized for early-career neuroscientists in which I?m also involved and at the annual Durham Science Fair for local school children.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401395","grantId":"G0401395","fundValue":"271259","fundStart":"2006-01-02","fundEnd":"2010-03-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"C  Thompson","coPersons":["Antoni Ryszard Slabas"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
