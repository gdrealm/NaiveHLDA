{"id":"26FBE4AD-25D3-4A37-AB83-8CA9BCAD2FF6","title":"Understanding Public Procurement of Innovation","abstractText":"<p>The project seeks to analyse how the government spending on goods and services can be better used to stimulate innovation and economic recovery and how to improve and maintain public services while reducing their cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the 2-year project is to analyse rigorously how the public demand for goods and services in the UK is currently influencing innovation behaviour of suppliers and supply chains&nbsp;- and how this can be improved. It seeks to understand how demand is articulated and transmitted and how policy instruments may be used more effectively and with increased reach to business, including SMEs. </p>\n\n<p>The project will aim to get in the inside of procurement decisions to understand why public sector buyers are often risk-averse and to identify the skills needed to handle buying an innovative solution. A particular interest is to show how this approach could work in a supply chain as this can be the only way that smaller companies with more flexible ideas can get a share of large contracts. Key methods used will be ethnographic case studies a broad industry survey. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H008535/1","grantId":"ES/H008535/1","fundValue":"487611","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jakob  Edler","coPersons":["Andrew  James","Elvira  Uyarra","Andrew Peter McMeekin","Luke Gregory Georghiou"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
