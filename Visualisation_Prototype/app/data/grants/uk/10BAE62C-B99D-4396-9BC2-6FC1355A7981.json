The function of these components is primarily to carry current, reduce oxygen and oxidise a fuel. As these devices are typically constructed using traditional manufacturing techniques there is little control of the atomic scale processes that occur at the interfaces between each of these components. As the electrochemistry that controls the fuel cell operation is correlated with the structure and strain at the interfaces between the components and with the electrode/environment interfaces, a clear understadning of these processes at the atomic scale is essential if optimised, high performacne, low cost fuel cells are to be produced. In this work we will use a complementary suite of advanced techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Low energy ion scattering and crystal truncation rods to probe the structure of the interfaces, including buried interfaces, and link this with surface chemistry and fuel cell performance. Once these key factors are understood we will apply this knowledge to the design and manufacture of 2D and 3D electrode structures. We will engage with our international partners to complement the work undertaken at imperial and test devices with our industrial partner, AFC Energy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M014142/1","grantId":"EP/M014142/1","fundValue":"1076040","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2019-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen John Skinner","coPersons":["Mary  Ryan","John Anthony Kilner","David James Payne","C  Nicklin","Ainara  Aguadero"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
