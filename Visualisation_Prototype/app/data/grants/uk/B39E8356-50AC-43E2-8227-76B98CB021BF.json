All researchers will document the practices of Village Courts in different regions of this highly diverse country, with the aim of counteracting a political rhetoric that the Village Courts are failing with actual evidence of the ways in which ordinary Papua New Guinean people have maintained and developed a system of justice and dispute management that works for them in the absence of state involvement or support.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J012300/1","grantId":"ES/J012300/1","fundValue":"147940","fundStart":"2012-08-31","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Denley FischerMelissa Aviva Demian","coPersons":["Fiona  Hukula","Michael  Goddard"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
