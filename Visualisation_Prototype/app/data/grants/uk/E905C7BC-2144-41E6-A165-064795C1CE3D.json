Areas addressed by the grant include enhancing measures of poverty and methods for impact evaluation and increasing understanding of poverty dynamics, for example, by developing a measure of non-cognitive skills for use with young people and a protocol for the adaptation of similar measures in developing countries (the use of cognitive debriefing techniques will be discussed in a paper to be drafted early 2015; it also informed an ESRC grant application to develop a survey measure of capabilities for use in India and other developing countries). The work funded by the grant feeds into broader trends, for example, a growing interest in mixed methods and interdisciplinary studies to address complex social problems and evaluate the impact of interventions. I continue to work with colleagues at UEA on impact evaluation short courses and masters programme and in co-authoring 'Impact Evaluation for International Development: The Essential Guide' which will be published by Routledge in 2015. I have provided impact evaluation training to Uganda government officials (funded by GIZ) and have provide training to DFID evaluation officers on the evaluation of small n interventions, building on a new short course I delivered in June 2014 with Maren Duvendack. I am also collaborating with the new DFID-funded Centre for Development Impact http://www.ids.ac.uk/cdi, which UEA has become one of the partners of, and have co-organised two events on ethics in impact evaluation (September 2014 and January 2015).
