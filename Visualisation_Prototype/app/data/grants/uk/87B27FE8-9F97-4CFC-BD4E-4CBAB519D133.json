Involvement in peer bullying has been found to be associated with a range of adverse outcomes in childhood including academic problems, physical and mental health problems, and suicidal ideations and attempts. An understanding of which factors increase the risk of children becoming involved in bullying behaviour at school is necessary in order to develop prevention or intervention programs that go beyond the school context. Moreover, it is still unclear whether bullying throws a long shadow over affected childrenâ€™s lives into adulthood.</p>\n\n<p>This project will use a number of prospective data sets (ALSPAC, Understanding Society (USoc), Great Smokey Mountain Study (GSMS)) to investigate:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>the relationship between pregnancy (family adversity, maternal anxiety and depression), preschool family factors (problematic partner relationships, parenting) and individual characteristics (behavioural dysregulation, ethnicity) on involvement in peer bullying at school age</li>\n\n <li>the impact of bullying in childhood on late adolescence and early adult psychiatric morbidity, suicide ideation and attempts, susceptibility to health problems and wealth creation.</li>\n\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K003593/1","grantId":"ES/K003593/1","fundValue":"156352","fundStart":"2012-11-26","fundEnd":"2014-11-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Dieter  Wolke","coPersons":["Ngianga-Bakwin  Kandala"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
