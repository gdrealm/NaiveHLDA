Edinburgh University has been trailblazing in this important activity. Our recent award of an MRC translator allowed us to take on the services of a well-known entrepreneur who has reorganised our approach and galvanized our capacities. This has already led to the formation of 3 new companies in the last 6 months. However, fully to realise our potential to develop treatments for major unmet needs such as cancer pain, memory loss, mental illnesses, clostridium difficile, heart disease and cancer, we need, firstly, to establish a small team in support of our MRC translator to speed up progress, and, secondly, to build a core laboratory to train and support our staff in their efforts to discover and develop new drugs. Overall we hope vastly to improve the translation of our globally-leading research to benefit people and thus to provide clear evidence that this can be done effectively in a UK Medical School, given the right approach and some pump-prime funding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801673","grantId":"G0801673","fundValue":"297821","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Seckl","coPersons":["Malcolm  Walkinshaw","John  Savill"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
