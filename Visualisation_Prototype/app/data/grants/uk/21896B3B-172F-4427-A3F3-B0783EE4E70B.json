XEUS has been selected by ESA for an assessment study as one of the candidate L-class missions in the framework of the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 program. XEUS is designed to address two of the four main questions posed in ESA's Cosmic Visions, namely: 'What are the fundamental laws of the Universe?' and, 'How did the Universe originate, and what is it made of?' It will provide answers to some of the key questions in contemporary astrophysics: How did supermassive black holes form and grow? How did feedback from these black holes influence galaxy growth? How did large-scale structure evolve? How did the baryonic component of this structure become chemically enriched? How does gravity behave in the strong field limit? How does matter behave at supra-nuclear densities? XEUS provides unique astrophysical capabilities through its unprecedented sensitivity to the hot, million-degree Universe, and is fully complementary to the major future ground- and space-based observatories, JWST, LISA, ALMA, ELT and SKA. The proposed programme involves a set of technological and scientific activities within the XEUS project in the areas of the X-ray optics, the NFI and WFI focal plane instruments, and in the scientific definition of the XEUS project. The programme is focused on the XEUS Assessment and Phase A activities currently underway and will maintain and reinforce the UK's role XEUS in the next phase of the project, as well as strengthening the project itself by providing our considerable expertise in these areas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H004092/1","grantId":"ST/H004092/1","fundValue":"84901","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Willingale","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
