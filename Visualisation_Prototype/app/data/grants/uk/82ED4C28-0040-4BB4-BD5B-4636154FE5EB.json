{"id":"82ED4C28-0040-4BB4-BD5B-4636154FE5EB","title":"Quantifying the Effect of the Upper Atmospheric Electric Potential on Lower Atmospheric Temperature and Pressure","abstractText":"Weather and climate prediction are inevitably limited by incomplete knowledge of the Earth system and its external influences. One under-explored and consequently controversial area of research is the meteorological influence of the Sun through processes other than direct radiation, such as variations in the Earth-ionosphere electric potential in the global electric circuit driven by solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions. Previous work has suggested that a relationship exists (often termed the Mansurov effect) but previous correlations have been indirect and the effects most likely underestimated. BAS has considerable expertise in the measurement and understanding of the ionospheric electric potential pattern using the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN). We propose to use 15 years of SuperDARN electric potential measurements from both the northern and southern hemispheres to conduct the most comprehensive analysis to date of the relationship between the ionospheric electric potential and atmospheric temperature and pressure. If this analysis confirms a significant relationship then its consequences for weather and climate will be assessed by studying the climatologies for different ionospheric potential states and evaluating the possible effects on atmospheric modes like the North Atlantic Oscillation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I024852/1","grantId":"NE/I024852/1","fundValue":"370876","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The role of the Sun is one of the largest unknowns in the climate system and, as such, is an ongoing source of controversy in the climate change debate. We have now shown [Lam et al., 2013] that changes in the mid-latitude surface air pressure are indeed correlated with changes in the solar wind magnetic field. While a small change in surface pressure at Earth's poles with varying solar wind magnetic field has been acknowledged for several decades, we identified unanticipated significant changes to the structure of the planetary wave surface pressure field at the highly-populated mid latitudes. These solar wind effects are presently not represented in weather and climate models; we have shown that they may be a result of atmospheric current variability on tropospheric cloud microphysics [Lam et al., 2014]. Since the trajectories of storms tracking across the North Atlantic are highly dependent on the planetary wave configuration, so is the day-to-day weather experienced by the UK. The longer-term position of meanders in the North Atlantic jet stream, on a timescale of months, determines the location and the timing of more prolonged periods of low and of high pressure in and around that region. Correct modelling of the solar wind input could help to forecast both UK weather and longer-term weather trends, such as droughts, to the benefit of the UK economy. In addition, representation of the solar wind forcing of the atmosphere in climate models can not only increase their accuracy, but public confidence in policies based on the output of such models.

The existence of a surface meteorological response in the polar regions to fluctuations in the dawn-dusk component of the interplanetary magnetic field is well established, but meteorological effects resulting from fluctuations in the solar wind are presently poorly represented in weather and climate models. There is evidence that suggests that this Sun-weather connection occurs through coupling of the interplanetary magnetic field with the electric field of the ionosphere (the ionised upper atmosphere), and that this in turn affects meteorology through the global atmospheric electric circuit that exists between the Earthâ€™s surface and the ionosphere. Consequently it has previously been assumed that this effect maximises at high latitudes and is negligible at low and mid latitudes, because the perturbation of the global atmospheric electric field by the interplanetary magnetic field is concentrated in the polar regions. Previous work has only investigated polar surface effects, which has limited our insight into mechanisms. We have therefore investigated the magnitude of the surface effect worldwide, and the height-dependence of the polar effect from the surface to the mid-stratosphere, using global reanalysis data.\n\nThe most significant achievements of the project are that we have discovered that (i) the interplanetary magnetic field influences mid-latitude surface atmospheric pressure as a consequence of its effect on polar pressure and (ii) the polar mechanism involved operates in the lower troposphere, with resulting perturbations propagating upwards to the tropopause. These two discoveries were published in high-impact journals and both were chosen as journal highlights. As a consequence project team members have been invited onto international teams examining and reviewing the question of the effect of solar variability on weather and climate, and to give keynote talks at conferences. \n\nThe project identified a previously unrecognised difference between the mid-latitude mean surface pressure during intervals characterised by strong duskward and dawnward-directed interplanetary magnetic fields, and that this difference possesses a statistically-significant wave structure similar in location and form to atmospheric Rossby waves. The amplitude of the effect is comparable to typical initial analysis uncertainties in ensemble numerical weather prediction. Thus this relatively localised and small-amplitude solar influence on the upper atmosphere could have an important effect, via the nonlinear evolution of atmospheric dynamics, on critical processes such as European climate and the breakup of Arctic sea ice. \n\nThis project has also provided insight into the mechanism. The increase in time lag of the effect with increasing altitude in the polar troposphere and its confinement to the troposphere is consistent with the upward propagation by conventional atmospheric processes of a solar wind-induced variability originating in the lower troposphere. For instance, it is consistent with the effects of atmospheric current variability on tropospheric cloud microphysics put forward by Brian Tinsley and others. This is in contrast to the downward propagation of atmospheric e?ects to the lower troposphere from the stratosphere due to solar variability-driven mechanisms involving ultraviolet radiation or energetic particle precipitation. Further research is planned to investigate the physical mechanism responsible for the polar region effect, which could then allow the meteorological effect identified in this research to be included and tested in numerical weather prediction models.
