Dr McArdle was trained in media presentations as part of her Research into ageing-funded Fellowship and has participated in scientific interviews and discussions with local and national media and charity support groups. As we age, our muscles get smaller and weaker. In addition, muscles of older individuals are more prone to damage and when damaged, do not recover well. This leads to further weakness. This age-related problem has severe implications for older people. Weak muscles will result in an increased risk of falling, which can be fatal in an older person. On a day-to-day basis, muscle weakness leads to an inability of that person to carry out normal every-day tasks. The aim of this study is to understand more comprehensively why old muscles are unable to recover successfully following damage. Muscles of young individuals adapt and train rapidly. This training effect is associated with changes in the pattern of protein content of the muscles. This change in muscle content of a family of proteins, known as Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) is crucial to the ability of young muscle to repair itself successfully following damage. Our previous work has demonstrated that this ability to produce HSPs does not occur in old muscle. We do not understand fully the role of HSPs and their synthesis during recovery of young and old muscle following damage. Comprehensive understanding of this process will allow us to move closer to developing suitable therapeutic regimes aimed at maintaining the ability of muscles of older individuals to repair successfully following damage and will impact significantly on their Quality of Life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D014379/1","grantId":"BB/D014379/1","fundValue":"233997","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings from this study have advanced the field, providing novel information regarding the role of an inability of old muscles to produce HSPs in the development of sarcopenia.
