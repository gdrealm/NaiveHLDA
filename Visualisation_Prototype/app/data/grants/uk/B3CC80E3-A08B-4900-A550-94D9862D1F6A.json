Novel colocated antenna arrays gave enhanced capacity gains which were comparable with spaced antenna arrays. A versatile 8 by 8 MIMO channel sounder was realised with future applications. A new partner, the Swedish Ministry of Defence, FOI, joined the project and contributed to the experimental programme. The application of this work is outside academia, with potential uses within defense organisations as well as for specialised communications systems.
