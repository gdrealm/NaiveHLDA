This collection will be a valuable resource for the UK wheat community, as it would represent a source of new and novel alleles for agronomically important genes. We propose to open up the resource to the entire wheat community as an unencumbered resource free of MTAs and follow on IP agreements. The procedure utilises transgenic technology to create new alleles, however, any novel or useful alleles identified can easily be separated from the transgene by conventional crossing and segregation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E000126/1","grantId":"BB/E000126/1","fundValue":"86152","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Edwards","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" We have discovered and developed tens of thousands of wheat molecular markers (called SNPs).
