Existing evidence suggests that early-emerging antisocial behaviour problems are most likely to develop when genetically-vulnerable children experience harsh, non-supportive parenting. </p>\n\n<p>The goal of the research is to test this hypothesis and to identify physiological and psychological factors that explain this association. The sample will include 300 8- to 10-year-old children who were first evaluated as part of a separate study when they were three years old. Half of these children experienced very high levels of harsh, non-supportive parenting when they were three and half experienced low levels of harsh, non-supportive parenting. </p>\n\n<p>Research assistants will conduct home visits to interview parents and children about the children's behaviour, experiences of stressful life events, and family demographics. Children will provide samples of the stress hormone cortisol and children and parents will provide DNA samples. This study is expected to provide new information about why genes and environments combine to influence antisocial behaviour, to identify the most vulnerable children, and to identify modifiable risk factors for childhood antisocial behaviour that could become the targets of psychosocial or pharmacological interventions.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1583","grantId":"RES-062-23-1583","fundValue":"734290","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sara Rachel Jaffee","coPersons":["Edward Charles Melhuish","Jay  Belsky"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
