{"id":"EFF7C0EF-7745-473F-B5F8-646FB6EE7849","title":"Evolutionary Analysis of Non-Coding RNA Genes and Gene Families","abstractText":"Recent years has seen an increased appreciation of the importance of some parts of the genome that is transcribed from DNA to RNA but not translated from RNA to proteins, also known as non-coding RNA. Though probably not utilised in the same abundance as proteins, RNA molecules are now known to undertake core cellular functions like catalyse biological processes, regulate the production of other genes, and provide structural support. Due to the absence of the translation step and the fundamentally different principles governing structure formation for RNA molecules and proteins, the way non-coding RNA and protein-coding RNA evolves is quite different. The codon based encoding of proteins results in a three base periodicity of selective constraints on protein-coding RNA. Non-coding RNA is not translated, and thus not subject to codon caused constraints. However, the structures of RNA molecules have very strong base pairing interactions, similar to that seen in the Watson-Crick base pairing of the DNA double helix. Preservation of this base pairing results in structure dependent constraints on the evolution of non-coding RNA genes. We will investigate the evolution of non-coding RNA genes, in particular how local structure affects rates of mutation, and attempt to develop improved models for describing this type of evolution. A direct benefit of an improved understanding of RNA evolution will be better methods for recognising when the evolution separating two related sequences seems to have been governed by the types of constraints particular to non-coding RNA genes. This will assist in identifying non-coding RNA genes shared between related genomes, and hence in our ability to make sense of the genome sequences that become available. Due to the versatility of RNA in mediating biological processes, a replicability similar to DNA that is not possessed by proteins, and the presence of RNA in some of the most fundamental cellular functions, it has been hypothesised that life may have started with RNA or RNA-like molecules, the so-called RNA world. To what extent are modern non-coding RNA remnants from the RNA world, rather than of more recent origin? A few known families of non-coding RNA genes have been identified throughout most types of living organisms, but many families seems to be quite close knit lacking distant relatives. This could indicate a more recent origin, but could also be due to our lack of ability to recognise distant relatives as such (or even failure to identify distant relatives as non-coding RNA genes). We intend to address this problem by developing a novel method for recognising distant relatives by comparing representations describing the variability over the entire family of a non-coding RNA gene. As stated above, by far the most important source of constraints on the evolution of non-coding RNA genes is believed to stem from conservation of base pairing in the molecular structure of the RNA. It is thus of great importance for this project to be able to infer the base pairs of the functional structure, also known as the secondary structure, with high fidelity. As a stepping stone towards the main goals of this proposal we will thus also look into possible ways to improve secondary structure inference. Software tools from both this and other parts of the project will be made freely available for other researchers to use, either as source code or as web servers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D012139/1","grantId":"BB/D012139/1","fundValue":"201999","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jotun  Hein","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
