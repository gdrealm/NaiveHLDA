By studying a human premature ageing disease called Werner's Syndrome which essentially mimics normal ageing but much more quickly, scientists hope to understand the causes of many of the age-associated diseases. It is now known that most, if not all, of the many premature ageing aspects of Werner's syndrome result from the loss of a single protein known as WRN. We have shown that cells taken from patients with Werner's syndrome have problems copying their genetic blueprint, the DNA, and that such problems result in their DNA becoming very unstable. Such 'genomic instability' is known to be important in the development of many cancers, and it may also make people more prone to develop other serious diseases. To find out how WRN has such wide-ranging effects, we need to study the protein on its own in the test tube and to test the effect of making changes in it (mutations) in cells and whole organisms. Although some progress has been made using cells taken from patients, each batch of cells is different and we cannot precisely ascribe any changes to the WRN protein itself. In addition, we need to work out which parts of the WRN molecule are particularly important in keeping the DNA intact, and whether changes to these regions can affect how long a cell and even an organism lives. Obviously this is both impractical and unethical in mammalian systems, so we have chosen to examine the fruit fly, Drosophila. The fly is very well characterised, with the sequence of all the 'letters' of its DNA code already known, and many different genetic procedures are possible to 'mix and match' different combinations of genes. To date, we are the only researchers to have identified a WRN-like function in flies and we have very recently, and excitingly, shown that flies lacking this activity show a big increase in abnormal changes to their DNA, just like in patients with Werner's syndrome. By providing a full molecular and genetic analysis of the action of WRN in flies, we hope to answer significant questions as to what the protein is doing to protect our DNA. We are therefore planning to make molecular probes to look at when and where the fly WRN protein is made, what it does to DNA, what other proteins it works with and what aspects of the DNA copying process are affected when the protein is altered. Finally, by replacing the fly version of the WRN gene with the human WRN gene, we hope to develop a model system for future use in testing drugs that either block human WRN activity (for example to make otherwise long-lived cancer cells age quickly), or to promote longevity of normal cells, with the hope of avoiding many of the problems associated with ageing of vitally important cells in old age. The long term aim of such ageing research, and in particular, the development of model ageing systems, is to help achieve a healthy old age and prevent many of the debilitating illnesses associated with getting old.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E000924/1","grantId":"BB/E000924/1","fundValue":"343452","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used by BBSRC to highlight the value of basic biosciences underpinning health, featuring in their online 20 year timeline and in print material at the recent celebration of British Biosciences.

Using the fly system, we were able to understand more clearly how the encoded protein protects the DNA from damage as cell divide and how its loss may contribute to ageing. We have developed new ways of looking at how the protein works and hope to be able to use these technologies to test agents that can be used either to enhance its activity (anti-ageing) or inhibit it (anti-cancer). \n\nWe also discovered by chance a very similar gene that seems to be important in protecting cells from another type of DNA damage and mutation of which in humans is linked to a familial cancer syndrome. The exonuclease assay may be adaptable for higher throughput drug screening. The key findings on DmWRNexo activity have been published in a number academic journals (inlcuding a video journal to show exactly how we conduct the novel exonuclease assay) , and presented at conferences and to funders.\nThe novel gene discovery linked in with our findings on BB/E016995/1 and have formed the basis of a several grant applications for further funding, together with a PhD project at the Open University (currently being written up).
