How will technologies change the way children interact and learn? Can we create new forms of digital materials for learning? This grant will address such questions by examining how young children (aged 5-8 years) use materials, both digital and non-digital, to help them think and learn mathematics.</p>\n\n<p>To understand the role of interaction, we will compare the way children explain number concepts (such as why 2+7=3+6) using materials such as wooden cubes, paper, or squares manipulated on an iPad, or gesture-recognition device (eg Wii). Using video, we will examine the relationship over time of what children say, how they move materials, where they look, and how they gesture.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This project will address long-standing theoretical questions about the relationship between the way we act and the way we think, and the role gesture plays. It will also produce much-needed research for teachers and policy makers about the importance of providing young children with hands-on learning experiences, and the impact of devices such as iPads. The research will also inform designers of how we can create novel learning materials using emerging forms of technology.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001531/1","grantId":"ES/K001531/1","fundValue":"163236","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew David Manches","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
