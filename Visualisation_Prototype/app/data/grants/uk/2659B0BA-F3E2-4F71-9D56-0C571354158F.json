Microglia are brain cells that regulate inflammation, and when infammed these cells can phagocytose (i.e. eat) neurons and synapses. We and others have found that microglia can eat live neurons and synapses via two types of receptor on their surface: P2Y6 and VNR, and if we block these receptors then we can prevent neuronal and synaptic loss in models of brain pathology. \n\nThese are novel and surprising findings, and in this project we want:\n1. To determine whether blocking (by drugs or genetics) the phagocytic receptors P2Y6 or VNR is beneficial in a variety of brain disease models.\n2. To find novel ways of blocking P2Y6 or VNR that may used as therapy for brain pathology.\n3. To determine whether blocking P2Y6 or VNR is beneficial by blocking phagocytosis (eating) of neurons and synapses.\n4. To generate genetic knockout mice for P2Y6 and VNR and test whether they are protected against a variety of brain pathologies.\n\nIf so, this work may lead on to the development of novel treatments for stoke, trauma, epilepsy, AIDS dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L010593/1","grantId":"MR/L010593/1","fundValue":"414497","fundStart":"2014-06-30","fundEnd":"2017-06-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Guy Charles Brown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
