However, for transplantation therapy to achieve greater success and on a wider scale, advance is needed in several directions. These include finding supplementary sources of donor tissues and cells that lend themselves for therapy of a larger number of conditions, such as kidney and liver failure, arthritis, diabetes and tooth loss; and a way of ensuring acceptance of the replacement tissue without the need for lifelong drugs that block the immune system. To accelerate progress, experts in basic biology and transplant medicine at King s College London plan to come together in a joint venture with the Medical Research Council, to form the UK s first MRC Centre for Translation of Research in Transplantation. The Centre s mission is to put research in transplantation on a new trajectory to deliver more rapid and effective modes of diagnosis and treatment. The programme of research will apply extensive knowledge of human immunology, stem cell biology, genomics and imaging to develop new areas that will benefit human health. In collaboration with the King s College Centre of Medical Law and Ethics, the MRC Centre will also play a pivotal role in training and education.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600698","grantId":"G0600698","fundValue":"2095280","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven H Sacks","coPersons":["Ellen  Solomon","Robert  Lechler","Frank  Nestle","Paul  Sharpe","Adrian  Hayday","Anthony  Dorling","Reza Sarvghad  Razavi","Cosimo  De Bari"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
