We propose that one potential factor specific to the progress of CwPLI in speech and language therapy is the childâ€™s recognition of, and ability to verbally reflect upon, features of pragmatics (rules about how language is used). This is called metapragmatic ability (MPA). In this study we aim to develop an MPA assessment procedure for use with school-age children; to profile MPA of a group of CwPLI and compare these to a groups of children with typical language development (CwTLD) and specific language impairment (CwSLI); to study the role of MPA as a factor which assists progress for CwPLI.</p> \n<p>MPA will be assessed on an innovative task in which the child is asked to identify pragmatic errors depicted in filmed social scenarios. Data on the MPA task will be gathered from 80 CwTLD, 30 CwPLI and 30 CwSLI aged between 6 and 11 years. The 30 CwPLI will also receive an intensive social communication intervention. Changes in language/social functioning will be compared to initial MPA and changes in MPA ability after therapy. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2223","grantId":"RES-000-22-2223","fundValue":"78061","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine  Adams","coPersons":["Elaine Mary Clarke"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
