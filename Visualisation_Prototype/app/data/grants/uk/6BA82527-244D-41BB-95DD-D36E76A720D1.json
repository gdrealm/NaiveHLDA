{"id":"6BA82527-244D-41BB-95DD-D36E76A720D1","title":"Private education, risk and the protected social worlds of upper-middle class girls","abstractText":"<p>In recent years young women have been represented in two seemingly contradictory ways: as celebratory success stories or as grave causes for concern. What these popular presentations often hide is the way in which class, ethnicity and sexuality cut across these configurations of young femininity and the fact that it is often not middle-class girls who are characterised as 'risk-takers' but rather as 'can do girls' with 'the world at their feet'. This would seem to particularly be the case for those girls who have had a private education as they appear to inhabit a distinct social world; as a protected and cloistered elite. And yet there is a growing body of research that suggests that there are a number of risks that middle-class girls have to contend with. </p>\n\n<p>This research seeks to add to this body of work and to redress the gaps in the work on private education, by exploring some of the risks faced by a unique cohort of girls in one private, single-sex institution. The study will examine the girls' and their parents' conceptions of the risks that they face as they contemplate making the move beyond the 'protected' space of the private secondary school. </p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G005869/1","grantId":"ES/G005869/1","fundValue":"76168","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexandra  Allan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
