{"id":"67D72D42-3A22-475A-AF0B-AAA9C533A98E","title":"Measuring the Power Spectrum of Primordial Gravitational Waves","abstractText":"Detecting the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) through its imprint on the polarisation on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) will be one of the major experimental challenges over the next decade. Extracting a signal of less than one part in one million of the 3K mean CMB temperature, and separating that signal from instrumental and astrophysical foregrounds that will themselves be orders of magnitude larger requires not only exquisitely sensitive detectors but also meticulous attention to detail in the data analysis. The development of robust tools for this analysis will require assembling current experimental and theoretical information on astrophysical foregrounds, further development of existing computer codes for CMB power spectrum analaysis, and testing those codes on simulations. Only this level of effort will allow the application of these tools to real data expected by the end of the decade.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E002129/1","grantId":"PP/E002129/1","fundValue":"306863","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Carlo Riccardo Contaldi","coPersons":["Andrew Howard Jaffe"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" How foregrounds affect CMB B-mode searches Used by cosmological experiments Education","dataset":"gtr"}
