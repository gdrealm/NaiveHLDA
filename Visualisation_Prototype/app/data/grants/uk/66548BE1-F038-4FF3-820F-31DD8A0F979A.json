{"id":"66548BE1-F038-4FF3-820F-31DD8A0F979A","title":"Micron Resolution Full-Field Shape Metrology for High Value Engineering Applications","abstractText":"This project seeks to establish the technology required for a unique shape measurement approach to fulfil a commercial need that is beyond current capabilities by a factor of &gt;5. The technology is based on an optimisation approach for interferometric sensors whereby the measurement range and reliability are maximised. Initial exploitation is expected through the gas turbine industry where the commercial drivers are to reduce fuel consumption of their engines and thereby achieve an advantage over their competitors. Such a development also provides a means to conserve the world's natural resources improving long term sustainability. Information from our collaborators, Rolls-Royce shows that the ability to control and optimise the geometry of turbine blades to micron levels (1 micron = 0.001 mm) will generate specific fuel consumption savings of 0.3 to 1.0 % - equivalent to 1000 litres of kerosene on a typical London to New York flight. Beyond turbine blade manufacturers there is potentially a far larger market in blade maintenance companies and in other applications, for example, automated de-burring of high value components (also relevant to Rolls-Royce).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F008864/1","grantId":"EP/F008864/1","fundValue":"76967","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Peter Towers","coPersons":["Catherine Elizabeth  Towers"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
