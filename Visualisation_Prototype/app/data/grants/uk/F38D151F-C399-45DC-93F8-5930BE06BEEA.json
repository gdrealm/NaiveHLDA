This award will cover our travel and subsistence costs to both STFC and non-STFC observing facilities. The major topics of observational astrophysics research to be covered by the PATT Linked Grant include: \n\n\n- investigations of supernovae and the end stages of stellar evolution; \n\n- high temporal, spatial and spectral resolution observations of the solar atmosphere and those of other cool stars; \n\n- studies of solar system bodies, including comets and asteroids; \n\n- astrochemistry, including that of interstellar and circumstellar clouds; \n\n- detection and characterisation of exoplanets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M001970/1","grantId":"ST/M001970/1","fundValue":"31377","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Francis Paul Keenan","coPersons":["Mihalis  Mathioudakis","Markus  Janson","Tom  Millar","Justyn  Maund","David Brian Jess","Stephen  Smartt","Alan  Fitzsimmons","Christopher  Watson","Stuart Alan Sim","Rubina  Kotak"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
