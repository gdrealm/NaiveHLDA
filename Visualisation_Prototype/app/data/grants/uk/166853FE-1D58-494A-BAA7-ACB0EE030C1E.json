{"id":"166853FE-1D58-494A-BAA7-ACB0EE030C1E","title":"Quantitative, multimodal neuroimaging to investigate the mechanisms of brain plasticity","abstractText":"The adult brain is able to reorganise its connections. For example, after a stroke, new brain areas take on the roles of those that have been damaged. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can measure these changes in brain organisation. \nThe aim of this work is to understand the mechanisms behind these brain changes. We aim to answer questions such as: How are new brain cells recruited? How are the connections between cells strengthened? \nRather than studying people who have had a stroke we will look at normal healthy people and induce changes in brain organisation in a controlled way. We will place a vibrating device on the fingertips that, after only a few hours, causes expansion of the region in the brain that senses touch. We think that the connections between two brain regions may strengthen if they are activated with synchronous vibrations. \nWe will use fMRI to measure the expansion of brain regions and MEG to measure the timing and co-operation between brain cells. Used together they give a clear picture of how the brain is changing. We will develop new methods to measure the strength of connections between two regions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501110","grantId":"G0501110","fundValue":"240197","fundStart":"2006-08-17","fundEnd":"2008-10-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Laura  Parkes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
