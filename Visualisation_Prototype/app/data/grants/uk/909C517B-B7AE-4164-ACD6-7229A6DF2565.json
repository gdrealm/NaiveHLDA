The provision of a series of forums over two years where established and new researchers can discuss the consumption, production, collection and display of dress, textiles and beauty regimes is an unprecedented method of developing this area of study. It would be a major contribution to the advancement of studies on the African diaspora and would provide a broader knowledge base for a wide variety of international academics, practitioners and students.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119578/1","grantId":"119578/1","fundValue":"19974","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Carol  Tulloch","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
