Growing older involves dramatic changes to all aspects of our lives, but one of the most important concerns is our mental or 'cognitive' health. This research focuses on the cognitive abilities that enable us to function in the world, including memory, attention, emotion, language, action. We aim to understand how individuals can best retain these abilities into old age. Addressing this issue requires us to understand how brain structure and function support cognitive performance. Recent developments in neuroimaging technology show that as we age there is widespread loss of brain tissue in regions important for everyday cognition. Much research has focused on this tissue loss, and its role in cognitive decline in later life. However, other findings paint a more positive picture. While some cognitive abilities decline with normal ageing, many are spared. Moreover, cognitive decline doesn't occur abruptly at a pensionable age: cognitive abilities follow different trajectories across the lifespan, some remaining stable into our 80s, and some beginning to decline even in our 30s. Underpinning this complex pattern of spared and impaired cognition are complex interactions between neural structure and activity. A growing number of studies show that the brain responds flexibly to tissue loss, recruiting other brain regions to support neural function. This functional plasticity is possible because cognitive abilities, like memory or attention, are not underpinned by single brain regions, but by networks of regions. Successful ageing is therefore characterised by successful functional plasticity. Although ageing is often stereotyped as a time of mental restriction and inflexibility, cognitive neuroscience reveals that across the adult lifespan individuals make flexible use of available resources, including recruiting other regions and cognitive processes when necessary. Research Aims and Objectives Our aim is to identify what determines successful flexibility. This requires us to sample across the adult lifespan, measuring different aspects of neural structure and activity, and of cognitive performance. We will study a cohort of 700 participants aged 18 to 88, who will have a structural brain scan and perform key cognitive tests. Some members of this cohort will also participate in functional neuroimaging experiments to measure brain activity during cognitive tasks. We will ask (1) Is functional plasticity maintained across the lifespan and does it vary across cognitive abilities? (2) Are the distributed neural networks that support different cognitive abilities preserved in ageing? (3) Does the preservation of different cognitive functions vary, given the variability of neural change in different brain regions? Potential applications and benefits Our research will generate a unique resource of neuroimaging and cognitive measures about change across the adult lifespan, generating important benefits for academic researchers, the older community, and wider society. It will provide major contributions to ageing research, and provide a 'virtual brain and behaviour bank' acting as a continuing international resource for future research. Our focus on healthy ageing will be educationally important for all older adults. Few studies of ageing focus on healthy ageing, and the prevalent view of ageing is of deficit and ill-health. Our focus is on what characterizes older adults with preserved performance, a perspective with huge implications for how society views the ageing process. Moreover, our detailed analysis of neural and cognitive flexibility will help identify the conditions under which older adults may be aided by interventions. Finally, because our findings will help specify normal age-related deficits, they will show how normal ageing differs from pathological ageing in conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H008217/1","grantId":"BB/H008217/1","fundValue":"4195080","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Because the aims of the Cam-CAN project are about driving basic research into healthy cognitive ageing and changing attitudes and stereotyes of ageing, the impact of our findings is likely to be seen over the long term. So far we have given a number of public lectures in a variety of contexts. In these lectures we discuss our early findings in the context of resilience and preservation, a framework which the public enjoys and takes seriously. We are convinced that over time, our findings will have economic, societal, and public policy implications over and above the scientific impact of our research.\n\nOur findings provide a detailed characterization of the functions which remain flexible and therefore potentially amenable to learning, retraining and preservation. We anticipate that these findings will support evidence-based development of lifespan education programs, products, and policies relevant to social programmes to aid the preservation of cognitive functions across the lifspan and maintain employment in older people. More broadly, as our research focuses on how people can function successfully across the life span, our findings have the potential to overturn negative stereotypes of ageing and improve well being in later life.

In contrast, our focus is on maturational changes across the lifespan and the dynamic and interactive nature of lifelong neural and cognitive changes that underpin the preservation of cognition throughout life. Our starting assumption is that good cognitive health is underpinned by the brain's ability to respond flexibly across the lifespan. To test this assumption we have obtained a unique set of in-depth imaging, cognitive and demographic data on a population-derived set of 700 individuals. The recruitment of these participants and the collection of such a vast array of data has taken 4 years. Our initial analyses and preliminary findings focus on understanding the range of factors that affect neural flexibility and their interaction. Some of our scientific highlights to date are:\n\n1. Cognitive variability\nAlthough ageing is widely believed to result in inevitable and across-the-board cognitive decline, in the Cam-CAN data we find a nuanced set of relationships, some of which change across age groups, reflecting the range of cognitive domains covered by our tasks and the specificity of our measures, which have been previously refined by experts within each domain.\na. We find that ageing is associated with considerable variability across individuals in patterns of cognitive preservation and loss.\nb. The finding that some cognitive functions are preserved in some older individuals raises the key issue of why some people age successfully: a primary focus of our research. In younger adults, we find that good cognition is associated with good physical and brain health and high income, whereas in older people, brain health (particularly white matter) is the strongest predictor of cognitive preservation.\n\n2. Brain structural changes\na. Many studies have reported global age-related declines in Grey Matter (GM). In our cohort however, overall GM reduction across the age groups is weaker than typically reported. Our sample may provide a more accurate assessment of age-related GM changes because it is i) more uniform and population-representative, ii) minimizes cohort effects by sampling a wide range of abilities/education levels across the lifespan, and iii) excludes people with premorbid dementia.\nb. We find that the brain becomes less structurally connected with age, in that there is less dependence in the degree to which different neural regions lose their integrity.\nc. Results of our novel method for assessing patterns of in vivo myelin -- a tissue that is an important component of WM tracts, and which continues developing well into later adulthood - provided new evidence that myelin mediates age-related changes in cognitive function.\n\n3. Brain functional changes\na. The dynamic range of an individual's neural activity (as measured in fMRI and MEG) is emerging as a key indicator of cognitive health in our sample, with increased neural responsivity important for maintaining cognitive function, and reduced responsivity being associated with poorer physical health (e.g. poor vascular dynamics), especially for fluid cognitive abilities.\nb. Cognitive processes are enabled by interactions within and between neural networks. This functional connectivity is important for maintaining cognition throughout life. Decreases in GM at older ages alters the functional connectivity architecture of the brain, with lower connectivity within domain-specific functional networks but increased connectivity between networks. In addition, we find that ageing seems to be associated with reduced flexibility of &quot;reorganizing&quot; functional networks in the face of changing cognitive demands (different tasks).\n\n4. Differentiating age-related vascular and neural changes\nUnique to our cohort, we obtain MEG as well as fMRI data. MEG is a more direct measure of neural activity than fMRI, and is essential for separating neural and vascular effects that are confounded in the fMRI signal. We find that vascular reactivity is lower in the older age groups, and this is independent of any age-related changes in neural reactivity. This provides us with methods for uncoupling neural and vascular effects in neurocognitive studies.\n\n5. Lifestyle factors\na. Preliminary results reinforce the beneficial effects of exercise: people who engage in vigorous recreational exercises like jogging, swimming or regular physical activity (e.g. via active transport for their journey to/from work) have increased heart rate variability and reduced resting heart rate, both markers of good physical health. Exercise also shows both direct cognitive benefits to long-term memory, as well as indirect benefits to simple reaction time tests, through the mediating benefits to the brain's white matter. The association of exercise with good neurocognitive health suggests a role in delaying the onset of age-related and dementia-related cognitive decline. Although the case for the benefits of exercise is not yet fully proven, it is of such public health importance that it will be a major theme if we are able to secure funding to re-test the same participants for another 5 years.\nb. One theme that emerges from our research is that retirement is associated with both physical and cognitive change: (i) Amongst the over 55-year olds in our sample, those who are still working look more similar to younger adults in the dynamics of their brain activity than those who have retired; (ii) working people outperform retired people on several cognitive measures; (iii) preliminary results suggest that even when accounting for chronological age, relationships between age and cognitive decline become increasingly negative the longer that people spend retired from work. Some of these negative relationships appear to be mitigated by post-retirement exercise, suggesting that an active lifestyle is important for maintaining cognitive health.\nc. These relationships are based on cross sectional associations and comparison across age groups, and factors other than age itself may be important. We aim to secure further funding for another 5 years to obtain longitudinal data to test and strengthen our ability to understand true longitudinal change associated with age. The Cam-CAN project is continuing to develop a number of resources that have been made available to others in our recent protocol paper (Shafto et al, BMC Neurology, 2014). This describes our recruitment methods, research framework, and research design (cohort characteristics). Specific statistical and methodological developments, and the 700 datasets are being developed for open use and in collaborations.\nOur framework - aimed at identifying preservation and flexibility across the adult lifespan- contributes a new approach that can be used by future researchers, and provides examples that are an alternative to studies which consider ageing as analogous to disease processes. In addition to published examples of our findings, a detailed description of our protocol is now published online (Shafto et al, 2014) which provides a detailed description of how we measure a range of cognitive, neural, and epidemiological factors that contribute to successful cognitive ageing.\nBecause our approach requires measuring complex cognitive and neural measures on a large scale, and the nature of their interactions, we have developed and continue to develop statistical and data processing tools which are likely to be very useful to others. For example: (1) new tools for large-scale processing of multimodal data which is often done by hand, including identifying artefacts in MEG data, processing outliers in behavioural data, and automating onset identification in fMRI data; (2) comparing across imaging modalities not only for simple event processing or resting state network characteristics, but for complex cognitive tasks including language comprehension; (3) developing approaches for comparing across and combining measures from a very wide range of diverse cognitive domains which is rare in studies of cognitive ageing.\nFinally, the Cam-CAN data will eventually be made publically available. A stated aim of the project is the establishment of a &quot;Virtual Brain and Behaviour Bank&quot; which will act as a continuing international resource for future research and an important basis for longitudinal studies.
