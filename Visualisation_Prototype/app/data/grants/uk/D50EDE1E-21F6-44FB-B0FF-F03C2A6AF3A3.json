{"id":"D50EDE1E-21F6-44FB-B0FF-F03C2A6AF3A3","title":"Service Design Research UK","abstractText":"Service Design Research UK (SDR UK) aims to create a UK research network in an emerging field in Design that is Service Design. This field has a recent history and a growing, but still small and dispersed, research community that strongly needs support and visibility to consolidate its knowledge background and enhance its potential impact. Services represent a significant part of the UK economy and can have a transformational role in our society, if we think of how they affect the way we organize, move, work, study or take care of our health and family. Design introduces a more people-centred and creative approach to service innovation, which is critical to delivering more effective and novel solutions that have the potential to tackle contemporary challenges.\nThe UK is a leader in the development of Service Design, mainly driven by design practitioners (Engine, Livework, Thinkpublic, Participle, Snook, etc.) and organizations such as the Design Council, Design Wales, Demos, Young Foundation, NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement. In this scenario the academic contribution to the development of Service Design as a subject of research and practice has been instead weak and dispersed. \nThis network aims to: \n1. Identify, compare and map current research work into Service Design in UK;\n2. Increase understanding of and demand for Service Design as a practice and research field in UK;\n3. Identify research and knowledge gaps in the field to inform PhD studies and future research projects collaborations and ideas;\n4. Increase visibility and connectivity of SDR UK nationally and internationally.\nThe research network will create the opportunities, for the SDR UK's emerging research community, to converge around three main themes: 1) Service Design for Innovation; 2) Service Design for Social Good; 3) Service Design for Sustainability. Three thematic workshops will bring together academics, designers, public and private sector organizations and relevant institutions to collect and map the research work done till now, discuss project exemplars, share experiences and identify research gaps and future research themes. The workshops outcomes will be made available on a dedicated on-line platform, where the emerged research questions will be used to inform an on-line forum. SDR website will be linked with existing national and international initiatives and on-line communities related to the topics of service research and innovation. The international Service Design and Innovation (ServdDes) conference to be held at Lancaster University in April 2014, will host a final public event to present SDR UK results and to organize discussion tables around the emerged research themes to springboard possible future research collaborations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K003607/1","grantId":"AH/K003607/1","fundValue":"28616","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniela  Sangiorgi","coPersons":["Alison  Prendiville"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":" This network has allowed to map an emerging field of research in UK which is still very dispersed and fragmented. The main result has been to make this area visible and start creating connections and activate collaborations. It was evident where research did concentrate which is on public sector, and in particular in healthcare, and with a specific focus on applied research to develop novel service models as well as test service design methods. Limited research was apparent instead in the evaluation of design impact, and in understanding how service design practice did change depending on the sector and context it was applied. There has been some development which came straight from the network:\n- AHRC funding for a 6 months study of Design for Service Innovation and Development;\n- Linkoping University (Sweden) to conduct a similar mapping activity informed by SDR UK;\n- a work in progress publication with Lia Patricio (University of Porto, Portugal) and Alison Prendiville (University of the Arts) that compares SDR UK data and insights with the global Service Research survey on future research;\n- an event at the Service Design and Innovation conference (ServDes2014) that used the developed maps to add information from other ongoing international research projects and compare research directions and applications;\n\nNot directly related but informed by SDR UK, is the EU project the PI is currently involved which is aiming to create a platform called Design for Europe, which is a knowledge repository to bring develop Design use across Europe in the public, private sectors and policy.
