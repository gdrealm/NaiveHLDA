{"id":"3FF4D51D-4BB0-4A18-9010-F91962FECF6A","title":"Revitalising Critical Dialogues on Community Theatre: a seminar series and national festival of community theatre.","abstractText":"The project is aimed at creating significant and innovative engagement and impact activities with new national audiences, following on from the activities and outputs of the AHRC-funded Fellowship &quot;Enacting Community&quot;. The project is a collaboration between the Fellowship PI, Kerrie Schaefer, and acta Community Theatre company, a key partner whose work was documented and analysed within the Fellowship research project, and whose professionally- and publically- oriented events provided pathways for impact. acta has secured part funding (from Arts Council England) for a National Festival of Community Theatre to be held in Bristol in June 2016. acta and Schaefer aim to collaborate on producing this event and a series of (three) critical dialogues leading into it. In particular, the critical dialogue series aims to build on acta's Foundation Worker scheme targeting emerging practitioners who might be graduating/recently graduated from University although lacking practical industry/work experience. The National Festival of Community Theatre will feature performances, workshops and critical dialogues covering research themes deemed most relevant to practice concerns by acta and Schaefer. There will be a high profile opening event to the Festival with over 100 people expected to attend including community theatre practitioners and companies from Europe and the UK, students and academics, and public and private commissioners of work. The seminars and Festival will be digitally documented and a documentary film will be made available on the acta website project page. \n\nThese activities, building on established cross-sector networks and relationships, will benefit a great number of user groups, and, together with documentation of the project, will ensure longevity of the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N001230/1","grantId":"AH/N001230/1","fundValue":"23976","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kerrie Vanessa Schaefer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
