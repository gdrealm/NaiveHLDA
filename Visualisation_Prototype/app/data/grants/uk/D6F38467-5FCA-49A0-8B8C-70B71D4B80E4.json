They contract individual farmers who select options which suit that farm and the farmer.&nbsp; This study will examine the benefits and problems from developing AES with options that allow neighbouring land mangers to work at the landscape scale by agreeing between themselves what options to use and where to locate them.</p>\n\n<p>The study will use extant ecological studies to compare the types of environmental benefit that might be expected from the farm-by-farm approach with the benefits that may accrue when the participation decision and choice of options is decided by neighbouring land managers following consultation and collaboration with one another.&nbsp; Boundary theory will help investigate any additional difficulties organising and arranging such collaboration would cause for land managers, environmental agencies and nature advisory organisations; organisations who work on the boundary between land managers, conservationists, environmental policy-makers and uses of the countryside.</p>\n\n<p>This study will show how fit for practice the current Environmental Stewardship Scheme and advisory organisations are to cope with the next tranche of environmental issues caused by global warming induced climate change.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H037241/1","grantId":"ES/H037241/1","fundValue":"141445","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  Franks","coPersons":["Mark Jonathan Whittingham"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
