{"id":"0FF6A39E-EC92-4642-A1C7-26C8B4984B19","title":"Civility in 21st Century Britain","abstractText":"<p>There is a generalised preoccupation about standards of civility in the UK. Crime rates have declined, casualised violence has fallen and overt discrimination has become unacceptable. But levels of anxiety regarding declining levels of common decency and standards of behavior continue to rise. Part of the problem lies in the fact that discussions about civility tend to be shaped by anecdote and perception, much of it fuelled by the populist media. </p>\n\n<p>Our aim with this project is to move beyond these assumptions by grounding the discussion in a firmer evidence base. In the first phase we will apply the theoretical framework developed by the Young Foundation in its report 'Civility Lost and Found' to three case studies. Firstly, we will be studying an urban area to analyse whether flux, churn and diversity are correlated with declining levels of civility. Secondly, we will look at a rural area of stability with the aim of testing assumptions regarding the desirability of greater stability and homogeneity. Finally, we will apply our analysis to a new community to determine whether civility can be fostered. This phase of the project will be based on ethnographic observation and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with local residents. In the second phase we will draw on a local advisory group to interpret the evidence and generate a set of recommendations regarding possible policy interventions which can help foster a more mindful and civil society.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-193-25-0001","grantId":"RES-193-25-0001","fundValue":"88167","fundStart":"2010-05-10","fundEnd":"2011-05-09","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alessandra  BuonfinoPhoebe  Griffith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Young Foundation","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
