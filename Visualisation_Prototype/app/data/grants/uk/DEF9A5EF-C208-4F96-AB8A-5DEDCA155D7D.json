{"id":"DEF9A5EF-C208-4F96-AB8A-5DEDCA155D7D","title":"Local school Hubs for supporting STEM education through astronomy","abstractText":"If astronomy is to fulfil its large potential as a motivational forum for STEM teaching, large numbers of sufficiently skilled teachers will be needed. However, there are a limited number of astronomy education professionals available to train the teachers, and time for teachers to be trained is very limited. This project seeks to use highly skilled astronomy educators, Space Ambassadors and others to work with key teachers in key schools and colleges who will then act as a 'hub' for disseminating that training to local schools/colleges. Such a network of Hubs will not only provide a ready means of widespread teacher training and support, but also focus points for development and dissemination of new initiatives and resources.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J000221/1","grantId":"ST/J000221/1","fundValue":"15000","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Michael Newsam","coPersons":["Sarah Georgina  Roberts","Paul  Roche","Christopher  Leigh"],"organisation":"Liverpool John Moores University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
