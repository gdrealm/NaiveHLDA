This knowledge exchange project was a collaboration between Manchester Metropolitan University and NHS Manchester, working closely with Co-operatives UK and Community Catalysts Limited (a social enterprise representing micro care providers).&nbsp; It supported seminars, placements and impact generation for third sector organisations that wished to learn more about working with the NHS and local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The main impact generating activity was further development of Balance - an online toolkit that uses self-assessment to analyse management practices in social enterprises. The original plan was to add a new section on readiness for public sector contracts. In consultation with social enterprises and support organisations the new section was refocused to cover income diversification more widely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Project placements enhanced exchange of knowledge between social science researchers and Third Sector frontline and infrastructure organisations.

Under this grant a new section on the diversification of income sources was added to Balance in April 2010. Since then, 540 social enterprises have registered to use the tool and 380 assessments have been completed. Social Enterprise North West offers Balance as part of the support they provide and have to date purchased 240 licences (2012 - 2013). \n \nDemonstrating value is particularly challenging for very small service providers lacking the skill or time to utilise existing 'prove and improve' tools . The placement with co-operatives UK showed that small scale co-operatives enable service recipients to retain control over their care (as promised in consumer versions of personalisation) while sharing organisational tasks and responsibilities in ways consistent with notions of co-production, citizenship and community.\n\nInteractions between researchers, public services and social enterprises in this project showed that sharable representations - drawings, models, diagrams - can act as 'boundary objects', supporting interaction and communication across sectors. This has potential to inform further cross sectoral research and knowledge exchange. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
