Embracing and developing the factory on the machine concept will be a critical step in enabling a sustainable manufacturing sector for the next generation of engineered products dependent on precision and micro/nano scale geometrical accuracy and functionally optimised surfaces.Key challenges to achieving the concept of the factory on the machine are: Challenge I: Elevation of machine tool accuracies beyond the present formidable barriers to those currently only achievable by advanced metrology equipment in stable operating environments, through embodiment of our leading research in machine error modelling and reduction. Challenge II: Building sound foundations for the factory on the machine by developing new metrology instrumentation, used within the machine environment and a novel toolkit, for geometrical characterisation (size, geometry and texture) for the next generation of engineering products.In order to answer the challenges and vision of the CIM, the overall research programme is divided into key research themes and platform type activities. The two major thematic areas of research within the CIM are:Theme I - factory on the machine : to create a configurable and scalable platform for implementing advanced manufacturing and measurement technologies on machines ranging from nano, micro to large volume capability. Analogous with the lab on a chip concept, the delivered system will fuse production capability with high-precision metrology to provide an automatic quality control feedback loop for both product quality and machining process sustainability. Theme II - underlying techniques for factory on the machine : The aim here is to create new measurement and specification methodologies and products (smart software and hardware systems) and to deliver an underpinning new technology in measurement science for micro/nano scale surfaces on macro/meso dimensioned objects with Euclidean or non-Euclidean (non-rotational and non-translational symmetry) geometry and deterministic texture all to be applied within the factory on the machine environment. Platform activities will encompass: (i) Retention and recruitment of key identified research and technique staff; (ii) Generation of new knowledge and instrumentation derived from fundamental EPSRC, EU and TSB funded research projects (iii) Support blue sky research and feasibility studies in machine tool/surface technology and (iv) Knowledge exchange to key partners through specific projects, collaboration agreements, licensing, workshops, training, national networks, sand pits and open days. Platform activities will be targeted towards key partners firstly, their supply chains/end users, then secondly wider sectors of UK industry, as well as national and international standardisation bodies. Overall, this CIM research will link measurement and production in a unique way to minimise cost whilst at the same time enabling the manufacturing base to meet the challenge of ever increasing complexity and quality in manufacture. It will provide coherent research solutions to the manufacturing sector to ensure that advanced UK manufacture is at the forefront of emerging technologies. Partnership with UK industry will provide a research focal point, a national network to disseminate the outcomes and a link with other networks, CIMs and IKCs to ensure that the research provides the required outputs to drive industry forward. This would boost the capabilities of the project proposers to an unrivalled and unique position within the field of machine tool accuracy and surface metrology, allowing the research team to command a global leading role in the foreseeable future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I033424/1","grantId":"EP/I033424/1","fundValue":"4834360","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The WSI sensor has applications in many product types; the first main application currently being investigated is the manufacture of roll-to-roll vapour barrier coatings for flexible PV (photovoltaic) cells, where the WSI is able to detect defects (under half a second for full-field measurement) in the coating (for subsequent repair) that can have a critical impact on product longevity. Minimising these types of defects will ultimately reduce the cost (and increase the reliability) of the flexible PV cells thus improving and widening uptake of this type of renewable energy.\n\nMore generally, the concept of embedded measurement, as exemplified by the WSI sensor, will dramatically improve yields through improved process control and will lead to lower cost and thus increasing uptake of technologies by consumers in areas such as flexible/printable electronics, roll-to-roll manufacture of structured films (for flat panel displays, solar concentrators etc.), as well as more traditional areas of manufacture such as: aerospace, automotive, semiconductor, and bio-engineering applications as well as paper applications such as food packaging, banknotes, etc. It will significantly reduce manufacturing costs and help industry move towards zero waste and a carbon neutral production.
