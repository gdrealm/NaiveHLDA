{"id":"7EC0DBA0-0FC2-44F1-8708-8676EBEDA4C9","title":"The PACE trial; A RCT of CBT, graded exercise, adaptive pacing and usual medical care for the chronic fatigue syndrome","abstractText":"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS, also known as ME) affects 1 in 50 people. The main symptom is severe disabling fatigue made worse by activity. Its cause is unknown and we do not know how best to treat it \nTreatments that may help include: specialist medical care alone (SMC) and SMC supplemented with one of the following special therapies: adaptive pacing therapy (APT); cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT); graded exercise therapy (GET). \nSMC comprises medical follow up visits, self-help advice and drug treatment of symptoms \nAPT involves learning to balance activity and rest.\nCBT helps patients to understand and cope better with the illness. \nGET involves gradually increasing physical activity. \nThe trial will compare these treatments in 600 patients with CFS/ME, who will be followed up for a year. The aim is to see which treatments are best in reducing fatigue and enabling patients to do more. We will also look to see whether they have harmful effects and find out how they work. \nThe results of the trial will allow patients, doctors and health service planners to choose the best, safest and most cost â€“effective treatment for CFS/ME.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200434","grantId":"G0200434","fundValue":"2779280","fundStart":"2004-06-14","fundEnd":"2011-05-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Denton White","coPersons":["Trudie  Chalder","Michael  Sharpe"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
