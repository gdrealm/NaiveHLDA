Because the total DNA code of humans (the human genome) has been determined, scientists can now search for the small differences in this code between people who become ill and those who stay well. To perform experiments that identify and confirm these differences requires looking at the code of many thousands of people with the disease. However, it is time consuming and expensive to collect DNA samples from and medical records of such people. The UK DNA Banking Network (UDBN) was set up to hold a large number of DNA collections for different common diseases (e.g. diabetes, cancer, heart disease). UDBN gives out samples and anonymised health data to scientists who want to perform these experiments. UDBN?s service helps save money and it accelerates the pace of research. This application outlines how UDBN intends to continue providing its service over the next three years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901461","grantId":"G0901461","fundValue":"1148730","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"William  Ollier","coPersons":["K P  Dixon","Martin Alexander Yuille"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
