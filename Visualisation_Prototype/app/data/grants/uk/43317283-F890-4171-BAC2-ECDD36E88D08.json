The study catchments will be the UK Demonstration Test Catchments (DTCs) and the aims will be achieved through: (1) using existing climate model scenarios to set baseline outcomes for change; (2) localized DTC-focused stakeholder elicitation workshops to develop scenarios for land use changes in response to the climate scenarios; (3) simulating current hydrological events and future changes in catchment hydrology in response to changing climate/land use; (4) new understanding of phosphorus (P) behaviour in extreme hydrological conditions, using experiments and newly available high resolution observations from the DTCs to inform model development; (5) improved prediction (with uncertainty) of future P behaviour scenarios arising from the new understanding of hydrology-P interactions; (6) attempting to scale up the information from headwater-catchment to full basin scale, and; (7) compare model performance with existing P models and assess uncertainties involved in this process, with further iterations of stakeholder consultation. We shall focus on the 10 km2 scale because this matches the size of the nine study catchments of the Defra DTCs (from the Eden, Wensum and Avon DTCs), which are our chosen study areas; this scale also represents the ideal size for studying processes along the mobilisation-delivery-in-stream impact 'transfer continuum'. These integrated studies will produce a prototype quantitative assessment and prediction of nutrient fluxes. \n\nOur hypothesis is that increased seasonal variability in storm patterns (more extreme events, long drought periods), combined with interactions with land use change, will greatly alter future dissolved and particulate P fluxes across the land-water continuum and subsequent retention in-stream and downstream eutrophication risk. We shall extend our initial 'Systems Evidence Based Assessment Methodology (SEBAM)' study that focused on mobilization of P at the farm scale (recently published by the team), into a prototype modeling framework that includes source, mobilization, delivery and in-stream processing functions for predicting P fluxes from UK headwater catchments, and considers land use change, and use this framework (combined with knowledge from other projects involving the team) to scale up our information to define the potential for predicting other nutrient behaviours at the full basin scale. \n\nWe will capitalize on the new and unique high quality, high temporal resolution P monitoring data that is starting to emerge from the nine Defra DTC sub-catchments. A unique and exciting aspect of the work will be the use of expert elicitation procedures that incorporate fuzzy uncertainty-based analyses to develop tailored land use scenarios (building on the UK Land Use Foresight Initiative) for each of the unique landscape typologies for the 9 DTC focus catchments. Combining this information with the latest climate scenarios for the UK, we will include new developments in high-resolution numerical weather prediction. We shall then use these scenarios to study the impacts of climate and land use change to 2050 on hydrology, P mobilization, delivery and in-stream processing, informed from new empirical learning and experimentation. Model outputs will then be validated for other catchments in the wider UK (Conwy, Ribble, Tarland) using data from linked projects and our partners. Throughout the project, the outcomes will be tested with stakeholders. This will deliver a locally owned knowledge-based framework for understanding and managing future nutrient transfers from rural catchment systems, and some exciting new science on P transfers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K002392/1","grantId":"NE/K002392/1","fundValue":"805235","fundStart":"2013-08-12","fundEnd":"2016-08-11","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Part of the science approach in NUTCAT-2050 was presented at an Exeter Initiative on Science and Technology conference on food security, by P Falloon:\nhttp://www.exetersciencepark.co.uk/component/rseventspro/event/17-exist-conference-2014?Itemid=events\nThe talk raised business, academic and other users awareness of the relationship between soil, agriculture, climate, land use and water quality, and discussed how state of the art climate projections being used in the project might affect these issues.

In the Eden, rainfall is more important than temperature for getting on the land. Changes in farming and land management in the Eden have been due to both weather and non-weather related reasons, including economics, policy and legislation, technology and foot and mouth disease.\nTesting the downscaling ability of the Met office Unified Model to predict observed rainfall patterns has revealed that it may be better to run a high spatial resolution (1.5km) climate model for Northern England.\nAnalysis of the high resolution Eden DTC nutrient data has established that more than 75% of the Total Phosphorus load is transferred in 5% of the time, when discharge is high, which emphasises the importance of the large rainfall events. Preliminary analysis of EA flow and chemistry data for stations on the River Eden suggests significant downstream retention of phosphorus.\nA simple lattice Boltzmann methodology has been developed to study the transport of sediments and solutes by advection and diffusion in water.\nAnalysis of UKCP09 weather generator data for the 2050s suggests that the duration of dry periods will increase, with more, warmer dry periods of up to an extreme maximum of 90 days duration in S England. The information about drying periods will be used to plan soil tests on drying/rewetting.\nA method for uncertainty analysis has been extended under this project for use with water quality data and multi-model comparison. Water quality predictions for current conditions (comparison with observed data) will be made with models SWAT, HYPE and INCA-P, which are being set up with national datasets for soils, land use and weather. Future predictions of phosphorus transfer will allow farmers and land managers to explore options for land management, which seek to balance agricultural production and sustainable water management. Our findings may ultimately feed into agricultural policy. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism","dataset":"gtr"}
