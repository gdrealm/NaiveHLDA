This drug has the potential to become the standard of care for the treatment of muscle spasticity in MS with fewer and less severe side effects for patients than current drugs. In particular earlier treatment should be achievable, countering the onset of disability and allowing a normal life to be sustained for longer. This drug has now passed pre-clinical safety studies including two species 28 day toxicology.\nWe are now actively seeking additional funds to enable the clinical support studies, GMP manufacture, formulation, encapsulation, and phase 1 studies on this drug. The first phase 1 study will be a SAD/MAD safety study in volunteers. Part funding has already been secured from the Wellcome Trust, and UCL business. The first volunteer is expected to be dosed in Q3 2013.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_13037","grantId":"MC_PC_13037","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Selwood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
