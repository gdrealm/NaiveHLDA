{"id":"AC52FA37-BE57-4BA3-BF43-918AE5107AED","title":"From Melts to Functional Frameworks","abstractText":"Many useful compounds are made by reactions in solutions. However such conditions limit the type of compound that can be produced as the solvent strongly controls the nature of the compounds that are formed. The initial aim of this reserach will be to produce new compounds in liquid melts produced by heating, at temperatures similar tyo those in dosmetic ovens, some very simple inorganic compounds such as boric acid or oxalic acid. Compounds formed under such conditions often have so-called framework structures which have holes or pores embedded in them. Members of this structural family have a number of important applications such as absorbing and storing gases, ion exchange (as used in water softeners/filters and in waste treatment) and as components in rechargeable batteries. The overall aim of this work will thus be to produce and characterise radically new structures of this type - hopefully with much improved properties for these important applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F013752/1","grantId":"EP/F013752/1","fundValue":"317284","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Weller","coPersons":["John  Owen"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
