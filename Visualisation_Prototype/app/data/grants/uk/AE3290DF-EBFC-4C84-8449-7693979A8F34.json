The British Potato Council estimates the UK potato production, processing and retail markets to be worth c. &pound;3 billion p.a. and the potato cyst nematodes (PCN), Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida, are the most economically important nematode problems of this industry. They occur in 65% of UK potato land with G. pallida present at 92% of these sites. PCN impose an annual cost in excess of &pound;50 million on UK potato growers and threaten the future of the crop for many growers. Breeding for resistance since the mid 1950s has produced few commercially acceptable varieties with resistance to G. pallida. Currently used chemical control methods are under increasing pressure due to cost, environmental and health concerns and there are no benign alternatives to the currently used compounds. Control of G. pallida is an essential requirement to maintain the competitiveness of U.K. production. For example, the consumer demand for food with no pesticide residues has resulted in Waitrose sourcing all its potatoes from crops that have not received a nematicide treatment (www.waitrose.com). This requires imports from countries with a lower PCN incidence or requires a more extensive agricultural system in the UK. Consumer support is likely for UK produce that avoids pesticide residues or environmental harm and is soundly based on a sustainable approach. This proposal underpins the innovation needed to reach that outcome. Over the next 5 years, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute will undertake a major genome sequencing programme aimed at nematodes and other helminths that are human or veterinary-important parasites. WTSI is willing to sequence this plant parasitic nematode for comparative genomic studies. Gene identification will be carried out ab initio and by experimental analysis. The scienfic outputs of the proposed work will be of relevance to plant nematologists and to the wider scientific community. A G. pallida genome sequence will allow the UK plant nematology community to remain internationally competitive and will enable new collaborative links to be built with researchers working in other fields including plant development, molecular plant pathology and evolution of resistance. The proposal has broad support. The British Potato Council will independently support CASE awards for postgraduate students that will be aligned with the project. Other support is evident from the letters of support from both industry and the scientific community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F000642/1","grantId":"BB/F000642/1","fundValue":"424996","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Potato cyst nematode (PCN), a microscopic worm that attacks potato plants, costs the UK potato industry &pound;43 million/year. Control of PCN relies on chemicals that are often essential for economic cropping in the UK. EU legislation has already resulted in the recent loss of two nematicides in response to environmental concerns. There is severe doubt that future pesticides with appropriate environmental safety can reach the high control levels that are required. Having the genome sequence of PCN underpins new long-term strategies to design novel, benign methods of control. As the first genome sequence available for any cyst nematode, it also provides valuable information for understanding the important cyst nematode pests of other crops such as soybean, sugar beet and wheat.\nThe sequence data from this project is publicly available and has already been utilised by nematologists around the world. It has provided the foundation for further funding, leading to research grants and at least four PhD studentships at institutions in the UK. It has directly led to the formation of an international consortium of researchers from both academia and government bodies who are using the sequence data generated for Globodera rostochiensis to understand important aspects of its biology, determine differences between pathotypes that may be associated with virulence and undertake comparative genomics with other Globodera species.

Potato cyst nematodes are present on 65% of UK potato land, and controlling them costs UK growers in excess of ?50 million annually. Mainstream commercial potato varieties show no resistance to Globodera pallida, and increasing controls on the use of nematicides, and increasing concern on the part of consumers about pesticide residues, mean that these nematodes threaten the future of the potato crop for many growers. Novel control and pest management approaches are thus urgently needed for this nematode. \n\nThe principal output from this research is a high-quality draft genome sequence of the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida, which will prove a major resource in developing novel approaches to control this important plant pathogen. It will also be a valuable tool for researchers working with other parasitic nematode species for comparative genomic studies. Sequencing the genome of Globodera pallida proved challenging, as there was significant genetic diversity within the parasite population, confounding standard approaches to assembling the short sequencing 'reads' generated into a single sequence. Producing data from a range of different sequencing platforms allowed us to circumvent this problem and produce a draft sequence for the entire genome. \n\nGenome sequence data itself is of little use without some 'annotation', indicating the putative function of different elements of the sequence, and in particular, which parts of the sequence are predicted to be genes - transcribed as RNA and then (for the most part) translated to produce proteins. To aid this gene finding, we sequenced RNA from two samples for each of eight key stages of the Globodera pallida life cycle, allowing us to unambiguously identify genes. As an additional benefit, these data allow us to infer exactly when each gene is turned on and off, an important clue to the function of the genes. \n\nAdvances in sequencing technologies allowed additional sequence data to be generated over and above that originally planned in the project. We have generated sequence for a number of additional G. pallida populations. These include four UK populations that differ in their virulence. We have also generated sequence data from from the closely related species of potato cyst nematode, G. rostochiensis, which differs in its virulence against a key resistance gene found in some potato cultivars. \n\nWe have characterised the transcriptomic response of infective juveniles of G. pallida to seven chemical compounds, including nematicides. Expression analysis was carried out after appropriate exposures to chloroquine, dazomet, imidacloprid, thiabendazole, levamisole, fluoxetine and ivermectin, considerably broadening the applied impact of the research. Complete knowledge of the genes expressed by potato cyst nematode at the various stages of its lifecycle will provide many opportunites for the development of new management or control strategies for this important crop pest. \nAnalysis of the data has produced a catalogue of candidate genes involved in initiation of the parasitic interaction with the host potato plant. Such genes will be important targets for the disruption of this process that could lead to plant resistance. One route for achieving this would be to develop plants that produce molecules to specifically target and suppress these genes or others known to be essential to the viability of the nematode. \nThe data that we have generated characterising the transcriptomic response of infective juveniles of G. pallida to seven chemical compounds, including nematicides, considerably broadens the applied impact of the research. Analysis of the gene complement of the nematode may provide additional targets for the development of new, biosafe nematicides. All of the genomic data is available to the scientific community and its analysis will continue to provide insights into the biology of Globodera pallida and the molecular basis of its pathology for many years. The transcriptome sequence from eight stages around the Globodera pallida lifecycle and in response to seven chemicals, including nematicides, allows global comparative gene expression to be analysed. Together, this provides probably the most comprehensive transcriptomic dataset for a nematode other than Caenorhabditis elegans and is a major resource for further functional analysis of genes. \nThe comparative genome and transcriptome sequence produced for more than six populations of G. pallida plus the closely related species G. rostochiensis will provide insights into key determinants of nematode virulence.\nMolecular understanding of the interaction between potato cyst nematodes and their host will have important implications for our understanding of plant development, and of how plant development can be controlled. Disrupting this reprogramming process will also be an important target for control of the nematode. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
