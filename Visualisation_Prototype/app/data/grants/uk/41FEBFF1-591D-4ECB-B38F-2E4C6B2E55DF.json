The first time-laspe images of a running horse allowing us to understand its motion, the moment a bullet ripped through an apple - images, freezing a moment in time so that we can examine minute details. In cellular biology our understanding of cellular function continues to evolve as we observe complex dynamic processes played out under a microscope, captured by a camera at high speed and slowly revealing its hidden intricacy. As biologists ask every more complex questions, so we must develop more sophisticated tools to rationalise the complex data that we observe. Our current understanding of protein interaction in cells is informed, principally, through the use of microscopical tools to delineate localisation and compartmentalisation of signalling events within cellular organelles such as mitochondria. Further insight can be gained regarding protein association utilising the so called F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique. FRET acts as a molecular ruler, enabling us to measure the relative separation between proteins or protein-domains on the nanometer length scale. Our work has focused on the determination of protein-protein interactions by FRET and high-resolution fluorescent lifetime imaging (FLIM). Unfortunately, these advanced techniques are relatively slow in capturing cellular events so that our desire to observe real-time the processes involved in, for example cell migration (directed motion often under the action of chemical gradient) are stymied. With this project, we seek to significantly speed up the acquisition of protein-interaction data to allows us to observe cellular signalling as it happens. This can be achieved through multiplexing of our excitation and detection channels to such an extent that we envisage a 1000-fold improvement in imaging with no loss of spatialresolution in the image. This work represents the state-of-the-art in functional imaging with the opportunity to observe complex cellular events in unpreceded detail: capturing an image of a T-cell as it surveys a cancer cell, forming dynamic 3-dimensional contacts and observing the protein signalling events that drive these processes; observing the moment a cell responds to a chemical stimulus at the level of single-proteins. The technology we will develop will drammatically improve our understanding of dynamic events within cells offering insight into drug interactions in diverse applications throughout the lifesciences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I022937/1","grantId":"BB/I022937/1","fundValue":"266847","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We have created a two-photon microscope capable of scanning live cells using fluorescence lifetime imaging at rates 10-100x those of previous systems.

Previous technology was simply too slow to image at sufficient rates (few minutes) to allow researchers insight into disease mechanisms in living cells. The team at King's College are gaining a unique understanding of cancer through this technology. The system will continue to deliver high impact research outcomes and is being commercialised and applied more widely to drug and cancer screening. The microscope and camera technology are the subjects of separate spin-out activities in University of Edinburgh and King's College.
