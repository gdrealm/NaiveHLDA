The project will build an e-Infrastructure on the UK National Grid Service (NGS) to provide integrated access to a variety of resources for social science research, including datasets, tools, services and easy-to-use user environments. Specifically, it will:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>make available new, powerful, easy-to-use research tools and services which will reduce the effort needed to integrate and re-use datasets, and simplify the way that research is currently carried out;</li> \n <li>provide a testbed for the development of metadata and service registries, tools for user authorisation and authentication, and user portals and collaborative virtual user environments;</li> \n <li>lay foundations for an integrated strategy for the future development and support of e-infrastructure and services, and produce a road-map that identifies the human, technical and financial resources required to pursue the strategy;</li> \n <li>leverage infrastructure investment being made by UK e-Science core programme and JISC for the benefit of the Social Sciences;</li> \n <li>promote synergies across NCeSS and other ESRC investments, co-ordinate activities, encourage mutual support and identify areas in which to promote the benefits of common policies and technology standards.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-149-25-1063","grantId":"RES-149-25-1063","fundValue":"558340","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rob  Procter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
