{"id":"87754FD1-4826-4863-8903-16D6F6675CFE","title":"Cerebral recruitment during information processing in healthy individuals and in schizophrenia","abstractText":"Recent evidence suggests that the fragmentation of mental activity that characterizes schizophrenia arises from impaired coordination of brain activity. When healthy individuals process information, rhythmic oscillations in brain electrical activity occur. We have recently shown in several studies that these oscillations are abnormal in people with schizophrenia, potentially leading to inconsistent recruitment of the brain when information is being processed. Similar, but less marked abnormalities occur in siblings who are at risk of developing the illness, suggesting that these abnormalities reflect the core brain disorder that predisposes to schizophrenia. We will record brain electrical activity while using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to obtain images of brain activity associated with processing of information, in patients, siblings and healthy comparison subjects. We hope this will lead to the development of a test that improves the reliability of diagnosis of schizophrenia, facilitating more efficient treatment and better outcome.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601442","grantId":"G0601442","fundValue":"610655","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Francis Liddle","coPersons":["Penny Anne Gowland","Stewart Bertrand Park","Susan  Francis","Richard  Bowtell","Karl John Friston"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
