Through advanced proteomics and transcriptomics approaches we aim to identify protein substrates regulated by a specific branch of the N-end rule pathway and investigate their role in the defense response. We will analyse new N-end rule associated genetic resources in barley that should increase resistance to pathogens. This work will provide evidence for a novel post-translational mechanism within the plant immune response, and resources to develop crops with increased resistance to pathogens.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M029441/1","grantId":"BB/M029441/1","fundValue":"342516","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Holdsworth","coPersons":["Rumiana  Ray"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
