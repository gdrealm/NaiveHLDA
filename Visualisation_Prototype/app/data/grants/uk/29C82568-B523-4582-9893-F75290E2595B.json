GaAs offers a number of advantages over InP such as lower cost and higher performance in addition to accessing wavelengths unattainable in InP. However GaAs devices are typically only available as simple ridge waveguides. InP devices are also available as more complex buried waveguides which are more easily integrated and offer flexibility not found in ridge waveguides whilst they also offer improved heat dissipation, permit higher current densities for smaller active volume and have controllable optical beam profiles. These were successfully developed in the GaAs materials system in EPSRC grant EP/E001017, offering the best materials and best device architectures for future incorporation in opto-electronic integrated circuits, allowing technologically advanced device architectures to be developed at wavelengths not presently covered by such devices. IP was generated in applying our novel technique for buried GaAs waveguides to the case of the superluminescent diode (SLD) and semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA), whose operation relies upon attainment of an ultra-low reflectivity mirror at one or more ends of an optical cavity (unlike the case of a laser in which high mirror reflectivities are required). Application of our technique has enabled attainment of mirror reflectivities which are orders of magnitude lower than the lowest reported using alternative techniques, and has allowed a step change in the performance of SLDs incorporating this design, with our unoptimised proof-of-principle devices offering world-leading performance.Whilst this technology is capable of extension across the complete range of wavelengths and associated applications accessed by GaAs, we will first address a large burgeoning market for SLDs and SOAs in the field of optical coherence tomography - a medical imaging technology rolling out across the global healthcare market. Slight modification to the materials and device designs will be made, and the funding will also allow both the commercial packaging of prototype devices for beta testing modules in the field and the reliability testing necessary for convincing users and/or licensees of the technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H029508/1","grantId":"EP/H029508/1","fundValue":"113986","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kristian Michael Groom","coPersons":["Richard Andrew Hogg"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
