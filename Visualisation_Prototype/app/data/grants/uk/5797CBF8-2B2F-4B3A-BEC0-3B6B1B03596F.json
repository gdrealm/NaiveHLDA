Normally one thinks we need lasers and their inherent special properties of one colour and pencil like beams to make patterns of interference: however with careful design we can develop new beams which can give extended patterns of light with similar applications. These white light patterns may be made even with a household bulb! Once we understand how these patterns are made we may use them for moving objects (a miniature tractor beam) for physics and biology studies and also to look at light penetration through turbid sample: this could be ultimately fog or a sample of tissue: if we can get light to go deeper into such samples we may be able to image deeper, activate drugs deep in tissue which may have applications in healthcare","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D059828/1","grantId":"EP/D059828/1","fundValue":"152864","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kishan  Dholakia","coPersons":["Wilson  Sibbett"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
