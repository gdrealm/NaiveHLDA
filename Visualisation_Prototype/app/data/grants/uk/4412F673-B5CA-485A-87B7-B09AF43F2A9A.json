This will help provide more effective treatments.\nAt present pneumococcal pneumonia is one of the most prevalent bacterial pneumonia, killing up to one million children under five worldwide each year. More than 90% of pneumococcal pneumonia deaths in children occur in developing countries and there remains a critical need to improve child survival and stop the devastating impact of pneumonia.\nUnderstanding the immune response to infection is vital for diagnostic treatment and improving vaccinations. In this application we investigate how and what immune reaction pathways take place in the blood of infants with severe pneumococcal pneumonia. To test this idea we plan to undertake a molecular study of gene activity using very small amounts of blood to identify and mathematically model specific immune response pathways to infection.\nThe study will explore a new approach using computational science for mapping and understanding the relationships of genes and proteins that can be used to build predictive models of response to an infection. These studies may lead to new insights toward the molecular basis of disease outcome and prediction of treatment response to infection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701289","grantId":"G0701289","fundValue":"598553","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Ghazal","coPersons":["Richard Adebayo Adegbola","Gerard Anthony Morris","Dirk  Husmeier","Sarah Louise Rowland-Jones","Paul  Dickinson","Stephen Ross Howie"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
