{"id":"CC2C2512-AF1C-439A-B855-354A3A9EB7F4","title":"Know Your Bristol stories","abstractText":"A programme of work will be undertaken involving collaboration between University of Bristol researchers (including students), the University's Centre for Public Engagement, and two community groups in Bristol, focusing on providing support for community events and research activities. This builds on the successful model developed during the Research Development Grant award for 'Know Your Place, Know your Bristol'. These events will focus on two different community groups, Horfield Organic Community Orchard, and Local Learning, and related partners, and will involve different types of community heritage (e.g. memory, historical artifacts, photographs, film), and will help build new connections between different groups.\n\nThe aim is to make academic research and expertise available through collaboration with local community partners, to aid the production of local knowledge by community groups, the Bristol City Council 'Know Your Place' project, as well as researchers. The events will explore the potential for future programmes of interaction, and development of other funding bids, and enhance development of sustainable partnerships. They will be recorded through blogging and other social media, as well as through digital media, and the project website will develop a resource-bank outlining how arts and humanities researchers at Bristol can aid, as well as learn from, a wide variety of different local community groups.\n\nBristol City Council's 'Know Your Place' project has created an open-access interactive map website covering Bristol: layers of historic maps are overlayed on the modern map of the city, allowing users to explore the historic landscape underneath their feet, and the evolution of their localities. The project aims to capture additional user-generated data -- photographs, film, documents, recorded oral testimony, and proactively sought out university researchers to help it develop a strategy with which to achieve this. By collaborating with the Bristol City Council team, arts and humanities researchers will be able to help feed material towards this recourse, and will be facilitated in consolidating relationships with and between community groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007556/1","grantId":"AH/K007556/1","fundValue":"42875","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Bickers","coPersons":["Peter  Coates","James  Thompson"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
