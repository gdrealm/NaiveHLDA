The pharmaceutical industry has been relatively unsuccessful in bringing new treatments to the marketplace for COPD, with many products failing when they are first given to patients. This is largely because not all COPD sufferers are the same and it is likely that drugs will treat certain aspects of the disease and therefore are more likely to benefit some but not all patients. We propose to try to understand what makes people with COPD different from each other and to use these differences to further our understanding of which types of drugs will benefit which types of people. Using this approach we aim to identify markers in blood and sputum that will help us to predict the progression of COPD and response to therapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001365","grantId":"G1001365","fundValue":"3374920","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Brightling","coPersons":["Robert  Stockley","Jadwiga Anna Wedzicha","Martin  Tobin","Jorgen  Vestbo","Anthony  Brookes","Dave  Singh","Paul Richard Burton"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
