The combination of drivers to reduce dependence on depleting petrochemical resources; to reduce negative environmental impacts, notably climate change; to create significant new market opportunities for biotechnologies; and to improve energy security, constitute an historically novel impetus to innovation. A transition to a bio-economy raises biology and agriculture to a strategic economic significance that could not have been imagined twenty years ago.</p>\n\n<p>The research compares contrasting bio-economy developments in Brazil, the USA and Europe. It will examine the diverse challenges, obstacles and potentials faced by countries endowed with different resources, natural and human. The bio-economy embraces innovation in new and ecologically sustainable agricultural inputs (biomass residues or new dedicated crops); new biological processes of converting biomass (biorefinery); and new biological products. </p>\n\n<p>The research also explores new geographically distributed collaborations between firms, between firms and the science base, and the emergence of new bioeconomy firms and markets.</p>\n\n<p>A key aspect of the research is the collaborative partnership between social scientists in Essex and Manchester and the Bioscience for Business Knowledge Transfer Network.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-180-25-0005","grantId":"RES-180-25-0005","fundValue":"253003","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Harvey","coPersons":["Andrew Peter McMeekin","Ken  Green"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
