Within this field the isolation of heavier carbene analogues holds a special fascination as, in addition to fundamental questions regarding their structures and bonding, these compounds may also act as ligands to transition and other metal centres. Although the chemistry of stable diaminocarbenes and their silicon analogues has emerged only recently, the corresponding heavier diaminotetrylenes (R2N)2E [E = Ge, Sn, Pb] have been known since the 1970s. The electron-deficient, low oxidation state group 14 centres in these compounds are stabilised by donation of electron density from the niotrogen lone pairs into the vacant p orbital at the group 14 centre. It is notable that, in contrast to the diaminotetrylenes, analogous compounds with phosphorus (the element directly below nitrogen in the periodic table) adjacent to a divalent group 14 atom are virtually unknown. This is, in part, due to the perception that lone pair donation from phosphorus to an adjacent electron-deficient centre would be poor. However, recent calculations suggest that this is not the case and our own preliminary experiments suggest that a wide range of such compounds is readily accessible.This proposal seeks to build on our preliminary results through the synthesis of an extensive array of phosphorus-substituted, divalent group 14 compounds (phosphatetrylenes) and the study of their structures, bonding and reactions. In the course of these studies we will investigate the donor/acceptor properties of our compounds when bound to transition metals. One of the potential drawbacks of current diaminocarbene chemistry is the limited nature of the changes that may be made to the donor/acceptor properties of these compounds. In contrast, the substituents at phosphorus in our compounds may be readily modified and so the donor/acceptor properties may be altered, permitting the synthesis of phosphatetrylenes having a wide range of properties. These ligands thus have the potential to complement diaminocarbene ligands in transition metal-based catalysts, providing an effective mechanism to tune catalyst properties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F037465/1","grantId":"EP/F037465/1","fundValue":"318410","fundStart":"2008-06-02","fundEnd":"2011-06-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Izod","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" The isolation of stable low-coordination number and low oxidation state derivatives of the group 14 elements (i.e. formal analogues of carbenes, alkenes, alkynes and related species) remains one of the most exciting and challenging areas of contemporary main group chemistry. Within this field the isolation of heavier carbene analogues holds a special fascination as, in addition to fundamental questions regarding their structures and bonding, these compounds may also act as ligands to transition and other metal centres. \n\n\n\nDuring the course of this project we have isolated a range of heavier group 14 carbene analogues supported by phosphorus-donor ligands and have shown that the stabilities and structures of these compounds are markedly affected by the nature of the ligand substituents. We have also shown that these compounds, which are typically isolated as mixtures of diastereomers, readily interconvert between diastereomeric forms. This behaviour is unexpected as inversion at pyramidal phosphorus and/or group 14 centres is usually disfavoured; our theoretical calculations have demonstrated that these interconversions are low in energy due to the unprecedented nature of the mechanisms by which they proceed.\n\n\n\nAs part of this project we have also discovered a new, light-induced rearrangement which converts a phosphide to the corresponding thiolate species via migration of a methyl (or other organic) group from sulfur to phosphorus. We have shown that this rearrangement is general for a range of substituents at sulfur and phosphorus, and that the use of chiral co-ligands leads to the formation of scalemic phosphines by this route.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the project has led to several key advances in main group chemistry including: (i) the isolation of entirely new types of low oxidation state group 14 compound with potential applications as ligands in transition metal chemistry, (ii) the observation of new inversion pathways for pyramidal main group centres, which are directly relevant to the stabilities of chiral phosphines and related ligands, and (iii) the development of an unprecedented isomerisation which may lead to a new route to scalemic phosphines and arsines. This is limited by the fundamental nature of the project. This project was of a fundamental nature and so dissemination was via publication in academic journals. Chemicals","dataset":"gtr"}
