{"id":"381F1855-AF28-41A5-8B92-F2F58D86225E","title":"Edge of a Dream: Utopia, Landscape &amp; Contemporary Photography","abstractText":"Contemporary society grows increasingly concerned with how we engage with the environment, and so-called 'green issues' are regularly debated in public domain. It is, therefore, timely to consider how contemporary art currently addresses the politics of landscape. 'Edge of a Dream' specifically looks at our relation to landscape within the context of global capitalism. \\n\\nThe project identifies a trend within recent landscape photography that presents utopian visions of the natural environment. 'Edge of a Dream' asks to what extent these images are a response to, or critique of, the effects of global capitalism. \\n\\nThe project responds to W.J.T. Mitchell's call for a diverse reading of landscape that acknowledges its socio-political significance; the photography in this project contests a singular or essential idea of nature. Mitchel acknowledges the relation between ideology and representations fo landscape.\\n\\n'Edge of a Dream' examines the work of four international artists producing photography they are, Simryn Gill (MAL), Mandy Lee Jandrell (SA/UK), Virginia Nimarkoh (UK) and David Spero (UK). The artists' works cross-refer in their respective interrogations of landscape. Under the broad theme of landscape, the photography references a diverse range of ideals such as ecology, self-sufficiency, economic prosperity, beauty, architecture, nature, and fantasy. The project provides the opportunity to contextualise an important area of art practice, some of which is new to the UK. None of the photography has yet undergone in-depth critical investigation in relation to the issues that the project raises.\\n\\nThe project brings together key writers and academics within the fields of new technology, design and geography respectively, to examine this important body of work. They include; Anthony Iles, Assistant editor Mute magazine (UK); Kate Soper, Professor in Humanities, Arts and Languages, London Metropolitan University (UK); and John Wood, Professor in Design, Goldsmiths, University of London (UK).\\n\\nThe primary aim of the project is to conduct photographic research and generate new writing for the main research outcomes which are an edited book and online presence. The writing will relate to the artists' photography and the research questions outlined in this proposal. There will also be a one-day public seminar held at Camberwell College of Arts.\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F012454/1","grantId":"AH/F012454/1","fundValue":"16112","fundStart":"2008-01-07","fundEnd":"2008-07-06","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Virginia  Nimarkoh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
