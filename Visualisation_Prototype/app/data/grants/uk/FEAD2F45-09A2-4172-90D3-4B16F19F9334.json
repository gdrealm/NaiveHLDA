In particular, Laurencia species provide such halogenated compounds as medium ring ethers (rings of 7,8 or 9-atoms consisting of one oxygen and the rest as carbon) that have traditionally been viewed as difficult to synthesize in a laboratory. Previously, the biogenesis of these compounds has been assumed to involve the cyclisation of an alcohol onto a reactive bromonium ion to create the medium ring. However, there are some unexplained difficulties with the currently proposed biogenesis. We now propose that alcohols are not the true biogenetic precursors.

A EPSRC funded DTA PhD student (end date September 2011) has now completed the project where we will shortly report a unifying biogenesis for these naturally occurring compounds.
