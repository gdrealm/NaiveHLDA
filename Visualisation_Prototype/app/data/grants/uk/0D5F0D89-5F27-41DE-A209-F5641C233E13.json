Promoting the health and wellbeing of older people is a critical policy issue as the population ages, while social, economic and demographic changes across Europe point to an increasing role for grandparents in providing childcare support to families. Despite competing pressures on older workers to remain in the workforce for longer and to provide care to frail family members, there are additional pressures on grandparents to provide childcare. This is thought to be due to policies encouraging more mothers into the paid workforce, increases in rates of family breakdown and single motherhood, and financial pressures on families.</p>\n\n<p>This vital economic and social role is largely overlooked or taken for granted by policymakers, and the health impacts on older people of taking on these childcare roles are not known.</p>\n\n<p>Our project is in the Ageing Cluster led by Professor Peter Llyod-Sherlock of Phase I of the <a rel=\"nofollow\">SDA initiative</a><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K003348/1","grantId":"ES/K003348/1","fundValue":"156843","fundStart":"2013-04-15","fundEnd":"2014-10-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used to inform policy and practice.

While cross-sectional analyses show that those who are not looking after grandchildren, and those who are looking after grandchildren intensively, are more likely to report poor health in comparison to those who look after grandchildren non-intensively, longitudinal analyses show that those who provide grandchild care (particularly those providing non-intensive childcare) are significantly less likely to report poor health. Our findings using SHARE support recent work in China and Taiwan that also suggests that providing grandchild care at lower intensity levels is positively related to health whereas higher intensity care levels is negatively associated. \n\nA key focus of our study was an examination of the link between grandparental childcare and health taking into account prior health status as well as socio-economic circumstances across the life course. As our cross-sectional analyses using SHARE show that those in more disadvantaged circumstances are more likely to end up providing intensive grandchild care, it was necessary to rule out that the association between grandparental childcare and health was due to this earlier disadvantage rather than to grandchild care per se. However, once prior health status and lifecourse circumstances are taken into account, grandparental childcare (and in particular non-intensive grandchild care) still shows a positive relationship with health in SHARE. This finding points to the need for public policy to support the role of grandparents as care givers for their grandchildren, at non-intensive levels. At the moment the informal caring role of grandparents especially grandmothers is largely hidden. There is a need for better recognition of this vital role across different policy domains, including pensions and retirement, childcare, housing and social security. Policies to support active ageing need to explicitly recognise and value older people's involvement in their grandchildren's lives, both for the benefit of children, their families and wider families, but also because of the benefits for older people's health and wellbeing.\n\nThe difference between our results and work from the U.S., which shows a negative impact of grandparental childcare on health, is most likely due to the measure of grandchild care used. In the U.S., as previously discussed, most studies focus on higher intensity levels of care, for example, grandparents who are 'primary caregivers' for their grandchildren. Evidence from China also suggests that grandparents who provide higher intensity levels of care (that is, grandparents who coreside with their grandchildren and provide 15 or more hours of care per week) are more likely to experience health declines. \n\nIn addition, although in our analysis of SHARE we take into account prior health status and earlier socio-economic circumstances, several important indicators are missing which are also likely to affect who provides care. For example, we do not have a measure of the quality of the relationship between grandparents, their children and grandchildren. This is likely to affect which grandparent is selected to look after grandchildren, which in turn is likely to be related to health in later life.\n\nIn our cross-sectional examination of ELSA we find that living with a grandchild is negatively associated with QoL whereas looking after a grandchild in the past week shows a positive relationship. However, in longitudinal analyses once prior QoL is taken into account the relationship between these two measures and grandparental health is no longer significant.
