More recently, the use of coated microbubbles in therapeutic applications such as targeted drug delivery has also become an active area of research. However, their behaviour in vivo is by no means fully understood and the aim of this project is to investigate the hitherto neglected problem of microbubbles excited by an ultrasound field within the confines of narrow blood vessels. The work will involve a combination of theoretical modelling and both in vitro and in vivo experiments which will enable a more rigorous assessment of the safety of ultrasound contrast agents and the development of more effective ultrasound therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E029310/1","grantId":"EP/E029310/1","fundValue":"207902","fundStart":"2007-07-11","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  There has been considerable interest in our findings from the regulatory bodies that formulate guidelines for the safe use of ultrasound imaging.

This is extremely important for the correct interpretation of ultrasound signals for both imaging and treatment monitoring. The stresses on the vessel wall were also examined and showed there would be conditions under which damage could occur.\nSimultaneously at the Inst. Cancer Research an in vitro model for investigating the interaction between microbubbles and blood vessel walls experimentally was developed. The results of experiments using this model confirmed that damage to the vessel wall, including complete rupture could be produced with moderate bubble concentrations and exposure conditions. The mathematical models have more general applications in cavitation research and in combination with the experimental results have potential use in the development of safety guidelines for the use of contrast enhanced ultrasound.\nThe conditions under which vessel penetration was observed could also be exploited in the development of more effective therapies.
