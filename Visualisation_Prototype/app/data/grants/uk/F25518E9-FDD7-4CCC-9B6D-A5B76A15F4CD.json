{"id":"F25518E9-FDD7-4CCC-9B6D-A5B76A15F4CD","title":"The Enterprise and Diversity Alliance: Promoting Knowledge Exchange in the New Era of Business Support","abstractText":"<p>This project aims to establish the Enterprise and Diversity Alliance (EDA) as the United Kingdom’s leading knowledge exchange network for entrepreneurship and minority businesses (that is, small enterprises owned by ethnic minorities, women and young people).</p>\n\n<p>It brings together researchers, corporations, the finance sector and professional bodies in order to pursue one central ambition: to ‘make diversity and enterprise everyone’s business’.</p>\n\n<p>Three strands of work will be undertaken to ensure that knowledge on minority enterprise is shared widely with relevant stakeholders. First, innovative peer mentoring initiatives with minority entrepreneurs will be launched. Second, the project will integrate knowledge on diversity and enterprise in the practices of large organisations. Finally, knowledge and insights from the implementation of the EDA project will be shared with the wider peer, professional and policy networks of partner organisations. In effect, EDA members will be ambassadors for diversity and enterprise amongst their peers. This provides an opportunity for the EDA to influence major national initiatives.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J020699/1","grantId":"ES/J020699/1","fundValue":"49766","fundStart":"2012-04-02","fundEnd":"2013-04-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Monder  Ram","coPersons":["Kiran  Trehan"],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
