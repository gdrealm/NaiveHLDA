Such repertoires are not only important for conducting empirical social research but also for supervising students’ empirical research and for teaching research methods at undergraduate or postgraduate level. This programme aims at building and strengthening advanced quantitative repertoires in the Midlands area.\n<br />\n<br />The programme is cross-disciplinary in character and caters to participants across the social sciences. These may be lecturers in research methods or researchers (including postgraduates).\n<br />\n<br />Training will combine face-to-face delivery with e-learning. The face-to-face element comprises eight intensive and interlinked 2-day modules (‘clinics’), each supported by an e-learning module. The e-learning component, including e-discussions led by the course tutor refreshes lessons learned in the classroom and provides avenues for further development.\n<br />\n<br />The programme concludes with a conference on teaching research methods at undergraduate and postgraduate level. The conference focuses on best practice in methods teaching and will review strategies and experiences involved in developing and disseminating methods repertoires in regular curricula.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F018517/1","grantId":"ES/F018517/1","fundValue":"78537","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Cornelis ('Cees') Van Der Eijk","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
