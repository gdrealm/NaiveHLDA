Dengue disease ranges from mild fever to the potentially fatal dengue haemorrhagic fever/ shock syndromes (DHF/DSS). It is estimated that at least 50 million dengue infections and 250000 cases of DHF occur annually. DHF is characterised by an increase in vascular permeability, which is believed to be immune mediated. Our current understanding of dengue disease is limited and there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments in use to control the spread of DENV.\nOur research is aimed at understanding how DENV replicates and causes disease. The DENV NS5 protein has been found to be essential for replication of the virus and is an important target for antiviral drug development. Recent evidence also suggests that the NS5 protein may play a role in promoting disease. We intend to investigate how the NS5 interacts with the host cell to alter host cell processes, defining the regions of the NS5 protein involved and determining whether these features are common to different strains of DENV.\nBy determining how individual DENV proteins modulate host cell processes, we will increase our understanding of DENV disease. This knowledge can be used to develop improved DENV vaccines and antiviral agents that are urgently needed. In addition, the research proposed in this application is potentially relevant to our general understanding of how the immune system functions to control microbial disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801973","grantId":"G0801973","fundValue":"364201","fundStart":"2009-08-17","fundEnd":"2012-12-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Duell Davidson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
