Artists often adapt industrial and digital technologies to work with creatively, as evidenced by the use of digital printing, to create artists' books and prints. This project would create new methodologies for artists' creative production methods.\\n\\nAs the technology becomes more affordable, laser cutters are a regular feature within secondary, further and higher education. This project aims explore the potential of the laser cutter as a tool for artists working with the book form and paper-based work, and see how it can replace the need for labour intensive manipulation of paper and card by hand. The project also aims to change attitudes to creative making and increase awareness of the advantage of new technologies for artists/craftspeople.\\n\\nManipulating paper on a laser cutter is being explored within industry, but what remains relatively unexplored is the possibility of using the laser cutter as a creative production tool for artists and craftspeople. One aspect that is unappealing to many artists is that the normal carbon dioxide laser cutter will burn and scorch the edges of the paper. With an investigation into which papers cut with the least amount of burning and by utilising nitrogen instead of oxygen as the cutting catalyst, this should reduce any scorching to an absolute minimum. \\n\\nThe PI researches and assists artists and designers with laser cutting and feels that the potential of these machines is under-explored. As part of this bid the PI would be developing his own practice as a book artist with the use of the laser cutting process. This involves exploring the possibilities of using the laser cutters in conjunction with digital printing to produce accurate cuts and folds within the book, in relation to the printed imagery. The results of this would be used as one of the three in-depth case studies in the final outcomes.\\n\\nThe PI will also work with two other book artists who have yet to engage with laser cutters as a creative production tool. The possibility of using the laser as a tool for cutting, scoring, perforating and engraving paper is as yet underutilised by book and paper artists. Many artists use hand cutting and scoring in their work unaware that laser cutters can assist in many of the more mundane aspects of producing editions or unique works. The laser cutter need not replace the handcrafted element rather run alongside it. This would allow the artist to produce larger editions more effectively and allow the work to be distributed to a wider audience.\\n\\nThe artists will be invited to be a case study resident at the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR), University of the West of England, and work intensively over a four day period, producing new work that explores the use of the laser cutters. The new work produced on residency will be exhibited at four venues in the UK and Denmark over 2010 - 2011. \\n\\nTo present this applied research within an academic context, the findings of the project will also be published online to allow for greater dissemination and to provoke further discussion and development of the laser cutter as a creative production tool. Collectively the case studies will be written up and submitted for publication as an article in 'The Bonefolder', 'The Journal of Artists' Books' and 'AfterImage'. Free cutting guides, aimed at artists, designers, craftspeople and those in education, will be available as PDFs on the CFPR book arts website. A critical essay on the project's outcomes will also be available on the book arts website as a PDF. \\n\\nA one-day symposium for twenty-five delegates will present the project, demonstrate the process and feedback into the project report. One of the case study artists will also present the work produced on residency and discuss how the process of using a laser cutter impacted on the creative production of their work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H020756/1","grantId":"AH/H020756/1","fundValue":"31957","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Since conclusion of the project, the findings have been used to inform delivery of the laser-cutting bureau service at UWE. This service available to artists, designers and makers external to the university has seen a steady increase in numbers using the service and results from the projects have helped to inform those cutting for the clients, as well as informing them on the best way to utilise the laser-cutter as a tool.\n\nOne of the major case study artists, Mette-Sofie D. Ambeck, has since gone on to produce another laser engraved edition artist's book. Dust to Dust was produced in an edition of 10 in 2012, with laser engraving by Tom Sowden. It is now in the public collection of the Tate, Manchester Metropolitan University Library, UCA Epsom Library and Winchester School of Art Library, and it was selected for the Fifth International Artists' Book Exhibition 2013 at Szent Istv?n Kir?ly M?zeum, Sz?kesfeh?rv?r, Hungary where it has been donated to the permanent collection.\n\nAll outputs from the project are available as downloads from the CFPR Book Arts website (http://www.bookarts.uwe.ac.uk/papermods11.htm). Aimed particularly at those who wish to use laser-cutting technology to manipulate paper and card, those offering this as a service and those within education for whom it has relevance, these downloads and description of the project are available for free.
