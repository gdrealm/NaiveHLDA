These cells are not only a good alternative to animals which are currently used for heart research but also are a valuable material for treating patients with heart failure, which is a major killer to the UK people. However, in order to achieve this goal, it is essential to further understand how heart cells develop in our body before birth.\n\nThis study aims to unveil characteristics (?gene profiles?) of specific cells (heart cell precursors) in the embryo which are changing to heart cells. This very important information has not been achieved due to technical limitations of previously-available methods because such cells are extremely small in number. This study will solve such difficulties by using a combination of state-of-the art technologies. In the experiment, a single individual cell of interest will be isolated and collected from embryo under microscope, and the genes included in the cell will be amplified using a newly-established molecular biological method so that the amount of the genes become sufficient for assessment. Then, amplified gene expression of each cell will be assessed by using the latest, extremely powerful analyser. \n\nThe data obtained will provide a range of new important knowledge regarding how heart cells are developed in the body, which will in turn suggests how to produce heart cells from stem cells in the laboratory. Moreover, this information may open a door to new research. We may be able to generate heart cells from patient?s own cells such as skin cells by applying the information obtained in this study. Thus this research project will gratefully contribute to the progress in medical science and to development of new therapies for heart failure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900105","grantId":"G0900105","fundValue":"333380","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kenta  Yashiro","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
