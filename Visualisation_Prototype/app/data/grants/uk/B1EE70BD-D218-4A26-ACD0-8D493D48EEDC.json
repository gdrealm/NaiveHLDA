This refers to where individuals find pathways out of gambling without recourse to formal public or voluntary sector support.</p> \n<p>The study involves: a scoping survey about who participates in internet gambling, when and how they participate, and what types of internet gambling they prefer. It will be followed by life history interviews with internet gamblers and their significant others to explore individuals’ pathways in and out of gambling and the role of&nbsp; ‘families’ in defining problem gambling and developing informal strategies to support the gambler out of this behaviour.</p> \n<p>By considering types of harm experienced within the family we will investigate the extent to which the home is becoming a new space of risk.</p> \n<p>The findings will be disseminated to key stakeholders (e.g. GamCare, Relate). In particular, we aim to show how family-based strategies identified in the fieldwork might be 'scaled up' for use within the therapeutic community.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D00067X/1","grantId":"ES/D00067X/1","fundValue":"152072","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gill  Valentine","coPersons":["Kahryn A Hughes"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
