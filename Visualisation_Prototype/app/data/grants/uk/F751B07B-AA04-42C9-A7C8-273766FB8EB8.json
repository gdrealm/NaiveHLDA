The curriculum consists of 10 “sessions” focused on quantitative research within social work, starting with the need for numbers through to basic statistics. In addition, resources for more advanced study will be provided. Each session will include resources for teaching, references and interactive materials to support teaching and learning but aimed at allowing flexible use across different types of course.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 2 will involve rolling this out to other interested Universities (2013-15). An evaluation will compare knowledge and views of students and staff, after the first year and at the end of the project. This work is complemented by the RDI proposal aimed at teaching and pedagogic support.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J011835/1","grantId":"ES/J011835/1","fundValue":"70754","fundStart":"2012-01-08","fundEnd":"2015-01-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Donald McColl Forrester","coPersons":["Barbra  Teater","John Samuel Carpenter","John Joseph Devaney"],"organisation":"University of Bedfordshire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
