How? Phonetically, is the shape of the tongue inside the speaker’s vocal tract perceptible?</p>\n\n<p>This project brings these questions together, to investigate how dialect, speech production and speech perception are related. It had previously been thought (on the basis of US English) that differing tongue shapes can be used by different people to articulate the consonant /r/ in a random way, with no sociolinguistic function. Either the tongue tip curls upwards, or points downwards to create a broad bunched shape, a difference apparently impossible to hear.</p>\n\n<p>This project looks at these articulatory shapes of /r/, which our previous ESRC work found to vary socially in&nbsp; Scottish English. If this difference can’t be heard, how can&nbsp; the &quot;speaker-hearer chain&quot;&nbsp; create and transmit this social variation in tongue shape? What does get transmitted?</p>\n\n<p>The project will directly measure speakers’ tongue shapes, play just the acoustic recordings of /r/ types to listeners, who will mimic what they hear, then measure their tongue shape. This will uncover whether listeners can perceive and reproduce the differences in shape, or whether other differences we will measure such as the timing of the articulation matter more.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I036400/1","grantId":"ES/I036400/1","fundValue":"185059","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James M Scobbie","coPersons":["Eleanor  Lawson","Jane  StuartSmith"],"organisation":"Queen Margaret University Edinburgh","findingsText":" 1. We have confirmed the remarkable finding from our previous grant (ES/E011829/1) that there is a clear social class difference in the way that the tongue is shaped to produce a word-final /r/ consonant in Scottish English, despite claims in the literature that such differences are inaudible, idiosyncratic, or dictated by adjacent consonants and vowels. Our sample of 16 children in Glasgow provided categorical evidence of the difference.\n2. We have shown that the minority of speakers who use a different /r/ shape in word-initial position from word-final position, all have the same system, with a middle-class-style &quot;bunched&quot; /r/ in word-final position and a more tip-up or &quot;retroflex&quot; /r/ in word-initial position.\n3. We have shown a strong social difference in the relative timing of tongue-root and tongue tip components of word-final /r/.\n4. We have shown that some listeners in a mimicry task can alter the way they produce word-final /r/ when listening to an unfamiliar voice: the details of the ways in which these speakers vary inform theories of speech perception and production. Academic research- we expect linguistic, sociolinguistic and phonetic interest in the findings. We also expect our novel methodology to influence research in psycholinguistics.\nAcademic scholarship and teaching - the reasearch team has contributed materials and concepts behind the web-based phonetics teaching site Seeing Speech, and its AHRC-funded successor, Dynamic Dialects. We expect dialectological and phonetic teaching to use these resources, both in traditional academic courses, an in applied courses for speech and language therapy.\nClinical Research and practice - we expect our exemplification of social variation in /r/ to influence the ways in which ultrasound therapy is conceived and implemented in North America, where /r/ is a key target for therapy.
