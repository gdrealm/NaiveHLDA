Recent work from our lab has shown that new neurons are generated in the hypothalamus of adolescent and adult mice. Intriguingly, these neurons appear to be destined for circuits that regulate appetite and energy expenditure. This raises the interesting possibility that these circuits can be modulated to the benefit of human health. In particular, to preserve the healthy functioning of the brain in aged individuals and tackling eating disorders, such as obesity.\nWe have discovered that the new hypothalamic neurons arise from a unique population of stem cells, called tanycytes. We have also found that these cells express a very important signaling gene, called Fgf10. Our main objectives are to characterize and understand the function/s of Fgf10 in tanycytes. To meet these objectives, we will use well-characterized tissue culture systems and examine the brains of genetically modified mice, in which the functioning of Fgf10 has been abrogated or elevated. We will also investigate the cohort of genes and molecules that Fgf10 may talk to and interact with to exert its functions. \nThe generated information will advance our knowledge of brain stem cells and brain function and may well lead to the development of molecular tools to positively modulate brain function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L003406/1","grantId":"BB/L003406/1","fundValue":"444752","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings are quite recent and at their infancy but will ultimately have a great impact on understanding brain stem cells function and regulation of appetite  ","person":"Mohammad Kouros Hajihosseini","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" Backgournd:\nOur main objectives are to learn more about the biology of a population of newly-discovered population of stem cells in the adult brain. This population of cells, called tanycytes, are of particular interest and importance because they reside in close proximity to areas of the brain that control level and frequency of food uptake (appetite) and energy expenditure. Previously, we showed that tanycytes divide and supply the brain's appetite-regulating circuitry with new cells (neurons), implying that these circuits are flexible in their functionality\nThus, if we knew what genes regulate the biology of tanycytes (for example, the rate at which they divide and generate new cells), we may be in a position to change the behavior of tanycytes and ultimately regulate appetite. For now, we are investigating this possibility in genetically modified rodents, but we are confident that as mice replicate human physiology, any findings in these animals will apply directly to humans. \nDiscovery:\nA key gene that is active in tancytyes is called 'Fibroblast growth factor 10', or FGF10 for short.\n In line with the proposed aims of the project, we have now used compound transgenic mice to silence the functioning of FGF10 in tanycytes and simultaneously follow their fate and that of their daughters in their normal environment in the brain (in vivo). Our recent discoveries show that deletion of FGF10 from these cells, initially perturbs the rate at which they divide, but ironically, the daughters of tanycytes become more proliferative and generate more cells. This suggests that FGF10 normal has multiple roles, possibly with a short-acting effect that has a knock on effect on other biological processes. \nOur follow on studies are aimed at understanding how FGF10 brings about these effects. For example, what genes are controlled by FGF10. The information we have generated so far will be valuable to ourselves and others. First, it verifies that FGF10 is an important factor in biology of tanycytes and worth following up at molecular level. \nSecond, FGF10 is also an important regulator of organ formation during embryonic development, as exemplified by mutations that cause human defects in limbs, ears, salivary and submandibular glands in LADD and ALSG syndromes. Thus, knowing more about how FGF10 functions in one system - in our case, tanycytes - will provide valuable clues about it functionality in other systems.\nOur findings are quite recent and in their infancy. However, once we have understood more about the molecular targets and partners of FGF10, we can share this information with chemists/ pharmaceutical organizations to devise ways of modulating FGF10 function as means of modulating tanycyte biology and ultimately appetite/ energy expenditure. This is particularly pertinent in view of rising and prevalent levels of eat disorders such as obesity, which are placing a burden on health services and the affected individuals.
