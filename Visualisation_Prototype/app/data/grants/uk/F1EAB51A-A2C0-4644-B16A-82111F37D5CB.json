Energy companies will be allowed to build new nuclear power stations provided sufficient progress is made on the radioactive waste issue. In common with other nations, geological disposal is the UK's preferred option for dealing with radioactive waste in the long term. Making a safety case for geological disposal is a major scientific undertaking. National and international research programmes have produced a good understanding of the mechanisms by which radionuclides might return to the human environment and of their consequences once there. One of the outstanding challenges is how to deal with the uncertainties inherent in geological systems and in the evolution of a repository over long time periods and this is at the heart of the proposed research.The main mechanism whereby radionuclides might return to the environment, in the event that they escape from the repository, is transport by groundwater flowing in rocks underground. The mathematical equations that model this flow are well understood, but in order to solve them and to predict the transport of radionuclides the permeability and porosity of the rocks must be specified everywhere around the repository. It is only feasible to measure these quantities at relatively few locations. The values elsewhere have to be inferred and this, inevitably, gives rise to uncertainty. In early performance assessments, relatively rudimentary approaches to treating these uncertainties were used, primarily due to the computational cost. Since then, there have been considerable advances in computer hardware and in the mathematical field of uncertainty quantification. One of the most common approaches to quantify uncertainty is to use probabilistic techniques. This means that the coefficients within the flow equations will be modelled as random fields, leading to partial differential equations with random coefficients (stochastic PDEs), and solving these is much harder and more computationally demanding than their deterministic equivalents. Many fast converging techniques for stochastic PDEs have recently emerged, which are applicable when the uncertainty can be approximated well with a small number of stochastic parameters. However, evidence from field data is such that in repository safety cases much larger numbers of stochastic parameters will be required to capture the uncertainty in the system. Only Monte Carlo (MC) sampling and averaging methods are currently feasible in this case, and the relatively slow rate of convergence of these methods is a major issue.In the work proposed here we will develop and analyse a new and exciting approach to accelerate the convergence of MC simulations for stochastic PDEs. The multilevel MC approach combines multigrid ideas for deterministic PDEs with the classical MC method. The dramatic savings in computational cost which we predict for this approach stem from the fact that most of the work can be done on computationally cheap coarse spatial grids. Only very few samples have to be computed on finer grids to obtain the necessary spatial accuracy. This method has already been applied (by one of the PIs), with great success, to stochastic ordinary differential equations in mathematical finance. In this project we will extend the technique to PDEs, developing the analysis of the method required, and apply the technique to realistic models of groundwater flow relevant to radioactive waste repository assessments. The potential impact for future work on radioactive waste disposal and also for other areas where uncertainty quantification plays a major role (e.g. carbon capture and storage) is considerable.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H051503/1","grantId":"EP/H051503/1","fundValue":"262323","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project has been conducted in close collaboration with the government's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and their main contractor AMEC.

It had been applied previously only in the context of SDEs in finance. Here we studied it in the context of subsurface flow and in particular in the safety assessment of longterm radioactive waste disposal underground. The gains in the context of uncertainty quantification are significantly higher than in the SDE case. \n\nWith respect to the theoretical aspects, we significantly exceeded our research plan, giving in essence an almost complete analysis of the method in the physically relevant situation of lognormal coefficients and numerical experiments backing up all our theoretical findings. We extended the analysis to various discretisation schemes, to the case of Monte Carlo Markov chain (of huge importance to incorporate also data). And we applied the method to the WIPP test case and to some 3D model problems in radioactive waste disposal. \n\nIn parallel, we also extended the analysis of quasi-Monte Carlo methods applied to the same model problems, as well as combining the two approaches to the most efficient novel method, the multilevel QMC method - the analysis of which is essentially also completed and will be published in due course in a follow-up paper, as well as a comparison paper of all our new methods with stochastic collocation. \n\nAnother set of results that arose within the project were new multiscale and multilevel iterative techniques for solving highly heterogeneous elliptic partial differential equations efficiently and robustly, as well as their rigorous analysis. This is crucial, since the bottleneck in the novel UQ tools above ed up being the deterministic finite element solver for individual samples. We made them widely known mainly through publications in the leading international journals and through talks (many keynotes; also to engineers - oil, hydrology, aerospace, meteorology, ...). \n\nIt has spawned a whole new field of research, with academic positions on the topic being created in Germany or the US and entire minisymposia or even workshops devoted to them. The publications listed have been cited more than 450 times in the last 4 years (source: Google Scholar), which is a very big number for mathematics.\n\nThe methodology can be applied in all areas of science and engineering and people are actively applying it in a huge range of fields. In our group, we have a new EPSRC funded project together with GKN Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering in Bath where we apply the method in the context of uncertainty quantification in aerospace composites.\n\nThrough the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and their contractor AMEC, the specific findings in the context of radioactive waste disposal will be taken forward.
