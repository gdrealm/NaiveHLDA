They are heme-binding proteins, and bind the same heme cofactor as does the oxygen carrying blood protein hemoglobin. Like hemoglobin, P450s also bind molecular oxygen (O2). However, unlike hemoglobin they reduce bound oxygen with electrons delivered to the heme from partner proteins, and which ultimately are derived from the cell coenzyme NADPH. This enables P450s to split the oxygen molecule into its component atoms. One of the two atoms is used to form water (H2O), while the other is used to oxygenate an organic substrate molecule bound by the P450 close to its heme iron. Frequently, hydroxylation (introduction of an OH group) is catalysed. In humans, activity of P450s is essential for production of steroid hormones, and also for creation of many lipid molecules essential for signalling within the body (e.g. for activation of the immune system). However, humans have 57 different P450s, and their most famous roles are in detoxification and removal of drugs and other xenobiotics from the body / performed mainly by hepatic P450s. In bacteria and lower eukaryotes, the P450s have important roles in pathways that allow unusual molecules (e.g. camphor) to be used to provide energy for growth, and are essential for production of molecules such as antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin). The ability of P450 enzymes to introduce oxygen atoms at defined positions in organic molecules has also attracted much attention from organic chemists, who are looking for cleaner and more environmentally friendly routes to synthesis of drugs and other important molecules. A fundamental understanding of P450 structure and activity is essential to understand how they achieve their biological functions, and how they can be applied for biotechnological roles. Also, there is enormous interest in understanding how prescribed drugs bind to individual P450s (and how molecules of biotechnological interest bind to the relevant P450s), since this can lead to accurate predictions of how individual P450s act on these molecules, their lifetimes in the body and how these parameters can be changed by altering the drug structure. The usual way of determining binding modes of substrates/drugs to P450s is to form crystals of the complex made between the P450 and the drug, and then use the technique of x-ray diffraction to obtain the crystal structure. In this proposal, we seek to address fundamental questions relating to how P450s 'activate' oxygen and catalyse hydroxylation reactions. Specifically, we will use modern kinetic techniques (including laser flash photolysis) to provide evidence for formation of transient reactive heme species that are considered critical for oxygenation chemistry. Also, we will use these methods to answer a critical question relating to whether two different reactive species are formed in the P450 reaction 'cycle' and if these have differing types of activities that could be exploited biotechnologically. In addition, we will address serious issues relating to the relevance of binding modes seen for substrates in different P450 x-ray structures. We will use a model system (P450 BM3) to establish whether an observed substrate binding mode is relevant to catalysis in the P450 and to challenge hypotheses suggesting that the substrate re-positions as the P450 is reduced, or whether thermal effects are critical for causing substrate to relocate. Collectively, this work will answer fundamental questions on the nature of P450 catalysis and the relevance of distinct reactive intermediates in the process. Also, it will define the relevance of substrate binding mode and substrate relocation in a key model P450, with important ramifications for rationalising how substrates bind to biomedically relevant P450s. Thus, the study proposed has wide ranging relevance to understanding P450 activity in mammalian physiology and for biotechnological applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F002521/1","grantId":"BB/F002521/1","fundValue":"520651","fundStart":"2007-07-16","fundEnd":"2012-01-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The project involved studies of structure, mechanism and fast reaction chemistry in a biotechnologically important cytochrome P450 enzyme.

Frequently this results in hydroxylation of the substrate. This is the reaction catalysed by the P450 BM3 enzyme from the soil bacterium Bacillus megaterium, which is the fastest known P450 hydroxylase and the subject of studies done in this project. BM3 is a P450 that is naturally fused to its electron donating partner, a factor underpinning its high levels of activity.\nThe aim of this research was to use the biotechnologically important BM3 enzyme as a model system for investigating the catalytic properties of P450s and to probe for formation of reactive oxygen-bound intermediates that are involved in the catalytic cycle of the BM3 P450 and which ultimately result in oxidation of the substrate. This research used a combination of methods including computational and experimental techniques (the latter including fast reaction methods of stopped-flow absorption spectroscopy and laser flash photolysis); and employed mutagenesis techniques to alter the properties of the P450 in order to stabilize certain oxygen bound species.\nResearch performed furthered knowledge of structure/mechanism in a biotechnologically important P450 enzyme. Most significant achievements were (i) The generation of mutants of P450 BM3 that stabilize its ferrous-oxy complex and/or alter its heme iron coordination state. The former mutants enabled analysis of binding kinetics for gaseous ligands (oxygen, CO) to the heme iron and allowed studies to probe formation of later catalytic cycle intermediates; (ii) Development of methods to rapidly reduce P450s using laser excitation and to form (using peroxynitrite or peroxide surrogates) reactive iron-oxo intermediates. Limited evidence (low yields) for formation of the most reactive species (the iron-oxo intermediates referred to as compound 0 and compound I) was obtained through fast reaction studies, but computational work favoured strongly the catalytic relevance of only the very short-lived compound I intermediate. During the course of this study, research was done elsewhere (using a thermostable P450 operating at ambient temperature) that provided convincing data for formation of compound I and its catalytic potency. Near the end of this project, ourselves and others were also able to get good spectroscopic evidence for compound I formation in a different P450 enzyme in which catalysis is naturally driven by hydrogen peroxide. Through enzymatic, structural and computational studies, novel data were obtained for the mechanism of inter-monomer electron transfer in the P450 BM3 enzyme, which we showed naturally to be a dimeric enzyme. In addition, the dominant role of the ferryl-oxo (compound I) intermediate (over the ferric-hydroperoxo compound 0) in BM3 substrate oxidations was shown computationally. Other mechanistic and modelling studies probing the BM3 mechanism indicated that substrate (fatty acid) migration from a non-catalytically competent state to a position proximal to the heme occurs, and that this process is likely not related to changes in the reduction or oxygen binding state of the P450. Several P450 BM3 mutants were made in the course of this project, and in some cases we were able to show considerable changes in the way the heme iron was bound (coordinated) by protein amino acids. This allowed us to identify a number of heme iron coordination states that had not previously been observed in nature, and to identify novel conformational states occupied by the P450. Collectively, a large body of novel data on the catalytic and mechanistic features of a biotechnologically important P450 enzyme were collected, and new insights were made into how conformational changes occur and how these may be related to the progression of the P450 catalytic cycle. Important data were collected in relation to conformational states occupied by the target P450, and further studies here (including dynamics analysis) could enable understanding of how conformational rearrangements are related to the catalytic process of P450s. Novel ligation modes of heme iron were also identified and these provide templates for identifying proteins in which these occur naturally. Methods developed for rapid P450 reduction should be used to explore reactions of heme (and other redox cofactor) binding proteins with oxygen and other substrates in order to determine mechanistic details in P450s and many other redox enzymes.
