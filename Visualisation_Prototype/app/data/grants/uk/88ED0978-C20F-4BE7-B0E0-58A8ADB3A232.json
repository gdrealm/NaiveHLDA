A study of Government, the BBC and UK Film Council","abstractText":"How is creativity, both as a concept and as a practice, affected by UK government policy? This project will analyse creative industries policy since New Labour's coming to power in 1997. It will document where ideas about cultural creativity and its economic significance have come from and investigate how policy debate was shaped. It will also undertake two detailed case studies of the impact of policy on creative practice in the BBC and the UK Film Council. Finally, addressing the question of how devolution affects policy and practice, attention will be focused on BBC Scotland and the film agency, Scottish Screen.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112152/1","grantId":"112152/1","fundValue":"157575","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-01-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  PI Philip Schlesinger\nProject director, policy seminars and briefings for Creative Scotland joint board, funded by the Scottish Arts Council, April-August, 2007.\n\nMember FCO-AHRC delegation to UK-Brazilian creative industries workshop, Sao Paulo, 3-5 December 2007.\n\n'Provovateur', Artist as Leader Lab, Hospitalfield House, funded by the Jerwood Charitable Foundation, Arts Council England, Scottish Arts Council, Arbroath, 21 January 2007.\n\nThe project has informed contributions made as a member of Ofcom's Scottish Advisory Committee and of the Scottish Funding Council's Research and Knowledge Transfer Committee.\n\nCI Simon Frith\nMember of the Scottish Music Industry Working Group in 2006/7.\n\nPanellist at two events organized by the AHRC Research Centre for Studies in Intellectual Property and Technology Law at Edinburgh University.

It involved case studies of two key institutions of the creative economy: the BBC (analysing the 'creative turn there under DG Greg Dyke) and the UK Film Council (analysing the introduction of a new tax regime for film). It also, through the linked PhD studentship considered key creative economy institutions BBC scotland and Scottish Screen and their operations in a devolved nation. Our end of project seminar, which included policy actors, industry executives and cultural agencies indicated very clearly that academic research into the workings of the creative economy can enable key players to rethink the conditions under which they work, how they develop strategy, and how unexamined beliefs have an impact on everyday practices.
