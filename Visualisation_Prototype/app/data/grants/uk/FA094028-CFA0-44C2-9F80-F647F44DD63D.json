{"id":"FA094028-CFA0-44C2-9F80-F647F44DD63D","title":"Compact Linac with Dynamic Controls for Image Driven Optimisation of X-ray screening","abstractText":"Linac based X-ray sources are commonly used by customs officers and homeland security worldwide to scan the contents of shipping containers and trucks for illicit materials and goods, as well as dangerous materials. The linac consists of a small particle accelerator and a target. Modern scanning systems require more flexible X-ray sources to provide better scanning of objects where the X-ray output can be closely matched for each object to be scanned, known as image driven optimisation. However such flexible X-ray sources are not currently available.\n\nLancaster University and STFC have recently developed a compact controllable X-ray source as part of the PNPAS scheme. We propose to improve the engineering design of this linac to increase its technology readiness level as well as upgrading this linac to a higher beam energy, 3 MeV, and implement a sophisticated control system developed for high energy physics accelerators to allow the development of a flexible X-ray source suitable for image driven optimisation.\n\nThe linac is also significantly smaller than conventional linacs, allowing a reduction in weight that improves the\nmanoeuverability of the linac.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J005681/1","grantId":"ST/J005681/1","fundValue":"75458","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  They haven't yet as the project isn't finished yet.
