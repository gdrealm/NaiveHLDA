The importance of shape, size and surface chemistry has been recognised in determining distribution and potential toxicity. We wish to study the effect in fish of a subset of nanomaterials (fullerenes or buckyballs) that are produced in several tons per year. It has been reported that fullerenes cause toxicity (oxidative stress) particularly in the brain of exposed fish, however the evidence is not clear and there are other potential effects that may not have been detected. Therefore, to understand such effects it is particularly important to assess the generic health status of exposed tissues using an 'open' technology (genomics) rather than focusing on any one parameter or process. Moreover, we need to know if physicochemical parameters (e.g. size , aggregate structure and surface modifications) of agents such as the fullerenes can alter responses in organisms. This application is for a small exploratory study to establish the biological response of stickleback fish to fullerenes presented to fish in different structural formats and , through pilot studies, to establish organ-specific changes in gene expression as indicators of disturbance of processes in the body associated with oxidative stress or with other (as yet unrecognized) biological processes through analysis of the changes in the genes being expressed. This small application fits the remit of the Environmental Nanoscience Initiative (ENI) as it considers the comparative generic environmental risk of model nanomaterials presented to water in different formats. The study is interdisciplinary bringing together toxicology and genomic approaches, collaboration with a chemist involved in nanoparticles research and linking to the Environment Agency","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E014836/1","grantId":"NE/E014836/1","fundValue":"28827","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Findings have contributed to the ongoing development of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) in toxicity assessment and environmental pollution monitoring Chemicals,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Societal,Policy & public services","person":"J Kevin Chipman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" A summary of findings was reported at the end of the grant award and there are no new findings the work is being progressed in the form of the use of adverse outcome pathways for toxicity assessment with implications for end users in compound development and in environmental monitoring.
