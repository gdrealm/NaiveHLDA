Taking account of issues arising, a training day will be offered to Music Leaders from the nine areas to equip them with the skills to continue a regional CPD offer in the long term.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J001120/1","grantId":"ES/J001120/1","fundValue":"99933","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Hallam","coPersons":["Andrea Rebecca Creech"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
