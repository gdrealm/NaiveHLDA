Typically, it featured a text of twelve or more verses, several simple 'woodcut' illustrations and the name of a suggested melody. The pictures and tunes were frequently well-known already, having been 'recycled' from previous songs. Ballads were the pop songs of their day and it can be convincingly argued that the modern music industry - commercially driven and predominantly urban - has its roots among the publishers of broadsides in seventeenth-century London. In terms of the subject matter of balladry, love led the way, but there were also songs about religion, politics, sensational happenings, heroic adventures and terrible crimes.\n Our research will identify, contextualise and publish online an authoritative sample of seventeenth-century England's best-selling ballads. New musical recordings will be commissioned from the acclaimed Carnival Band. In addition to a core of 100 songs, we will include the following: images of the ballads in later editions and versions of the songs drawn from manuscript sources, printed songbooks and later folk song collections; information about other ballads that were closely related to the core songs in terms of their texts, tunes or pictures; transcripts of all the song texts in modern type; a range of supporting information - bibliographical and contextual - that should help users to interpret the ballads; and links to other on-line ballad resources. All in all, the site will include 500 images of the selected ballads (some of the ballads were printed in two parts and will therefore require two separate images), 100 recordings and extensive supporting information prepared in collaboration by the academic participants. In effect, the website will display full scholarly editions of these ballads in an electronic format appropriate to the twenty-first century. Other outputs will include co-authored scholarly articles and conference papers, a PhD thesis and two public concerts.\n Historians of all sorts are increasingly making use of ballads in their work, though they tend to concentrate on the texts to the relative neglect of the tunes and the pictures. The current project aims to encourage a more rounded interpretation of balladry by presenting newly-commissioned recordings and high-quality images of the original songs. Scholars are also in the habit of quoting ballads somewhat uncritically as they seek lively evidence to support arguments on other topics. The new website, by identifying a sample of the most successful songs, will demonstrate the value of distinguishing between ballads on the basis of their seventeenth-century impact. Obviously, ballads that enjoyed commercial success are likely to have been more reflective of popular tastes than those that failed to impress on such a scale. In these and other ways, the project will make a contribution to the debates that are currently taking place among historians and literary scholars about broadside balladry and its wider cultural significance. \n The website is not intended, however, to be useful only to professional academics. Access to the resource will be free, and it is hoped that this will facilitate its use by a wider audience (including musicians, lovers of 'early music', radio and TV producers, and history students at school and university). The aspiration to broad relevance is reflected in the fact that the project will involve collaboration not only among academics but between them and a group of musicians. Towards the end of the the 3-year period, a concert programme will be performed on two occasions and in two different locations. It is hoped that this will help to publicise the venture well beyond academic circles.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K003100/1","grantId":"AH/K003100/1","fundValue":"252054","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Marsh","coPersons":["Angela June McShane","Victor Arthur Gammon"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
