One in ten people every year and one in three in their lifetime use, and usually pay out of pocket, for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the UK. Research into CAM is growing, especially studies that look at why patients use it and the effectiveness of individual treatments. However, we know surprisingly little about the practitioners of these types of therapy. It is important to understand more about the knowledge and skills that underpin this kind of healthcare, and how practitioners attempt to ensure the safety and quality of their practice, especially because most complementary therapists work independently rather than having established career structures like doctors, nurses or midwives. The researcher will recruit graduates from CAM training courses to explore their careers and professional development. The study will involve interviewing practitioners about their experience, and observing them in their daily working lives to enable real events to spark off detailed discussions about how they deal with the realities of daily practice.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J002828/1","grantId":"ES/J002828/1","fundValue":"79913","fundStart":"2012-03-19","fundEnd":"2014-07-21","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This report is due in 12 months time.\n\nTo date there have been three main impacts reported by non-academic stakeholders that participated in the dissemination activities for the study:\n- Educational providers - Making changes to the curriculum of undergraduate courses to reflect the need to prepare students for the business side of practice and for the realities of the transition stage.\n- Individual practitioners - Reflections on own practice, aspirations and identity.\n- Profession in general - Implications of this for regulation (such as advanced practice registers) and professional organisations (such as support for new graduates).

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) retains a small but enduring position in most healthcare systems. Researchers have looked in depth at why patients choose CAM, but much less is known about the practitioners of CAM, such as their aspirations and their experiences. In the absence of the established careers paths that are seen in other healthcare professions (like nursing, midwifery or medicine), the study sought to understand how new graduates managed the transition to practice, built their professional networks and were able to build a successful practice. The research used an innovative multi-method approach using narrative interviews and observations of clinical practice then reflective interviews 12 months later to discuss emerging findings.\nThe main three findings were:\n1) The need to acknowledge that there is a transition phase\nMany graduates assumed that the biggest hurdle was getting their qualification to practice and that once they had it they would be able to build a busy practice. However, they found that in reality, there was a lot more to learn and that it could take many months or years to achieve the idea of a 'successful' practice they had hoped for. The biggest challenge in this phase was to understand that being in practice is also about building a business. Most graduates felt well prepared from their education for the technical and communicative aspects of practice (i.e. what happen in the consultation room), but poorly prepared for the business aspects (i.e. what happens outside the consultation room). \n2) There are tensions in professional identity that have an impact on the transition\nMany CAM practitioners consider their career as vocational and there are tensions around their working conditions. On the one hand, as independent private practitioners in a capitalist society, they are required to be entrepreneurial in their approach and embrace the business side of practice, but many have chosen their career to 'opt out' of conventional employment arrangements so sometimes they experience ambivalence about having to make money as a private practitioner within a capitalist economy. \n3) Graduates need to get support and participate in communities of practice\nBeing an independent practitioner can be isolating, so practitioners found that seeking support is vital to building a personally and financially sustainable practice. New graduates who were successful in building their practice found support in a variety of ways. They often got practical and emotional support from friends and family. They got support for developing their knowledge from professional groups - both online and in person - or from discussions with and observation of close working colleagues. Crucially, they received support from just a few 'like-minded' people who enabled them to think critically and reflectively about their practice. Although some described their practice as inherently isolating because of working alone, some described ways in which they were able to participate in communities of practice, both at a local level through multi-therapy clinics or peer mentoring groups, or at a profession-wide level through professional associations and journals. Academic: This research has collected previously undocumented empirical data on: the reasons that practitioners chose their careers, their expectations, their training experience, their transition to practice and their experiences of being established practitioners. In the field of the sociology of health and illness, the research makes original theoretical links to theories of social networks, and explores the extent to which CAM practitioners are able to develop communities of practice (CoPs). CoPs have been closely linked with questions of the quality and safety of healthcare practice so there is much potential for future work in this area. In the field of the sociology of work and employment, the research makes theoretical links to the concepts and techniques of entrepreneurialism explaining why these are such a source of tension for CAM practitioners. I have also published recommendations about the future of sociological research on CAM (Gale 2014, see publications).\nIn addition to these contributions to sociological research, I've made interdisciplinary connections too and am publishing an international and interdisciplinary book (Gale, McHale 2015, see publications). The primary argument of the book was that the current popular and policy debates are 'stuck' in a polarized and largely asocial discourse, and that an interdisciplinary social science (law, sociology, history, ethics) perspective seeking to introduce nuance and theorize diversity in the field, provides a much more robust interdisciplinary evidence base for policy and practice in the field.\nNon-academic: This work has been undertaken in collaboration with professional and patient representatives from the CAM community. This has ensured that changes have been made during the lifetime of the project to the curriculum of collaborating educational institutions (homeopathy and osteopathy), to the practice of individual practitioners (in a range of CAM therapies) and at the profession-wide level (in osteopathy). As I indicated I would do in my original application, I have prepared a briefing paper (reporting the research in lay terms and with a 'summary and key findings' section at the beginning) and sent it to key stakeholders. Electronic copies of this briefing paper are to be made available online and circulated more widely. A feedback form has been sent to each stakeholder requesting their views on how useful it is and whether they foresee it changing their policies or practice (as relevant). The findings from this will be reported in the 12 month narrative impact report. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
