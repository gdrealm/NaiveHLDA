The overall aim was to examine the relationship of social environmental factors with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) in midlife and older adults. The study represents secondary analyses of two large English longitudinal datasets (the Whitehall II, ELSA). The results showed that chronic exposure to negative aspects of close relationships can increase the risk of weight gain, measured by increased BMI and WC. Moreover, we found that high confiding/emotional and practical support may help the individual to maintain the recommended level of LTPA. However, only practical support was associated with an improvement in LTPA levels. Our results thus suggest that high social support and stable, nurturing relationships with low levels of conflicts and stress might help the individual to some extent to prevent weight and keep physically active. We further found that in older adults, social participation in education, arts or music groups, or evening classes, and in charitable associations was associated with maintaining recommended WC in those men whose WC was in the recommended range at baseline. Participation in social activities was not associated with achieving recommended WC in women or men with initially large waist. Non-academic groups that have been interested in the study include public health professionals, policymakers, journalists, and the general public. The project has enhanced research knowledge in the area of social environment and obesity and the findings have implications for public policy and clinical practice. Awareness of the importance of stable, nurturing relationships might help individuals when aiming to keep physically active and prevent weight gain. In health promotion programmes it would be important take the individualâ€™s social relationships into account. However, future research is needed to investigate whether interventions designed to improve social relationships could actually decrease the risk of weight gain and obesity, and increase LTPA. The present results further suggest that aspects of social participation may be a potential additional component to be integrated in weight management interventions in older adults, although it is important not to ignore the possibility that in some participant groups social participation was not associated with an increased likelihood of maintaining or achieving healthy weight. The project has made a demonstrable and novel contribution to the disciplines of health psychology, medical sociology, public health, and social epidemiology; both nationally and internationally. The study has significantly advanced empirical understanding and enhanced knowledge by clarifying the possible mechanisms linking social environmental factors, such as social support and negative aspects of close relationships, to health outcomes. The study contributed to the theories of social support and individual social capital. Scientific impact was additionally achieved through building new international cross-disciplinary collaborative networks. In addition, the findings have been built into teaching of postgraduate psychology students and undergraduate social science students. Scientific impact was achieved through three peer-reviewed articles in prestigious high-impact international journals, 2 international conference presentations, a presentation in a national conference, and 3 research seminar presentations.
