It will explore the relationship between academic authors and their practice, and, in particular, the emotional, institutional and intellectual relations that contribute to the production and interpretation of knowledge within higher education.</p>\n\n<p>Participants will be invited to take part in a series of up to eight interviews. Prior to each of these interviews participants will be asked to select a text that in some way represents their disciplinary interests. In the interviews participants will be asked to reflect on their choice of text, their experience of reading/writing the text and their thoughts and feelings about it. </p>\n\n<p>Within this study the interviews are understood as a space where the participant and researcher will work together to construct an interpretation of the relationship between the participant and their disciplinary practice. Initial interpretations will be shared, developed and refined as the study progresses.</p>\n\n<p>The main aim of the study is to enhance current understandings of the ways in which knowledge is produced and reproduced within higher education and to develop a rigorous and sensitive methodology to explore aspects of these processes that have been overlooked in previous studies.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G002266/1","grantId":"ES/G002266/1","fundValue":"86802","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Claudia  Lapping","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
