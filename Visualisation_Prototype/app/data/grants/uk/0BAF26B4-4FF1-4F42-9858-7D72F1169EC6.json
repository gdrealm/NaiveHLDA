In this project we will consider three related research issues that need addressing to support and strengthen existing research on complex random effect models. These three issues are sample size calculation, efficiency of estimation algorithms and model identifiably.</p> \n<p>Sample size calculation involves estimating how much data should be collected to answer particular quantitative research questions. Here we will aim to consider such calculations when the underlying data structure is complicated by dependencies within the data. We will consider a simulation-based strategy where many datasets similar to that which the user intends collecting are generated. These simulated datasets are then used to decide the appropriateness of particular sample sizes. </p> \n<p>Such a simulation-based approach is computationally intensive and involves fitting a statistical model to each simulated dataset. It is therefore paramount to use efficient estimation algorithms in the fitting stage of our approach. We will often need to use a family of estimation methods called MCMC methods to fit our models. The second part of our project will therefore investigate and supplement existing research on efficient MCMC algorithms for complex random effect models. </p> \n<p>Finally the project will consider the issue of model identifiability. Here we will consider whether the structure of a dataset will actually allow particular models to be fitted.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1190","grantId":"RES-000-23-1190","fundValue":"67077","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"William John Browne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
