Utilizing the resonant properties -field enhancement and spectral sensitivity- of Surface Plasmons Polaritons (SPPs) is generally thought to represent a practical avenue to achieving this objective. \nHowever, our ability to control and manipulate light at this scale dynamically -i.e. to produce active functionalities- and in real-time through low-energy external control signals is a missing link in our aim to develop a fully integrated sub-wavelength optical platform. To date, active plasmonic systems, including thermo- and electro-optic media, quantum dots, and photochromic molecules, are achieving sensitive progress in switching and modulation applications. However, high switching times (&gt;nanosecond) or the need for relatively strong control energy (~microJ/cm^2) to observe sensible signal modulation (35% to 80%), limit the practical use of such structures as signal processing or other active opto-electronic nanodevices.\nIn this context, this research aims to assess the potential for defects to enhance the non-linear optical properties of hybrid plasmonic crystals. The objective is to integrate defects, made of plasmonic cavities, in plasmonic crystals to create a focal point for electromagnetic energy stored in surface plasmon waves at the crystal's interfaces. The role of the defect is then to transfer this energy to a neighbouring non-linear material in order to change its optical properties at the femtosecond timescale, thus creating an active functionality. This research, largely based on ultrafast time-resolved near-field optical microscopy, is also expected to enhance our understanding of ultrafast energy transfers at the nanoscale- a critical expertise in designing nanodevices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J015393/1","grantId":"EP/J015393/1","fundValue":"375131","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The work performed in the project has lead to the discovery and development of integrated optical functionalities resulting in intellectual property.
