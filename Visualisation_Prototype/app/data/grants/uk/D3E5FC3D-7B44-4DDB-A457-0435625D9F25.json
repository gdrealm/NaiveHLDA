{"id":"D3E5FC3D-7B44-4DDB-A457-0435625D9F25","title":"Pedagogy and Curriculum in Early Reading: Multidisciplinary Perspectives","abstractText":"<p>The seminar series on multidisciplinary perspectives on reading will bring together researchers, practitioners and policymakers to further the aim of building bridges across reading research disciplines. Pedagogy in early childhood will be a central theme in that the aim ultimately is to help educators and policymakers draw on the full evidential base when making decisions about the development of reading in schools, especially for those learners who are currently not achieving their full potential. A key question for the group will be: how do we integrate and balance the teaching of phonics, comprehension and literature while not denying the changing nature of reading itself? The seminar series will link diverse reading researchers and encourage discussion of their findings in a wider audience of users. A theme permeating all seminars will be the epistemological frameworks underlying the various research methodologies adopted by reading researchers. Six seminars will be held during the 22 month period, starting in October 2006. By sharing their findings in the seminars, participants will have the opportunity to deepen and broaden their understanding of theoretical issues, policies and educational practice as well as to encourage cross-fertilisation and new insights to support, in turn, fresh lines of pedagogic enquiry.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4234","grantId":"RES-451-25-4234","fundValue":"14495","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kathy  Hall","coPersons":["Janet  Soler","Colin  Harrison","Sue  Ellis","Usha  Goswami"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
