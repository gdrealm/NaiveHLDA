Applications include anomalous ion transport in dendrites, spread of epidemics and cancer cells, electrochemical processes in solid oxide fuel cells, dispersion of human or animal groups, complex chemical reactions and contaminant transport. The proposed research has a potential economic impact for chemical and nuclear industries where traditional approaches based on reaction-diffusion models are used. The aim of this project is to establish dialogues between applied mathematicians, engineers from chemical and nuclear industries, neurophysiologists, computational neuroscientists and cell biologists. In order to ensure that they can benefit and to communicate our findings to a wide audience we intend to publish papers in relevant journals. We expect that this project will allow applied mathematicians and researchers in neurobiology and cell biology to collaborate and thus to be able to make significant advances in the areas of anomalous transport within biological systems. Collaboration with neurobiologists and experts in cell biology (Project Partners) has a potential social impact in enhancing quality of life and health. Collaboration with Dr. Santamaria from Neuroscience Institute at The University of Texas at San Antonio, USA will aim at understanding how subdiffusion in spiny dendrites regulates synaptic plasticity that underlines learning and memory. We will provide a new anomalous transport theory and the Project Partner will contribute experiments in measuring subdiffusion in Purkinje and hippocampal pyramidal cells. Collaboration with our Project Partner Dr. Chauviere from Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, USA will aim at providing a new theoretical tool that can be potentially used in designing new therapies to control cancer cell invasion. Clinical interventions aim at retarding malignant invasion by applying chemotherapeutic drugs that increase the death rate of the cells or reduce cell motility. Our mathematical models can provide important insights into the relationship between the death rate and anomalous motility. The research project will have a realistic impact by contributing scientific knowledge and new ideas in multidisciplinary area of anomalous transport-reaction systems and extending UK research expertise into this new area of mathematics. We intend to develop innovative methodologies for fractional partial differential equations and raise awareness of the importance of these equations in industries and academia. This project will foster international research collaborations with the USA and Spain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J019526/1","grantId":"EP/J019526/1","fundValue":"291257","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sergei  Fedotov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" We have developed a new fractional Fokker-Planck equation\nthat describes the cell's motility and signalling molecules in dendrites. new mathematical tools for the analysis of anomalous transport Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
