The aim of this research visit to Hong Kong University of Science and Technology is to work, in collaboration with the group of Prof. Bertam Shi, on assessing the feasibility of a number of approaches to brain-inspired computation with respect to their implementability in present-day and emerging integrated circuit technologies. Based on the shared experiences and expertise in this area, through extensive study of existing models, literature reviews, requirements analysis and exploratory designs, we will identify the most promising approaches that will be taken further in future research projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G035806/1","grantId":"EP/G035806/1","fundValue":"33459","fundStart":"2009-01-12","fundEnd":"2010-02-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"P  Dudek","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
