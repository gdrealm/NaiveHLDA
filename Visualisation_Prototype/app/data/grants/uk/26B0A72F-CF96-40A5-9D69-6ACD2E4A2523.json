This overall aim was achieved through the following specific objectives:\n\n* Objective 1: To identify partnerships under the research areas of interest identified by the Brazilian Science Without Borders Programme. \n* Objective 2: To finalize strategic plans to collaborate between UK and Brazilian scientists in future BBSRC (UK) and CNPq (Brazil) research programme calls (post ISIS support). \n* Objective 3: To promote exchange of experience between administrators of UK and Brazil research institutions, particularly in relation to their interaction with stakeholders and interested parties.\n\nThe outcome was as follows:\n\nObjective 1: Priority areas for research were identified and discussed in 5 workshop discussion groups, exploring collaborative opportunities between Brazil and UK institutions: 1) animal health; 2) animal genetics; 3) climate change and sustainable production; 4) animal welfare and 5) training, education and capacity building. Detailed information and action points are available on request (full report). \n \nObjective 2: Specific teams identified for these 5 areas developed topics for future grant proposals. For example, group 4 aims to develop proposals on pre-natal and early-postnatal programming with a focus on animal welfare, health and production impacts. \n \nObjective 3: UK delegates and Brazilian administrators met intensively during the workshop. Key Brazilian stakeholders were invited for a reception hosted at the Embrapa headquarters, followed by a business dinner. Further interactions are planned starting with a visit from Embrapa representatives to the EBRC in August, 2012. The collaboration initiated during the workshop will be taken forward through exploring joint grant submissions, continuing visits from Brazilian researchers to the UK and vice versa, and through development of networks in areas of interest. This includes facilitating researcher and student exchange visits between Brazil and UK, including to work at SAC using methodologies and capacities developed under the ISIS linked grant (Identification, investigation and implementation of plant-based parasite control strategies; BB/H009299/1), and a joint BBSRC grant application between UK and Brazil research teams for the 26 September 2012 deadline.
