These included: international students and their representatives, both as advocates and as researchers; academics conducting research in this area; academics involved in planning educational provision for international students; teaching and learning leaders in universities; international officers at universities; and government and other official bodies promoting the internationalisation of UK higher education. Four seminars were held between September 2008 and September 2009, covering the conceptual and research basis for internationalisation, evidence on the student experience, promising practices in universities, and an international comparative exploration of government policy as ‘context, enabling factor and constraint'.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0609","grantId":"RES-451-26-0609","fundValue":"8171","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michele  Schweisfurth","coPersons":["John Anthony Lowe","Christopher  Day","Trevor  Grimshaw","Qing  Gu","Clive  Harber"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
