A popular variant is high performance liquid chromatography, where the sample is introduced into a liquid stream (the &quot;mobile phase&quot;) and passed through a column containing particles of the separation medium (the &quot;stationary phase&quot;). If these particles are made smaller, then the separations improve and they can be accomplished in minutes or even seconds, rather than hours or days. Small particles however, require high pressures to force the liquid through, hence the term high performance (or high pressure) liquid chromatography (HPLC). A detector situated at the end of the column senses the separated chemicals and allows them to be quantified. The annual world market for instruments and consumables in HPLC is several billion dollars; tens of thousands of analyses are carried out daily in the UK alone. Thus, faster and more efficient variations of the technique are continually being sought. One of these is hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), a technique that has significant advantages over the commonly used separation procedure (reversed-phase, RP), particularly for the fast analysis of drugs and compounds of clinical significance. Many of these compounds have only weak interactions with the usual RP columns and thus give poor separations. However, the mechanism of HILIC is poorly understood, which makes it difficult to design the separation conditions. Some separations seem to work very well, whereas others do not, for no apparent reason. The aim of this research is to elucidate the principles of the HILIC separation mechanism and to elucidate the experimental parameters that are most influential on the separation. This knowledge will be used to develop a &quot;tool box&quot; approach to apply the technique to separations that have proved difficult by conventional techniques. The idea is to apply an automated series of HILIC separations using different experimental conditions that generate different selectivity, such that an optimum for the analysis can be chosen. The study is of particular importance to the pharmaceutical industry especially in connection with new methods of drug design, such as &quot;fragment based drug discovery&quot; which involve synthesis of more complex structures using small building blocks each containing some desirable property of the final compound. Many of these building blocks are small polar molecules that should be very well suited to the HILIC technique. All pharmaceuticals need to be carefully screened for the presence of impurities, that may give rise to undesirable physiological side effects. HILIC can be used for example to assess the presence of residues of these polar starting materials in the final product. HILIC appears less susceptible to &quot;overload&quot;, a phenomenon where distortion of the separation takes place when larger amounts of material are analysed. Overload can cause interference between large peaks of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and small quantities of impurities.\nThe proposed work will require the development of a mixture of compounds of different structure that can be used to probe the various contributions to retention in HILIC. While the HILIC technique is very simple in practice, it appears that there are many complex factors which contribute to the separations. For example, many important pharmaceuticals, drugs of abuse, and compounds of biomedical significance are charged species, which adds an extra dimension of complexity to the separation mechanism. Understanding the importance of these various contributions will allow separations to be designed which can fully exploit the useful differences between HILIC and conventional separation methods.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J016578/1","grantId":"EP/J016578/1","fundValue":"151902","fundStart":"2012-10-29","fundEnd":"2014-10-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We studied the mechanism of hydrophilic interaction chromatography, and have shown how the separations can be manipulated to give the optimum performance. We have worked closely with the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline to implement these findings such that they have additional screening methods for determining (in particular) polar impurities in their products. It is a regulatory requirement that impurities should be present at levels of less than 0.1% (or 0.05 %) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Some of our methods have already been implemented by GlaxoSmithKline in routine procedures. We have also transferred some of our methodology to the Antibiotics Reference Laboratory in Bristol, giving rise to improved methods for the analysis of these substances. Many antibiotics are polar compounds much more suited to hydrophilic interaction chromatography than reversed-phase techniques. Our methods are being used to determine circulating levels of these compounds in body fluids. The more theoretical aspects of our work have also allowed a greater understanding of this technique in the general research community. There is much interest in the technique as evidenced by the considerable number of invited lectures delivered nationally and internationally by the Principal Investigator over the period of the funding.

We identified those experimental parameters that influence the separation, and applied these changes in a &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;tool box&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; approach to find the optimum method. We have studied the potential speed of analysis of this new technique, and compared it with existing techniques. Results of our work have been implemented in the analytical laboratories of the pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline. HILIC has great potential for the analysis of compounds of biomedical importance. In particular, we have applied the technique to develop new and improved methods for the analysis of antibiotics, to assess circulating levels for efficacy and potential toxicity. This work has been carried out in conjunction with the Antibiotics Reference Laboratory in Bristol. Our findings give clear indications of the pathways that should be taken in developing separation methods in hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) that give alternative selectivity to traditional techniques, especially when the separation of polar molecules is considered. The results of this study, which recommends alternative conditions for the systematic separation of impurities in pharmaceuticals, when traditional reversed-phase methods fail, have already been implemented by GlaxoSmithKline. HILIC is also a very useful method for monitoring the circulating levels of antiobiotics in biological fluids. Monitoring is necessary because it is important that these levels are efficacious, without giving rise to toxic side effects. Some of our developed methodology is already in use at the Antiobiotics reference laboratory in Bristol, which is a national resource.
