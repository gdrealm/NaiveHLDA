There are clear advantages to this process from the regulatory perspective - an admission of wrongdoing, court enforcement, addressing of deficiencies and acceptance of external monitoring. From the corporate perspective there is a shield in place against further action and on-going negative publicity. The research seeks to demonstrate how and why this mechanism developed. It looks at how it has impacted on corporate governance reform, organizational structure and the theoretical underpinnings of corporate law. Further the research seeks to examine the appropriate parameters of this sort of device.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1957","grantId":"RES-000-22-1957","fundValue":"77920","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sally  Wheeler","coPersons":["K  McEvoy"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" The primary purpose of this funding was to find out more about how the deferred prosecution system for violation of SEC rules was being used in the US and explore its potential.\nThe system has now been adopted in the UK as part of the bribery legislation. Government seems to have ruled out further adoption of deferred prosecution but given its desire to change &quot;banking forever&quot; in both cultural and business practice terms it would do well to think of this again.
