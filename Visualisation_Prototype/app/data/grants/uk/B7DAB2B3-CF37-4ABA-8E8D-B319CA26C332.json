In many fields, the dangers of infection by pathogens, for example anthrax, need to be faced and there are major challenges with existing techniques in quickly assessing the danger so that rapid public safety responses are possible . Current techniques may be slow, expensive or need trained people and specialised laboratories. We want to devise a detection technique based on accurate measurement of a number of physical characteristics of bacteria that will allow differentiation of even similar strains so that the true pathogens can be clearly identified. This is a difficult challenge and further, we aim to show in our proof of principle, that it will be possible to design a detector that is low cost, reasonably portable and can work autonomously i.e. without continuous human intervention. Success would then encourage the development and deployment of this remote monitoring technology in critical public spaces, for example large public events and hospitals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K006088/1","grantId":"EP/K006088/1","fundValue":"645304","fundStart":"2013-01-21","fundEnd":"2016-01-20","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Maguire","coPersons":["Davide  Mariotti","David Andrews McDowell"],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
