It uses a circuit similar to that used for kidney dialysis. Liver cells have to be especially conditioned to carry out these tasks, which takes several days to achieve. As serious liver failure can develop rapidly, and often without warning, the bioartificial liver machine must be ready for &quot;off the shelf&quot; delivery to the clinic. This can only be achieved by frozen storage of the liver cells in sufficient numbers at very cold\ntemperatures (eg minus 150C).\n\nThe aim of our present work is to develop a new machine which can freeze large volumes and numbers of cells (eg about 1.5 litre) in a controlled fashion, so they can survive these very cold temperatures. Another important point is that the new cooling machine can be powered directly from mains electricity and thus does not\ndepend on the use of cold liquid gases, mainly liquid nitrogen, which are no longer considered safe to use for these purposes. These liquid gases are not sterile and may cause significant infection in materials which contact the patient. Thus on two counts (successful cooling of sensitive liver cells and avoidance of infection) this new equipment will be a great improvement on the current technology, and make the UK a leader in this field of science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K500720/1","grantId":"MR/K500720/1","fundValue":"205429","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Clare  Selden","coPersons":["Barry James Fuller"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
