{"id":"C5105BA0-7399-424F-A427-DC190A1BE94C","title":"Quantum-degenerate dipolar gases of bialkali molecules","abstractText":"At very low temperatures, matter enters a new regime where its properties are fully quantum-mechanical. Such quantum matter is very precisely controllable and offers many new properties that are likely to form the basis of future technologies. The EuroQUAM Programme is a EUROCORES Programme coordinated by the European Science Foundation to develop European research in Cold Quantum Matter. This proposal is part of the QuDipMol Collaborative Research Proposal, which brings together five experimental groups (Innsbruck, Freiburg, Firenze/Pisa, Durham and Hannover) and four theory groups (Durham, Orsay, Prague, Innsbruck). QuDipMol aims to form a quantum gas of polar (heteronuclear) alkali metal dimers. The molecules will be formed in traps containing mixed ultracold gases of two different alkali metal atoms, both by photoassociation and magnetic tuning through Feshbach resonances. Methods will be developed to increase the rate of formation and the density of the polar molecules. The Durham experimental group will work to create polar molecules using ultracold atomic gases of rubidium and caesium. This mixture is particularly attractive due to the unique nature of the interatomic collisions for these species, which should provide a means to manipulate the properties of the atomic mixture in order to make the molecule production more favourable.A major problem along the way is that the molecules may be destroyed (or lost from the trap) because of collisions with atoms or other molecules. It is important to understand these collisions, both to work around them during the formation of the molecules and to control the resulting polar quantum gas. The Durham theory group will work to achieve the necessary understanding by developing potential energy surfaces for the systems of interest and carrying out quantum-mechanical reactive scattering calculations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E041604/1","grantId":"EP/E041604/1","fundValue":"351148","fundStart":"2007-09-07","fundEnd":"2011-09-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings from this grant have underpinned much further work on the production of ultracold molecules from ultracold atoms. The experimental groups in Innsbruck (Naegerl) and Durham (Cornish) have both recently succeeded in producing ultracold polar RbCs molecules in their absolute ground state. Such molecules will be used to explore novel phases of matter and may form the basis of future devices in quantum simulation and quantum information processing.

Major achievements included \n- the development of new ways to calculate near-threshold bound states of ultracold molecules (usedin much subsequent research)\n- understanding the hyperfine levels of ultracold alkali-metal dimers\n- predicting a new mechanicsm for forming ultracold molecules from alkali-metal atoms paired with closed-shell atoms\n- understanding which of the possible ultracold alkali-metal dimers will be stable to all possible 2-body collisions The work under this grant has been used in many subsequent studies of polar ultracold molecules, including studies of KRb in Boulder, RbCs in Innsbruck and Durham, and work aimed at forming RbSr in Innsbruck (Schreck), LiYb (Washington (Gupta) and Kyoto (Takahashi)) and RbYb (Duesseldorf (Goerlitz)).
