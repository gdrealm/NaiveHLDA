{"id":"B078DC2E-2FFC-404B-9B70-CEC6DC3D9AC2","title":"FARMERS- Farm and Rural Energy from Renewable Sources","abstractText":"The Farming and Rural Mixed Energy from Renewable Sources project (FARMERS) explores the feasibility of using\nintegrated energy systems to lessen energy costs of rural communities (relative to urban ones). It will research adaptation\nof methods to optimise the use of energy in farms and rural communities, reduce CO2 emissions by using renewables and\nbiomass CHP instead of fossil fuels, with energy storage to control and balance loads on rural distribution networks, saving\ncostly reinforcement for high loads from farm processes, electric vehicles or large intermittent renewable feeds and enable\ngreater use of renewable generation around rural communities. FARMERS will use renewable generation at Harper Adams\nUniversity and in local properties to test, adapt and demonstrate optimisation software models, hardware implementation,\nto identify solutions for farmers and rural communities to install and integrate renewables while using local energy storage\nto balance energy use and optimise the value of energy to rural communities. FARMERS will deliver optimisation models,\nsystems guidelines for rural energy networks and establish business cases, consultancy and models for widespread\nreplication.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508597/1","grantId":"EP/N508597/1","fundValue":"89888","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sven  Peets","coPersons":["Daniel  May"],"organisation":"Harper Adams University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
