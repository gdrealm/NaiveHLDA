The five subject areas covered were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>‘From child-rearing to ‘parenting’: what’s new about contemporary parenting culture?’;</li>\n\n <li>‘Gender and parenting culture: Intensive fatherhood?’;</li>\n\n <li>‘Child-rearing in a risk society’;</li>\n\n <li>‘Changing Parenting Culture: the problems of parenting policy’; and</li>\n\n <li>‘Pregnancy and pregnancy planning in the new parenting culture’.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The overall aim of the series was to explore the way that the cultural meaning of ‘parenting’ has expanded and how it has become an object of expertise and policymaking. Through a series of conversations we hoped to discuss the history and sociology of this development, and its effects for parents’ experience and for the workings of specific child-rearing related activities. The series was a great success. The events brought together in a very powerful way detailed study of particular aspects of the contemporary experience of parenting including TV parenting programmes, feeding babies, family planning, and outdoor play, with a wider socio-cultural analysis of the history and contemporary features of parenting culture. Overall the series attracted a diverse group of people, stretching beyond academic colleagues, as research users of a variety of kinds participated as panellists and attended events.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0538","grantId":"RES-451-26-0538","fundValue":"17324","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ellie  Lee","coPersons":["Charlotte Rosemary Faircloth","Frank  Furedi"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
