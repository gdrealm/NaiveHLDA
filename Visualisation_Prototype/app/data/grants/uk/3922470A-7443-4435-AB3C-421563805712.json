It explores how the culture of moral sentiment, despite ostensibly representing a sphere inimical to the concerns of political economy, worked in ways analogous to, and involved with, economic processes. The research contributes to the critical, historical, and cultural materialist understanding of the development of a modern humanitarian sensibility in relation to the political and economic reconfiguration of the British Empire. \\n\\nThe research focuses on inter-related themes central to the representation of slavery: the disruptive nature of suffering, the idea of social injustice, and ideas of compensation and reparation. These sentimentalised themes, and their complex representation, emerge in relation to new, historically specific, conceptions of subjectivity: conceptions based on circuits of reciprocity rather than sovereignty which are developed in a context of violence done to global peoples. The project argues that the obsession with forms of corporealised identity commonly associated with the 'cult of sentiment' is related to the circulation of affect that emerges from the proximity of the triangular traffic. It contributes to current critical and postcolonial reflections concerning the ways in which the legacy of Atlantic slavery has been constructed and understood. \\n\\nThe project examines a range of discursive contexts that mark key moments across the period. The interdisciplinary concerns of the study broach those normative modes of enquiry that separate the study of culture and representation from the realm of economics to offer an analysis of cultural representations grounded in the social and economic conditions of their production. The exploration of specific issues and their related moments within the history of abolition provides a method for illuminating the broader ideological and economic processes that informed the campaigns.\\n\\nThe project has four central chapters. The first focuses on the development of classical political economy in relation to moral philosophy, a conjunction commonly associated with Adam Smith and others of the Scottish Enlightenment (1750-1780). It sets this analysis within these writers' commitment to analysing the consequences of commercial progress for civil life. It charts the ways in which the first formal abolition campaigns took up these arguments. The second examines the conjunction of sentiment and economics via the marine insurance scandal concerning the massacres aboard the Liverpool slave ship, the Zong (1783). Publicity surrounding the trial is often credited with having motivated the abolition campaigns. By the 1780s, insurance was a key instrument in the promotion of a civilised commercial sociality. As the trial illustrates, the civility of 'mutual interest' could not hide the fact that the question of the definition of slaves as persons or as commodities was at issue. The third focuses on West Indian planter anxiety concerning slave labour in the colonies (1790-1825) setting it within changing labour and production strategies in the West Indies. In this context, indebted planters, as well as abolitionists, favoured amelioration and reform. The final chapter examines this issue in a metropolitan register: the development of ethical consumption and free trade debates in the early nineteenth century (1815-1838). It examines the transatlantic activities of abolitionist, James Cropper, whose venture capitalism exploited notions of moral sentiment and progressive political economy. The project concludes by examining the politics and economics of 'sympathy' in the light of this historical research, and of contemporary postcolonial re-readings of the period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E003192/1","grantId":"AH/E003192/1","fundValue":"18104","fundStart":"2007-09-24","fundEnd":"2007-12-23","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anita Jacqueline Rupprecht","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
