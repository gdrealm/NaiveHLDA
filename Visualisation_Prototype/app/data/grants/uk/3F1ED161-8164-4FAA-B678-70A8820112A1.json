SML has previously talked to school children (ranging in age from 5-18 years) about how structures can help us learn about the viruses and bacteria that make us ill. This work would be likely to generate results that would be accessible for the general public and we would therefore seek to take up all possible opportunities to interact with and inform the general public. We have recent experience in preparing exhibits for an ?Art of Science? exhibition held in Oxford and found that illustrations based on atomic coordinates derived from pathogens provoked particularly lively debate in the wide audience drawn to such an event.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400389","grantId":"G0400389","fundValue":"193769","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan M.
