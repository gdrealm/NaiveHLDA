For the past 7 years we have investigated genetic factors in human obesity, largely focusing on the analysis of children with very severe obesity. Many of these children are so massively obese that their health is immediately threatened. In a cohort of over 1000 children we identified the first single gene disorders causing human obesity, and have, thus far, identified four previously unrecognised single gene disorders. In one condition that we described, called congenital leptin deficiency, we have been able to show the dramatically beneficial effects of recombinant leptin therapy. We are now studying the effects of this therapy in 5 children, all of whom are shown rapid and sustained weight loss. We now request support to continue this highly successful programme for a further 5 years. During this time we propose \na) To increase the scope and speed of our genetic studies in severe childhood obesity\nb) To continue to work out why particular mutations in particular genes cause the precise sorts of problems they do by studying both the biochemical properties of the mutant proteins in the test tube and by studying the humans carrying these mutations in great detail in our clinical laboratory. A particular, early focus will be on mutations in the neurotrophin receptor TrkB, a gene in which we have recently found mutations causing human obesity \nc) To begin to pay more attention to the genetic factors involved of more common forms of obesity \nd) When we find a new genetic disease in a human, we often cannot do all we would like to, to understand the link between the mutation and the patient?s problem. This is often because we cannot get ready access to the tissue in which the mutant gene is malfunctioning e.g. human brain. If we use sophisticated genetic techniques we can make a mouse which contains the same mutation as the human and then use the mouse to see what sort of tissue damage is occurring in precisely which parts of, for example, the brain. In addition, we can use a range of experimental treatments in the mouse, to see if there is anything worth taking forward into human studies. So, we are planning, in a number of highly selected and appropriate cases, to make and study mouse models of human genetic diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9824984","grantId":"G9824984","fundValue":"3105120","fundStart":"1999-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  O'Rahilly","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
