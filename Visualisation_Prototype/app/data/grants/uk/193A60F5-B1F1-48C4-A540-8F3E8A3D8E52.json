{"id":"193A60F5-B1F1-48C4-A540-8F3E8A3D8E52","title":"Salford IMRC Renewal","abstractText":"This proposal is concerned with the renewal of the Salford IMRC which was initially established in January 2002. This proposal will extent the life of the Salford Centre for Research and Innovation (SCRI) in the built and human environment, until 2011 and further increase the impact that the centre has created in the first five years of its lifecycle. The rolling research agenda and evolving vision of the Centre has been very well received by the industrial and academic circles, as it has been made explicit by the international assessment panels and this renewal aims to firmly establish the world class status of the centre and increase the performance of UK Plc. The centre brings together significant expertise from three research institutes within the university of Salford and aims to continue its collaboration with more that 60 partners in the industrial and academic communities internationally.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E001882/1","grantId":"EP/E001882/1","fundValue":"4866540","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ghassan  Aouad","coPersons":["Grahame Stephen Cooper","Vian  Ahmed","Patricia  Sterry","Lauri Jaakko Koskela","Peter  McDermott","Rachel  Cooper OBE","Yacine  Rezgui","Michail  Kagioglou","Leslie  Ruddock","Martin  Sexton","James  Powell","Peter  Barrett"],"organisation":"University of Salford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
