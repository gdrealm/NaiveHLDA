An important aspect of health and well being in all forms of life is the ability to resist and fight infection and disease, and the molecules which make up the immune response are a very important factor in both resistance and recovery. The immune response has two major methods of defence, the innate immune response, which has been preserved and refined throughout evolution, and the antibody-based response, a relatively recent addition. The innate immune response has non-variable components, including molecules known as collectins, and others called pentraxins, which respond in a fairly general, often rapid manner to threatening microorganisms and molecules of both internal and external origin. The Complement cascade provides one route through which molecules of both innate and adaptive immunity can clear their targets. The collectins in the lung are important in resistance to respiratory disease, allergy and asthma. Those in the blood stream, along with the pentraxins and Complement, enable the destruction of molecules and microorganisms of various kinds. Recent work suggests that the pentraxin human CRP, alongside Complement component C1q, may exacerbate rather than reduce inflammation and these molecules have become targets for inactivation by designed drugs. For the collectins, biotechnology can generate parts of the molecules, including the parts that are involved in binding their targets, and these fragments often retain their defensive properties. A major focus of this research is the definition of the three-dimensional structure of pentraxins and of active fragments of collectins, both in their own right and bound to those parts of their targets which they recognise in real life. This will provide invaluable information for the further design of potential diagnostic and therapeutic agents and strategies, for a variety of diseases, by our collaborators and other investigators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400743","grantId":"G0400743","fundValue":"137638","fundStart":"2005-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Annette Karen Shrive","coPersons":["Trevor James Greenhough"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
