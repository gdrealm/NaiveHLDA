{"id":"C43854EB-2DE9-4E63-8AA2-E3A987910E65","title":"Expanding the String Technique: a new tablature-based integration of multi-parametric string music","abstractText":"This research seeks to develop a new form of musical notation for string instruments, extending recent developments in multi-parametric tablature notations. A new composition will be written for the JACK Quartet, an American string quartet specialising in new and experimental music. \\n\\nThe aim of the research is to generate a more singular, unified approach to multi-layered string tablature. Previous experiments with the so-called 'parametricisation' of string technique have resulted in increasingly dense, stratified, and visually dispersed approaches to musical notation (often with music for solo performer written on as many as half a dozen discrete staves). This new project sets out with the intention of composing works which maintain a similar level of control and specificity of physical, performative movements whilst 'compressing' and integrating notational data into a visual image that is more readily assimilable by the performer. The aim is to find an approach to notation that maintains the crucial complexity of the musical and performative material while dramatically simplifying its visual presentation and creating a much more direct and immediate relationship between musical notation and performer action.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H018417/1","grantId":"AH/H018417/1","fundValue":"17190","fundStart":"2009-11-16","fundEnd":"2010-11-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The notational system developed during the study is beginning to appear in the creative work of others, particularly in the work of PhD-level composers at various institutions worldwide (including Harvard, University of Melbourne, University of Victoria BC, etc.). Works including this notational approach have been performed at, for example, the Darmstadt Ferienkurse in Germany and the June in Buffalo Festival in the USA. \n\nThe work has been discussed with citations in both academic and non-specialist publications, including Irvine Arditti's 'Die Spieltechnik der Violine' and a profile article in The Atlantic magazine (Karen Loew, 'Squiggles are the new quarter notes: why music looks different now', The Atlantic. Oct 2013).\n\nThe work has also been used in Dance and choreography, including a major project led by the Australian theatre company Not Yet Its Difficult, with sponsorship from Hellerau Dresden.

Most significantly, this notation has allowed a new approach to string writing, moving away from a pitch-centred thinking (in which aspects of timbre, bow pressure, and bow position are seen as secondary characteristics) into one in which the movement of the bow can act as a carrier of primary content. The notation itself prioritizes these physical movements such that previously secondary and tertiary musical parameters can be moved to the foreground. This will surely provide useful/fruitful musical and creative opportunities for future composers, who may find new ways to control and manipulate such parameters to create new expressive outputs. In this case, the line between inside and outside of academia is reasonably thin. The outputs are primarily creative in nature and have thus far had their widest distribution outside of academic circles. The work has been presented at a major international music festival in Germany, with widespread press and major radio broadcasts, and upcoming performances will include additional music festivals and lectures outside of the academic world.\n\nThe musical impacts inside of academia are as widespread as outside of academia.\n\nAdditionally, a further project extending on the string research has been followed, applying the multi-colour tablature notation system to voices. The piece 'A painter of figures in rooms' was commissioned by PRSF New Music 20x12 and the London Cultural Olympiad 2012. The work was premiered at Southbank Centre in July 2012, was broadcast by BBC Radio 3, and has been released on CD by NMC records (live) and HCR (studio recording). \n\nFurther creative extensions of the approach are planned in works for Australia's ELISION ensemble in a project to be premiered in 2016.
