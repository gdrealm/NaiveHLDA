There are some treatments already available for depression, like the SSRI (&quot;Prozac&quot;) class of anti-depressants. However, not all patients respond well to SSRI treatment: about a third of patients remain depressed. This is an area of medicine where there is a strong need to do a better job therapeutically. But there has been relatively slow progress in delivering new medicines in the last 15 years. \n\nWe propose to explore and test a radically innovative approach to finding new drug treatments for depression (and potentially other psychiatric disorders). In this project, we will focus on the idea of using anti-inflammatory drugs (like aspirin) to treat depression, especially in patients who have not responded well to SSRI treatment. \n\nRecent scientific research has highlighted that inflammation is a major risk factor for depression. Some degree of depression is very common among patients with medical inflammatory disorders, like rheumatoid arthritis. Patients who are primarily depressed, and do not have a medical inflammatory disorder, generally have somewhat higher blood levels of inflammatory markers than non-depressed people. There is already some evidence that inflammation can block the therapeutic effects of SSRI anti-depressant drugs. And there have been some reports that anti-inflammatory drugs can have anti-depressant effects, at least in some patients with depression.\n\nOn this basis, we will address 4 key questions that need to be answered more clearly and completely before we can consider potentially more serious investment in clinical development of new anti-inflammatory drugs for depressive symptoms linked to abnormal states of the immune system.\n\n1) Is inflammation linked to SSRI treatment resistance? 2) Do anti-inflammatory drugs have anti-depressant effects? These questions will be addressed mainly by analysis of several, large, prior datasets. For example, we will use anonymised NHS data as well as clinical trial data released by the industrial partners (GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson &amp; Johnson) to look for new evidence linking inflammation to depressive symptoms that respond poorly to SSRI treatment. To test a particular mechanistic reason why inflammation might cause SSRI treatment failure, we will also do a number of small lab experiments, using blood samples from healthy volunteers (University of Edinburgh and GSK).\n\n3) Can we validate immune biomarkers for depression and treatment resistance? 4) Can we use biomarkers of depression to predict which anti-inflammatory drugs are most likely to be anti-depressant? Essentially what we mean by these questions is can we develop a blood test that we can use to predict which patients with depressive symptoms are most likely to benefit from which anti-inflammatory drug? To address these questions we will again priortise analysis or re-analysis of existing data including several large biomarker collections (released by GSK) and major studies conducted by the academic partners (University College London, King's College London). We will also conduct some additional lab experiments on human blood samples.\n\nWe aim to complete this project within 2 years and then review the case for further investment in direct clinical trials of new anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of depression in patients who have a blood test result indicating that they are inflamed and unlikely to respond well to existing anti-depressant drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L014815/1","grantId":"MR/L014815/1","fundValue":"497427","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  Bullmore","coPersons":["Tom Charles Freeman","Carmine M.
