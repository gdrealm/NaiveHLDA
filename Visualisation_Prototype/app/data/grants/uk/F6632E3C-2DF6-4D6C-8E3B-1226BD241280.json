Methodologically, the research project will incorporate a mixed methods approach - major existing datasets such as the Family Resources Survey, English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and Quarterly Labour Force Survey will identify differences in post-retirement incomes between ethnic minority groups.</p>\n\n<p>In addition focus groups and interviews will be conducted with individuals from ethnic minority groupings including Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Black Africans, Black Caribbeans and a white British control group. By investigating the current attitudes to, and patterns of saving among the ethnic minority working groups and pensioners the research will comment on the adequacy of current pension policy in addressing the needs of this particular sector of society. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H023739/1","grantId":"ES/H023739/1","fundValue":"80723","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Orla  Gough","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Westminster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
