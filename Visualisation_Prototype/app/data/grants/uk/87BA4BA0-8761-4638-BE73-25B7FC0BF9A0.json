Our previous findings and the possibility to determine the transcription profile of MN derived from ALS patients as well as investigating their functional characteristics led us to set up a collaboration with Professor Jun Xu et al at Tongji University in China. Professor Jun Xu and Professor Zhengliang Gao have established very good stem cell research facility at Stem Cell Research Center at Tongji University. They have international recognised track records in stem cell research and have successfully produced motor neuron like cells from human fibroblast cells. This collaboration is a joint effort to efficiently progress in ALS research, merging technical expertise and a large number of biological samples. The application of microarray analysis to the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) derived motor neurones (MN) from patients and controls will uncover the genes and pathways dysregulated in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This research programme will elucidate the selective vulnerability of MN allowing the identification of potential therapeutic targets. The aims of the proposed study are: 1. To produce iPS-derived MN from our collaborators at Tongji University in China and set up the technique in the host laboratory in Sheffield, UK. 2. To determine the expression profile of the iPS-derived MN 3. To compare the expression profile of MN derived from sporadic and familial ALS patients with control. 4. To determine the stress response of MN obtained from patients compared to controls as well as comparing the stress response of MN and fibroblasts from the same individual 5. To identify the cytokines and other factors released in the media by the iPS-derived ALS cells and their effect on control MN. 6. To compare the axonal transport characteristics of patient derived MN with control derived MN. 7. To test drugs able to antagonise or induce relevant pathways identified through the investigations outlined above.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K008943/1","grantId":"MR/K008943/1","fundValue":"45141","fundStart":"2012-10-30","fundEnd":"2013-10-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ke  Ning","coPersons":["Pamela Jean Shaw"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
