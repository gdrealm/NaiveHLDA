{"id":"832952E9-6B80-4814-AED6-4A86779E0287","title":"High throughput Sequencing Hub for the North of England","abstractText":"DNA sequence has always been an important source of inspiration for advances in medical and clinical research. This culminated in the sequencing of the first human genome, a project that took 6-8 years and several billion pounds. As a result we were able to discover the number and identity of genes that defined the human form though it is taking much longer to work out how these genes interact. But we know that people vary from each other in their disease susceptibility or in the way that they respond to treatment. The current need is to understand the basis of this variation and to use it to understand more fully how to define the most appropriate treatment to particular patients presenting with a particular condition. This is called ?personalised medicine? and it is widely thought to be the best way of optimising treatment.\nAchieving this requires establishing the DNA sequence of particular genes in those patients, and this requires much more productive sequencing technologies. Fortunately, new instruments are now becoming available which can sequence a human in just a few weeks for approx #10-50,000. The Advanced Genomics Facility (AGF), located in Liverpool, is a leading UK centre of excellence and service provider for the new generation of sequencing technologies. We want to expand the capacity of the AGF to serve the research leaders in Universities and hospitals of the North of England by offering a one-stop shop that provides advice for all stages of the work. We shall also provide training and pump-prime cost-sharing programmes helping client groups to turn DNA sequence into knowledge.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900753","grantId":"G0900753","fundValue":"2268020","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Hall","coPersons":["Andrew Robert Cossins","David Christopher  Crossman","Munir  Pirmohamed","William  Ollier"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
