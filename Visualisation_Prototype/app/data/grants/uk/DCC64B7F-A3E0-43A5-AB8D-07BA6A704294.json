{"id":"DCC64B7F-A3E0-43A5-AB8D-07BA6A704294","title":"EO Big Data Processing","abstractText":"As part of NERC's Earth Observation Data Acquisition &amp; Analysis Service, our remit is to receive direct broadcast satellite EO data, process these for use by environmental scientists and distribute to users as soon as possible after reception. We also maintain an archive of all received data for long time-series requirements and support public engagement through web based access to image products.\n\nWith new satellites such MetOp and NPP producing higher volumes of data than before, the time to process data we receive with our existing computer systems has increased significantly. A cluster of processing servers would allow much faster processing (in minutes rather than hours) with resulting products available to users more quickly. This is particularly important for near real-time users we support such as NERC research cruises and aircraft campaigns.\n\nImproved processing capability would also allow additional products to be created from our data (both new and archive) using software available to direct broadcast satellite ground-stations such as Dundee. For example, possible products for Atmospheric studies include cloud top pressure/temperature, optical depth/effective radius and total precipitable water, and for Terrestrial and Earth applications they include reflectance, soil moisture, ice cover and surface temperature products. These would supplement Marine products already derived from our data by our NEODAAS partners at PML.\n\nThe web server is necessary to replace a very old server to handle the increased load created by more products and demand for these from more users. The UPS battery back-up is essential to ensure that the whole system remains functional during power glitches and outages.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L012987/1","grantId":"NE/L012987/1","fundValue":"54000","fundStart":"2013-11-08","fundEnd":"2014-04-07","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Parkes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
