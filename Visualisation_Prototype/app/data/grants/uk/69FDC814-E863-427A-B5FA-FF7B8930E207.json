{"id":"69FDC814-E863-427A-B5FA-FF7B8930E207","title":"The Making of the Viol in Sixteenth-Century England","abstractText":"This is a resubmission of a top-rated application (A+ 'Highest quality and significance'). Peer review praised the project's importance, feasibility and broad impact, and identified no weaknesses. In response to the peer review comments our Case for Support and other documents have been refined to clarify the project's innovative methodology and to elucidate its excellent value for money.\\n\\nMusical repertory of great importance and quality was performed on viols in 16th-century England. Viols played by professional musicians, noble amateurs and boys were central to music-making at court, in noble houses and major choral establishments, and viols were also used in less elevated society. English viols and violists became the most renowned in Europe. Most significant English composers of the time were highly sensitive in their use of specific instruments, and wrote for viols. In order for scholars and performers (professional and amateur) to understand and play this music, they need suitable viols, but so little is known about them that we cannot specify appropriate instruments with precision. Consequently, we cannot determine with well-founded confidence whether an antique viol is an example of this type, and attempts to replicate the type are weakly speculative and ahistorical. \\n\\nOur ignorance cannot be remedied by the scrutiny or use of surviving antique viols because: they are extremely rare; they are not accessible to performers; the information they embody is crucially compromised by degradation and alteration. However Fleming (2001) demonstrated how the combination of information from disparate sources can provide knowledge and understanding about viols beyond what may be deduced from extant examples; our project will apply this approach to 16th-century English viols. A unique strength of the project is the significant enhancement of this proven method by the addition of John Bryan's musical expertise. Bryan will investigate the mutual influence of instruments and music by interrogating the music played on these viols for evidence that illuminates the nature of the instruments used. Among features he will be the first to evaluate are the ranges of notes favoured or avoided, the distribution of musical material among the parts, and instrumentation in works that combine viols with other forces. Important relevant repertory includes LbL Add.31390, Och Mus.984-8 and manuscript and printed continental music found in 16th-century England. Fleming will investigate viol-makers' technical resources (tools, materials, workshop practice), documents concerning the makers and their work (these reveal work and family relationships, costs of viol ownership etc), and the few surviving viols. His extensive experience of using visual material will be formalised to enable organologically reliable information to be derived from images (his approach has applications beyond this project).\\n\\nThe immediate outputs of the project will include a major book, a conference session and several journal articles, together with a range of oral and musical presentations to academic and other audiences. In the longer term, the research findings will have a continuing impact on understanding and practice by being incorporated into the work of scholars, teachers, performers and instrument-makers. This project will enable makers for the first time to meet performers' demands for instruments that are optimally suited to the music that was performed on viols in 16th-century England, attempts to do which are currently frustrated by our lack of knowledge and understanding. Crucially, it will enhance knowledge and understanding of these revered instruments by revealing how composers exploited and responded to these viols' capabilities and limitations. Furthermore, as these English viols were so highly esteemed throughout 17th- and 18th-century continental Europe, it will have a comparable impact on our understanding of continental music practices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G010404/1","grantId":"AH/G010404/1","fundValue":"286473","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Bryan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Huddersfield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
