ENSO events are caused by natural ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropical Pacific, but their impacts are transmitted globally through so-called teleconnections linking distant areas. Teleconnections act through changes in the atmospheric circulation, and they cause regional climate disturbances that can be very damaging, such as floods and droughts. Although Europe is far from the Pacific centre of action, ENSO is also a factor in UK/Europe climate variability. The ENSO cycle has warm (El Ni&ntilde;o) and cold (La Ni&ntilde;a) phases with largely opposite physical impacts. Recent studies have demonstrated that there is also more than one type of ENSO, depending on location within the equatorial Pacific region, and that teleconnection effects differ from one type to another. Further information about these differing effects, and the underlying processes, is required to improve the prediction of the consequences when an ENSO event arises. \n\nThe aim of the work in this proposal is to investigate ENSO and teleconnections by (a) analysing data from observations and realistic climate models, with the use of mathematical methods to determine various 'modes' for ENSO evolution and associated atmospheric changes, and by (b) carrying out numerical experiments with simplified atmospheric circulation models to study the dynamical interactions induced by ENSO-like forcing of the system. Although simplified models are less realistic, by reducing the physical mechanisms represented in such models attention can be focussed on particular dynamical processes and causes and effects which are nevertheless relevant to actual climate variability. The simplified model experiments also provide an opportunity to test the strengths and weaknesses of the analysis methods used in (a).\n\nThe results will help us to understand why teleconnection effects may differ from one ENSOent to another, and how processes in the tropics and extratropics are inter-related. An important potential benefit is that long-range forecast producers will be able to check whether the relevant pathways are properly represented in the systems used to predict ENSO and its impacts: accordingly the Met Office is a partner in this project through the monthly-to-decadal forecast group.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J021628/1","grantId":"NE/J021628/1","fundValue":"167119","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The project is still under way.
