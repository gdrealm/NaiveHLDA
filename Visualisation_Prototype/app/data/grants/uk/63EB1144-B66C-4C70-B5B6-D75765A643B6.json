They do this by extending long 'neurites' that grow away from the cell body until they find their target cell and adhere to it. The processes by which neurites grow are therefore absolutely fundamental to the formation and function of nervous systems. In our recent work funded by BBSRC, we have discovered a previously unknown protein that is an essential part of the process of neurite outgrowth. We have identified the gene that encodes this protein, and have found that blocking the expression of this gene stops the extension of neurites. In this project, we aim to learn more of the mechanism(s) that link this protein to neurite outgrowth. In particular, we wish to discover how the protein works together with other components of the process. The outcome of this project will be new insight into the mechanisms that underlie all function in nervous systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D017823/1","grantId":"BB/D017823/1","fundValue":"302728","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We maintain an ongoing dialogue with Pfizer (now Neusentis) on our research. The findings we described to them sparked interest in both our understanding of neurite/axon growth process and the role of the cytoskeleton in membrane protein expression. A primary concern of theirs is accurate cell models for drug discovery, and we went on to collaborate with them via a BBSRC IIP in 2010 and via an industrial CASE studentship on the role of the culture environment on axon outrgowth and phenotype, taking advantage of both our expertise in aspects of cell culture, and our detailed knowledge of axonal markers and our own antibodies.\n\nThey are also interested in the expression of membrane targets in recombinant cells. A further BBSRC IIP in 2011-12 deriving from our interest in spectrin and the 4.1 proteins investigated the use of cytoskeletal proteins in membrane target expression and activity.

We had previously shown that CAMSAP1 is a spectrin-binding protein required for neurite outgrowth. In this project, we discovered a major microtubule-binding activity in the C-terminal region of CAMSAP1. This region contained a domain we named CKK (entered in Pfam as PF08683). The isolated CKK domain inhibited the growth of nerve axons, presumably by competing with endogenous microtubule binding proteins. Further, we identified the spectrin-binding region within a small 50 amino acid domain we named CC1 (CAMSAP-conserved 1). Within CC1, spectrin bound to 20 amino acids close to the N-terminal of CC1, and 4 amino acids within this were essential for binding. Ca2+-calmodulin also bound to CC1, within 14 residues close to the C-terminal of CC1. Spectrin and Ca2+-calmodulin competed for binding. Isolated CC1 over-expressed in neurons and PC12 cells inhibited neurite/axon outgrowth. A mutant CC1 which did not bind spectrin did not inhibit outgrowth. CC1 bound specifically to the long C-terminal isoform of beta-II spectrin in a region adjacent to the PH domain. Native EGFP-human CAMSAP1 cDNA could rescue rat CAMSAP1 siRNA knockdown of neurite outgrowth. Mutant cDNAs lacking either spectrin-binidng activity or CKK domain could not rescue neurite outgrowth. We conclude that CAMSAP1 is an essential part of the apparatus that allows nerve cells to grow axons. \n\nWe noted that the CC1 and CKK domains were common to three related human genes that we named CAMSAPs1-3. They also contain an unusual calponin homology domain (entered in Pfam as PF11971. ) Evolutionary analysis revealed that CAMSAPs (defined as CKK-CC1-CH proteins) appeared early in animal evolution, perhaps as part of the solution to organising the cytoskeleton for tissue function.\n\nWe also examined spectrin evolution, and found that spectrin first appeared in the immediate ancestors of the animals, represented in modern Choanoflagellate lineages. Spectrin appeared before its major partners (ankyrin, 4.1, adducin and CAMSAP), and seems to have been adapted for tissue function, beyond its prototypical actin cross-linking activity, during the evolution of tissues as its partners emerged, by acquiring novel protein biding sites.\n\nWe also continued an earlier collaboration on spectrin-binding proteins in heart muscle (Pinder KCL; Yacoub, Harefield). Although we found little CAMSAP1 in heart muscle, spectrin was abundant, as was protein 4.1. We characterised the 4.1 proteins of heart in detail and discovered a novel link to the Ca2+-homeostasis system via SERCA2. How do CAMSAPs fit in the processes of neurodegeneration characterised by axon death or loss? Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
