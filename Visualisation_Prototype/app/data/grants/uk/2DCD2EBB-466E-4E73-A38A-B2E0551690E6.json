It is therefore possible to produce specific cells in culture which in principle could be used to replace cells lost through degenerative conditions such as Parkinson s disease and diabetes. The long-term potential of stem cells to treat a variety of diseases is immense but the research and technology requires the development of a complex infrastructure. Embryonic stem cell lines are derived from embryos donated for research and surplus to clinical requirement. The formation of a network of assisted conception centres using common procedures and management will enable embryos to used in the most efficient way and to the best ethical standards.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300496","grantId":"G0300496","fundValue":"308806","fundStart":"2004-05-23","fundEnd":"2008-05-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Harry David Moore","coPersons":["Charles  Kingsland","Peter Walter Andrews","K  Martin","Masoud  Afnan","Christopher  Barratt","Geraldine Mary Hartshorne","Kamal  Ahuja","Simon B Fishel","Richard  Kennedy","W  Ledger"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
