In order to successfully orchestrate the cellular environment for the support of viral infection and replication and based on their inherently small genome sizes many viruses have adopted approaches that incorporate multiple functions into single proteins. In this application we propose to study mechanisms by which the adeno-associated virus Rep protein can regulate its many activities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001764","grantId":"G1001764","fundValue":"553448","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ralph Michael Linden","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
