Mauritian Creole (MC) is the only language common to all Mauritians. But it has not been officially standardised yet. Interestingly, young users are developing their own shared standardised orthography in emails and internet postings.\n\nThis project analyses how technology reinforces the use of MC and creates a sense of identity especially among young people. Through questionnaires and interviews, we discuss the role of users in devising a standard for MC. Our findings will contribute to ongoing debates regarding standardisation of MC and its status as a national language uniting different ethnolinauistic groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119479/1","grantId":"119479/1","fundValue":"6256","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Aaliya  Rajah-Carrim","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
