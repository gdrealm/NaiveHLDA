{"id":"91578F4E-900B-4239-BAE3-5A5FDB0E893F","title":"GridPP4+ Edinburgh one year extension for staff support","abstractText":"This proposal, submitted in response to the 2014 invitation from STFC, aims\nto provide and operate a computing Grid for the exploitation of LHC data in\nthe UK. The success of the current GridPP Collaboration will be built upon,\nand the UK's response to production of LHC data in the period April 2015 to\nMarch 2016 will be to ensure that there is a sustainable infrastructure\nproviding &quot;Computing in the LHC era&quot;\nWe propose to operate a Grid as the main mechanism for delivering very\nlarge-scale computational resources to the UK particle physics community.\nThis foundation will underpin the success and increase the discovery\npotential of UK physicists. We will operate a production-quality Grid,\ndelivering robustness, scale and functionality. The proposal is fully\nintegrated with international projects and we must exploit the opportunity\nto capitalise on the UK leadership already established in several areas. The\nParticle Physics Grid will increasingly be integrated with national and\ninternational initiatives.\n\nThe project will be managed across various domains and will deliver the UK's\ncommitment to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) and ensure that\nworldwide activities directly benefit the UK.\nBy 2015, the UK Grid infrastructure will have expanded in size to 50,000\ncores, with more than 30 PetaBytes of storage. This will enable the UK to\nexploit, in an internationally competitive way, the unique physics potential\nof the LHC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M004961/1","grantId":"ST/M004961/1","fundValue":"122946","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Clarke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
