Through these concerted actions cells are able to form and maintain a diverse array of different tissues and organs. Extracellular signalling molecules, such as morphogens, establish temporal and spatial gradients that help determine cellular fate decisions. The restriction of morphogen expression to a small subset of specific cells, such as those in stem cell niches, is crucial to allow correct orchestration of cellular fate within a tissue or organ. However, very little is known about the intracellular signalling pathways and molecular mechanisms that regulate morphogen expression. This proposal's principal aim is to uncover a new upstream regulatory pathway governing morphogen expression. Its central hypothesis concerns addressing whether a unique ubiquitin-protein ligase called 'Hyperplastic Discs' (Hyd) uses the addition of a small protein, called ubiquitin, to control morphogen expression and influence intercellular communication. Addition of ubiquitin to other proteins, in a process called ubiquitylation, provides the cell with a powerful 'molecular handle' to control the modified protein's behaviour. Hyd represents a particularly intriguing and important ubiquitin-protein ligase and this work aims to comprehensively uncover its ubiquitin-associated molecular mechanism. Taken together the proposal's findings will not only advance our understanding of the mechanisms governing animal development and cellular homeostasis, but also expand our knowledge of the versatility and regulatory potential of ubiquitylation as modification system. Potential applications and benefits of this work are manifold. One direct benefit would help us understand a possible cause of a number of human diseases that demonstrate aberrant morphogen expression, including cancer and many congenital disorders. Similarly, as a process ubiquitylation is central to numerous biological processes that when disrupted can lead to a wide array of human diseases. Therefore, elucidation of novel modes of ubiquitylation action will both expand our knowledge of its signalling potential and guide our understanding of its role in both this as well as several other important areas of biology. Furthermore, the identification of a Hyd-associated molecular mode of action will allow the development of small-molecule therapeutic compounds. Therapeutic intervention with such compounds could then correct the aberrant, disease-associated morphogen expression. Finally, Hyd-associated therapeutic intervention could also provide huge advances in regenerative medicine by promoting morphogen expression and stimulating dormant stem cells into dividing and promoting tissue regeneration. Design and development of small molecule compounds requires detailed insights in a protein's molecular mechanism. Only a comprehensive approach will allow accurate dissection and elucidation of the molecular events controlled by Hyd and its downstream effectors. Hence, the proposal's three individual projects use a combination of cutting-edge proteomic, biochemical and genetic techniques to address the specific objectives of: (1) Identification of Hyd-mediated ubiquitylated targets, (2) the type of ubiquitylation signal made on them and (3) the proteins responsible for translating and propagating the ubiquitin signal into a molecular event. Overall this work is both important and timely and will provide important insights into extremely important areas of biology and molecular biology. Whose findings will impact upon our understanding of numerous biological processes and potentially lead to the generation of treatments for human disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H012869/1","grantId":"BB/H012869/1","fundValue":"454975","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings were used to initiate a collaboration with NHS clinicians/rheumatologists to start clinical studies into the application of Hedgehog agonists in the treatment of osteoarthritis.

Through regulating important intracellular and extracellular signalling pathways, Hyd is able to influence stem cell function in the Drosophila and mouse gut. Loss of Hyd function alone causes stem cells to die, but in combination with the cancer promoting 'oncogene' called RasV12, promotes tumourigenesis. These findings shed light onto important areas of cell biology regarding Our results in the skeleton indicate murine Hyd as a potent suppressor of osteoarthritis (OA) and ectopic tendon ossification (ETO). Furthermore the effects are Hedgehog dependent. These results will have a major implication is how Hedgehog angonist may be used in the clinic to control OA and ETO progression.
