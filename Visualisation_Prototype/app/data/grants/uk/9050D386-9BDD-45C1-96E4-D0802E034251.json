Efforts to develop effective anti-malarial therapies have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of how parasites have adapted to proliferate so effectively whilst also evading immune responses. The rodent parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi, provides the best available experimental model for addressing these questions but, until now the lack of gene modification technologies for this parasite has precluded direct functional studies on the gene products that are implicated. In a recent pilot study we have established the conditions for Plasmoduim chabaudi genetic modification and have successfully generated the first fluorescent parasites. These and other parasite lines will immediately be an invaluable tool in experiments that will visualise live interactions between parasite and host immune cells and tissues and that will examine host responses to specific parasite proteins in an in vivo setting.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600845","grantId":"G0600845","fundValue":"431876","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanne  Thompson","coPersons":["Jean  Langhorne"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
