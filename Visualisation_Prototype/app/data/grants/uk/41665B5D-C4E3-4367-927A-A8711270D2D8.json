The School of Chemistry at the University of Bristol is an acknowledged leader in synthesis, materials and supramolecular chemistry, as well as chemical biology and research groups are working towards the production of bioactive compounds, polymeric materials and surfactants with applications in energy harvesting and storage, as well as on synthetic receptors with future healthcare potential. Cutting-edge analytical equipment underpins progress in all of these research areas and impacts arising from investment in Mass Spectrometry will broadly fall into four groups: in industry and academia as well as on the general public and society.

The acquisition of these new instruments has allowed us to significantly advance our understanding of specific chemical reactions, as well as to analyze in detail synthetic approaches to naturally occurring scaffolds, which have the potential to lead to novel therapeutic compounds. Cyclohexane based anion carriers are being designed and synthesized, which may have the potential for channel replacement therapy in cases of cystic fibrosis, synthetic scaffolds are finding applications as medicinal sensors, while rationally designed porous solids are a potential solution to the gas storage problem. The properties of non-proteinogenic amino acids are also of interest, especially those features, which make them suitable for the study of Alzheimer's disease. Scaffolds are being designed with the purpose of supporting cell or tissue growth, enzymes are being rationally developed to act as specific catalysts, while compounds that can mimic biological boundaries could be used as protocells for drug delivery. Findings from mass spectrometric analyses carried out will advance mechanistic understanding which will enable the production of new materials. The rational design of compounds which may play a role in energy harvesting and storage, or which may act as drugs with potential healthcare uses will also stimulate research both within academia as well as industry. We are training the current cohorts of PhD students from the Centres for Doctoral training as well as post doctoral researchers within individual groups. These students may eventually progress to senior positions in academia or industry. Output from the MS facility is also being used in undergraduate teaching as well as outreach events with the aim of inspiring the next generation of chemists.
