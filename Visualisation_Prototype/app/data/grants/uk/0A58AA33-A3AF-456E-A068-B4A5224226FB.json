Comparing the genomic DNA of related species does not identify which sequence differences were selected. Statistical population genetic approaches using sequence differences between and within species can pinpoint regions of the DNA that may underlie adaptive changes. However, these techniques are only effective if the genome sequences to be compared are neither too similar nor too dissimilar, and few pairs of genome sequences suitable for the analyses are yet available in the animal or plant kingdoms, or even in fungi. The impending completion of the genome sequences of the two Brassicaceae Arabidopsis lyrata and Capsella rubella, together with the available genome sequence of A. thaliana, offers opportunities to study such questions in plant species at the intermediate evolutionary distances that are ideal for computational studies of evolutionary processes; these three species are also suitable for functional studies. We will exploit this resource by studying sequence evolution on a genome-wide scale and by studying the molecular basis of evolution in two well-characterized and ecologically relevant traits, flowering time and self-incompatibility (SI). We will first generate sequence alignments of all three species and compile all sets of orthologous genes, i.e. descended from the same gene in the species' common ancestor. As the genetic maps of the three species are known to be very similar, large orthologous stretches of genome can be identified. The alignments will immediately allow us to detect the especially interesting category of genes that are present/absent in individual species, allowing study of genome evolution. We will next estimate rates of synonymous sequence changes (not changing the amino-acid sequence of the proteins encoded) and non-synonymous changes between pairs of genes present in each species pair. Comparing these rates across all genes can answer several important questions, including whether rates of non-synonymous substitutions are similar between genes or regions, and if not, whether variation is systematic across large genomic regions. Candidates for having evolved adaptively and/or contributed to speciation will be genes with unusually high rates of non-synonymous substitutions, relative to polymorphism levels within populations (which we shall estimate from a large set of loci to serve as 'controls'). Other interesting candidate genes can be identified from unusually high or low differentiation between natural populations. The sequence analyses will provide a foundation for functional studies of two adaptive traits, flowering time and SI. Genes affecting flowering time will be identified with two complementary approaches. First, variation in flowering time in naturally occurring A. lyrata populations will be correlated with sequence changes in orthologues of known A. thaliana flowering time regulators. Second, we will identify A. lyrata genomic regions with large effects on flowering time by genetic mapping, and then study candidate genes in these regions by manipulating their activity. We will use the self-incompatible species A. lyrata to study the transition to self-compatibility (SC) in some natural populations, and will do similar studies in C. rubella (SC) and its self-incompatible sister species C. grandiflora, including establishing an immortalized mapping population from a cross of the species to map genes associated with SC/SI, and other traits of evolutionary significance, such as flower size, etc. Together, our studies are expected to answer several interesting evolutionary and genome evolution questions, and should also advance breeding programmes in crops.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E024734/1","grantId":"BB/E024734/1","fundValue":"255928","fundStart":"2007-08-27","fundEnd":"2010-08-26","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Although only two publications have come out, two others are nearing completion.

Our part of the project was to investigate the genetic causes and consequences of mating system variation within Arabidopsis lyrata. \n\nThis grant was closely associated with NE/D013461 and the postdoctoral research fellows worked closely together. Many of the main outcomes are thus shared with that grant.\n\nHowever, the outcomes lead by the postdocs employed on this grant (Annabelle Haudry and Hong-Guang Zha) were as follows: \n\nShifts in mating system in species that have genetically controlled self-incompatibility systems (such as A. lyrata) involve a two-step process: 1) disruption of the system controlling self-incompatibility (SI); 2) transition to a predominance of inbreeding within populations. This research importantly emphasised that the selection pressures for these two steps are different and that loss of SI can occur without a shift in mating system. Specifically, plants that are capable of selfing in populations that are predominantly outcrossing still reproduce predominantly by outcrossing whereas in populations where most individuals are capable of selfing, high levels of inbreeding occurs. \n\nThis research investigated the causes of these two shifts. Ecological factors were not identified (e.g. current population density or differences in habitat) and mutations were not identified in the genes directly involved in the SI reaction. Comparison of variation in genes flanking these genes (part of the S-locus) also suggested that loss of SI was not due to increased recombination in the region, which would disrupt the required pairing between genes controlling recognition in male and female components.\n\nA next generation sequencing approach (Illumina sequencing of self-incompatible, SI, and self-compatible, SC, pools of crosses between SI and SC individuasl) was used to investigate the genomic basis of loss of SI. These results were delayed beyond the time that the postdocs left and so the informatics component has taken a number of years to complete. The results have not yet been published but suggest that loss of SI is related to variation on the same chromosome as the S-locus but associated with particular S-alleles. An important finding from these analyses was that highly divergent genes such as SI genes are at risk of not being assembled in resequencing studies. Our original analyses were confounded because genes at the S-locus (along with other highly polymorphic regions) were found in the unaligned reads which normally would not have been analysed. \n\n\nWe also used a next generation sequencing approach (tagged amplicon sequencing) to investigate whether the shift to inbreeding in only some populations might have been due to a bottleneck in the number of S-alleles (which would reduce the number of effective mating partners if populations remained outcrossing). This research was also delayed due to technological issues with the approach, because the target gene was larger than the available approaches at the time could handle. Working with the Liverpool node of the NERC biomolecular analysis facility, we were able to pilot an alternative, which seems to have worked. The data are still being analysed but are consistent with the hypothesis that inbred populations have only 1 or 2 S-alleles, which would not be sufficient to maintain outcrossing. Most of what is known about shifts in mating system come from comparisons between species, where additional changes after speciation can obscure the original causes of loss of SI. They also confound loss of SI with a shift to inbreeding. Our results have important implications for considering these as separate processes. This is important for understanding the effects of crop breeding programmes.\n\nOur results suggesting difficulties in assembly of highly polymorphic genes in genome resequencing studies will have important implications for a wide range of studies. Highly polymorphic gene families are known to be critical for adaptation to changing environments but they may not be included in reassemblies.
