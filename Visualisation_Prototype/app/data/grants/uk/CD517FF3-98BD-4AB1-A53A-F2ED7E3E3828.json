(Stage 2 in Fellowship in Creative &amp; Performing Arts originally entitled 'Chronicle 2010' now known as CollabDocs.)","abstractText":"Colllaborative Docs (Stage 2) is the second stage of the CollabDocs research project (formerly known as 'Chronicle 2010'.) The overall project looks at how documentary practice can take advantage of the generation of web technologies known as 'Web 2.0'. CollabDocs is concerned in particular with participatory media and collaboration. The practice-based research examines how the 'vernacular videos' that get posted, for example on You Tube, might be combined to tell larger stories, and what role a producer might play in bringing themed participatory videos together to meaningful effect. \\n\\nIn Stage 2 the Fellow will produce two distinct web-based participatory documentaries. The first - Are you happy? (Phase 2) - looks at what happiness means today. The second - Four Wheels Good? - looks at our love/hate relationship to cars. Both projects will start with a call to action, and diverse members of the public will be invited to contribute video content. These contributions will be edited and highlights presented in websites designed so that the video is contrasted in an engaging way with related online content. The latter content will be drawn in through publically accessible feeds. Such content could include stills from the photo sharing site Flickr or traffic news from the BBC. These various sources will be combined to produce a new kind of documentary, where the meaning is not fixed in a linear form by the viewpoint of a single director, but reflects multiple perspectives, and shifts as new data enters the system. The creative challenge for the project will be to design the flow of elements and the web interface so that the viewer can enjoy a satisfying experience; which combines storytelling, interaction and easily digestible information. \\n\\nA DVD will be produced to reflect the fellowship observations, critical reflection and findings, and showcase the web productions. The Fellow will also pursue a programme of in-person events and activities throughout the three remaining years of the Fellowship, but in particular in the final year, through which she will share the fellowship work and findings with interested parties in academia and industry.\\n\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I025638/1","grantId":"AH/I025638/1","fundValue":"32499","fundStart":"2011-02-14","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The unique platform for exploration provided by the Research Fellowship and my ensuing research findings continue to be of great interest within the creative economy. I have been and continue to be invited to speak, present and consult in a variety of KE and industry contexts in the UK and abroad. I have repeatedly been invited to talk within the BBC - streamed live to three locations at a BBC Connected Studio development lab in 2013 for instance. I have been an advisor at Sheffield DocFest's Meetmarket (2013) and on the AHRC funded REACT Future Documentary Sandbox (2013), and I am one of only two UK curators on the MIT OpenDoc Lab _docubase - a key resource for practitioners of emerging documentary. In October '14 I attended by invitation a select one-day convening at MIT OpenDocLab on the convergence between documentary and journalism online - the only UK academic in attendance offering insight and chairing a panel in a gathering with representatives from the New York Times, The Guardian, the BBC, The Sundance Institute and a number of Professors. At the same time, as Co-Director of the i-Docs project, I co-convene the i-Docs Symposium, co-host the facebook group and oversee the website. i-Docs is the prime UK meeting point for scholars and practitioners of emerging documentary, and my input to these sites provides and supports KE. These engagements provide practitioners with access to my research in a context where documentary is undergoing transformation within its form, market, distribution and exhibition. Practitioners need to better understand that context and the opportunities that it provides. Feedback has consistently shown that my work provides a valuable insight as they grapple with those changes. Creative Economy Cultural","person":"Mandy  Rose","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":" 1. My central research insight concerns the disruption to documentary which has come about in the context of digital. The impact is not only expressed at the level of form. Computerisation and the social, semantic and open web are between them producing an environment in which documentary tools, technology, funding, form, process, authorship and distribution are all reworked, and the audience become actors - capturing, liking, sharing, and potentially producing content. Documentary is transformed within a new media ecology. \n\n2. Lev Manovich and Henry Jenkins have both observed the tendency within digital culture for marginal twentieth-century cultural forms to be reinvented. My second key insight concerns the contemporary re-emergence and transformation of forms of community media and participatory art. Building (at times explicitly) on 20th century precedents in participatory art, community and access video, documentarists are seeking approaches to making purposeful digital work with people rather than about them. They adopt a range of modes - acting as facilitators, curators, collaborators. They experiment with architectures of participation, seeking ethical and aesthetic strategies; ways to be true to participants and engage an audience, to create the conditions within which a necessary story can be told, in a context of meaningful dialogue. \n\n3. In this new environment the role of the director/producer is often becoming a practice of co-creativity. I have explored this role in the growing repository of interviews with key practitioners published on the CollabDocs blog. One feature of this environment is an emphasis on process and face-to-face interaction with interactive media providing a stage for a public conversation. A co-creative approach to documentary provides a progressive re-working of documentary's historic role in the public sphere, as an open space for dialogue and a stage for the performance of citizenship. \n\n4. The fourth research finding concerns the potential for documentary within the 'ubiquitous data' that is both consequence and driver of the online environment. In particular I have noted the morphing of the character of video in the context of the latest web coding language, HTML5. Before that coding language became common web video was impervious to its life online; published online in a way that reproduced the conditions of the TV screen. Now, existing databases and live information drawn from social media can be connected to the documentary environment, offering opportunities for the production of new kinds of knowledge and application. \n\nThe affordances of networked connectivity offer the potential to re-contextualise documentary material through mobilising the enormous co-creative potential of human discourse captured in the web. This has been a central theme of my web documentary, &quot;Searching for Happiness&quot;. That documentary has sought to find a form to shape live content into a coherent experience. The project points the way to the re-invention of documentary for the online environment and the creation of new visual and informational grammars. The invitations that I continue to receive to speak, present, and participate in a variety of convenings both in the UK and internationally attest to the substantial interest that there is in the insights I have developed within the framework of the CollabDocs AHRC Research Fellowship within creative economy and pedagogical contexts. Documentary is in a process of transformation as described above as well as hybridisation with other genres. The intersection between journalism and documentary online is of particular note. Research is required to map these new landscapes and consider the reframing of both cultures. One might ask: how does the reader / user comprehend content where Journalisms's strict codes around impartiality and consent meet the looser, more creative framework of documentary? \n\nThere is much interest among practitioners also in the community media and Access TV precedents of 21st century participatory documentary. Further work could address specific case studies and develop resources to equip documentarians with models and protocols so that they can to think about how to work effectively and ethically with non-professionals. This builds on the production experience of global collaboration within The are you happy? Project. \n\nAdditionally there is significant interest among practitioners in the use of live data within documentary - a central exploration within the Searching for Happiness project. There is a project in development for CDEC Creative Catapult by my colleague Jon Dovey which builds on the findings from that project. This proposes the development of a platform for industry - The Context Engine - which would allow editors / users to plug live data into documentary content. \n\n[These are joint findings across AH/FO16298/1 and AH/10265638/1.] Creative Economy","dataset":"gtr"}
