Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an ideal alternative source as they can be derived from patients' skin cells and have the potential to form any cell type in the body. However, current technologies are hindered by the inability to reliably produce mature cell types. We have developed a method that enables iPSCs to be reliably differentiated at low cost and high purity into neurons. This offers the ability to utilise these cells for understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the petri dish and developing new treatments and diagnostics for such patients. Ultimately, we aim to produce a technology capable of diagnosing AD and informing treatment options for patients as well as providing industry with the ability to screen and develop novel drugs for this incurable disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K020277/1","grantId":"BB/K020277/1","fundValue":"170769","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Michael Ward","coPersons":["Lisa  Mohamet"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
