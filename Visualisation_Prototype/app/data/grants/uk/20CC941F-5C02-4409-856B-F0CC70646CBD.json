During the course of the project the Sheffield Homes was reincorporated into SCC.\n\nThere are four levels upon which the project has directly impacted the work of SH/SCC. First, the project established action research interventions in two social housing areas of Sheffield. These included the establishment of local provision co-designed by tenants, tenants reps, SH/SCC and the project. The evaluation of these, as well as national data sets provided a basis for a model of DI intervention. Second, support for the development of strategy by SH/SCC based on findings from the research. Third, knowledge exchange to allow both research and practice developments by SH/SCC and the research team. Fourth, contribution to national debates on DI issues and engagement with national networks.\n\nTaking each in turn. The local action research projects had immediate local impact with the establishment in one case of a new ICT facility and training support in Stannington, Sheffield for older residents where no such facility had existed before. In Parson Cross work with residents led to recommendations of IT system development by the council and establishment of Job clubs to support residents engagement with new DWP job seeking &quot;digital by default&quot; systems. The research developed a model for intervention that had three key elements: 1] assessment of interventions against client context; 2] hyper local delivery and co-design; 3] individual engagement and assessment to link clients with appropriate support. This model has been implemented in the work of Sheffield Homes who have developed a number of Hyper local interventions and are rolling these out across relevant community centres. This model has also been taken on board by South Yorkshire Homes (Housing Association) and Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council - and has been proposed for local NHS community support (evidence base, reports, correspondence, interviews with John Lovibond and Jane Lyon SCC). Work by tenant volunteers on the SCC implementation of the recommendations has led to employment opportunities for 11 of the 40 volunteers and has provided over 1000 sessions and supported over 200 residents to date (evidence base correspondence, interviews and report from Maxine Bowler Healy Development Trust).\n\nThe Knowledge Exchange can be evidenced by continued partnership between SCC and the research team (now based across Sheffield Hallam, Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores Universities). It has underpinned bids to the &quot;Digital Deal&quot; and the implementation of the above policy interventions. The work has underpinned the establishment of Sheffield and Region Digital Housing Network that has run three one-day knowledge exchange events. The close of the project included a Digital Inclusion Event and conference at SCC to highlight the inclusion of DI issues in SCC ICT policy. Future support is to be given for bids to the Fairness Commission by SCC. The project has also supported a one day best-practice and knowledge exchange trip for SCC staff and a cabinet councillor (Cllr Cllr Mazher Iqbal) to meet the GO ON ITs Liverpool network led by Cllr Laura Robertson Collins - GO ON Its Liverpool is a national touchstone for best integrated multi agency practice in the DI field. These interactions have led to additional research actions including the re-assessment of the evidence base for DI benefits (CI: Kirby and PI:Yates) and a case study of digital channel shift in SCC (CI: Kirby).\n\nThe national international agenda has been influenced by the involvement of the PI (Yates) in a range of national and international networks. Yates has presented the work to key relevant major stakeholders including: Department for Work and Pensions; Government Digital Service; BT; at an SAS.com sponsored Westminster event with senior civil servants; Chartered Institute of Housing; and GO ON Its Liverpool. Additionally the PI is an active member of the UK Digital Leaders programme and has presented the finding at national and regional Digital Leaders events. The PI is currently working with Digital Leaders to establish a research forum within the network. The project developed from the start an on-going relationship with Tinder Foundation (Previously UK online) - event helping UK online find new office space - and has regularly contributed to the Tinder foundations Social and Digital research symposia. Most recently the project has been asked to contribute to the Social Policy Associations publication &quot;In defence of Welfare (II)&quot; intended to promote policy debate prior to the 2015 general election.

This collaborative work was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) as a Knowledge Exchange project with Sheffield Homes (SH) and Sheffield City Council (SCC). The results of the work were intended to be directly applicable to non-academic contexts. The work was conducted by collaborative team with staff from Sheffield Homes, Sheffield Hallam and Liverpool Universities. The project sought to examine and understand digital exclusion and develop potential interventions to support inclusion. The project was designed to support SCC/SH in addressing a well-defined and pressing policy need to increase digital engagement among social housing tenants. The project was also designed to apply learning from recent academic research in the areas of digital inclusion, digital engagement and user centred software and service design.\n\nAt the close of the project a significant knowledge base has been developed between the partners that will support current and future interventions and policy decisions. Such support opens up the possibility of addressing reductions in service resources through online provision, and the possibility of joining up services across functions to therefore maintain quality of front line delivery. As noted above the project work has been directly applied to policy making by SCC and will be of relevance to other local councils and social housing providers. Constant knowledge exchange and impact on SH/SCC work was driven by the joint programme board which included senior SH staff, the SCC Director of Customer Services, the SCC Director of Business Information Solutions, the Chief Executive of UK Online/Tinder Foundation, Heeley Development Trust, the research team and invited tenant or SCC staff. This allowed the work of the project to be regularly disseminated to key partners.\n\n\n\nDirect impacts\n\nThe following interventions were supported by the project:\n\n o Community based training and support:\n\n o A computer club and WiFi access were provided by in Stannignton. The club has run weekly since spring 2013.\n\n o A &quot;Job club&quot; was established in Parson Cross to support local residents who needed to engage with the &quot;digital only&quot; Universal Job Match\n\n o Service design:\n\n o Workshops were undertaken in Parson Cross to provide SCC with insight into user centred digital service design\n\n o The intervention infrastructure and facilities for the will remain in place supported by Heeley Development Trust.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the joint work of the project board the following have been established:\n\n o Sheffield Housing Digital Inclusion Network - including non-SCC social housing providers, Tinder Foundation, regional DWP and community groups (27/6/13; 16/12/13).\n\n o SCC Digital Inclusion Conference (11/11/13)- meeting to establish Digital Inclusion Strategy for SCC. The work of the project has directly fed into the digital inclusion strategy for SCC through the work of the project board chair.\n\n o Project informed follow-up survey work by SCC on digital exclusion for those 1,719 social housing tenants directly affected by recent Welfare Reform ('bedroom tax')\n\nOther engagements\n\nThe team has undertaken regular engagements to ensure the broadest engagement and impact from the project, including:\n\n o Project and findings presented to Chartered Institute of Housing (Leeds, 13/8/13)\n\n o Project staff, data and issues discussed as part of UK Online Centre's 7th Social Digital Research Symposium (OfCom, 4/9/13)\n\n o Work presented to Go On ITs Liverpool Steering Group (5/9/13)\n\n o Yates (PI) and Liverpool ICC colleagues joined and supporting Go On ITs Liverpool Steering Group\n\n o Invited to present project and findings presented to DWP Cross-cutting Delivery Analysis staff and Government Digital Service staff (Caxton House, London, 17/10/13)\n\n o Invited to present project and findings at SAS (www.sas.com) Digital Government Breakfast Briefing (Church House, Westminster, 24/9/13)\n\no Project organised a best-practice exchange visit by SH/SCC senior staff and SCC cabinet member (Cllr Mazher Iqbal) to Liverpool City Council (Cllr Laura Robertson-Collins) and Go On ITs Liverpool partners (4/10/13)\n\nThe project team is now based in two locations, Sheffield and Liverpool. The team will continue to work with colleagues in key stakeholder organisations - in particular SCC, Go On ITs Liverpool and Tinder Foundation. SHU is continuing to support the work of Dr. Kirby who is undertaking in depth qualitative work with staff at SCC. Prof. Yates is working with colleagues in Liverpool and Sheffield to explore the role of the CDI sector in addressing digital and social exclusion. Using final report to SCC the team intends to continue disseminating the findings to key stakeholders. A comparative analysis of the projects hyper-local data with national data (OfCom and OxIS) has allowed the development of a model of digital exclusion that the team is currently preparing for publication. More broadly the team will continue to engage the national stakeholders already identified above (DWP, Government Digital Service, Chartered Institute of Housing) as well as those who have recently expressed an interest in the work, such as charities (Shelter), major telecoms providers (BT, EE) and political actors (Labour Party). Through these engagements the team hope to continue to contribute to the debate on digital exclusion and digital government services.
