{"id":"A19BB768-499F-4FEB-9181-080139CCABB8","title":"Crossing Over: The films and Filmmaking of Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar","abstractText":"Alejandro Amenaber is Spain's most acclaimed young filmmaker today, a leading representative of the new wave of 1990's directors who have managed to combine commercial success with artistic flair. This project is the first major, comprehensively study in English of his films and filmmaking practices. It seeks to account for Amenaber's distinctive brand of commercially appealing, quality, auteur cinema, though not simply in terms of Spain's auteur traditions and its 'national cinema'. Rather, it analyses Amenaber as an exemplar of transformations in Spain's film industry in the 1991's, which also reflect wider and more complex changes taking place in global film production, distribution and marketing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113067/1","grantId":"113067/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Barry  Jordan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
