{"id":"BB1D486E-EAB1-483B-9473-93AF3F480449","title":"An evaluation of UK engineering strikes between 1920 and 1970","abstractText":"<p>The Engineering Employers Federation systematically recorded and summarised detailed payroll statistics of its member firms between 1914 and 1970. Membership ranged from 2440 firms employing 700,000 workers in 1920 to 4734 firms employing 1,400,000 in 1970. It also kept a meticulous and fully consistent record of strike activity that occurred within these firms for an unbroken period from 1920 to 1970. For each firm, the data provide exact geographical location, union involvement, cause/duration/outcome of strike, numbers/types/gender/ seniority of engineering workers involved, numbers of workers incidentally laid off. <br />&nbsp;<br />This project entails transcribing this important historical record on to spreadsheets in a highly accessible manner so as to make the complete data accessible to future generations of researchers. The spreadsheets will not only code the data - in order to be of use for statistical purposes - but also provide a written summary of the cause and outcome of each strike. Anyone from a 'general audience' who wishes to learn about strike acivity in a specific geographical area and/or a specific period of time will have access to an immediately useful precise record of events.<br />&nbsp;<br />A descriptive statistical analysis will be undertaken that examines the trends in strike durations and frequencies of strikes in relation to contemporaneous economic events (eg the Depression, World War II, post-war recovery period). This work will also explore trends in the causes and outcomes of strikes, the relationships between outcomes and lengths of strikes, the relationship of strike patterns to different classes of worker and to types of engineering activity.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1804","grantId":"RES-000-22-1804","fundValue":"75472","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Hart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
