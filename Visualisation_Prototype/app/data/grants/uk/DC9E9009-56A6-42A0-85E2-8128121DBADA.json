{"id":"DC9E9009-56A6-42A0-85E2-8128121DBADA","title":"Control of early embryogenesis by extra-embryonic peptides","abstractText":"Like animals, plants use asymmetric cell divisions to create pattern and diversity. However, how plants specify and carry out asymmetric divisions is not yet understood. This proposal focuses on uncovering the role of intercellular communication as a mechanism driving asymmetric division of the zygote in plants. We have uncovered a group of peptides expressed in embryo surrounding cells that regulate the early divisions of the zygote. We will use these findings to identify novel components to the network of genes and proteins that are involved in regulating early embryo development and patterning. Through this work we will uncover the molecular processes that allow surrounding tissues to coordinate the development of plant embryos.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L003023/1","grantId":"BB/L003023/1","fundValue":"446972","fundStart":"2014-01-27","fundEnd":"2017-05-05","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jose F Gutierrez-Marcos","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
