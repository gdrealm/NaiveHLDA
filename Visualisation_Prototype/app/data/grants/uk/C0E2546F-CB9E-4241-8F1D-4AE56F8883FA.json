By understanding the structure of viruses we can gain insight into how they work and thus how we might deisgn new medicines to combat them. The structural details needed for this understanding can be provided by two techniques, X-ray crystallography and cry-electron microscopy. This programme aims to use these techniques to illuminate our understanding of several families of viruses of major importance to human health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500365","grantId":"G0500365","fundValue":"2148750","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Stuart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
