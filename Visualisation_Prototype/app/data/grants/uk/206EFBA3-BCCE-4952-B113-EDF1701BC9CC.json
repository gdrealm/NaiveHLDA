The infected beef is harmful because it contains an abnormal prion protein which when eaten by a healthy individual causes their own normal prion protein to become abnormal. \nNerve cells of the brain are particularly sensitive to this protein imbalance and when infected with abnormal prion stop working and die. We want to study how disease progression is represented at the level of the susceptible nerve cells. We hypothesize that the different parts of the nerve are not equally sensitive to disease and will investigate if synapses, the point of contact between nerves, are particularly susceptible. Synapses are essential to brain function and their disruption will prevent communication even before nerve cells die. In particular, we will use a mouse model of prion disease to look at nerve cells as they undergo degeneration. Identifying which parts of the nerve are most susceptible should help develop ways of preventing the progression from a sick to a dead nerve. Importantly, the work will help us understand and possibly treat other debilitating brain diseases (e.g. Alzheimerâ€™s) associated with the accumulation of abnormal brain proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501636","grantId":"G0501636","fundValue":"573765","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Vincent  O'Connor","coPersons":["V Hugh  Perry"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
