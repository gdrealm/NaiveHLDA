As anyone whose child has learned to escape their car seat knows, preschool children have a remarkably fast and powerful ability to learn by observing othersâ€™ causal actions. Previous work suggests that humans may be unique in this regard, but what psychological mechanisms, if any, differ among primates?</p>\n\n<p>We will first use a computational model to predict how learners should learn from different demonstrations. We will then conduct a study examining what learners of different species actually do. In this study, children, chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys will observe a human demonstrator perform two actions (eg pulling a lever and turning a dial) on a puzzle box. Only the second action causes reward production, but the first action is more plausibly necessary if the actor performs it on purpose, or in mechanical contact with the reward. The question is whether these variables affect the tendency of different species to perform the 'unnecessary' action in the sequence.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;This research will help us to understand the ways in which human cognition differs from that of other primates, and when these evolutionary changes might have occurred.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009540/1","grantId":"ES/K009540/1","fundValue":"242112","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-06","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Daphna  Buchsbaum","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
