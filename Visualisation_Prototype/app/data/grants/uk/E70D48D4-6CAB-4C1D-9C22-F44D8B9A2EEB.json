{"id":"E70D48D4-6CAB-4C1D-9C22-F44D8B9A2EEB","title":"Instrument for Soundscape Recognition, Identification and Evaluation","abstractText":"SummaryThis project involves collaboration between three institutions, Huddersfield University and the Universities of York and Southampton with additional technical supervision from the University of Cambridge and Atkins Consultants Ltd. The project concept arose out of the EPSRC Ideas Factory 'A Noisy Future? Making the World sound better', January 2006. There are three related themes with associated work packages: acoustic source recognition and characterisation, source localisation using networks, and instrument applications. The output of the three themes is combined in a fourth work package which is the development of the instrument itself. A fifth work package deals specifically with liaison between the team members and with the external supervision.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E008275/1","grantId":"EP/E008275/1","fundValue":"193829","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gui Yun  Tian","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Huddersfield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
