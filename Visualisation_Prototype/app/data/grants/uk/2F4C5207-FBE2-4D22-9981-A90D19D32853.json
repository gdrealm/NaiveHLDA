{"id":"2F4C5207-FBE2-4D22-9981-A90D19D32853","title":"Farm Produced Ultrathin Lightweight Packaging","abstractText":"This applied research project builds on basic research by Valueform Ltd at the BioComposites Centre at BangorUniversity on 'Innovative processing of local agri-fibres'. This project will i) produce novel biocomposite food packaging using plant-based materials; cereal/ oilseed straws/ and others agri-residues, optimising process variables to obtain ultrathin materials ii) confirm use of Innovative farm-based technologies to convert these materials into retail food packages, at costs competitive with concurent non-renewable products. Preliminary investigations show that these biocomposites are more resource efficient than plastics, biopolymers &amp; starch-based alternatives currently available on the market. The packaging products will be biodegradable /compostable &amp; post-use for making medical disposable products such as kidney trays, urinals delivering a very efficient life cycle and also leading to reduction in landfill.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G000859/1","grantId":"TS/G000859/1","fundValue":"244335","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Morus  Elias","coPersons":["Paul  Fowler"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
