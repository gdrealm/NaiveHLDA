{"id":"325D8A6E-743D-47EF-90B1-F4C794C1AE84","title":"The Autism Genome Project","abstractText":"Autism Spectrum Disorders are severe neurodevelopmental disorders, with a prevalence of ~60 in 10000, characterised by impairments in verbal and non-verbal communication, processing social and emotional information and repetitive or stereotyped behaviours. The cause of autism is unknown but there is strong evidence for the involvement of inherited genetic factors. The Autism Genome Project (AGP) proposes to tease apart the complex genetic etiology of autism. The AGP brings together leading experts in autism research from 13 groups in Europe and North America, with expertise in the autism phenotype, statistical genetic analysis, and high-throughput methods of gene discovery. To achieve our goals, the AGP has a powerful resource of 1,496 multiplex families (two or more affected individuals in a family) and ~2,000 trios (one affected individual and both parents). The multiplex family samples have been genotyped and analysed for linkage using a set of 10000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spread across the genome. Analysis of the SNP data using a qualitative autism diagnosis has identified regions on chromosomes 2q, 5p, 7q, 9p, and 11p that likely harbour variants increasing susceptibility to autism. \n\nOur study design will take four parallel, complementary approaches to identify autism susceptibility genes. We will integrate these approaches in a staged design of experiments that maximises our chance of success while being cost effective. We will (1) follow-up our top four-five regions of linkage (2) use the richness of the autism phenotype to help us understand how genetics and different aspects of the clinical picture are related (3) search for changes in copy number (deletions and duplications) throughout the genome that may also be causative for autism and (4) analyse candidate genes for mutations and association with autism. Variants in genes emerging from linkage and fine-mapping, copy number analysis, and data from outside sources will be evaluated in the second and third years of the project through our staged experimental design. The large cohort of AGP trio families will be used as an independent sample for validation of significant findings obtained in the multiplex families. Identifying susceptibility alleles and a proper understanding of the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms will be key to identifying any interacting environmental factors, and for developing rational preventative and treatment strategies to improve quality of life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601030","grantId":"G0601030","fundValue":"804408","fundStart":"2007-04-23","fundEnd":"2010-09-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Monaco","coPersons":["Annemarie  Poustka","Michael  Gill","Bernard J Devlin","Jonathan L.
