{"id":"A0CB1A5C-7D88-4B12-B017-D3CAFB97F758","title":"Enhancing engagement between MidPlus and industry","abstractText":"This project will establish a collaborative framework in which industry can access both High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities and industry standard commercial software packages in a commercially viable and sustainable manner. In particular, we will work with three software vendors (MathWorks, ESI and Wilde) to produce case studies demonstrating the competitive advantage to SMEs that can arise from access to quality software on HPC facilities. The project will also explore the options for more flexible licensing models that are consistent with HPC-on-demand, and will evaluate the scope for SMEs, particularly within the Engineering and Manufacturing sectors within the MidPlus region, to exploit HPC in improving their product design and development cycles.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L019582/1","grantId":"EP/L019582/1","fundValue":"50096","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The grant has only been in place for 12 months and is still in progress, so this is still evolving.

We have been working closely with two software providers to develop new ways to make their software available to their customers on our Regional Centre, and thereby provide enhanced collaboration between academic and industrial R&amp;D.\n\nWe note that the timescales we projected for the final outcomes from this grant to become evident have not yet elapsed. Once complete, the work stemming from this grant will provide new models for software licensing that will make the combination of high-end computing and commercial finite element software more readily available to academic and industrial users within the UK, and will show the synnergistic value of collaboration between Regional d-Infrastructure Centres and Indevpendent Software Vendors.
