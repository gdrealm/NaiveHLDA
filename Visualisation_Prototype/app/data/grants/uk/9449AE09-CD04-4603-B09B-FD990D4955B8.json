Recordings consist in time-series and are collected via multiple electrodes at the surface of the skull. Mathematical operations allow decomposing those recordings into more easy interpretable signals to examine, for instance, different frequencies (e.g. slow and fast fluctuations of the signal). There is currently no tool allowing the statistical assessment of all the EEG dimensions simultaneously (all electrodes, all time points and all frequencies together). Our project aims at providing a freely distributed toolbox allowing such analyses, therefore providing a new way to investigate a lot of research data and potentially generating important new knowledge about the brain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K014218/1","grantId":"BB/K014218/1","fundValue":"11637","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The tools developed in this grant are now in beta version (06 Nov. 2014) and a few selected researchers are trying them. To put this award into the wider context of international brain research, the tools have been integrated into our previously published toolbox which itself is now included into the EEGLAB software, the largest and most popular software in the world to analyse electroencephalographic data. The EEGLAB integration has only been possible because of the new tools developed through the current award.\nExploitation: the tools are freely available on the web, and distributed under GPL.

Recordings consist in time-series and are collected via multiple electrodes at the surface of the skull. Mathematical operations allow decomposing those recordings into more easy interpretable signals to examine, for instance, different frequencies (e.g. slow and fast fluctuations of the signal) or components (the likely cerebral origins making up the recorded signal). In this research we developed tools / software that allow analysing the entire data space simultaneously, as for instance all electrodes on the scalp for all time points collected and throughout all temporal frequencies. \n\nConcretely, we have written code for methods (and validated them through simulations) that allow researchers to perform many statistical tests on the data (that is for the whole data space), while ensuring the results are not just due to chance (a problem known as control of family-wise error rate). These tools are coded in a popular mathematical language/software (MATLAB), are freely available, and are also distributed through another software commonly used to analyse EEG data (EEGLAB). The tools developed are freely available under GPL. This implies that the research outcomes can be (1) used by anyone and (2) incorporated and developed for any other purpose than initially intended.\nIn addition of making sure that this work can be reused, it has been promoted via publications and via the participation of the applicants to workshops and conferences. Future specialist workshops are planned to present the tools and software developed.
