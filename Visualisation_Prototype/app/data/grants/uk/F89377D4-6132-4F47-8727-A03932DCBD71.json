{"id":"F89377D4-6132-4F47-8727-A03932DCBD71","title":"3D World","abstractText":"This project will deliver a cost-effective method of significantly improving the realism in the enhanced 3D online gaming platform under development by Realtime Worlds (RTW), one of Europe's largest independent computer games developers. The project will utilise sensor-derived data, location-based technologies, image processing techniques and user-generated inputs to create automatic mechanisms for the platform to integrate many 'real-world' elements, greatly improving the realism of the immersive experience.This represents a radical departure from traditional methods of development, reducing production costs and significantly improving return on investment. The improved 3D World Platform (3DWP) will target industries requiring a superior platform for highly-realistic, immersive multiplayer online game development. This will penetrate the fastest growing sector of the $3.7 billion worldwide video game market - expected to triple to $12.2 billion within five years, and enhance UK production capabilitiesin this sector. The Mobile Computing and Smart Sensors (MoCASS) Group at the University of Dundee will provide sensor and wireless-location technologies to capture real-time traffic flow data for the virtual world, and image processing and other expertise to enable the estimation of building footprints, heights and form factors from satellite (geomatic) data. The Smart Systems Group at the University of Abertay Dundee will also contribute expertise in sensors, image procesing and database management.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G002916/1","grantId":"TS/G002916/1","fundValue":"270441","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"William Allan Gillespie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
