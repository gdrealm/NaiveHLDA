This research project has measured consumer 'financial sophistication' using research tools from which numerical measures of an individual's understanding of basic concepts in finance such as interest rates can be measured. Findings show that consumers who do not understand basic concepts in finance are more likely to use high cost borrowing products such as payday loans, are more likely to get into problems repaying their debts and are also more likely to make financial mistakes. These findings have been shown for representative samples of UK consumers.\n\nHowever, the project has also discovered that if individuals lack basic financial understanding then money advice providers, such as Stepchange and Citizen's Advice can be a source of help to make up for what consumers do not know. Our research shows that consumers with poorer understanding of financial concepts are more likely to seek advice if they face a financial problem. The research suggests that financial advice can be a form of 'safety net' for consumers who do not properly understand their financial decisions. The findings from this project have already been incorporated into consumer financial protection policies implemented by the UK government. The research has produced core insights which are essential for policymakers buy also extremely beneficial to consumer finance service providers seeking to make their products understandable and attractive to consumers.
