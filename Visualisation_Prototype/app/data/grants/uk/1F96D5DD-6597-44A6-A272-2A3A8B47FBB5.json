It is a disease that seems to be caused by attacks of the immune system on parts of the brain. Many researchers think it may be caused by an unusual response to an infection, as it occurs in clusters, especially in colder climates. The leading candidate infectious agent is Epstein-Barr virus, the cause of glandular fever, which has infected almost all patients with MS. After initial infection, the virus lives on in people as a latent form. We have shown that latent EBV fools the immune system into thinking it is not a problem by stimulating a special sort of immune cell called a regulatory T cell. Knowing that the immune response to EBV may be important in MS, we recently looked at the regulatory T cell response to EBV in patients with MS and found that it was strikingly different to that of healthy people. We now propose to look at these differences in more detail to establish the way in which infection with such a virus might lead to the disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401603","grantId":"G0401603","fundValue":"250158","fundStart":"2005-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Vickers","coPersons":["Robert N.
