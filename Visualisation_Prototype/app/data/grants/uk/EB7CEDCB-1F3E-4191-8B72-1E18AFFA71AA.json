Piccirillo, have been further developed by NASA grant at University of Wisconsin to propose a CMB satellite. In France, the idea has been used to fund a novel instrument (QUBIC) to be installed in Antarctica.

The main ideas developed are: 1) bolometric interferometry; 2)Cryogenic systems for 300mK to 100mK bolometric systems; 3)microwave techniques in thermal detectors. Cryogenic techniques at sub-K temperatures are used in a large variety of instrumentation, from particle physics to medicine. Bolometric interferometry might be a cost effective way to make imaging systems at mm and sub-mm systems without using large optics with many applications in the larger economy like, for example, airport security.
