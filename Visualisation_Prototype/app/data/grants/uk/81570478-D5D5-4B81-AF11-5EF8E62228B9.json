Our work will also impact upon the magnetic fusion program and its quest for a\nsafe, reliable and environmentally friendly energy source.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J000892/1","grantId":"ST/J000892/1","fundValue":"361425","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Badnell","coPersons":["Peter  Storey"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
