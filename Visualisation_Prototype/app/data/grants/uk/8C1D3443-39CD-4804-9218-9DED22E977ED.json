It is structured around two key questions, the first empirical, and the second policy orientated. \n\n1. What is the evidence for decision costs in relation to tax incentivised savings schemes? \nA model of household savings and investment decisions was created to explore behaviour in relation to pensions and Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs). This model was matched to UK survey data, focussed around the population cross-section observed in 2006/07. In the absence of decision costs, the model suggests that three out of every four individuals who hold no ISA investments would immediately open an ISA account. Allowing for decision costs permits the model to reflect realistic annual rates of ISA take-up, which do not exceed 5% of the population aged 20-60.\n\n2. How do decision costs affect responses to the savings incentives that are offered through ISAs? \n\nThe model derived in answering the first question was used to explore behavioural responses to ISAs, and how different assumptions about decisions costs influence those responses. The basic model structure implies that most investments made through ISAs are substituted out of other non-pension wealth, rather than the product of new household saving. In this context, decision costs have an important influence on the scale of the investments made through ISAs, and on who enjoys a welfare gain from the scheme. This analysis highlights the potential importance of decision costs when analysing winners and losers of policy reform. Our findings in relation to decision costs concerning individual investment decisions have important implications for a wide range of individuals, including academics, financial advisers, and government.\n\nOur modelling work will be of direct use to analysts in Whitehall, and can be adapted to other countries' contexts.
