{"id":"FF3FEB83-3C1F-408D-9F65-1BCA0508EFC8","title":"Re-Thinking Economies","abstractText":"<p>This seminar series explores how anthropology can provide an essential counterweight and complement to dominant economic and political macro-analyses of the world today. Each seminar will address emerging economic configurations in a specific area for which grounded anthropological perspectives are needed in order to grasp the full variety of actual practices.</p> \n<p>The series is designed to be cumulative so that each workshop will also address common themes and raise new questions which will then form the basis of the final conference at the LSE in 2007.</p> \n<p>The seminars are both reflexive, examining economic anthropology’s own intellectual trajectory, and will seek to explore how (but also how far) different approaches, views and aims can balance and enhance each other.</p> \n<p>The structure of the four thematic workshops addresses these aims. Along with economic anthropologists, representatives of related disciplines and relevant non-academic groups (eg NGOs, activists, civil servants, trade unions) will contribute to each session. To facilitate wide participation, the workshops will be held across Britain and Italy on the following themes: ‘unequal development: the globalization of apartheid’ (Goldsmiths, London), ‘informal and regional economies’ (Bologna), ‘third sector economies and the state’ (Manchester) and ‘the ethics and economies of bio-privatisation’ (St Andrews).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4140","grantId":"RES-451-25-4140","fundValue":"15434","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine  Alexander","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
