Pluripotency is a functional state that implies the ability to form all tissues in the organism; it simulates the very beginnings of the founder tissue of a foetus. The ability to create this pluripotent state from adult cells in a laboratory liberated researchers from having to rely on embryos to produce these cells, and furthermore allowed them to have cells that were potentially competent to produce any type of cell for tissue regeneration. Given that iPS cells come from adult cells from a prospective patient, the likelihood of rejection from tissues is also significantly reduced. iPS cells therefore represent an attractive source of patient-specific cells for drug discovery, as well as more directly for genetic correction and treatment of numerous human diseases. \nHowever, current reprogramming strategies typically take weeks and the efficiency of this process is extremely low. Furthermore, there is much work to be done to optimize the induction of pluripotency in human cells. Therefore, there is significant scope for advancing the process by which pluripotency is induced. In particular, almost nothing is known about how physical cues such as shape, topography and stiffness might regulate the establishment of pluripotency.\n The lack of insight into how physical cues drive pluripotent reprogramming is particularly interesting considering that pluripotency is originally established in a highly physical environment - the developing embryo. The inspiration for the proposed research is to take what we know about the developing embryo - its spherical shape, its softness, the chemical contacts of pluripotent cells in the embryo - and attempt to create it in laboratory conditions. This is in contrast to the way most iPS research is done, in which the cells are plated on a flat, hard dish made from plastic. We are synthesizing biomimetics - meaning materials that mimic biomaterials - to simulate the embryonic environment as closely as possible to optimise the induction of pluripotency in cells. We propose that this will make the process of reprogramming more efficient, and also that these cells will be highly amenable to being guided into specific tissue cells. We can use the same biomimetic ideas to guide the cells into specific lineages. The ultimate goal of this type of research is to receive cells from a patient and create - using biomimetics - tissue competent cells for regenerating organs. This is a highly cross-disciplinary proposal that will also lend greater insight into pluripotent cell function, and how these cells interact with their environment.\n The research will impact biotechnology, regenerative medicine and stem cell biology. It will bring to bear new insight into how stem cells work, and how we can investigate them. Using our connections in stem cells, biophysics, and biotechnology, we will widely circulate our results, generating impact in several academic disciplines. Given its high potential for impact in regenerative medicine and its highly cross-disciplinary nature, the proposed research is highly suited for the portfolio of the MRC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M011089/1","grantId":"MR/M011089/1","fundValue":"309190","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kevin  Chalut","coPersons":["Jose Carlos  Silva"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
