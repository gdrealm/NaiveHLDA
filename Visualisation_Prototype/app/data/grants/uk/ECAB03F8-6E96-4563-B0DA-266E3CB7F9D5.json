{"id":"ECAB03F8-6E96-4563-B0DA-266E3CB7F9D5","title":"Structural Studies of Pilus Biogenesis and Bacterial Adhesion","abstractText":"We propose here to study the structures of proteins \ninvolved in the pathogenesis caused by uropathogenic \nEscherichia coli. Urinary tract infections are the \nsecond most common infections after infections of the \nrespiratory tract. The infectious process requires \nadhesive hair-like fibres termed pili . Pili serve \nas attachment devices which allow targeting of the \nbacteria to specific host tissues. A pilus is made of \na large number of protein subunits which polymerise \ntogether to form a fibre. At the tip of the pilus, \nthere is a sugar-binding protein (or adhesin ) which \nspecifically recognises receptors displayed at the \nsurface of the host tissue. In this proposal, we plan \nto obtain snapshots of the molecular interactions \nrequired to assemble pili, and those required by the \nadhesin to recognise its cognate receptor. The planned\n research program outlined here will not only \ncontribute to our understanding of pathogenicity \nleading to urinary tract infections but will also \ncontribute to our understanding of diseases caused \nby other bacteria that utilize very similar mechanism \nto assemble pili and to recognise their receptor. \nSuch bacteria include Haemophilus influenzae \n(causing ottitis media, or meningitis) or Salmonella \ntyphimurium (causing gastroenteritis): any insight \nacquired on the uropathogenic E. coli system will \nbenefit investigations of a wide range of pathogens. \nStructural studies will also help design new \nantibiotic drugs which will target either pilus \nassembly or bacterial adhesion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0100442","grantId":"G0100442","fundValue":"1144020","fundStart":"2003-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gabriel  Waksman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
