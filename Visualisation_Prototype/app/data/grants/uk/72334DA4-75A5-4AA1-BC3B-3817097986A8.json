These diseases have a significant impact on animal health and represent a financial burden to countries worldwide. This collaborative project will deliver a magnetic sensor-based device and surveillance system which would provide early detection of disease and enable quick action in order to reduce the risk of disease spread, with economic benefits to farmers and food producers and welfare benefits to farm animals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N00387X/1","grantId":"BB/N00387X/1","fundValue":"200155","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Federica  Di Palma","coPersons":["Matthew Derek Clark"],"organisation":"The Genome Analysis Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
