Terrestrial photosynthesis is intimately connected with our use of other natural resources, and it exerts major controls on the water, mineral and carbon cycles of the world. For example, plant transpiration is thought to have contributed to recent changes in fresh-water availability associated with the global rise in CO2, and it is at the centre of a crisis in water availability expected over the next 20-30 years. Over this same period it is estimated that a 50% increase in global food production will be required to keep pace with the increase in human population. Crop yields have matched population growth until recently, but the gains from cereal cultivars bred in the Green Revolution were realised in full a decade ago. Thus it is vital that routes to further improvements in photosynthetic efficiency are sought now. In most species, CO2 is fixed by Ribulose Bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase (RuBisCO) in the Calvin-Benson cycle to generate a three-carbon compound. RuBisCO is remarkably poor in its substrate selectivity and promiscuously fixes both CO2 and O2, a fact that makes RuBisCO arguably the most inefficient step in photosynthesis. One way of reducing O2 use by RuBisCO is to raise the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). So-called carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) have evolved multiple times in nature, albeit not as a feature of most common crop species. Thus, comparisons suggest roughly a 50% increase in overall yield might be realised if O2 use by RuBisCO were bypassed in crops. Significant resources have gone into engineering RuBisCO for increased CO2 selectivity and introducing a single-celled version of C4 photosynthesis in rice, but these approaches have yet to see a step change in photosynthetic efficiency. One new set of strategies yet to be explored is to co-opt light-driven pumps, anion exchange transport and substrate channelling to supply CO2 to RuBisCO. To date none of these processes is known to facilitate photosynthesis, although all three occur naturally and have been employed synthetically in biology. It is our goal to develop the equivalent of a 'two-stage pump': placing in series (1) a transport mechanism to concentrate HCO3- in the chloroplast powered by the light-driven ion pump halorhodopsin (hR) from the archeon Halobacterium halobium, and (2) substrate channelling within the chloroplast using one or more molecular 'building blocks' from Clostridium or cyanobacteria to carry HCO3- or a four-carbon intermediate to RuBisCO. This two-stage strategy is expected to maximise CCM gain driven independently with light energy absorbed by hR, and it has the added potential for engineering hR to tap the unused asset of light beyond the photosynthetic spectrum. Furthermore, an overarching feature of this approach is in its modular nature: it will be possible to develop each stage of the two-stage pump in parallel, and to assess its functionality separately at molecular, cellular and whole-organismal levels, combining the components thereafter for final validation. This modular approach ensures the maximum efficiency and speed in realising our goal within the three-year period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I02450X/1","grantId":"BB/I02450X/1","fundValue":"199054","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  No societal economic impacts to date.

So-called carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) have evolved multiple times in nature, albeit not as a feature of most common crop species. The strategy we explored was to co-opt light-driven pumps from bacteria, anion exchange transport and substrate channelling to supply CO2 to RuBisCO, reengineering the chloroplast to improve photosynthesis efficacy. We made significant progress towards this goal, succeeding in expressing functioning components, including ion pumps and scaffolds in chloroplasts, and we have an excellent understanding of the design parameters for transport and scaffolding through mathematical modelling. For the latter we constructed full 3D realistic chloroplast models, from which we predicted gains in carbon fixation across a range of pump characteristics. Crucially we identified a previously unknown sensitivity to the pump concentration, thereby greatly aiding the chloroplast design. This design is currently being implemented in a follow on grant, BB/M011291/1. By determining a biotechnology design for a bicarbonate importing chloroplast we have identified the crucial design features that have to be met. This is now being taken forward in our follow on grant BB/M011291/1. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
