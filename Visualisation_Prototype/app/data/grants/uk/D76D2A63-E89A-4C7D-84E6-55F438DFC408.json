{"id":"D76D2A63-E89A-4C7D-84E6-55F438DFC408","title":"NETWORK: Advanced Microtechnologies for Microsurgery","abstractText":"Microsurgery and cell surgery require precise interaction between tissues and tools at a scale that is below the dexterity and perception thresholds of clinical operators. Currently operators rely on microscopes, manual and micrometer tools to accomplish processes. The frequency of processes at this scale is increasing in the light of current benefits of minimal access procedures and as the benefits of biotechnology processes requiring the manipulation of cellular tissue are understood. Clinical procedures, known as minimally invasive procedures, involving for example laparoscopy and endoscopy, have been explored with robotic tools and have shown some success. The advance in technologies in terms of micro-fabrication, nanoscience and bionanotechnology have introduced further opportunities for micro-sensing, micro-mechanisms and micro-actuators that offer new potential for surgical and diagnostic tools in microsurgery and cell surgery applications.The Network will define short and longer-term strategies to advance this technology for this application field towards the benefit of the UK. Network members are leaders from the multi-disciplines of engineering, science, medicine, healthcare, biology and business. Collectively they will contribute and steer this research study through a programme of workshops addressing future and current clinical needs, the potential of recent new solution technologies, application categories and impact, resulting changes in healthcare delivery, ethics and further technological needs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C51601X/1","grantId":"EP/C51601X/1","fundValue":"62316","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Nigel  Brett","coPersons":["Xianghong  Ma"],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
