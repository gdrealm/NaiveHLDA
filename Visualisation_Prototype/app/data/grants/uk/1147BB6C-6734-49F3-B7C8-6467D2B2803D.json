However, the biology of stem cells is complex, reflecting their role in maintaining body tissues through a continual, highly regulated process of self-renewal. Unravelling this complexity will require deeper insights into development and cell biology, genetics, molecular biology and other disciplines. The ultimate goal of harnessing this knowledge for patient applications requires a long-term commitment. It will involve studying multiple types of stem cells in considerable detail. The combined forces of basic stem cell biologists and clinician scientists needed to characterise stem cells and their differentiated progeny for medical applications have not yet been assembled elsewhere in the UK. The University of Cambridge is one of few places where this goal can be accomplished. Therefore, the Cambridge Centre for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine is being established to achieve this purpose. Its three programmes will focus on pluripotent stem cells, cancer stem cells and neural repair. The Centre?s mission is to gain a greater understanding of the properties of these stem cells and to exploit them for patient benefits.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800784","grantId":"G0800784","fundValue":"2069660","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger Arnold Pedersen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
