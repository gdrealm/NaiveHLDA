They can combine the advantages of both the organic and inorganic components and are based on a wide suite of possible materials and structures with potential for low cost manufacture. Controlling the structural arrangements (morphology) of semiconducting polymer/nanocrystal composites is a key challenge that has major implications for next generation optoelectronic devices. These devices detect and control or emit light. Here, we focus on semiconducting polymer/nanocrystal composites with potential solar energy applications. Building on our proof-of-principle study we aim to combine control of nanocrystal geometry and composition with their spatial arrangements within semiconducting polymer/nanocrystal composites to establish solar cells with improved efficiencies. We will construct new nanocrystals and establish new methods for achieving precisely controlled morphologies within polymer/nanocrystal composites using approaches that are scaleable and potentially low cost. A successful outcome to this study would result in a step-change in polymer/nanocrystal composite morphology control and a new generation of high efficiency polymer/nanocrystal solar cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K009710/1","grantId":"EP/K009710/1","fundValue":"585553","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-24","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  O'Brien","coPersons":["Brian  Saunders"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
