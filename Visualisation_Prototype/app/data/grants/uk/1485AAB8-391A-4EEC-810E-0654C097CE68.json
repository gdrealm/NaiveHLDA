This affects the making of new memories and we believe that it is also impairs the up-dating of newly acquired memories. With ageing the properties of nerve cells in the hippocampus change, impairing the communication between nerve cells. However, as the making of new memories is not fully abolished in old age, the question arises as to what mechanism accounts for memory making in old age. Our recent innovative collaborative study, published in PNAS, proposes such a mechanism. Using a mouse model, we have shown for the first time that the generation of a particular connection between nerve cells, so-called multi-innervated dendritic spines, leads to memory making when the strengthening of existing connections is impaired. This scaling effect of alterations of spines in distal neural circuits, in effect compensates for the synaptic impairments, which is confirmed by our recent data. The memory making that involves multi-innervated dendritic spines requires more training and it is less flexible in comparison to memory making relying on strengthening of existing connections. Our studies propose the hypothesis that in old age memory formation depends on the generation of multi-innervated dendritic spines and that because of this mechanism memory formation is slowed down and newly acquired memories are less flexible. Here, we will test this hypothesis. We will study hippocampus-dependent memory of young adult and aged mice after training in two behavioural tasks and we will investigate the impact of manipulations of the generation of multi-innervated dendritic spines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021423/1","grantId":"BB/J021423/1","fundValue":"357979","fundStart":"2013-03-25","fundEnd":"2016-03-24","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Not yet.

Specifically, we have found that in old age training-induced autophosphorylation of alphaCaMKII is impaired and PSD-95 expression becomes upregulated. The upregulation of PSD-95 is a required for the generation of multi-innervated dendritic spines (MIS), a particular type of synapse that typically receives two inputs. \n\n2) We have generated two adeno-associated viruses to overexpress either wild-type PSD-95 or PSD-95 lacking the PDZ2 domian that is required for MIS generation. Further, we have obtained a PSD-95 knockdown virus that is currently being assessed for its use to manipulate PSD-95 expression in our system.\n\n3) We have provided tissue samples after training for EM analysis for our collaborator Prof. Mike Stewart to test the hypothesis that MIS generation enables learning in old age.\n\n4) We found that conditioning with 2 or 5 trials results in similar memory scores in young and old mice. Now, we optimizing experimental conditions to test the idea that updating of memory in old age is impaired after retrieval, as expected for generation of MIS. At this stage our findings are too preliminary to be taken forward by others. We need first to conclude the molecular, EM and behavioural analyses before others can take advantage of our findings.
