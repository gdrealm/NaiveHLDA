DCAL's research provides a unique perspective on language and thought by placing sign languages and Deaf people in the centre of our understanding of language and communication.<br /><br />DCAL’s research since 2006 has contributed substantially to the recognition that deafness is an important model for exploring questions in linguistics, cognitive sciences and neuroscience.<br /><br />Two overarching themes drive our research:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>How is communication shaped by deafness and the use of sign language?</li>\n\n <li>How does deafness and early language experience impact on cognitive functions beyond language?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>For both themes we consider the effects of deafness, delayed language development and sign language use across the life span by studying children, adolescents and adults including those with impaired signing, comparing them to non-signers, both hearing and deaf, at&nbsp; behavioural and neural levels.<br /><br />DCAL is the largest research centre in this field in Europe with nearly 30 staff and research students, about 1/3 of whom are deaf. We are committed to knowledge exchange relating to our research agenda from professional groups who work with d/Deaf individuals and organisations of and for the d/Deaf.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-620-28-0002","grantId":"RES-620-28-0002","fundValue":"4431350","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Health Care and Services\nAs a direct result of DCAL research, the NHS has established the first neuropsychology clinic for Deaf patients who use British Sign Language within the Cognitive Disorders clinic at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN). By developing services for this under-researched group, NHS provision has become accessible for the first time. The research has also demonstrated an international demand for adaptations of the tools created to assess cognition and language in this group; (2) the extent of the previously unmet demand for clinical services for this excluded population; (3) the cost benefit of service provision; (4) the developing influence of this work on UK government policy.Thus the programme of research has had impacts on clinical services for deaf patients, and on wider government policy in this area.\nEducational\nSign Language assessment tools created by DCAL researchers have been adapted for on-line administration on a dedicated website. This provides teachers and other professionals working with deaf children with the ability to compare individuals with a national sample, and store scores to enable longitudinal data collection and record-keeping. It also enables DCAL to continually update normative data.
