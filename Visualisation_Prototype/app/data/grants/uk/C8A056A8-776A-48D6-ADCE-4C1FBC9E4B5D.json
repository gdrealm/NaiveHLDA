About 1 in 100 women experience preeclampsia before 32 weeks of pregnancy. The only effective treatment is to deliver the baby prematurely, but this has serious consequences for the baby. Watchful waiting, often employed clinically to allow the baby?s lungs to mature, risks progression of disease severity in the mother. A cheap and effective therapy for prevention of preeclampsia complications is urgently needed.\n\nIt is not known what causes preeclampsia but recently some blood molecules (called anti-angiogenic factors) known to affect blood flow are higher in women with PE. These anti-angiogenic factors when given to pregnant animals mimic preeclampsia. Drugs called statins, which lower cholesterol, reduce the levels of these molecules. It is not known whether statins can reduce the severity and complications of preeclampsia.\n\nWe will test the idea that statins can reduce these molecules in preeclamptic women before 32 weeks of pregnancy and decrease the severity of preeclampsia. Doctors from six hospitals will seek consent from these women. Those who are suitable and agree, will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will get a daily dose of statin. The other will get a dummy sugar pill (placebo). We hope to recruit 128 women. Neither the women nor their doctors will know what group they are in. In this way, we can be confident that any differences between the two groups are due to treatment. Women will stay in hospital and be closely monitored, and if the preeclampsia gets worse, their baby will be delivered.\n\nThis trial is unique because it is the first to test whether statins can reduce the severity of preeclampsia and because statins are not prescribed normally to pregnant women. There is some concern that statins may cause congenital defects in the baby, but we have found no convincing evidence to support this. Furthermore, we believe it is safe to give statins later in pregnancy once the baby?s organs have already developed. However, all side effects and complications will be closely monitored.\n\nIf this small trial shows that the severity of preeclampsia is reduced, and there are few side effects, a bigger trial will be organised to determine if statins can increase the length of pregnancy and reduce the number of premature deliveries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701824","grantId":"G0701824","fundValue":"625244","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Asif  Ahmed","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
