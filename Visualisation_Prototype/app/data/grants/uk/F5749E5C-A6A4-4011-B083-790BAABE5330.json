Despite being so different, all our cells carry exactly the same information in their genes. What makes them special is what information they use, that is, which genes they switch on and off.\n\nThe information on how to make a cell is stored in the form of a DNA molecule. However, this information cannot be read directly: it first needs to be copied into another molecule called RNA, from which it can be 'translated' into a protein. Proteins are the components that directly build the cell and make it function.\n\nThe amount of each RNA molecule in a cell has to be carefully controlled. For example, many diseases -such as cancer- appear when cells contain the wrong amounts of certain RNAs. The levels of all RNAs are set by the balance between how quickly they are made and how fast they are destroyed. Although both aspects are equally important, we know much less about how cells control the destruction of RNAs.\n\nFrom the moment an RNA molecule is made, different proteins attach to it. These proteins, called RNA-binding proteins, decide when the RNA should be destroyed. When RNA-binding proteins do not function correctly, the cell loses control of the production of many proteins, and this may cause disease. For instance, defects in certain RNA-binding proteins lead to consequences such as muscular dystrophy or mental retardation.\n\nOur aim is to understand how RNA-binding proteins control the destruction of RNA molecules. One way to study a complicated process of the human body is to use a model organism: this is a simpler creature, but similar enough to allow us to learn about ourselves. To study how RNA-binding proteins work we will use a simple yeast -made of a single cell- that can acquire different forms. We will remove RNA-binding proteins to see how this changes the way in which RNAs are destroyed, and we will study which RNAs are bound by different RNA-binding proteins. This will allow us to understand how cells control their genes in order to become different. We expect this information will be useful to understand how human cells behave and, eventually, help us devise cures for disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J007153/1","grantId":"BB/J007153/1","fundValue":"505005","fundStart":"2012-07-20","fundEnd":"2016-07-19","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The main impact on the grant so far has been academic (see relevant output section)  ","person":"Juan Ignacio Mata","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" Key finding: Discovery of hundreds of new genes. \nOur bodies are made of very different types of cells: Skin cells are flat and protect our body, while brain cells have cables that pass messages around. Despite being so different, all our cells carry exactly the same information in their genes. What makes them special is what information they use, that is, which genes they switch on and off. The information on how to make a cell is stored in the form of a DNA molecule. However, this information cannot be read directly: it first needs to be copied into another molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA), from which it can be 'translated' into a protein. Proteins are the components that directly build the cell and make it function. Cells also produce other RNAs that are not translated to make proteins (non-coding RNAs, or ncRNAs), which have other roles in the cell. The identity of a protein can be predicted from the sequence of the RNA. Moreover, proteins can also be identified directly using specialized techniques. However, both approaches are very inefficient at identifying very small proteins. Thus, these proteins have been largely ignored by researchers, even though there are examples of small proteins with key biological functions. A new experimental method has been recently developed that allows the detection of every RNA region that is actively translated in a cell. From these data, all proteins can be predicted regardless of their size. The method is called 'ribosome-profiling' after the ribosome, which is the cellular machine that carries out translation. The application of this approach to several organisms has revealed the existence of hundreds of previously unknown predicted short proteins. Many of these translated regions were in RNAs that were not thought to be translated (ncRNAs). In some organisms, these short may proteins represent as much as 20% of all previously known proteins. These results demonstrate that cells produce many more proteins than previously thought. Studying these new proteins will be crucial to understand how healthy cells behave, and what goes wrong during disease.
