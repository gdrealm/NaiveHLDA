An initial survey identifies and classifies surviving pre-1939 library buildings and forms the basis for the architectural history of an important Victorian and early 20th century civic institution with ambitious social objectives and an iconography to support them. In the final phase of the project we will examine case studies of schemes to upgrade historic buildings to meet the present needs of service providers and users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E505058/1","grantId":"AH/E505058/1","fundValue":"33493","fundStart":"2007-01-21","fundEnd":"2007-05-20","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Pepper","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
