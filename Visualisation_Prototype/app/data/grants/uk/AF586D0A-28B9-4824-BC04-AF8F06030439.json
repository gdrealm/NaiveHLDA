{"id":"AF586D0A-28B9-4824-BC04-AF8F06030439","title":"Influence of molecular structure of various hydrocarbons on soot formation","abstractText":"Many types of combustion system emit particles into the atmosphere which are known to be a major hazard due to their toxicity to human health, particularly the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The smaller particles (less than about 100nm in size) are believed to be the most hazardous, as they can penetrate deep into the human lung. The purpose of this proposal is to gather scientific information on how the structure of fuel molecules affects the production of soot and particulates. During the next 10 to 20 years one can anticipate increasing interest in synthetic fuels which use molecules specifically developed to burn more efficiently and cleanly. The development of such molecules will require knowledge of how different molecular structures affect the production of harmful particulates and other emissions. Such clean fuels may be derived from fossil sources such as coal or increasingly from biomass (starches, sugars, and cellulosic materials) using chemical or biological conversion methods. The proposed project aims to determine in detail which features of a molecule's structure are responsible for producing more soot than others. The project relies on a new methodology which has not been used by the combustion research community previously to any significant extent. The methodology involves the replacement within a hydrocarbon molecule of selected commonplace 12C atoms with 13C atoms carrying a stable isotope label (extra neutron) which survives combustion intact, without altering the chemical and transport properties of the molecule. This label , which can be detected in the soot particles, provides a unique ability to determine which atoms or group of atoms of a molecule become soot particles. Two extensive series of experiments will be conducted, the first on a laminar diffusion flame and the second on a diesel engine. Unlike a diesel engine, the laminar flame allows the principal influences on soot formation to be chemical ones, by eliminating spray formation and evaporation and the effects of turbulent mixing and intermittent combustion. A laminar flame also allows readily the sampling and analysis of the contents of its envelope and it permits the introduction of controlled amounts of oxygen and other diluents at its base so as to study how these diluents affect soot formation. The second series of experiments will be on a diesel engine which represents a commonplace practical combustion system. Although the fuel spray in a diesel engine is less accessible, a diesel engine it is a truly realistic environment in which the pollutant particulate is formed. A total of 15, 13C-labelled fuel molecules have been selected to study the effect of their structure on soot and particulate formation. These 15 molecules have a wide range of structural features that could potentially affect soot and particulate formation and the 13C labelling method will allow the influences of these features to be evaluated. By the completion of the project it is envisaged that the knowledge gained could guide the production of future synthetic fuels so that the molecules they contain result in less soot and toxic particulates when combusted.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I006044/1","grantId":"EP/I006044/1","fundValue":"176715","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been published and presented in scientific symposia, and also presented to BP Oil Company, which is a major international producer of fuels.

The fuel molecules are then combusted and the soot/particulate pollutant formed during combustion is analysed. The isotopically labelled carbon atoms that were originally in the fuel are now traced in the soot/particulate pollutant. By comparing how many labelled atoms were in the fuel with how many of them were found in the soot/particulate matter, it is possible to know the likelihood that a particular carbon atom in the fuel molecule being converted to soot/particulate. The methodology has been applied to several fuel molecules, alcohols, esters, acetates, alkanes, aromatics, etc, and the results reported in the open literature through published papers in international journals. The findings have been published in international journals such as Combustion and Flame and have been presented in key symposia. Environment,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
