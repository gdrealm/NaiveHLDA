Genetic research can therefore identify DNA changes that cause susceptibility to these mental illnesses. Genetic linkage studies of families have identified which chromosomes the genes for these types of depression are localised on. However, new technology borrowed from the microelectronics industry has enabled the University Collele London research group and their USA collaborators to rapidly identify at least thirty nine new genes likely to be causing genetic susceptibility to depression. We now wish to develop this research by identifying the precise genetic abnormalities in these genes that increase susceptibility to bipolar disorder. Abnormalities that are found will be studied for their clinical effects and their role in the variability of psychiatric symptoms and responsiveness to drug treatments. The identification of pathways involved in disease susceptibility should lead to the creation of new treatments and prevention strategies for bipolar and other types of affective disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701007","grantId":"G0701007","fundValue":"456286","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Hugh Malcolm  Gurling","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
