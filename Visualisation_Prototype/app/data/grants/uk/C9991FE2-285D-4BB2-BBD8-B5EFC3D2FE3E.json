{"id":"C9991FE2-285D-4BB2-BBD8-B5EFC3D2FE3E","title":"Applications of mathematics in the geosciences","abstractText":"A group of applied mathematicians will gather together with a group of geoscientists to consider the formulation and solution of problems which are of paramount importance in current concerns over the effect of human actions on the environment. Three particular problem areas will be considered: the possibility for sudden collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and a consequent abrupt rise in sea level; the problem of how best to use microbial biodegradation as a natural way of decontaminating polluted land; and the ways in which the Earth's surface is eroded through the action of wind and water.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D06936X/1","grantId":"EP/D06936X/1","fundValue":"40097","fundStart":"2006-09-17","fundEnd":"2008-03-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Fowler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
