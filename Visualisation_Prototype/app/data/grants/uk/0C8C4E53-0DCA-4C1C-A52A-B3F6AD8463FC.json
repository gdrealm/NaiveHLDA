The grant facilitates exchange of post-graduate students and early post-doctoral scientists. To date we have held a workshop in Beijing, two students have spent time at NW and one UK student has visited China for 3 months. The students have learned new techniques that they will use in their studies, there has been increased collaboration between the partners. One of the students, Liu Wei, who spent time at NW has subsequently graduated and been funded to work on a project using the skills he learned in the UK. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
