Moreover, the effects of group identification on health will be compared with the effects exerted by other factors known to predict health, such as socio-economic status and health-related behaviours.The degree to which the effects of group identification on health are independent from the effects of these other factors will also be considered. The prediction that the effects of group identification on health are mediated by perceived social support (ie, the extent to which group members feel they can rely on each other for assistance) will also be tested.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve these aims, the proposed research will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>test a large sample of participants (N = ~16,000), drawn from two nations (~8,000 from Scotland and ~8,000 from Italy)</li>\n\n <li>use a longitudinal design (two waves across a two-year period: 2012-2014)</li>\n\n <li>use an extended range of physical and mental health indicators.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I038349/1","grantId":"ES/I038349/1","fundValue":"431667","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Research is still in progress and only some of my findings have just been published.

We have also found greater levels of education to be associated with lower number of received prescriptions for analgesics.
