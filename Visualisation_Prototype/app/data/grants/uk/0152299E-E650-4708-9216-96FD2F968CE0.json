These include our findings on how voluntary organisations may engage with whole families rather than individuals; and our case studies of innovative practice and strategies for managing change. \n\nInvited feedback on our materials via our intensive consultation enabled us to modify our outputs and web resources to increase their utility for practitioners, and also revealed that the materials are being swiftly utilised by our key stakeholders in planning and structures for third sector organisations. This collaboration between Leeds, Birmingham and senior executives of major voluntary sector organisations has opened up discussions and explored dynamic strategies for meeting the challenges facing voluntary organisations. \n\nTechnical development\nAdditionally, we have built capacity in data management, archiving and the secondary analysis of QL research in both academic and practice settings through the development and use of the Changing Landscapes datasets. The new functionality for EPrints in the area of access control has generated considerable interest nationally and is likely to be widely adopted as a core component of EPrints in the near future. It is anticipated that our technical developments will have an impact on research data management in the HE sector, particularly, but not exclusively, for HEIs using EPrints.

Knowledge Exchange and Synthesis\nAcross our network of QL projects we explored how UK voluntary organisations have responded to rapid change over the past decade. Six core themes were identified (sustainability, independence, hybridisation, participation, inter-organisational relationships and impact), which informed our synthesis of 29 project reports and papers. Much research has anticipated that economic recession and public sector austerity, coupled with changing political priorities for the relationship between the voluntary sector and the state, will result in higher demand for the sector's services at a time of constrained resources. Although registered charities show a gradual austerity-related downward trend of aggregate income, figures are broadly stable over time and evidence for wholesale closure of voluntary organisations and community groups is thin. The synthesis provides some explanation for this apparent paradox between a challenging environment, yet organisational survival.\nVoluntary organisations have been actively pursuing a range of adjustment strategies designed to keep essential services to meet increasing needs on more limited resources, including: restructuring, redundancies (including shorter hours, and transferring some hitherto paid work to a voluntary basis), greater attention to collaboration and partnership working (albeit with mixed interest in mergers), and intensified efforts to reposition and rebrand organisations over time. Competing conceptions of forward strategies are being formulated and promoted. One strong vision is of the necessity of 'transition', where voluntary organisations adapt their focus and strategies to become more enterprising and business-like. The study has also shed light on the concept and implementation of 'social value' in commissioning; and the value of understanding the recent past as a platform for current trajectories (e.g. at community level, in relation to community regeneration). \n 2. Secondary Analysis\nSecondary analysis of 78 QL interviews, drawn from two data sets - Real Times (Third Sector Research Centre), and Pathways through Participation (National Council for Voluntary Organisations/IVR/Involve) - explored the dynamics of volunteering. Volunteering research is often de-contextualised and a-historical, focusing on aggregate trends or engagement in one particular voluntary activity or at one point in time. Yet volunteering is dynamic and situated within multi-layered contexts. Our dynamic analyses revealed that: \no Volunteering can only be understood in the context of other aspects of individual's lives - e.g., work, family, leisure,- and how these varied trajectories intersect and change over time. \no Volunteering processes are embedded within family relationships and can be passed on, negotiated, shared and fought over on a collective basis.\no Volunteering is also affected by organisational contexts: as organisations evolve over time, the spaces for and experiences of volunteering change. This can affect recruitment, retention and outcomes.\no Community contexts are vital sources of identity and meaning that shape and are shaped by volunteering processes. Community boundaries indicate the existence of insiders and outsiders, affecting people's participatory possibilities.\n\nThe synthesis and secondary analysis work demonstrated the value of scaling up QL research to broaden geographical and historical reach and enhance the evidence base. Bringing the projects together enabled us to create 'big' rich data that, crucially, retains its depth and explanatory power. We intend to respond to the recent ESRC Civil Society Data Partnerships call with research building on our methodological developments in this study. Conceptual and instrumental impact is being created for:\no models of volunteering, and the structure of organisational health checks;\no development of reflective practice-research dialogue concerning the implementation of a voluntary, sector-led partnership programme of work supporting adults with multiple and complex needs \no development of an interactive timeline of successive phases of community development in a deprived urban area Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
