{"id":"B43F31E0-BFC1-4C93-844A-453740CFDC12","title":"Milner Symposium 2012","abstractText":"The purpose of this research grant is to support a unique event where leading computer scientists from around the world come together at a memorial symposium held in Edinburgh in honour of one of the world's leading computer scientists, Robin Milner, who died in 2010. The speakers at the symposium have strong connections to Robin Milner's work and his legacy. They cross a broad spectrum of specialisms across artificial intelligence and computer science from automatic theorem proving to programming language design to the theory of concurrent and communicating systems to modelling and understanding complex pervasive and ubiquitous systems.\n\nMany of the speakers are themselves very distinguished and highly regarded researchers in their own right but they are united in having been inspired and influenced by Robin Milner's ideas, his methods, and his work. Because it is highly unusual to have such a distinguished programme of speakers, the symposium provides a unique opportunity for students, early career researchers, or more senior researchers to learn from, and benefit from, pioneering work of huge significance and impact.\n\nIn addition to speakers from research labs and universities, the symposium will also feature industrial participants who have followed a path which has been shaped by Robin Milner's lifelong belief that work in theoretical computer science should provide strong foundations for computing practice, software engineering, and applied practical work in the design, development and maintenance of computer and communication systems. The industrial speakers at the Milner symposium are leading examples of how theory can be applied in practice and bring unexpected and surprising benefits.\n\nEvents such as these are a melting pot for ideas and they both inform and inspire. Progress in science is made at events such as these where participants come together and discuss and exchange ideas. Collaborations between previously unrelated researchers can be started at events such as these, leading to new research projects, new discoveries and new breakthroughs. Different from a conventional conference, where the participants are members of one community and are focused on a particular approach to a particular problem, the Milner symposium crosses many boundaries between communities, as Robin Milner's work did. In such a setting, serendipitous meetings can take place leading to fresh ideas and remarkable insights.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J019712/1","grantId":"EP/J019712/1","fundValue":"22300","fundStart":"2012-04-16","fundEnd":"2013-01-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This was a symposium, so impact was immediate on the many participants.

The three main themes were: proof assistants for program correctness, functional programming languages, and concurrency. The speakers had 40 minutes (rather than the usual conference 25 minute allowance) to discuss their work, other relevant work, and future perspectives. In addition there were two panels, one entitled &amp;quot;the future of functional programming languages&amp;quot; (and funded by BCS), the other entitled &amp;quot;The future of concurrency: which solutions to which problems.&amp;quot; Both panels involved world-leading figures in their areas. Both presentations and panels included generous time for audience participation. Contributors included both academics and industrialists.\n\nIn order to maximise attendance the meeting registration fee was kept low, partly with the aid of generous University support. Special provision was made for PhD students, including a yet lower registration fee. Students are the future, and we wanted to ensure they could benefit from Milner's ideas and their development; this included SICSA funding for Scottish students.
