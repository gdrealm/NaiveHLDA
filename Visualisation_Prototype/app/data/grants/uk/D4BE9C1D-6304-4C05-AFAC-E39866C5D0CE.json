{"id":"D4BE9C1D-6304-4C05-AFAC-E39866C5D0CE","title":"Connections between belief revision, belief merging and voting","abstractText":"There is a strong connection between logical theories of belief revision and merging and decision/voting theory. They share the common mechanism of trying to resolve conflicting alternatives. In belief revision, an agent is faced with the problem of choosing between several alternatives when trying to restore consistency to theory. Ideally, the choice process is conducted in a way that verifies a number of fairness principles. On the other hand, belief merging concerns with the problem of determining a group's beliefs from individual members' beliefs that are not always compatible with each other. Similarly, in voting systems, a social welfare function takes individual preferences into account in order to produce a collective preference. Here again certain fairness principles are desirable. In spite of the similarities, the basic approach and the methodologies used in each of these areas differ from one another. In a recent publication ( Belief revision, belief merging and voting ), we provided a framework that makes it possible to study them in an uniform way. Our initial findings suggest that there is a wealth of possibilities of research on the connection. The motivation for the workshop is to promote discussion and cross-fertilisation between the three areas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E034446/1","grantId":"EP/E034446/1","fundValue":"6290","fundStart":"2006-10-16","fundEnd":"2007-03-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Odinaldo Teixeira Rodrigues","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
