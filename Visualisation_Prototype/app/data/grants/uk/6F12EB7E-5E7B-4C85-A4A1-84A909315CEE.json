{"id":"6F12EB7E-5E7B-4C85-A4A1-84A909315CEE","title":"Exploring the characteristics of imitation in Parkinson's disease","abstractText":"<p>Parkinson’s disease is a common neurological disorder, which has a profound effect on movement. People find it hard to initiate movements and often make smaller movements, such as taking shorter steps. Currently, cues are used to improve people’s movements, for example, markers on the floor to encourage longer steps. This project will investigate another possible way of eliciting movements in Parkinson’s - imitation. Even just watching a movement primes people to make the same movement themselves, tapping into movement areas of their brain.This could facilitate movements in Parkinson’s, but there has been little research into imitation in Parkinson’s.<br /><br />This project will examine how effectively imitation can improve movement in people with Parkinson’s, compared to a group of healthy volunteers of a similar age. They will copy a simple sequence of hand movements from a video clip and this will be compared to when they are instructed verbally to make the hand movements. Measuring the speed and distance that they move their hand will reveal how effective their movements are. Understanding how Parkinson’s affects imitation will inform the development of therapeutic interventions and day-to-day strategies using imitation, which have the potential to improve the quality of life of people with Parkinson’s.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K013564/1","grantId":"ES/K013564/1","fundValue":"313385","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2017-03-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Not applicable as we do not yet have any published findings as this project is still at an early stage.

Although we are at an early stage of data collection, we anticipate that this project will produce the scientific groundwork needed to inform the incorporation of imitation into interventions, which will benefit people with Parkinson's, their families, and practitioners who work with this group. Users of this research will include other researchers outside of our immediate collaborators, who may also capitalise on our findings and apply them to the design of interventions.
