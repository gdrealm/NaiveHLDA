It builds on two existing initiatives:\n1. An archive of 3000 qualitative video and audio interviews on over 80 topics with users about their health and illness experiences held by the Health Experiences Research Group (HERG), University of Oxford (and disseminated publicly on www.healthtalkonline.org run by the DIPEx Charity)\n2. Experience-Based Co-Design (EBCD), a participatory action research approach which actively involves service users in service design and has been implemented in over 60 care services in six different countries since being piloted in 2006. Past evaluations have shown it to be effective in achieving quality improvement and cultural change.\nBoth initiatives include video-recorded in-depth interviews with people talking about their experiences. HERG interviews are nationally collected and wide-ranging, whereas EBCD interviews are collected locally with a more specific focus on 'touchpoints' - key interactions between users and services where quality improvements can be made - in each care setting. In EBCD analysis of these touchpoints is used to create a 'trigger' film which staff and users watch together to start a discussion about improving care locally, before setting up co-design working groups to plan and implement changes together.\nThese two initiatives have already collaborated on a recent study for the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) which demonstrated EBCD in two care pathways based on secondary analysis of HERG interviews rather than new local interviews worked just as well, saving time and cost.\nThis provides a strong evidence base to propose further secondary analysis to support care organisations seeking to apply experience-based quality improvement in an affordable and timely way across more conditions. We will reanalyse ten of our existing interview collections. In each case the primary research question for the secondary analysis will be: What touchpoints do users identify in their experiences of care where quality could be improved?\nThe HERG collections are generally focused around a particular condition or health topic. However, there is much material in the collections that could inform service settings and integration of care across sectors. Alongside the analysis for touchpoints in each condition, we will also ask: What are the touchpoints for a) outpatient care and b) interactions between health and social care across a range of different conditions which could be used to redesign services? \nThe secondary analyses will involve a researcher going back to the full transcript collection to identify touchpoints. On healthtalkonline, we also have a set of lay summaries identifying key topics of importance to interview participants in each condition (though not specifically analysed for touchpoints). A key further empirical question to ask is therefore: What touchpoints would emerge from a re-analysis of the website summaries, compared to re-analysis of the full transcripts? Can further time savings be made in identifying touchpoints by this method or is too much lost in the process?\nWe will also involve service users in the secondary analysis process, supporting them in analysing both selected transcripts and selected website summaries, and discussing with them similarities and differences in the touchpoints they identify compared to the social science researcher.\nWe will disseminate findings from the secondary analysis in the form of a series of trigger films made in collaboration with the DIPEx Charity, using our existing video recordings to illistrate the touchpoints we identify, and make these available through both www.healthtalkonline.org and the Point of Care Foundation online EBCD toolkit. With the close and active support of NHS England our findings will have a clear route to impact on policy and practice","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L01338X/1","grantId":"ES/L01338X/1","fundValue":"165290","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Louise  Locock","coPersons":["Adam  Barnett","Sian  Rees","Jocelyn  Cornwell","Gordon  Sturmey","Glenn  Robert"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
