It has already achieved its aims in that we have now received funding from BBSRC and the Indian Department of Biotechnology (DBT) to work on foot-and-mouth disease in India on a grant that will start in Nov 2014. We have visited three research groups in India on two trips: two government research institutes, one in Northern India, which whom we now have a grant award led by the Pirbright Institute, one in Chennai which we have visited and who have returned to visit us in Glasgow, and one Tamil Nadu state university, that we also visited. We discovered the the prospects for funding are much better at the national than regional level in India, and so further work with the latter is unlikely. This partnering work will continue, but the real outcomes will come form the now funded BBSRC / DBT grant which is about to start. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
