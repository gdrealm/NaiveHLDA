It has to be light so that the eye is not unnecessarily heavy and tiny muscles can move it with high precision when we want to look around. But above all, at least at the front, it has to be transparent, so that light can reach the retina and we can see around us. But what strategy has nature developed to build a structure which is tough, light and also transparent? As engineers know, it is important to use the right materials. The main molecular component of the external case of the eye, and in particular that of its front window (called the cornea) is collagen. Collagen is a chain-like protein that assembles together to form long molecular ropes called fibrils. Collagen is light and because it assembles into fibrils, it is very tough as well. If we look at the collagen in the cornea using an electron microscope, we can see that the collagen fibrils run side by side to form sheet-like structures. The distance between individual neighbouring fibrils in a sheet is very precise and about 50 nm. The precision of the distance between the collagen fibrils is the key to transparency. To understand why, it is useful to think first of what happens when we throw a stone on the flat surface of a pond. When the stone hits the pond surface, wave circles are produced that move outwards from a central point. If we throw two stones, the waves produced by one stone meet those produced by the other stone and an interference pattern is produced; where the crests of two waves meet, we will have a wave crest that is twice as high. Where the throughs meet we will have a through which is twice as low, and where a crest meets a through, the wave will disappear. If we managed to drop a row of regularly spaced stones, one quite close to another, we would find that the circular waves would disappear in all directions, except the forward direction. This is because the crest of any wave would meet the through of another wave everywhere except in the forward direction. Light is itself a wave, and when it hits a collagen fibril, it produces waves not dissimilar from those produced by a stone on a pond surface. Because the collagen fibres are equally spaced, light cancels out in all directions except the forward direction and the light can cross the cornea to reach the retina. One crucial thing which is not known though, is how the collagen in the cornea is maintained equally spaced. We know that around the collagen fibrils there are other proteins called proteoglycans. Proteoglycans are seen in the electron microscope to reach out for adjacent collagen fibrils, building in this way a network that may help to keep the collagen fibrils equally spaced. In this project, we propose to find out the exact location and 3-dimensional spatial arrangement of the proteoglycans around and between the collagen fibrils; thus, we want to determine the exact mechanisms that keep the collagen fibrils in place. We also propose to measure corneal transparency in various areas of the cornea by shining light of known intensity through it and by measuring the intensity of the light coming out. Finally we want to correlate the measurement of the corneal transparency in different areas with the measurements taken in the microscope about the collagen fibril spacing, fibril diameters and proteoglycan location and 3-dimensional structure. In this way we will have an idea of how the 3-dimensional order is maintained in the cornea by the proteoglycans, what effects proteoglycans have on collagen fibril diameter and interfibrillar distance, and how important these parameters are for corneal transparency. This information will be very useful to doctors studying the illnesses of the eye in which the cornea loses its transparency, and also for bioengineers who want to build artificial corneas for people that have lost their corneal functionality.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D001919/1","grantId":"BB/D001919/1","fundValue":"123619","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Carlo  Knupp","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
