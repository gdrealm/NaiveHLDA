These include: visits of UK researchers and academics to a number of field sites both in the UK and overseas; exchanges of young researchers between UK and overseas academic institutions; secondments of researchers to industry; a dissemination workshop and the establishment of a web portal for the storage and exchange of data and for the running of on-line meetings and seminars. Despite its main focus, the collaboration will necessarily provide links between members of the extended research teams with expertise in numerical simulation, constitutive modelling, soils testing and instrumentation. It is the intention that these activities will also be linked within the wider collaborative framework created by this funding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F013221/1","grantId":"EP/F013221/1","fundValue":"95973","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephanie  Glendinning","coPersons":["David Andrew Manning","Geoff  Parkin","Mohamed  Rouainia","Barry Goldsmith Clarke"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
