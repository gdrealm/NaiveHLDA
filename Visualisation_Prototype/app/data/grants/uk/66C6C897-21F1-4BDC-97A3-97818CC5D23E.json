However, research on language comprehension has shown that in some circumstances understanding does not proceed so easily and accurately as it seems. Research has shown that when a sentence contains negation (most commonly, by including the word &quot;not&quot;) the time to process and understand that sentence is longer than for a comparable sentence which does not contain negation.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The circumstances under which negation is normally used seem to depend largely on the wider context of the discourse. For example, negation is used when we want to deny something that the reader or listener may believe (eg, &quot;It is often cloudy on bank holidays, but it does not always rain.&quot;). Although the importance of context in using negation has been described in the literature, very little research has looked at the actual effect context may have on the ease of processing negation. The goal of this project is to use a electrophysiological technique called event-related potentials to systematically look at the influence of context on understanding negation.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2076","grantId":"RES-000-22-2076","fundValue":"81505","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lea  Hald","coPersons":["Alan  Garnham"],"organisation":"Canterbury Christ Church University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
