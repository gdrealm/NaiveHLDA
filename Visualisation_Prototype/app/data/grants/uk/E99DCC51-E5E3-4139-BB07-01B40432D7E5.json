Using this approach, fine-scale observations of the temporal and spatial patterns of such movements are used to draw inferences about the cognitive and linguistic operations that contribute to the process of comprehension. </p>\n\n<p>The present investigation aims to remain securely within this broad research tradition, and in particular to use standard eye-tracking methods for data-gathering purposes. However, in contrast with most previous work, the project will play down the use of informal verbal models, instead assigning a central role to computational models that are precise enough to derive detailed numerical predictions of eye-tracking data.&nbsp; Irrespective of the accuracy of any data-fits achieved, the work is expected to provide an indication of novel features that will eventually have to be built into any successful overarching model of comprehension and eye-movement control.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2069","grantId":"RES-000-22-2069","fundValue":"74557","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Don  Mitchell","coPersons":["Timothy Lewis Hodgson"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
