{"id":"592C7404-1BC7-4D97-ABAC-F7A0B81C2C22","title":"FACCE-JPI Knowledge Hub MACSUR Partner 65","abstractText":"FACCE MACSUR focuses on modelling European agriculture with climate change for food security. The work is\norganized in three themes on crop, livestock and trade modeling. The partnership consists of 73 partners from 16 countries\nall over Europe. The overarching challenge is to develop a pan-European capability in the development, use and\ninterpretation of models to perform risk assessments of the impacts of climate change on European agriculture. To address\nthis the following challenges must be met:\n\n1. Identify and address a range of issues between models in different themes to enable their closer integration including\nissues of scale and data processing.\n\n2. Train a new generation of scientists to work across models which contribute to greater integration of models. This\nchallenge can be described as focusing on the creation of integrated modelers as opposed to integrated models.\n\n3. Determine the contribution that can be made to reducing uncertainty over the impacts of climate change on European\nfood security by adopting integrated models of crop production, animal production and trade.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K008854/1","grantId":"BB/K008854/1","fundValue":"65654","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Peter Whitmore","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Rothamsted Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
