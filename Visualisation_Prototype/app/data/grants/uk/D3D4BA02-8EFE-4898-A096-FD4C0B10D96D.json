{"id":"D3D4BA02-8EFE-4898-A096-FD4C0B10D96D","title":"Inhibition of influenza virus replication by macrolide antibiotics","abstractText":"The threat of an influenza pandemic is constantly with us. The spread of bird flu across the world has heightened concerns about pandemic risk. This proposal is concerned with the development of drugs that will inhibit influenza virus growth and thereby prevent or reduce the severity of the associated illness. Our study will attempt to define the way in which these drugs work against flu. This information will be useful in improving our understanding of the influenza virus. It may also help us to develop better drugs in the future. The control of bird flu may be crucial in reducing the risk of a human pandemic; antiviral drugs may have a role in this. New flu drugs that can be used in humans will clearly be useful when a human pandemic next occurs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801931","grantId":"G0801931","fundValue":"453752","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas David Kay  Brown","coPersons":["Paul  Digard"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
