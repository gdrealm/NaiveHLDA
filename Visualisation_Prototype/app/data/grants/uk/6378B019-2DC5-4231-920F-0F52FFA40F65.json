{"id":"6378B019-2DC5-4231-920F-0F52FFA40F65","title":"Chartism: A Reassessment","abstractText":"Few modern European social movements -certainly British ones - have captured the attention of posterity to quite the extended Chartism (1838-circa 1858) has done. Encompassing moments of great and even revolutionary drama, it is pivotal to key historical debates about continuity and change, class, language and identity. Utilising the huge corpus of contemporary material (as well as the extensive published literature) relating to Chartism, this study will provide a long overdue sustained narrative and reassessment of its subject. It will probe the scope and character of the movement and explore the aspirations and visions of those who called themselves Chartist.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111828/1","grantId":"111828/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Malcolm Sherwin Chase","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
