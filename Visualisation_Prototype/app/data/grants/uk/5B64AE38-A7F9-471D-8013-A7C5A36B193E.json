Pleurisy is characterized by pus collection in the chest. Drainage of the pus is crucial to successful management, but is often difficult as pus is often locked into multiple pockets by fibrous septations. Understanding the pathophysiology of formation of these septations will allow strategies to target their formation. Our recent experiments suggest that pleurisy induces accumulation of thrombin (an enzyme involved in blood clotting) in the chest, which stimulates transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta release from mesothelial cells (that line the pleural cavity) in vitro. This is important as we have previously showed that TGF-beta can potently stimulate adhesions and fibrosis. \n\nThe proposed project will bring together the expertise of five established researchers on TGF-beta and mesothelial cell biology (Dr Lee), PARs (Drs Chambers &amp; Moffatt), pleural disease (Dr Davies) and pulmonary infection (Dr Brown). The proposed studies will build on our preliminary data and test the hypothesis that thrombin-induced release of TGF-beta plays an important role in the formation of adhesions / septations in pleurisy, using a variety of in vitro techniques and in vivo experimental models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501557","grantId":"G0501557","fundValue":"421044","fundStart":"2006-10-16","fundEnd":"2010-10-15","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy Stuart Brown","coPersons":["Rachel Clare Chambers","Y C Gary  Lee"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
