{"id":"728D096A-5AD7-4072-94DA-87879E7BDF1F","title":"Regulation of platelet purinergic receptor function by Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger Regulatory Factor adaptor proteins","abstractText":"Heart attacks occur when blood flow is blocked, often by a blood clot, while strokes are caused either by blocked or burst blood vessels in the brain. Platelet activation, which helps to stop us bleeding when we cut ourselves plays a major role in causing thrombosis, and so play a significant role in both stroke and heart attacks. One of the main drugs used in the prevention of heart attacks is clopidogrel which inhibits platelet activation by preventing a substance called ADP binding to receptors on the surface of platelets. The function of these ADP receptors is tightly controlled by multiple proteins in platelets. One possible family of proteins that may regulate ADP receptor function are the Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger Regulatory Factor (NHERF) adaptors. We plan to investigate the functional importance of these NHERF proteins to platelet and specifically ADP receptor function, work that we hope will open a path for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to prevent thrombosis and heart attacks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000432","grantId":"G1000432","fundValue":"331065","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart  Mundell","coPersons":["Alastair  Poole"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
