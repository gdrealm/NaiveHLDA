A central insight has been the role ‘intervention’ (as a specific category of coercive behaviour other than war) has played in facilitating the expansion of transnational processes in a system of sovereign states. These include the expansion and regulation of market relations, questions of political regime-type, particular ideologies, and questions of minority and human rights.&nbsp;&nbsp; Intervention, here, is a manifestation of the ‘will to order’ that has accompanied the expansion and increasing complexity of the modern international system. Modernity presents each age with fresh threats and challenges for which intervention, in the absence of more sophisticated methods and institutions of governance, will continue to be practiced by states.<br /><br />The project is grounded principally in English School insights regarding the institutions of international order and Historical Sociology’s insights into the tensions and contradictions of the modern world and practices of coercive re-ordering.&nbsp; As such, the inquiry moves away from conventional debates in the study of intervention that focus on questions of legitimacy and capacity and interests versus norms.&nbsp; The study is structured chronologically and ranges from the early modern to the contemporary period.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0667","grantId":"RES-451-26-0667","fundValue":"17922","fundStart":"2009-10-23","fundEnd":"2011-01-22","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  MacMillan","coPersons":["George  Lawson","Richard  Little"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
