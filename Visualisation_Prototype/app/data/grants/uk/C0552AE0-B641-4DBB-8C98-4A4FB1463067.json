{"id":"C0552AE0-B641-4DBB-8C98-4A4FB1463067","title":"NEW GREEN HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PRODUCTION","abstractText":"The aim is to exploit a recent discovery concerning the production of a new high activity catalyst for use in the production of hydrogen peroxide from the direct reaction between hydrogen and oxygen using novel gold palladium heteropolyacid catalysts. These new catalysts have been protected by a patent filing. The key feature of these catalysts is that they can be used in water as solvent at ambient temperature whereas all previous catalysts require low temperatures and organic solvents. Initial results show the new catalyst is over fifteen times as active as the current equivalent commercial catalyst. Funding is requested to complete patent exemplification and to ensure commercial exploitation can be achieved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I006060/1","grantId":"EP/I006060/1","fundValue":"119897","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have found a new catalyst that can make hydrogen peroxide and not decompose it Chemicals Economic","person":"Graham  Hutchings","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" We have discovered a catalyst that can make hydrogen peroxide directly from hydrogen and oxygen and this catalyst doe not decompose hydrogen peroxide We are in discussions with industry partners Chemicals","dataset":"gtr"}
