These technology challenges will be met through a multi-disciplinary partnership, working across institutions, across sciences, and across academia and business to create and apply innovative solutions that we need. Building on the existing links between WMG (Warwick Manufacturing Group) at Warwick and IIT-KGP, the agreement sets out an exciting agenda of future R&amp;D collaboration and the creation of 'cells' for IIT-KGP at WMG and for WMG at Kharagpur as a focus for exploitation. WMG and IIT-KGP will focus their partnership initially on three themes of economic, environmental and quality-of-life importance to India and the UK: low-carbon vehicles, medical technology and ICT/e-security. This proposal seeks support for travel costs for the IIT-KGP research theme leads for the three themes to visit WMG. Research funding is covered by existing grants and, in particular, industrial funding for collaborative programmes. The seedcorn funding sought in the Visiting Researcher Grant proposal will support the travel costs of academic staff and lead researchers at IIT-KGP to travel to WMG to develop, progress and help exploit collaborative research in the three themes. Over the three year period 7 visits to WMG will be supported, the first of one month duration, the subsequent ones of a week's duration. Research will be undertaken by existing and new research students and researchers. The Initiative will be self sustaining after EPSRC funding completes with full links having been established between the research teams and funds to continue collaboration being sought through industry and government sponsored research projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I005781/1","grantId":"EP/I005781/1","fundValue":"25696","fundStart":"2010-09-13","fundEnd":"2013-09-12","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard John Dashwood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
