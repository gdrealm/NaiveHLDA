These proteins control many signal transmission pathways that can become deregulated in cancer and other diseases. The proteins that we study are important in the progression of a cell from being normal to being cancerous, a process that requires a combination of abnormal cell growth and resistance to normal cell death. The proteins that we concentrate on are collectively called small G proteins. These fascinating proteins act as molecular switches in the cell, turning signalling pathways on and off and thus regulating a large number of cellular functions. One pair of small G proteins are called the Ral proteins. These Ral proteins are important for both of the processes involved in turning a normal cell into a rogue cancer cell: RalA increases cell growth while RalB suppresses cell death. The focus of this project is a protein called RLIP76, a binding partner for the Ral proteins that is also involved in pathways that are important in cancer progression. For example, RLIP76 can act as a pump that removes chemotherapy drugs from cells, making them less effective. RLIP76 also increases the radiation resistance of cancer cells making them more difficult to kill using radiation therapies.\n\nWe have already worked out how RalB and RLIP76 bind to each other by studying their structures, both individually and together in a complex, in three dimensions. This is crucial, because once we know exactly how proteins bind to each other and which particular regions of the proteins are important for the interaction, it will be possible to design drugs that either prevent or enhance this binding, This is one of the avenues that we are already pursuing with Ral and RLIP76. \n\nAdditionally, our previous work with RLIP76 also revealed new properties of RLIP76 that we now intend to characterize, as we predict that there will be other ways to exploit these traits and therefore attack this protein in disease. \n\nRLIP76 can itself control another family of small G proteins, the Rho family. RLIP76 has the ability to turn off the Rho family of molecular switches. As the Rho family proteins are themselves heavily implicated in disease progression, the ability to alter RLIP76 activity would therefore be therapeutically beneficial. We now intend to determine which of the Rho family proteins is the true target of RLIP76: this knowledge will be crucial for understanding which cellular processes RLIP76 modifies, by flicking the switch on Rho family proteins. We will also determine the minimal region of RLIP76 required to affect Rho family proteins and will go on to investigate how other proteins modulate this effect. Taken together, this work will further our knowledge of small G proteins and RLIP76 and permit the development of molecules that will guide future drug design projects.\n\nRal and RLIP76 have been shown to signal aberrantly in a variety of different cancers e.g. pancreatic, colorectal, bladder, prostate and melanoma, so therapies directed towards these proteins will be potentially helpful to a wide variety of cancer patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J007803/1","grantId":"MR/J007803/1","fundValue":"398986","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Darerca  Owen","coPersons":["Helen  Mott"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
