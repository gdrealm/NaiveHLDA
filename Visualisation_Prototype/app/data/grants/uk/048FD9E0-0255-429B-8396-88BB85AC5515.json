To meet these aims, we will undertake the direct measurement and sampling of water and sediment within Subglacial Lake Ellsworth in West Antarctica. For over a decade, scientists have regarded subglacial lakes to be extreme yet viable habitats for microbial life. Additionally, sedimentary palaeoenvironment records are thought to exist on the floors of subglacial lakes, which would provide critical insights into the glacial history of Antarctica. Of the &gt;150 known subglacial lakes, Lake Ellsworth stands out as an ideal candidate for exploration. Through a NERC-AFI award, glaciologists have shown the lake, beneath 3 km of ice, to be 10 km long, 2-3 km wide and 160 m deep, confirming it as an ideal deep-water lake for exploration. The deployment of heavy equipment has been shown to be possible at this location, based on several deep-field reconnaissance studies. This project will build, test and deploy all the equipment necessary to complete the experiment in a clean and environmentally responsible manner. Samples will be analysed and split at laboratories in the field and at Rothera Station, and then distributed to laboratories across the UK. This project, which has been in a planning stage for four years, will be a benchmark exercise in the exploration of Antarctica, will make profound scientific discoveries regarding life in extreme environments and West Antarctic Ice Sheet history, and will be of genuine interest to the public and media.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G00465X/1","grantId":"NE/G00465X/1","fundValue":"335292","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Martin John Siegert","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" Building of environmental protocols for subglacial access.\n\nThe Lake Ellsworth consortium provided the 1st Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation for clean Antarctic subglacial access. The CEE was introduced to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Buenos Aires in 2011, and again in Hobart in 2012, where it received international comment. Follwoing revision to the CEE, the UK FCO granted the Consortium a permit to undertake the research in August 2012. The CEE was published in Reviews of Geophysics in 2012, and is also available on the project website: www.ellsworth.org.uk\n\n\n\nDesign of risk for subglacial instruments.\n\nAn account for how instruments may be designed and engineered for subglacial exploration, with a rigorous risk analysis was performed by colleagues at NOC and published in 2012 in the Journal of Glaciology.\n\n\n\nPublicity\n\nDuring fieldwork in 2012/13, sigificant public and media interest was serviced using two websites:\n\nwww.ellsworth.org.uk\n\nwww.ellsworthlive.org.uk\n\n\n\nAlthough attempts to access Lake Ellsworth were unsuccessful this year, the programme has delivered a great deal in terms of instrument and programme design and discussions are currently being held with NERC on how to undertake a second field season. Our work is of great interest to the public, which we have serviced using programme websites. In particular we have been keen to involve Children in the programme, to help them understand matters relating to science, environment and engineering. Antarctic Treaty.\n\nThe Antarctic Treaty means that exploitation of Antarctic resources is forbidden. \n\nThe main areas for exploitation lie in intellectual property, which is partiuclarly of interest to the media and the public.
