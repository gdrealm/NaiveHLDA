{"id":"ACB85582-B26B-4913-980D-B2C361D546C8","title":"Easy-to-use Test Kits for Toxic Chemical Identification","abstractText":"We propose the development, both technical and commercial, of easy-to-use disposable test 'strips' and 'swabs' that are unique in combining specific, sensitive and rapid colorimetric detection of two classes of common toxic chemical. The technology base was established as part of a fundamental EPSRC funded study on the design of molecular sensor systems (GR/S98771/01). EPSRC Follow on Funds represent an ideal enabling opportunity to develop this work; as it stands the technology currently falls between 'blue-skies' basic research and a device that is potentially attractive to future substantial investment. It is our hope that the award of this grant would allow this gap to be bridged by enabling the construction of demonstration 'devices' and hence release future investment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G006156/1","grantId":"EP/G006156/1","fundValue":"94649","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Andrew  Fallis","coPersons":["Simon  Aldridge"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
