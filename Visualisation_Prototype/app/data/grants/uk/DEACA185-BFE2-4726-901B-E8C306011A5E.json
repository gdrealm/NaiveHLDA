Normally, inflammation is short-lived and the body recovers quickly, but in certain diseases, inflammation becomes chronic resulting in much longer-term discomfort and can become life-threatening when it affects an essential organ. Inflammatory diseases affect up to 10% of the population at some point in their lives. Recently, DR3 has been suggested as a potential target for new therapies against multiple inflammatory diseases ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to inflammatory bowel disease. This project is designed to increase our understanding of how DR3 controls other aspects of our immune response, namely those to viruses. This is essential as it may reveal potential side-effects that could be associated with therapies targeted against the DR3/TL1A pathway. In addition, the study is designed to reveal other important functions of DR3, which could then be used to manipulate immune responses to our own advantage. In particular, we hope to explore the potential of boosting immunity through activation of the DR3/TL1A pathway, therefore potentially aiding therapies such as vaccines against viruses and cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901119","grantId":"G0901119","fundValue":"373667","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Eddie Chung Wang","coPersons":["Ian  Humphreys"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
