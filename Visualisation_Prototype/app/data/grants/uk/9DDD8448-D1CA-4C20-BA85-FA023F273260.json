{"id":"9DDD8448-D1CA-4C20-BA85-FA023F273260","title":"Decision making in an unstable world","abstractText":"For humans and machines decision making is not always simple. Sometimes the world changes so quickly that experience does not always tell you how to behave. Humans can cope reasonably well in this unstable and complicated world but we don't have a full understanding of how they do this. Solving this problem requires a wide range of researchers from very different backgrounds to work together. This grant assembles a team from Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Psychology, Economics, Earth Sciences, Geography, Neurology, Education and Biology.We will carry out experiments on human volunteers while they make decisions and try to understand how these decisions are made. The resulting models will then be useful in the design of artificial decision making systems such as computer based traffic flow systems, automatic stock market trading systems and early warning systems for disasters. This project also includes a number of researchers who work on real world problems such as food choice, financial decision making, disaster management and human addiction.A major challenge in this area is to build genuine understanding and common working practices across the subjects. We have planned a range of activities to help build a common language and understanding which will result in a new and sustainable community of decision making researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I032622/1","grantId":"EP/I032622/1","fundValue":"1646370","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Iain Donald Gilchrist","coPersons":["Roland  Baddeley","Rafal  Bogacz","John Michael  McNamara","David  Leslie","Casimir  Ludwig","Simon  Farrell"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
