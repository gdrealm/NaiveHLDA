{"id":"DBA119D3-93A2-41B2-BC2A-4908707366D9","title":"Job polarisation and job quality","abstractText":"<p>Labour markets across Europe have become increasingly polarised, as the number of bad (low-pay, low-skills) jobs and good (high-pay, high-skills) jobs has increased relative to mid-ranking jobs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this research is to advance our knowledge about this process of polarisation, its causes, its implications and its links with other aspects of job quality. In particular, the research will produce the first empirical evidence on how job polarisation has changed and interacted with the organisation of firms in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>The analysis will also extend to other EU countries to investigate changes in other aspects of job quality in increasingly polarised labour markets and to explore the implications for government budgets and redistributive policies of the growth of jobs at the two ends of the pay distribution.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the research will study the implications of the hollowing out of the labour market for wage mobility in the UK, and, in particular, for the chances of the low-pay to progress up the career ladder.</p>\n\n<p>The research will therefore contribute to our understanding of the changing labour markets providing important insights for policies for skills, social mobility, and aimed at improving the quality of jobs and, ultimately, peopleâ€™s wellbeing. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001116/1","grantId":"ES/K001116/1","fundValue":"161854","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrea  Salvatori","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
