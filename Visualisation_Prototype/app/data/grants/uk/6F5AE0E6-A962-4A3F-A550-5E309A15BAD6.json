{"id":"6F5AE0E6-A962-4A3F-A550-5E309A15BAD6","title":"Everyday sanitation: a comparative study of Mumbai's informal settlements","abstractText":"<p>There is widespread recognition that sanitation in cities in the global South has been neglected in the social sciences and international development community. This is despite the importance of sanitation in cities, particularly for the poor, for health, schooling, and employment, to gender relations and dignity.</p>\n\n<p>However, while the macro data on sanitation distribution and exclusion (on toilets, sewers, drainage and piped water) is well known at a city, national and global level, the everyday patterns of access, use, experience and perception of sanitation for different people within informal settlements remains poorly understood. There is a pressing need to understand the experience, perception and coping strategies different people have of sanitation within informal settlements. </p>\n\n<p>This research aims to address these gaps through detailed ethnographic analysis of the micro-geographies of urban sanitation. It uses the case study of Mumbai, India, one of the world's biggest cities, where sanitation challenges are starkly posed, especially for the 54 per cent&nbsp;living in informal settlements. The research will consider how social differentials such as gender, age, class, caste, religion and ethnicity affect sanitation conditions, and will ask how these relations change over time. The ethnography will be conducted by a research assistant over two years.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1669","grantId":"RES-062-23-1669","fundValue":"182748","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  McFarlane","coPersons":["Stephen Douglas Graham"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
