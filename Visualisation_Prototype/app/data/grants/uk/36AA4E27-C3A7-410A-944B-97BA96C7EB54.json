{"id":"36AA4E27-C3A7-410A-944B-97BA96C7EB54","title":"Electron Microscopy of Advanced Materials","abstractText":"The electron microscopy laboratory at University of St Andrews, equipped with a JEOL JEM-2011 transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a JEOL JSM-5600 scanning electron microscope (SEM), was established in 1999 and has been furnished with major accessories including a MacTempas Image Simulation System, a Gatan 656 Dimple Grinder, a Gatan 691 Precision Ion Polishing System and a fully equipped darkroom. Both TEM and SEM have an Oxford Instruments energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. TEM images are normally recorded with a Gatan CCD camera and can be transferred to user's own computer through the university network. This laboratory will open for external users of UK academic institutions and industry in order to optimise the use of the equipment and to enhance the collaboration between researchers in different universities.One day per week for each microscope will be reserved for external users and the availability of the service will be marketed on the school website. The process of the service and arrangement of materials research projects will be monitored by an Advisory Committee led by the Vice Principal for Research, Professor Alan Miller with other members from several universities. Lecture course on electron microscopy and one-to-one training course can be offered under requirement.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F019580/1","grantId":"EP/F019580/1","fundValue":"255377","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This program offers free access to the electron microscopes at St Andrews. A large number of UK university researchers have been benefited. It is the most economic way to share large research facilities. Collaboration between groups and universities have been encouraged and a healthy research atmosphere was created. Almost all the users sent positive comments on the service and wished to see possible continuance of the project.

Some joined publications are listed (not completed because many papers were published by the users). The services offered to the UK university users have certainly strengthened their research in solid state chemistry and materials science. The training of electron microscope users led to more than 20 independent operators. Chemicals,Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
