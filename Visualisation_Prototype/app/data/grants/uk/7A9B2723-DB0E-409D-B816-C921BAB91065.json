Most attention focused on the immediate aftermath. Little thought went into long-term rebuilding of lives and livelihoods, creating sustainable communities or fully engaging local people in decisions taken. The Durham University Project Sri Lanka Institutional Model (Durham Model) and International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW) Rebuilding Peoples' Lives After Disasters Network associated with social work's community-based empowerment model (IASSW Model) aimed to counteract these weaknesses by providing ground-breaking work in the processes of internationalization in the context of globalisation and a humanitarian impulse to help from a social justice value base.\n<br />\n<br />In examining these two models, this research follows an interpretive ethnographic approach that uses a range of quantitative and qualitative methods including mapping disaster interventions; participant observations; and narrative interviews. The findings will attract considerable interest, not least because the Durham Model has a proven track record of success as evidenced by HEFCE and British Council recognition, and because the UN and IASSW are interested in the anticipated transferable skills, paradigm shifts in professional practice and curricula developments that are expected to arise from the findings.\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1025","grantId":"RES-062-23-1025","fundValue":"476650","fundStart":"2009-01-26","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings have been use to develop a new area of social work - green social work, which is calling for a paradigm shift in how humanitarian aid and sustainable development are conceptualised and enacted. In 2013, the lessons and guidelines emanating from this research have been applied in China during the Lushan earthquake; Uttarakhand floods in India and Nepal and in identifying flood risks in Cura&ccedil;ao. Curriculum development initiatives in this area were also started in VIA in Aarhus, Denmark; the University of Pretoria in South Africa, and Doshisha, Bukkyo and Osaka Universities in Japan. The findings linked to improving practice also led to the inclusion of social work in further research projects including the NERC-ESRC funded Earthquakes without Frontiers. And, the findings were used to inform discussions at UNFCCC COP meetings from 2010 to the present day.

These have already been used in: a) developing\n green social work curricula in Denmark, South Africa, Japan and Curacao, to promote a paradigm shift in how humanitarian aid and sustainable development are conceptualised and enacted. And, in 2013, the lessons and guidelines emanating from this research have been applied in China during the Lushan earthquake; Uttarakhand floods in India and Nepal and in identifying flood risks in Cura?ao. It also led to the inclusion of social work in further research projects including the NERC-ESRC funded Earthquakes without Frontiers. These initiatives can be initiated elsewhere.
