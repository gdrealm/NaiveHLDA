We will consider the use of results delivered by this\napproach to plan strategies to restore permanent grasslands degraded by climatic shifts and disruptions. Our\nproject will focus on perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), which is a major grass species naturally\ndistributed over the whole European continent as well as in Northern Africa and Near East (Humphreys et al.,\n2010). This species is a major component of many natural grassland communities. It is a resource capture\nstrategy species (Martin et al., 2009) which is especially prevalent in grasslands grazed by cattle. It is also the\nmain grass species sown in Europe to create temporary meadows and it has therefore received extensive\nbreeding effort during the last four decades (Sampoux et al., 2011). Recent developments in a new area of\necological sciences (landscape genomics) have paved the way to the discovery of genomic markers of\nadaptive diversity from genome-wide genotyping data. They are based on the implementation of methods\ncorrelating genomic polymorphisms and environmental variations at sites of origin of genotypes combined\nwith tests of signature of selection (Manel et al., 2010). We will implement this methodological frame to detect\ngenomic markers of climatic adaptation in the natural diversity of perennial ryegrass. We will use a genotyping\nmethod based on massively parallel sequencing technology applied to a high number of populations obtained\nfrom genebanks of plant breeding research institutes or collected in situ across Europe. We will furthermore\ntake advantage of know-how and facilities of plant breeding research institutes participating in the project to\nphenotype these populations in fields and in controlled environment to record agronomic and ecophysiological\ntraits. These phenotypic data will be used to model associations between phenotypic variability\nand genomic polymorphisms. Association models between genomic polymorphisms and environmental variations will be used to map\nthe spatial distribution of genomic markers linked to adaptive diversity in present climatic conditions and to\nforesee possible shifts in the spatial range fitting these markers in the context of several climate change\nscenarios based on the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) of IPCC AR5 (Moss et al., 2010).\nOn the basis of these results, we will define allelic profiles of perennial ryegrass expected to provide climatic\nadaptation at regional scale over Europe under the future climatic conditions foreseen by climate models. We\nwill consider combining climatic adaptation and value for services (forage production and climate mitigation)\nby the recombination of alleles providing climatic adaptation and value for services. We will design several\ngenetic pools mixing different natural populations for breeding regionally adapted populations to restore\npermanent grasslands degraded climatic disruptions. Breeding and releasing improved genetic material will\nbe out of the scope of the project but will be discussed with stakeholders at the end of the project during ad\nhoc meetings for implementation in further collaborative projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M018393/1","grantId":"BB/M018393/1","fundValue":"245697","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew  Hegarty","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
