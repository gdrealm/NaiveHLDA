Across the four partner institutions we gained in-depth insights into the ways that eight national parliaments deal with the European Union, focusing on the roles of parliamentarians and administrators (parliamentary clerks). In addition, the teams looked at interparliamentary cooperation both horizontally (among national parliaments) and vertically (between the European and national parliaments). The four research partners sought jointly to cover legislative and non-legislative matters since the introduction of the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty in 2010. Each of the four teams focused on two Member States and one thematic area in detail. In addition, the teams took responsibility for a further five countries each, to ensure that all 28 Member States were covered, albeit not all in equal depth. The Cambridge team, which was funded by the ESRC, focused on the UK and Poland, with an overview also of Ireland, the three Baltic States, and Croatia, and looked predominantly at 'non-Ordinary Legislative Procedure' issues, i.e. not the standard EU legislation. The primary focus was on foreign, security and defence policy but we also looked at the EU budget/multi-annual financial framework and the emerging post-crisis economic governance regime. The Paris team focused on legislative matters, the Maastricht team looked at the role of parliamentary administrators, while the Cologne team looked at inter-parliamentary cooperation, predominantly from a quantitative perspective. By virtue of being a collaborative project, each team undertook research relating to the research priorities of all four project partners. This report relates primarily to findings of the Cambridge team, although it also covers some of the wider themes raised by the project. \nThe project has generated a wealth of empirical data not previously available given the recent changes to the EU framework, some of which occurred as the project evolved. The research gave us the opportunity to study the role of the UK and Polish parliaments in great detail, looking at the parliamentary debates as well as interviewing members and officials from all four of the chambers concerned. \nSeveral key findings emerged. The five most important are:\n1) National Parliaments already have powers that are under-utilised; there is a lack of engagement on the part of many national MPs. Comparing across parliaments using a tripartite framework, established in the literature, of authority (formal powers), ability (resources) and attitude (willingness to use powers and resources), we found that attitude was the most important determinant of the quality, quantity and scope of scrutiny where scrutiny was non-automatic (i.e. for non-legislative areas). MPs may have the power to act but often choose not to do so, for reasons including political culture, traditions of executive privilege, and prioritisation of other issues. Much of the literature hitherto focused on the formal control powers of national parliaments, with little understanding of the cultural context that determined how those powers were used in practice. As a result, much previous scholarship has tended to 'overrate' parliaments that have many powers on paper (e.g. the Italian parliament), and to ignore the scrutiny work that less powerful chambers use to hold their governments accountable (e.g. the House of Lords, which plays a strong role thanks to the unique nature of its committee system, comprising a full EU scrutiny committee with sectoral sub-committees, and the fact that it is an un-elected chamber meaning that peers are not accountable to constituents in the way elected members are and have more time to focus on policy, including international and European policy). By highlighting the importance of attitudes in determining scrutiny outcomes, this project was able to give new insights into the practical reality of parliamentary activity on a day-to-day basis. \n2) Mainstreaming of European policy to sectoral/departmental committees is desirable in principle, as the Dutch case has effectively shown. E.g. mainstreaming allows more parliamentarians to be better equipped to hold Ministers to account and explain EU legislation to their constituents. However, this requires adequate resources both in terms of administrative staff and elected members with the time to devote to European issues. Attempts to devolve European affairs to departmental committees without adequate support will not lead to more effective scrutiny of proposals.\n3) National parliaments showed they have the capacity to coordinate their response to EU legislation by passing two 'yellow cards' under the Lisbon provisions on subsidiarity, one of which resulted in the proposal being withdrawn. However, to engage more effectively with European issues and to use their new powers more effectively, they should increase their cooperation and coordination at three levels: i) within parliaments, i.e. between committees; ii) horizontally among national parliaments; iii) vertically between the European Parliament and national parliaments.\n4) The increase in interparliamentary conferences - with the creation of two new conferences in the fields of Common Foreign and Security Policy (as envisaged in the Lisbon Treaty) and economic governance (as foreseen in Article 13 of the Fiscal Compact) - demonstrated that relations between parliaments - in particular between national parliaments and the European Parliament - may be punctuated by inter-institutional rivalry as well as conflict over what form of parliamentary scrutiny is most effective at the EU level. \n5) The increasing complexity of the EU institutional order following repeated treaty reforms has resulted in an EU where is it harder for national parliaments to hold ministers to account, especially where it is difficult for citizens to understand what is going on. Thus, despite the intention to make Europe more democratically transparent via the Lisbon Treaty, the growing complexity particularly thanks to the Eurozone crisis makes it more opaque to ordinary people and even to national parliamentarians.\n\nPlease note: while many of our key findings have been discussed in working papers and conference papers, the bulk of our research will be published over the course of the coming three years. In particular we would alert reviewers to the following forthcoming publications: a co-edited Handbook on National Parliaments and the European Union, co-edited by Smith (with Claudia Hefftler from Cologne; Christine Neuhold from Maastricht; and Olivier Rosenberg) due to be published in Palgrave in early 2015; a special issue of West European Politics covering the work of all four project partners and including an article by Ariella Huff: 'Executive Privilege Reaffirmed? Parliamentary Scrutiny of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Common Security and Defence Policy'. Drs Smith, Cooper and Maatsch are co-editing a special section of Parliamentary Affairs on 'Governance without Democracy? Analysing the Role of Parliaments in European Economic Governance after the Crisis' for publication in early 2017. In addition, Dr Maatsch has a monograph, Parliaments and the Economic Governance of the European Union: Talking Shops or Deliberative Bodies?, under contract with Palgrave for 2015 and Dr Smith and Huff have a monograph, European Budgetary Politics in a Time of Crisis: Balancing the Books, under contract with Edward Elgar due for publication in early 2016. We hope that our findings will be taken forward by practitioners, here understood as parliamentarians and parliamentary clerks, seeking to improve the way they engage with the EU, whether to ensure scrutiny of EU legislation or to hold national ministers to account over their role in EU decision-making. We have already engaged extensively with practitioners in the course of our research. Drs Smith and Huff both now have roles where they can perhaps influence outcomes more directly: Dr Huff has been appointed a Specialist to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and Dr Smith has been appointed a working peer and hopes to focus on European matters in the House of Lords.\nThe forward plan of ongoing research and publications, especially associated with the questions of accountability and legitimacy in light of the Eurozone crisis mean there will be ongoing academic impact, which we again hope will have an effect on public policy-making.
