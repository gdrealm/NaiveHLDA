{"id":"824834FA-C933-4809-BF3B-8F8FC1DEBE5E","title":"Ionization of Atomic Hydrogen by Low Energy Antiprotons","abstractText":"Ionization is an important process in astrophysical and technological plasmas and in the dissociation of molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. Technological plasmas are increasingly used in industrial processing of materials, particularly to affect their surface properties, and are widely used in the semiconductor industry. Energy from controlled plasma fusion of hydrogen isotopes presents us with the possibility of a 'clean' energy source to replace fossil fuels and to alleviate global warming resulting from carbon dioxide emissions from current generation power stations.The cross section for electron removal or ionization of the simplest atom (hydrogen, or its isotope deuterium) by antiprotons is currently of considerable interest. This is the simplest collision system for testing theory with only one active electron and, since the antiproton cannot capture an electron, the detection of a hydrogen ion in coincidence with an antiproton after the collision is a signature of the ionization process. We will measure the cross sections for ionization of atomic hydrogen by antiproton impact at low energies, in a range never before accessed experimentally. Our understanding of the ionization mechanism in such a simple three-body system should enable an important step forward in current theoretical models.A firm theoretical understanding of ionization is important to the applications mentioned above, as theory is often used to provide input to simulations and in the interpretation of observations in physical situations where dedicated experiments are difficult, or even impossible...","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I005625/1","grantId":"EP/I005625/1","fundValue":"8246","fundStart":"2010-04-12","fundEnd":"2011-01-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The data in the publication is being used by collision theorist to understand the fundamental process of ionisation in ion-atom ion-simple molecule collisions Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education ","person":"Robert William McCullough","coPersons":["Christopher Adam Hunniford"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" WE have provided benchmark data for atomic collision theory. these data will enable the further development of fundamental collision theory Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education","dataset":"gtr"}
