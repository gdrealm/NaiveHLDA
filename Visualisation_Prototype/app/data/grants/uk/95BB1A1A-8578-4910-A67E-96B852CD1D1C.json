{"id":"95BB1A1A-8578-4910-A67E-96B852CD1D1C","title":"Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems 2007","abstractText":"TAROS (Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems) is an annual conference that allows researchers in robotics from the UK and abroad to present their work to their peers. In 2007, TAROS will be held in Aberystwyth for the first time.For the event to be a complete success, it must bring together both internationally recognised and young researchers. The aim of this proposal is to seek financial assistance to allow both to happen while limiting the costs to delegates: funding to cover the expenses of two international invited keynote speakers and funding for bursaries for postgraduate students to encourage them to attend the conference.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F019386/1","grantId":"EP/F019386/1","fundValue":"6245","fundStart":"2007-10-02","fundEnd":"2008-04-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Frederic  Labrosse","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
