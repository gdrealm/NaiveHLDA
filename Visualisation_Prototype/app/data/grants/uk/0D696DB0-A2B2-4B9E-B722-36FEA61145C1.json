It is also a threat to visitors and tourists in countryside areas. Through six, integrated work packages, and the use of two case study areas (NE Scotland and N Wales), the research will provide information to ensure rural policies minimise the risks to rural communities from E. coli O157.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-229-31-0003","grantId":"RES-229-31-0003","fundValue":"30000","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ken  KillhamNorval  Strachan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
