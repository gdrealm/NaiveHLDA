This project seeks to further understanding of how the back of the eye ages. The 'system' to be investigated is the layer of light sensitive cells (rods and cones) in the outer retina, the remarkably dense, supporting vascular bed (choriocapillaris) that lies beneath it and the connective tissue layer known as Bruch's membrane that sits between the choriocapillaris and the rods and cones. \n\nRods and cones require large amounts of energy to function normally and the very highly vascular choriocapillaris provides the necessary oxygen. This needs to be precisely controlled as too low an oxygen supply impairs rod and cone function and potentially leads to cell death. Conversely, too high a concentration of oxygen can also be toxic.\n\nFrom published data, we know that with increasing age rod numbers drop, Bruch's membrane gets thicker and the choriocapillaris degrades in a way that reduces blood flow. It is possible that in healthy ageing these changes interact in a way maintains the health of rods and cones (photoreceptors).\n\nIt is not possible to make the direct measurements necessary to explore this phenomenon in more detail in patients or healthy volunteers, particularly as the anatomy of the back of the human eye varies markedly from one area to another. Also, it is very difficult to explore how changes in blood pressure and other factors might impact on photoreceptor health. Even direct measurements of choriocapillaris blood flow are challenging as a layer of pigmented cells lies just in front of it.\n\nFor these reasons we have developed a computer simulation of choriocapillaris blood flow and already identified some unexpected properties of this vascular bed. By drawing together published data and additional morphological data from post-mortem eyes donated for research purposes we intend to extend this model to describe how oxygen is delivered from the choriocapillaris to the outer retina and how much oxygen the outer retina (photoreceptors) need.\n\nHaving established the model we will be able to use it to determine how the integrated system of blood vessels, Bruch's membrane and photoreceptors behaves in healthy ageing. We predict that oxygen supply and demand will be closely matched and that, paradoxically, reduction of blood flow is beneficial as it keeps photoreceptors at an optimal concentration of oxygen. It is possible that similar combinations of age-related changes are a feature of healthy ageing at other sites, a phenomenon for which we have coined the term 'graceful ageing'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N003616/1","grantId":"BB/N003616/1","fundValue":"394940","fundStart":"2016-04-01","fundEnd":"2019-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip J Luthert","coPersons":["Ian  Eames"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
