Biofilms are important medically as they cause chronic infections and colonise implants, in industry where they are found blocking pipes and causing metal to breakdown. To form a biofilm, individual cells, come into contact with a surface (usually by swimming to it), stick, grow, multiply and spread, gradually producing a mature 3-dimensional biofilm. This consists of mushroom shaped heaps of cells, embedded in slime, with water channels running through. The channels carry nutrients and oxygen into the biofilm, which diffuse to the cells however diffusion does not occur equally throughout the biofilm. So individual cells experience different environmental conditions and thus the biofilm structure is very variable. Changes in environmental conditions also cause the cells to rearrange themselves and thus the shape of the biofilm can change. In this project we will study bacterial movement in the biofilm, determining how the cells move in response to environmental changes an d when they are motile within the biofilm. Bacterial movement is controlled by a sensory system, the Che system, which senses changes in the concentrations of chemicals in the environment and controls swimming so that the cell can respond, so we will also investigate the role of this system in the biofilm. To do this we will study how the genes involved in motility and chemosensing are controlled in the biofilm. The control or expression of genes will be studied by coupling them with a fluorescent protein which we can see using microscopy and thus directly study the expression of genes deep within the biofilm.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E010571/1","grantId":"BB/E010571/1","fundValue":"280612","fundStart":"2007-02-19","fundEnd":"2010-05-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Overall the project has successfully achieved its goals and we have elucidated biofilm formation and development in Rhodobacter sphaeroides per se, determined the role of motility, quorum sensing and the chemosensory system in determining gross biofilm structure, developed the RIVET promotor trapping technology and applied it to elucidate promoters of genes induced during development and studied a subset of these further.

The biofilm specific genes identified in this study will underpin further studies enabling understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in biofilm formation of R. sphaeroides WS8. Through the morphological studies we have clearly shown that motility, chemotaxis and quorum sensing are involved in gross biofilm formation and development. The finding that R. sphaeroides undergoes morphological differentiation and the use of RIVET to trap biofilm-induced promoters in key cell division genes demonstrates the power of the RIVET-GFP approach to in situ biofilm studies. Overall we achieved the goals of the project and were able to take the studies further with the CtrA/ddlA studies.
