Measurements of these gases are required for monitoring clinical procedures such as anaesthesia, and are also necessary in experimental medicine, where the aim is to understand their involvement in biological regulation. The problem in such measurements is that they need to be direct and fast, so that changes during the breath cycle can be accurately monitored. This proposal seeks to introduce novel methods of laser absorption into a clinical setting by adapting present techniques used in a physical chemistry laboratory so that they can be applied in medical monitoring and investigation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601796","grantId":"G0601796","fundValue":"98779","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gus  Hancock","coPersons":["Peter  Robbins"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
