{"id":"1AE19330-F365-4E8B-8DB3-4F33F3996F31","title":"Rapidly evolving multiple sclerosis: opening the window of therapeutic opportunity","abstractText":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the nervous system that represents the most common cause of disability in young adults. It is a long-term disease with a significant medical, economic and social impact, largely due to the accumulation of disability. Results of studies and clinical practice show that patients affected by rapidly evolving form of MS may not benefit from the available immunomodulatory drugs and are at high risk to become disabled. We want to establish a group (?cohort?) of patients with very active forms of MS that has not been controlled by the standard treatments. With ethical approval and the consent of each patient who wishes to enter this cohor, we plan to study in great detail the characteristics of disease in each subject by clinical tests, brain scans, blood and spinal fluid tests for indices of inflammation and by mapping some variations of genes that are associated with MS. With this information we will be able to identify within the group the most suitable patients who could benefit from new therapies being studied. The patients participating in the cohort will have the option to participate in the clinical trial most suitable to them. By accelerating the access of candidate patients, the clinical trials will be run more efficiently, speeding up the development of effective cures for MS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800679","grantId":"G0800679","fundValue":"494742","fundStart":"2009-03-29","fundEnd":"2014-11-27","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paolo Paolo Muraro","coPersons":["Jeremy  Chataway","Adam  Waldman","Richard  Reynolds","Omar  Malik","Klaus  Schmierer","Gavin  Giovannoni","Richard St. Nicholas"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
