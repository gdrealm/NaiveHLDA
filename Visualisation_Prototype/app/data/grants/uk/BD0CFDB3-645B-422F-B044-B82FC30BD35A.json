{"id":"BD0CFDB3-645B-422F-B044-B82FC30BD35A","title":"Research on Nonparametric Identification and Inference in Microeconometrics","abstractText":"<p>Recent years have witnessed a surge of international research in using micro-level data to answer empirical economic questions. The high-quality micro-level data are essential ingredients to understand economic behaviour and the impact of economic and social policy. This research project aims to contribute to advances in understanding identification problems and developing estimation and inference methods using micro-level data. In particular, the proposed research will: (1) develop point- and partial- identification results in microeconometric problems that occur naturally in empirical research in economics and social sciences; (2) develop semi- and nonparametric methods for estimation and inference in microeconometrics; (3) apply the state-of-the-art microeconometrics to important empirical problems.<br /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F03721X/1","grantId":"ES/F03721X/1","fundValue":"81171","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sokbae  Lee","coPersons":["Adam Michael Rosen"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
