{"id":"19E3A855-BA34-4F9A-BF41-E7E990516D2E","title":"The floating classroom- science in the Bay","abstractText":"<p>We would like to offer the University Research Vessel GUIDING LIGHT and scientific crew as a floating classroom for a series of half-day cruises around Cardiff Bay. School groups will undertake measurements of water turbidity/chemistry/depth, sample seafloor sediment and view the seabed on underwater TV. They will be introduced to the principles of seabed mapping and collect sediment samples. At Cardiff University students will analyse sediment samples by sieving and to extract microfossils. Information on water quality, bathymetry, sedimentology and biota will be synthesised to create an overview that highlights interactions between the hydrosphere, biosphere and society from an off-shore perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Each cruise will be open to parties of 10 GCSE level secondary school or sixth form students accompanied by 2 teachers.</p>\n\n<p>We propose to run 2 trips per day throughout the working week of Science Week and (money permitting) offer trips on the weekend to the general public. This would enable 150 students, teachers and members of the public to experience life working on a research vessel.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0110","grantId":"RES-168-26-0110","fundValue":"2000","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline  Lear","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" This grant funded an outreach activity not research.
