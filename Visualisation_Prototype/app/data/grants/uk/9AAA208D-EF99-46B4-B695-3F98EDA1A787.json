{"id":"9AAA208D-EF99-46B4-B695-3F98EDA1A787","title":"Isolation of pooled selected gene segments for allele discovery by next generation sequencing","abstractText":"Future crop varieties will need improved performance traits for the consumer and the producer, and reduced environmental impact (e.g. lower fertiliser or pesticide input). These traits are currently monitored by 'molecular markers', which are genetic fingerprinting tests. An alternative approach is to sequence the genetic information directly. A revolution in 'next generation sequencing' is currently underway' with speed doubling annually and prices tumbling, Direct sequencing can give far greater accuracy than molecular markers but there is a technical bottleneck caused by the fact that it sequences many individuals in the same container, raising the difficult issue of how to keep track of which sequence belongs to which individual. In this project we propose to develop, test and compare two promising tracking methods, using barley as a test-bed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G024790/1","grantId":"BB/G024790/1","fundValue":"120734","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  I do not know whether these studies have been followed up by others.
