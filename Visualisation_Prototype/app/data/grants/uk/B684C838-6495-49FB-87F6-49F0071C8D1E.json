There are occasional complications but the virus is generally assumed to be innocuous and is only monitored periodically by the health authorities. In the Far East however, EV71 outbreaks are associated with an increased incidence of severe infection and encephalitis. It is unclear if this is because of the particular strains that circulate or if the genetics of the population favour a severe outcome. In either case a vaccine for EV71 would be a valuable preventive measure. A number of possibilities have been examined for production of a vaccine but all have so far failed to give a high level of protective immunity. Of the candidates examined ?empty capsid? vaccines, which are a safe non-infectious version of the authentic EV71 virus particle, have been shown to be the most promising. However, empty capsids are difficult to manufacture making their development to a marketable vaccine unsure. We have developed a new methodology that reproducibly produces empty capsid at high yield offering a potentially viable route for manufacture. In this application we are seeking to apply this technology to the production of an empty capsid vaccine for EV71 and to demonstrate its success in the generation of protective immunity. The work will be done in collaboration with the UK Health Protection Agency and the company Sentinext, based in Malaysia, who are actively working with regional strains and vaccine development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000769","grantId":"G1000769","fundValue":"411951","fundStart":"2011-08-08","fundEnd":"2014-02-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Martin Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
