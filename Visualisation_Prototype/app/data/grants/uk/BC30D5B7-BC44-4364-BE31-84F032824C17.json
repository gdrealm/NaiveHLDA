{"id":"BC30D5B7-BC44-4364-BE31-84F032824C17","title":"TRAffic Modelling for Sensor Network Optimisation and Development (TRAMSNOD)","abstractText":"This project will develop new mathematical and simulation models for traffic in wireless sensor networks. A range of traffic models will be developed / some will be specific to particular applications, while others will be more general in nature, capturing the behaviour of a variety of application types. Traffic information from existing projects will provide empirical input to our studies. Our traffic models will be used to assess existing wireless sensor network protocols in the light of scalability, quality of data, dependability of data, and other important performance aspects which are discussed below. Optimised and customised protocols will be developed, and some of these will be assessed in field trials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D049229/1","grantId":"EP/D049229/1","fundValue":"86792","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ivan  Andonovic","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
