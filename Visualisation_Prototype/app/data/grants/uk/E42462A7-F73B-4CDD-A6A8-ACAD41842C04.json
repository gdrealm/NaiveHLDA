These models contain estimates of future emissions of trace gases and aerosols from natural and human activity, their dispersal throughout the atmosphere, and their chemical transformations into a wide range of secondary products. Photo-oxidation in the troposphere is highly complex, and is initiated by short lived radical species, in the daytime dominated by the hydroxyl radical, OH, and at night by either NO3 radicals or ozone. Chemical oxidation cycles remove primary emitted trace species which are directly harmful to humans (e.g. CO) or to the wider environment (greenhouse gases e.g. CH4,). However, many of the secondary products produced by atmospheric photo-oxidation are also directly harmful, for example O3, NO2, acidic and multifunctional species, many of which are of low volatility and are able to partition effectively to the condensed phase, creating secondary organic aerosol (SOA).\n\nIn order to calculate the abundance of OH, and hence the lifetimes of other trace gases in the atmosphere, it is necessary to have fundamental knowledge of the rates of reaction of the processes that generate and remove OH. OH reacts with both organic and inorganic species, with the former generating significant uncertainty in any OH calculation, since many thousands of reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exist in air. Practically, it has been impossible to identify all VOCs present in air and even where this has been attempted in a comprehensive manner, kinetic data on reaction rates are often missing. This complexity of VOCs, and limited associated data make it intrinsically difficult to reconcile observed OH concentrations and OH reactivity with model calculations. When attempted, significant mismatches are observed, highlighting some basic flaws in our ability to simulate the chemistry of the troposphere. Recent measurements of OH reactivity, combined with measurements of VOCs, have enabled the magnitude of missing OH sinks to be quantified, but not their chemical identity. Other measurements have shown that many unidentified organic components exist in ambient air when comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography is used as the measurement technique.\n\nThis proposal combines for the first time ultra high resolution VOC measurements developed by Lewis and Hamilton in York with the FAGE free-radical measurement and MCM modelling techniques developed by Heard, Whalley and Rickard in Leeds. We will determine the identity of missing organic material that contributes towards the removal of OH, and assess the formation of degradation products from their oxidation. This will be achieved by coupling comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer and flame ionization detector with an OH chemical reactor. By exposing ambient air samples to a controlled environment containing enhanced OH radicals, and by observing the relative change of chromatographic peak intensity for unidentified species relative to the change in intensity for known VOC species (and for which the reactivity with OH is known) the OH reactivity of the unidentified species will be determined. The use a mass spectral detector will allow us to positively identify those species which we observe as contributing significantly as OH sinks, and, provide an assessment of the formation rates of secondary products formed. Using a functional group classification of the major species contributing to losses, we will create surrogate parameterized mechanisms for use in the MCM to allow a more accurate description of processes controlling urban OH and O3 Understanding the functionality of the missing reactivity will enable the atmospheric effects upon air quality and climate due to policy changes regarding complex emissions (such as solvent and petrochemical evaporation) to be better assessed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J008532/1","grantId":"NE/J008532/1","fundValue":"219722","fundStart":"2012-08-17","fundEnd":"2015-02-16","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Jacqueline  Hamilton","coPersons":["Alastair  Lewis"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" Previous studies of the reactivity of the atmosphere suggests that there are a large numbers of radical sinks that are unmeasured. The aim of this project was to try to identify these. We have developed a novel atmospheric flow reactor to study the loss of organic compounds with OH radicals, the major atmospheric oxidant in most locations. This technically challenging equipment requires state of the art chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and has gone through at least 3 different iterations to finally get to a working prototype. The instrument has been deployed in a field experiment with the Universities of Leeds and Birmingham to investigate the role of organics in the atmosphere. As a by-product, the instrument is also an efficient method to study atmospheric kinetics, allowing over 50 rate constants to be measured over the course of a single day - something that previously would have taken months. The work will be carried on by a NERC funded SPHERES PhD student. Ultimately the rate constants will be made available to the atmospheric community. The aim is to provide a low cost, and quick method of measuring atmospheric rate constants of newly discovered but potentially important reactions. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
