Within the academic community the impact of management on organisational performance has become the issue that defines the field of public management. It is now recognised that management shapes performance when conducted from multiple levels, directed internally at operations, targeted at various parts of the environment, and executed with particular skill or adroitness. However, the rapidity with which public service improvement strategies have been put in place means that knowledge has not kept pace with practice.<br /><br />The aim of the project is to provide robust evidence on the ways that management improves the performance of public organisations by undertaking detailed analysis of an extensive dataset collected on an Office of the Deputy Prime Minister funded project.This dataset will be extended with additional surveys and case studies. High-level objectives include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Developing new theoretical perspectives, building contingency models and providing empirical evidence on the impact of strategic management and networking on the performance of English local government.</li>\n\n <li>Making methodological contributions including improvements in the measurement of management and performance and identifying the most appropriate quantitative techniques for modelling organisational performance.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0039","grantId":"RES-062-23-0039","fundValue":"640951","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Mark Walker","coPersons":["Kenneth  Meier","G A Boyne"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
