These include hormones such as GLP-1 and glucagon which are relevant to diabetes and other metabolic disorders especially common in the elderly, corticotrophin releasing factor, involved in stress and anxiety and parathyroid hormone, involved in maintaining bones. It has been known for over 10 years that many of the receptors for these agents can interact with accessory proteins called receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs). RAMPs are found throughout the body. However, until recently, the consequences of RAMP-receptor interactions remained unknown. Recent studies of a small number of these family B GPCRs has shown that RAMPs have important consequences for function and so it is now timely to extend this study to all 15 family B GPCRs. We have discovered that this can be achieved quickly, cheaply and easily by analysing the behaviour of human receptors and RAMPs in yeast and we will use this method to comprehensively explore how all the family B GPCRs found in humans are influenced by RAMPs. We will extend our studies to determine the consequences of these interactions using human cells. The results we generate will enable more sophisticated experiments to be performed to determine the physiological consequences of these interactions in in-vivo models. This is important as our data indicates that RAMP association can radically change the properties of an individual receptor; experiments that neglect to consider the effects of RAMPs can give misleading impressions of the true function of a receptor. Furthermore, it is likely that the association of the RAMP with a receptor will create a structure that can be selectively targeted by drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M00015X/1","grantId":"BB/M00015X/1","fundValue":"232799","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham Robert Ladds","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
