It also provides a unique opportunity for the direct identification and analysis of factors that contribute to development of both normal and tumour tissue.\n \nThe transcription factor, TCF4, has been shown to be critical for intestinal stem cell phenotype but how plasticity and self-renewal is regulated by TCF4 is poorly understood. Therefore, in vivo models of mouse gut-tissue-specific depletion of TCF4 on the APCMin, a mouse model of colon cancer background will be studied.\n\nAn in-depth understanding of the mechanisms that control differentiation of distinct cell lineages during normal development and cancer intestinal epithelial stem cells by Wnt/beta-catenin signalling, may lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets. \n\nGiven that beta-catenin signalling is deregulated in several different types of cancer, this may also lead to greater understanding of these tumours and of carcinogenesis in general.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700763","grantId":"G0700763","fundValue":"332416","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Abdolrahman  Shams Nateri","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
