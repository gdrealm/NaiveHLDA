{"id":"FA2BD48B-7483-48D9-8F14-7ACE1C177CED","title":"Initial Representations and Extended Scene Viewing","abstractText":"<p>Many if not most of our daily activities are informed by visual perception. The visual world guides behaviour and thought by interacting with what we have previously seen and learned and what we are currently thinking about and trying to accomplish. On the one hand, we seem able to apprehend a considerable amount from a very brief glimpse of a scene, as we experience for example in the fast cuts often used in television advertising and in music videos. On the other hand, an important limitation on visual processing is that high-quality visual analysis is restricted to a very narrow region of the visual field centered on the object we are currently looking directly at (fixating). How do these two facts about visual processing fit together?</p>\n\n<p>The proposed research involves a series of four studies aimed at understanding the nature of the information that is initially acquired in the first glimpse of a scene, and how that information then interacts with active exploration of the scene to guide our eyes to interesting and informative scene areas. By understanding the mechanisms that control what we are able to see quickly and how that is used to guide our viewing behaviour, this project will fill in a largely unexplored aspect of how our eyes are oriented intelligently through a scene during ongoing dynamic human scene perception. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F035500/1","grantId":"ES/F035500/1","fundValue":"75916","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John M.
