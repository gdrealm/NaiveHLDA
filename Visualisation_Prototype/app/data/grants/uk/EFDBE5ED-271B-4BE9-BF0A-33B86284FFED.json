This project will establish how this duty is&nbsp;currently interpreted&nbsp; by the ombudsmen and make recommendations as to how they might optimise their potential within the wider administrative justice context and develop new theoretical models of ombudsmen and their work.</p> \n<p>The study will focus on the main roles of redressing complaints and improving administration, the methods which they&nbsp;use and are&nbsp;developing,&nbsp;and their relationships&nbsp;with other stakeholders in the emerging administrative justice system which includes the public, the public services agencies, the courts, internal complaints systems, tribunals, auditors,&nbsp;elected representatives and advisory bodies.</p> \n<p>The project team while concentrating on public services ombudsmen throughout the UK will also study their counterparts in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. These countries&nbsp;have arrangements which are broadly similar but have some differences which should help illuminate key issues.&nbsp;The project team will interview the&nbsp;ombudsmen&nbsp; and a selection of parliamentarians, auditors and advisory bodies. Interviewees in the UK will also include other complaints handling bodies dealing with the police and prisons, child support and&nbsp;tax.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2133","grantId":"RES-000-22-2133","fundValue":"72528","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"William Brian Thompson","coPersons":["Richard Michael Kirkham","Trevor Giles BUCK"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
