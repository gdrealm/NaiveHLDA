{"id":"9D0637B1-F243-4A93-926B-BA924D1ED525","title":"Connected Communities: Philosophical Communities","abstractText":"The proposed research review will look at the contemporary rise of community philosophy groups in the UK and globally, and how individuals and communities use them to enhance well-being, belonging, self-expression and public reasoning. There is growing interest in the idea of philosophy as a way of life that we can practice to live happier and more flourishing lives. But can philosophy really bring people together and create communities, or is it more of a solitary activity? What communities has it created in the past? What forms do community philosophy groups take today? And how could this project encourage their growth? \n\nOne of the main aims of the research review is to identify and bring together what research exists on community philosophy groups, in order to stimulate future research in this area. At the moment, academic research into community philosophy groups has not been brought together in a single scoping study, with the result that this dynamic area has not received sufficient academic attention. This would be the first comprehensive review of existing academic literature on philosophy groups, and would play a valuable role for future researchers.\n\nThe project would also have a practical component, and would act as a catalyst for the growth of the grassroots philosophy movement, strengthening ties between academics, think-tanks and philosophy groups; increasing academic and media awareness of philosophy groups; and setting up a new 'philosophy hub' website, with an interactive map to help people find their nearest philosophy group, and to help philosophy groups attract new members. \n\nFinally, the project would seek to increase the role of philosophy groups in the British government's 'national initiative on well-being', which at the moment is dominated by a social scientific and technocratic approach. The project would show how philosophy groups empower people to reason their way towards their own definitions of well-being and flourishing, rather than having definitions imposed upon them. Grassroots philosophy groups therefore have an important role to play in making the 'national initiative on well-being' more humanistic, participatory and democratic. The project's collaborative partners include organisations closely involved with the 'national initiative on well-being', including the RSA and the new economics foundation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J012262/1","grantId":"AH/J012262/1","fundValue":"31860","fundStart":"2012-02-06","fundEnd":"2012-11-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  See published report and Jules Evans researchfish submission  ","person":"Thomas  Dixon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" See published report and Jules Evans researchfish submission  Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
