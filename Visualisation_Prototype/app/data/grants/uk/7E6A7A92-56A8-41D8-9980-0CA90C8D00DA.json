They are immensely efficient and are believed to have evolved close to 'perfection' in terms of the specific role that they play in metabolism. Fundamental studies of enzyme reaction mechanisms using relatively simple model enzymes have proved very valuable, giving many detailed insights into the way enzymes function in chemical terms. The advent of X-ray crystallographic structures changed the perception, in that one could now see the details of how the atoms involved in the catalytic act are organised in space and at least graphically, propose a plausible reaction mechanism. These mechanistic sketches contain no quantitative information and so have been tested by the all or nothing method of deleting or changing supposedly essential catalytic groups to measure what effect that has. In order to understand catalysis in more depth, one needs to be able to build up an energy diagram that relates the reaction progress with the energy of the system at any given point along the pathway. Some good progress was made many years ago by varying the substrate structure and deducing what effect that had on the reaction rate. There was and still is, a lack of incisive physical techniques that could measure the structural properties of dynamic events in catalysis. This application serves to address this issue by developing the application of fast (microsecond) infrared spectroscopy to studies of the dynamics of enzyme catalysis. This method measures the rate at which groups of atoms vibrate and is very sensitive to the weak forces, such as hydrogen bonding, that are crucial in enzyme catalysis. Thus, where it is possible to focus on catalytic events in the active site of an enzyme, it is possible to gain detailed information about the reaction intermediates (lowest energy states) along the pathway. These are important, as are the transition states (TS) energies gained from kinetic studies, in the evolutionary or lab mutagenic optimisation of catalysis. For optimal catalysis the intermediates should not be too stable and the TS energies as low as possible. This ensures that intermediates are not trapped and the energy barriers do not obstruct passage along the reaction pathway. We propose to develop the application of a new form of very fast IR spectroscopy to the detailed study of the mechanism and reaction pathway of the simple model pancreatic protein digesting enzyme chymotrypsin. This will allow us to construct such an energy diagram. A fast measuring method that will provide detailed structural information is needed to follow the reaction catalysed by enzymes, since these typically takes place in the millisecond time range. Chymotrypsin was the subject of intense study some 25 years ago but is not now of topical biological interest. It is however, a splendid object for study at a deeper level permitted by new technology, since it is robust, inexpensive and can hydrolyse a wide range of peptide and ester substrates. We propose to define the intermediates for this reaction in detail using substrates of increasing size and specificity to generate a structure activity correlation at a more detailed level that has been attempted before. The apparatus constructed will have wide-ranging application in future studies of enzyme catalysis. It will be applicable wherever a suitable inactive caged substrate (that can be made biological active by exposure to light) can be synthesised. This will, for example, include all reactions involving ATP &amp; the other nucleotide phosphates. The enzyme chosen for instrument development and calibration and also for study in its own right is an archetype for several hundred enzymes of topical biological importance, since all employ the same catalytic mechanism. The outcome of this work will be applied to the study of bacterial resistance to penicillin family antibiotics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F003641/1","grantId":"BB/F003641/1","fundValue":"82116","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"C  Wharton","coPersons":["Timothy  Dafforn"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
