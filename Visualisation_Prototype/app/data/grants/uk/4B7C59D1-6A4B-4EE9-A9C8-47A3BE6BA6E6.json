These graphene/boron nitride heterostructures are members of a new class of multilayer (&quot;vertical transport&quot;) electronic devices in which charge carriers can move perpendicular to the plane of the graphene layers. We will identify and optimise the conditions for growth of single atomic layers of boron nitride and graphene, followed by the programmed growth and processing of heterostructures in which single or multiple layers of graphene and boron nitride are grown sequentially to provide architectures by which new types of band-structure engineered functional device can be realised. In February 2013 EPSRC supported our proposed research by awarding us an Equipment Grant to purchase a custom designed molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system dedicated to the growth of epitaxial layers and heterostructures composed of graphene and boron nitride. The University of Nottingham regards this project as strategically important and is supporting it by providing the cost of installation of the new MBE system and the initial running costs for 2 years. We are now applying for this new grant to secure the research staff (1.5 of PDRA) to run the proposed 3-year project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L013908/1","grantId":"EP/L013908/1","fundValue":"481397","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sergei  Novikov","coPersons":["Charles Thomas Foxon","Ioan  Notingher","Peter  Beton","Andrei  Khlobystov","Laurence  Eaves","Christopher John Mellor"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
