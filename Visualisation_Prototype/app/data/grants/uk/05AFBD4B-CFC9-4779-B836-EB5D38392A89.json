{"id":"05AFBD4B-CFC9-4779-B836-EB5D38392A89","title":"Drosophila as a model for Alzheimer s Disease","abstractText":"Alzheimer s Disease and other forms of senile dementia directly affect around 700,000 people in the UK at a cost of #17billion per annum. At present there is no cure for dementia and great efforts are being made to understand the disease and to find an effective treatment. Much of this research has been conducted in rats and mice. This has yielded important information about the changes within brain cells that lead to Alzheimer s Disease, but of course comes at a cost in terms of animal welfare. We propose to replace the use of animals in such studies with the fruit fly. Importantly, we can insert into the fruit fly human genes that produce proteins that we know are important for Alzheimer s Disease, like the protein tau. By using this simple model we can easily investigate the biochemical pathways that lead to the accumulation of tau and the damage that this causes. Moreover, we can administer to the fly chemicals to try and prevent this damage. These two benefits of this simple organism could lead to new targets for drugs, as well as new drugs themselves. In addition, studying the fruit fly may give better insight into the creation of appropriate animal models of Alzheimer s and other brain diseases, thereby reducing the number of animals required to develop accurate models of human disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900801/1","grantId":"G0900801/1","fundValue":"370278","fundStart":"2010-01-25","fundEnd":"2013-01-24","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Kevin George Moffat","coPersons":["Bruno  Frenguelli"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
