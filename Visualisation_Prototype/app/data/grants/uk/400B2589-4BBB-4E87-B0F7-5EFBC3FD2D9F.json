{"id":"400B2589-4BBB-4E87-B0F7-5EFBC3FD2D9F","title":"Three Papers At The Interface of Knowledge and Value","abstractText":"Themes of knowledge and value interconnect philosophically in various ways and this creates some interesting border territory between the theory of knowledge and ethics. This project investigates three points of connection. Firstly, the question of the value of knowledge: How far does knowledge, and in particular moral knowledge, have its own distinctive value over and above the value of true belief? What is the nature of this distinctive value? Secondly, how far can we have moral knowledge of historically distant cultures? Is it always out of order to pass moral judgement on historically distant others, or are there some sorts of judgement we may properly make without doing violence to the fact that morality grows out of a historically contingent shared way of life? And, thirdly, given that we can transmit knowledge of most kinds to other people by telling them, why is it problematic to think we can do so for moral knowledge? If we are unable to transfer moral knowledge by telling, why not? What does this tell us about the nature of moral knowledge and moral education?\\nMaking a contribution to our philosophical understanding of these related questions enhances some central debates in philosophy and helps us to appreciate the borderlands between epistemology and ethics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E003788/1","grantId":"AH/E003788/1","fundValue":"25790","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Miranda  Fricker","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
