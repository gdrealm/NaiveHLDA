From mammals to insects we know that there are important feedbacks from the brain centres to the sense cells, and within the sense organs themselves. However, we know little how these contribute to the processing of sensory information. Whereas humans can focus their gaze on objects of interest, insects cannot do so, as the lenses of their compound eyes have fixed focal ranges. Instead, it is likely that their attention control may take place in a form of coordinated signalling at the level of the first visual synapses, the sites where the photoreceptor neurons innervate the brain. In many animals the first visual synapses utilise continuous electrical messages instead of electrical impulses to transmit information as this provides richer communication. This is also so in the photoreceptor-LMC (large monopolar cell; the first visual interneurone) synapse in fly, where six identical photoreceptors that look at the same small visual field connect to one LMC to improve the quality of their joint transmission. Yet, this is an overly simplified view of the information processing taking place at the first visual synapse. As in the vertebrate eye, the communication from photoreceptors to the brain occurs not just one way, but instead the cells that are synaptically linked to photoreceptors feed also information back to photoreceptors. The significance of this feedback communication is, however, poorly understood, in part because monitoring in electrical messages between small visual neurones is very difficult. Here, we propose to study how the communication between (i) photoreceptors and peripheral neurones and between (ii) photoreceptors and more central visual neurones of the fly enables it to extract and filter information from the visual scene in space and in time, and relay this information to higher visual centres and to the brain. This strategy is facilitated by (1) the possibility of genetically engineering fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) whose neurones display reduced or increased activity, (2) the favourable location and architecture of their visual systems, (3) our ability to perform high quality electrical recordings from visual neurones and (4) the behavioural tests, where we compare the learning performance of wild-type flies and mutant variants that have malfunctioning communication channels feeding back to photoreceptors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D001900/1","grantId":"BB/D001900/1","fundValue":"173966","fundStart":"2006-03-27","fundEnd":"2008-04-26","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our recent findings (data and simulations) about neural mechanisms of visual information processing in the Drosophila eyes are now used in a new open source platform (NeuroKernel) for emulating the fruit fly brain (Columbia University, New York, USA):\nhttp://neurokernel.github.io/\n\nIn General, discoveries from my laboratory are taught in relevant University courses worldwide; integrated into undergraduate lectures in Sheffield and likely in other institutions internationally.
