These are microbes that have co-evolved with humans and are part of our normal, healthy digestive tract. Several different species of these microorganisms have been shown to be beneficial to our health. Indeed, having the correct balance of beneficial bacteria is critical to the prevention of a range of intestinal disorders, the most well known being irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms used by these beneficial bacteria to enable them to survive and flourish in the such a competitive environment are currently not well understood. The genome sequence of a prominent member of our gut bacterial community, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has paved the way for a fuller understanding of these important processes. The bacterium contains a large number of proteins and enzymes specifically tailored for sensing different carbohydrates in its environment and using them as a source of nutrients. This may be how B. thetaiotaomicron is able to survive so well in the human gut which contains a wide range of complex plant derived carbohydrates from our diet (often called dietary fibre) as well as those produced by our own bodies. Microbes are able to sense changes in their environment, such as the presence of nutrients, by binding specific signalling molecules to proteins on the surface of the cell. The recognition of these extracellular molecules activates gene expression changes in the bacteria that enable them to respond to the change in their environment. However, the identity of these signalling molecules and the mechanism by which they are recognised is currently unclear. The aim of this project is to identify the important environmental signalling molecules that recognised by B. thetaiotaomicron and further our understanding of how they are sensed by the bacterium and the changes in gene expression that result. The prospective outcomes of this research are a fuller understanding of the mechanisms symbiotic bacteria have evolved to survive in the human intestine and possibly some insight into what dietary supplements we could use to encourage the growth of these beneficial organisms over harmful ones, thus benefiting human health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F014163/1","grantId":"BB/F014163/1","fundValue":"466840","fundStart":"2008-06-30","fundEnd":"2011-06-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Transcriptomic analysis of Bacteroides ovatus grown on xylans carried out on this grant has been used to identify novel enzymes for use in biomass processing.

Furthered our understanding of the mechansims used by dominant members of our gut microbiota to sense and respond to their major nutrient source, complex carbohydrates.\n2. Discovered that signal transmission across the bacterial cytoplamic membrane likely occurs via a novel mechanism 1. Identification of new enzymes involved in polysaccharide breakdown could be used to develop more efficient routes to biomass degradation to improve the economics of renewable energy production from cellulosic biofuels.\n2. Greater understanding of the mechanisms used by gut bacteria to survive and flourish in the large intestine will underpin development of next generation prebiotics designed to correct imbalanced (unhealthy) microbiota's.
