These sugars are exported from the leaf to all of the other parts of the plant (roots, stems, flower, seeds etc), where they are converted into plant components such as starch, fats, proteins and fibre. Our project concerns the initial steps in this process. At the moment we do not understand what these steps are, or what controls how much of the sugar is converted to starch, to fats, to protein, and to fibre. We have recently been studying plants that lack enzymes that may be involved in the initial steps. This has provided new and surprising information: loss of some of the enzymes has almost no effect on the plant whereas loss of others (in particular a sort of enzyme called neutral invertase) slows plant growth so the plant is very stunted. In this project we want to understand fully the family of neutral invertase enzymes: what they do, how they work and where they exist in the plant cell. In particular, we want to know why the neutral invertases are necessary for normal growth. As well as providing new information about crop productivity, our results will have implications for understanding how much sugar is stored in plants and how much is converted to useful materials such as fibre. This balance affects how we use our crops, and gives us new opportunities to improve them for our food and for the manufacture of 'green' products and biofuels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I01280X/1","grantId":"BB/I01280X/1","fundValue":"547042","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Smith","coPersons":["Trevor Leon Wang"],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":" In plants, sugars synthesised during photosynthesis in the leaves are transported to other parts of the plant such as roots, fruits and seeds to provide the fuel for their growth. We do not yet understand how the rate of growth of these plant parts is coordinated with the amount of sugar available from the leaves. Prior to this project, we discovered that plants lacking one of several enzymes that make sugar available for growth grew extremely slowly. This observation suggested that the enzyme - called cytosolic invertase - was important for coordination of growth and sugar availability. In this project we explored why this enzyme is important.\n\nWe found that the roots of plants lacking cytosolic invertase not only grew very slowly, but also had developmental defects. We established that loss of cytosolic invertase altered the amounts of the sucrose and glucose in the roots, and these altered amounts gave rise to big changes in the behaviour of genes important for growth, thus altering the rate and patterns of growth. Complex signalling mechanisms link amounts of sucrose and glucose to the behaviour of growth genes. Some of these mechanisms are found in many different types of organism, including humans. Our results open up important new approaches to understanding how growth and development are coordinated with sugar availability in plants. In the short term, our work provides a major new link between carbohydrate metabolism and the control of growth and development: areas which have traditionally been researched separately by plant biologists. Ultimately, knowledge in this area will enable biotechnologists to manipulate the growth rate of different plant organs - for example enabling more sugar from photosynthesis to be delivered to the harvested parts of crops such as seeds and tubers, thus increasing crop productivity.
