This started with the Big Bang, and the small irregularities which later grew into clusters, galaxies, and stars. Large black holes formed at the centre of the galaxies.

We have dedicated resources,including a recording room at JBCA, and a dedicated Discovery Centre at Jodrell Bank, to support a large range of activities. We maintain a high public profile through our contacts with local and national television, radio and newspapers, all of which help to maintain a strong public interest in astronomy.\n\nThe outreach included regular events at Jodrell Bank, organized in connection with the Visitor Centre. The BBC starsgzaing live events attract 10 million viewers each year. \n\nThe outreach team also organizes school events and teacher training. An example of our approach is provided by the Asymmetric Planetary Nebula (APN5) conference, organized by academics on this grant. Directly related to this conference, and involving people and materials from the APN5 conference, we organized a two-day programme of activities at nearby Keswick High School (a specialist\nscience school). The activities aimed at all key stages at Keswick and included sessions for local primary school children. Activities included telescope building, operating a transportable radio telescope, a demonstration\nof a Mars rover, the JB inflatable planetarium, and presentations by Science Made Simple. This event reached more than 2000 children in an economically challenged region of the UK.\n\nSuch activities provide strong support to STEM education, by generating interest by the children in these topics and encouraging them to continue in higher education.\n\nExtensive use is made of the internet in the JBCA outreach. Our extensive website attracts over 160,000 external visits each month. We are part of The Children's University of Manchester where we run the 'Earth and Beyond'\nhttp://www.childrensuniversity.manchester.ac.uk/interactives/science/earthandbeyond,\nwith a range of hands-on activities. The Jodcast\nhttp://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/jodcast/ is a twice-monthly podcast, including the latest news, what is in the sky this month, interviews with guest astronomers, a mini-drama, etc. A HD video feed is included. It is\namong the top astronomy podcasts in the world with over 3000 regular listeners per podcast, and was started and is run by postdocs and students, with help from staff. It regularly interviews senior visitors to the Galactic research\ngroup. The Jodcast was supported through an STFC grant. Our Twitter feeds \nhttp://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/feeds/twitter had over 100000 followers. Other events include sidewalk astronomy, where we take telescopes into the city centre, and cultural events at Jodrell Bank. Our strength as innovators has resulted in an STFC Large Award to develop 'festival'-style summer events beginning with the 50th anniversary of the Lovell Telescope and including coordinating Space 50 on behalf of the BNSC.\n\nThe new Discovery Centre at Jodrell Bank, funded by the University and te NW development agency, is attracting 120\\,000 visitors per year. It is world-leading in outreach, with innovative events aimed at hard-to-reach audiences. It works close together with other organizations such as STFC. The leaders were awarded the Kelvin Medal of the IoP for their work.\n\nJBCA is at the forefront of developing technology and\n techniques related to THz technology, data transfer and optical fibres. An industry exchange fellow (Neil Salmon) from Qinetiq worked with the THz instrumentation group, on identifying research likely to have commercial applications. \n\nThe technical component in the current grant is related to ARTEMIS, where we\nhave been asked to supply THz quasi-optical components (including spectral filters and dichroics). This technology is still in development: potential application are in the security and medical sectors, through THz cameras for\nsecurity systems medical imagery.\n\nOur reseach has required development of high-speed internet connections far above standard rates. We have developed applications using lightpaths across academic networks; a technique using non-IP, point-to-point\nconnections and allowing much higher connection speeds. This was done through STFC/EPSRC co-funded research, in collaboration with other groups including the medical profession, where there are potential future applications.\n\nOur SKA work led to the SKA organization being located at Jodrell Bank. This have already created 60 high quality jobs in Cheshire East, and had widespread political support.
