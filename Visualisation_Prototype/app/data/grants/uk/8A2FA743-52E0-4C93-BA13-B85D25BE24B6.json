For any species to propagate, be it a single celled microbe or a human being, it must be able to duplicate its DNA; thereby ensuring that it passes its genetic instructions onto its progeny. In cells, DNA forms a double helix. For the molecule to replicate, the double helix unzips and both strands are copied to generate two daughter molecules. The structure formed as DNA unzips and is copied is termed the replication fork. This research proposal describes a series of experiments designed to investigate the mechanims by which DNA is unzipped and copied in the replication fork. We propose to study the molecular basis of replication termination in a class of microbe, termed the Archaea. The Archaea we work on grow in hot spring environments, such as found in Yellowstone National Park. Because the organisms grow at 80 degrees centigrade, their cellular machinery is unusually robust and this stability greatly aids our analyses of the organism's biochemistry. Furthermore, over the last few years it has become increasingly apparent that the machinery that Archaea use to duplicate their DNA is a simplified version of the machinery that our own cells use. Therefore, as well as shedding light on the process of replication termination in the archaea, our studies may also yield invaluable insights into the evolution and mechanism of DNA replication fork action in human cells too.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G006512/1","grantId":"BB/G006512/1","fundValue":"727188","fundStart":"2009-05-18","fundEnd":"2012-05-17","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Bell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
