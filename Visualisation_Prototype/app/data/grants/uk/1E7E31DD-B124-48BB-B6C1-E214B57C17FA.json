Further investigation suggests that\nmaternal thyroid hormone (TH) has a direct effect on the baby’s brain development. This would rely on a well-functioning placenta to transport TH from the mother to the baby. Placental development itself is also influenced by TH, including a critical stage when the blood vessels within the wall of the womb are invaded by placental cells in order to form an effective placenta for exchange of essential factors between the mother and baby. In abnormal pregnancies where babies are not growing well (IUGR), impaired growth often stems from disruptions in placental development. Indeed, disorders of the thyroid gland in women are associated with an increased risk of placental disorders such as IUGR as\nwell as miscarriages, stillbirths and placental bleeding. Currently, our understanding of how the placenta transports TH and how the development of the placenta is affected by TH is very poor. Although the level of TH in the mother’s blood is a crucial factor, there are other factors which can modulate the effects of TH. One of these factors includes a protein found on cell surfaces called MCT8, which is a potent transporter of TH into cells. We aim to clarify the role of MCT8 within the placenta by studying its presence in human placenta and investigating differences between normal and IUGR pregnancies. We also propose to assess how MCT8 affects the properties of placental cells. Worldwide, disruptions in thyroid gland activity during pregnancy and IUGR are common findings, thus this proposed research would have widespread implications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501548","grantId":"G0501548","fundValue":"199303","fundStart":"2007-01-03","fundEnd":"2009-01-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Shiao Yng Chan","coPersons":["Christopher John McCabe","Jayne  Franklyn","Mark  Kilby"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
