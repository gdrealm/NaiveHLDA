Cilia are important in cell morphogenesis, tissue function and embryonic development, and there are many inherited diseases caused by mutations in genes involved in cilium formation or function. However, we have little idea what the encoded proteins actually do in cells, or how mutations cause the disease. Consequently many of these diseases are untreatable. Our work focuses on a disease called Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS). Patients with MKS seldom survive longer than a few days due to the severity of the disease, which affects the brain, kidneys, liver and skeleton. We use genetics and cell biology to investigate what the proteins mutated in MKS do in cells. We have previously shown that cells where MKS proteins are mutated cannot make a cilium, but how this translates into the brain defects is unknown. We have hypothesised that this is because cells cannot migrate properly. During brain development, cells need to migrate to the correct position and if this goes wrong, there are many problems with the formation and organisation of the brain. We have shown that cells where MKS proteins are mutated cannot migrate well and the work that we propose here is aimed at understanding why this is and how MKS proteins function in cell migration. Understanding this is critical to understanding normal human development so that we can understand what goes wrong in disease, a pre-requisite for the design of treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001644","grantId":"G1001644","fundValue":"453836","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Dawe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
