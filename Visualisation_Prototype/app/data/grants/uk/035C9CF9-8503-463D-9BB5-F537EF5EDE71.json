{"id":"035C9CF9-8503-463D-9BB5-F537EF5EDE71","title":"Localism and connected neighbourhood planning","abstractText":"Under reforms to the English planning system, new powers are being granted to communities to draw up neighbourhood plans in an attempt to produce the 'Big Society'. These plans will take precedence over development plans drawn up at the level of the local authority and thus represent a highly significant potential shift of power to communities in determining how their neighbourhood should function. Crucially, however, the proposed Neighbourhood Forums and Neighbourhood Development Plans seem to ignore the fact that communities are fragmented and that individuals within them may not have a full appreciation of the range of issues facing different people within the same area. Indeed, different parts of the community may have very different conceptions of the geographical area that comprises their 'neighbourhood'. These local understandings may have little or no overlap with the formal legal boundaries that sit across neighbourhoods, making it difficult to interact with the structures of policymaking.\n\nThe Localism and Connected Neighbourhood Planning project seeks to develop a technique to help disconnected communities come together to gather information and devise creative solutions to mutual problems to inform the neighbourhood planning process. A web-based interface will be built that can be accessed through smartphones to allow community members to gather geographical information about their neighbourhood. This information will appear in the form of online maps comprising boundaries, photos, text and ratings of different areas. Two case studies will be undertaken with neighbourhood groups in Birmingham and Bristol who will be loaned smartphones to gather data about their area. Workshops will be held with community members first to train them to use the smartphone interface and second to help them analyse the materials that they collect. This process will not only allow the community to produce robust information about their area, but in bringing different community members together, will facilitate a process of conversations within fragmented communities to find creative solutions to common problems.\n\nThe interface will be developed in such a way as to be straightforward enough for communities to use with minimal input from external agencies. This is particularly important as, in the context of public sector funding cuts, third sector organisations that have previously helped communities engage with regeneration and redevelopment are having to scale back their activities. The project will have a longer-term impact through integration with an ongoing undergraduate placement module run in collaboration with Chamberlain Forum, a Birmingham-based umbrella organisation for community groups. Students from the University of Birmingham will be working with neighbourhood groups for the next 3-5 years and will be able to help different communities gather data about themselves to inform neighbourhood plans using the technique developed by this project.\n\nThe project will work with MADE (Midlands Architecture the Designed Environment) and the Glass-House (a charity focussed on community-led design) to disseminate the technique within the urban design and community sectors. Members of the communities who have been using the technique will take part in a workshop with urban design professionals to talk about their experiences on the project and suggest how it could be further developed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J006580/1","grantId":"AH/J006580/1","fundValue":"31980","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The MapLocal app was trialled as part of a pilot scheme looking at ways of getting communities engaged with townscape/heritage in a project by Worcestershire Council Council Archives &amp; Archaeology Service.

The app was designed to be tested two in neighbourhoods in Birmingham, Balsall Heath and the Jewellery Quarter, that were engaging with neighbourhood planning as part of the Government's localism agenda. A total of 50 people took part in the pilot. The application gave participants the chance to produce photographs, notes of preference, voice comments and boundary data, all of which were automatically tagged to their location within the neighbourhood using GPS ('sat-nav') technology. These materials were then uploaded to a collective map for the community. The pilot generated 626 audio clips and over 1000 photographs and proved to be a useful tool for undertaking the first stage of a community planning exercise.\n\nThe project had three key findings. The first is that using this type of technique can bring participation to people rather than requiring people to come to participation. This can significantly extend the range of people involved in these information-gathering exercises. Secondly, by enabling participants to collect materials while walking around their neighbourhood, richer and more experiential data is produced compared to sitting in a meeting or workshop. The third is that this type of holistic information from a broad set of participants can be used not only to inform neighbourhood plan-making but also for other consultation purposes (for example for historic conservation: the app has already been piloted by Worcestershire County Council) as well as prioritising local services at a time of budget cuts and/or moves towards co-production of shared services. They feed into a broader debate about how smartphone apps can be used to inform public service provision at the neighbourhood scale in an age of scaling back local authority responsibilities.
