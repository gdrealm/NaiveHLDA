It builds on our expertise in stem cell governance and science to make a detailed comparative study of specific aspects of the mutual shaping of regulation, ethics, and science in two different countries.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>Two research assistants will make an in-depth comparison of the interrelationship between national governance, societal evaluation and the national structures of stem cell science in the UK and in Germany. Both countries had implemented different tools of governance to control/prohibit embryonic research in 1990. Stem cell research is the extraordinary case of a global science project developing with high speed but restricted in many ways for dominantly moral reasons. Science policies currently operate without a sufficient understanding of the mutual interaction of regulation, public recognition, funding situations, subtle governance practices, cultural change and scientific progress in a globalizing world. This project aims to fill this gap in our knowledge.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D002656/1","grantId":"ES/D002656/1","fundValue":"245306","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Dupre","coPersons":["Christine  Hauskeller"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
