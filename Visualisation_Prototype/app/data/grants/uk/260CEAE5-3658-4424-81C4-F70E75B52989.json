This includes a diverse range of endpoints where fluorescence imaging is an absolute requirement, and examples include clinical diagnostics, medical research and the fundamental study of cell and tissue biology. Our short proposal aims to solve these problems by use of a technique called time-resolved emission imaging (TREM) - a method realised by us in 2008. The potential value of TREM has only just become a practical reality due to the recent development of very stable and long-lived Pt(II) luminescent complexes (also developed by us). However, the true exploitable value of these molecules is one of versatility by conjugation to selective high affinity antibodies for the multitude of possible immunolabelling targets. This will have a major technical advantage for imaging complex tissues traditionally hampered by autofluorescence, by enabling proteins and cells to be resolved in isolation without fluorescent interference that would otherwise prevent detailed imaging.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G024235/1","grantId":"BB/G024235/1","fundValue":"34675","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"JAG  Williams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" We have shown that light-emitting metal complexes can be used as imaging agents in live cells and tissues. Other research groups across the world have also begun to explore such molecules for this purpose. However, what makes our research different is that we are specifically making use of the long duration of emission of light from these metal-containing molecules.\n\nWe have developed a new technique of time-resolved detection of light on the microsecond timescale, in conjunction with the wi We believe that our results will catalyse interest into the use of time-resolved optical microscopy on the microsecond timescale. The technique allows the selective elimination of background emission (known as autofluorescence) from images of biological material - or indeed material of any origin - on the basis of the timescale. Such autofluorescence becomes increasingly problematic on going from single cells to multicellular samples such as tissue sections.
