The research will attempt to understand the linkages between, and relative significance of, different forms of social divisions as mediated by ethnicity, class, faith, secularism, gender, age, migration, etc. It will also explore whether barriers to engagement exist for some groups of ethnic minority workers in joining or taking part in trade unions and the reason why some workers choose alternative means of accessing support at work. </p> \n<p>The research will provide analysis of the needs and aspirations of ethnic minority workers, whose social networks, length of time since migration, and other factors, may affect the way support for work-based problems, are accessed. The ethnic groups chosen, located in different areas of London, operating in differing labour markets, allow for a theorisation of how people's life world identities develop specific geographies. The research will also develop theoretical insight into how (and if) these geographical communities form specific social and spatial networks to deal with problems at work.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E017363/1","grantId":"ES/E017363/1","fundValue":"327322","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Holgate","coPersons":["Umut  Erel","Anna  Pollert"],"organisation":"London Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
