Northern politics during the American Civil War. My research reveals the importance of anti-partyism - a rejection of &quot;politics as usual&quot; in shaping the relationship between politicians and voters. Fiercely fought elections co-existed with a desire for patriotic unity, creating a tension that was exploited by the dominant Republican Party. My aim is to explore the implications of this kind of politics for the construction of nationalism, the nature of popular political participation and ultimately for Northern victory in the war.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112676/1","grantId":"112676/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Adam Inness Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
