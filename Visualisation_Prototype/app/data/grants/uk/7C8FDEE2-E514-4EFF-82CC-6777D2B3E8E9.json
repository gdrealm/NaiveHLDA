Using advanced statistical methods, the research team's objectives are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>assess whether equivalent-value care services and disability benefits mitigate the impact of disability on wellbeing to the same or differing extents</li>\n\n <li>assess the responsiveness of public support to changes in older people's care needs including examining the consequences of any delays between the onset or increase in severity of disability and the receipt of benefit or services</li>\n\n <li>provide evidence on the likely impacts of potential policy reforms, seeing if there is a case for a change in the balance of cash benefits and care services</li>\n\n <li>assess the role of different configurations of disability within the households of older people; looking at couples where one or both have a disability and how that relates to the receipt of benefits/care services.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The researchers will analyse four data sets: Understanding Society; English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, Health Survey for England Family Resources Survey exploiting new data on receipt of and payment for care services that are being collected in two of these surveys.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K003852/1","grantId":"ES/K003852/1","fundValue":"152121","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ruth  Hancock","coPersons":["Cara  Booker","MARCELLO  MORCIANO","Stephen  Pudney"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
