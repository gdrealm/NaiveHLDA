A prominent challenge is to understand the extent to which variation in environmental conditions affects evolutionary change within natural populations. Improved knowledge in this area will greatly advance our understanding of how genetic diversity is maintained in natural populations and of how populations are likely to respond to predicted changes in climate. The characteristics of individuals in a population are a consequence of their genes, the environment in which they live and the evolution that has occurred up to that point. So much is clear, but this simple statement conceals much complexity. Specifically, the consequences of carrying particular genes can vary with environmental conditions; it is possible (but not generally proven) that organisms express more of their genetic potential under good rather than bad environmental conditions. Similarly, the strength of natural selection, whereby some individuals have higher survival or reproductive success than others, may vary with environmental conditions. Since evolutionary change occurs when natural selection acts on inherited characters, environmental fluctuations can therefore have a substantial impact on evolution. Finally, because some of the genes underlying a particular character (e.g. body size) may be the same as, or associated with, the genes underlying another character (e.g. parasite resistance), characters are not free to evolve independently of one another. Instead the effect of natural selection on one character will be constrained by any selection that is also occurring on other characters to which it is genetically tied. Recent research suggests that these constraints also vary with environmental conditions. Currently, we have very little understanding of how these various processes interact to shape evolution in natural populations. In this study we will investigate the effect of environmental conditions on evolutionary processes using data from an unmanaged study population of Soay sheep on the island of St Kilda, NW Scotland. The data set is particularly useful for this study because, firstly, we have records on the individual life histories of several thousand sheep measured across 23 years. DNA profiling has been used to determine paternity and provide a family tree suitable for the kind of genetic analyses proposed here. Secondly, our previous research has demonstrated that there are four kinds environmental variation which show strong temporal variation affecting sheep performance, and we will be investigating all four kinds of variation in this study: the weather, sheep population density, food availability and parasite abundance. We will address the effect of the environmental conditions described above on the expression of genetic variation, the strength of natural selection and the genetic relationships between characters. Specifically we will ask how the environmental affects first, the expression of genetic variation in single characters like body weight: is more genetic variation always expressed when conditions are good? Second does environmental variation affect genetic relationships between characters? For example, are body size and parasite resistance freer to evolve separately under good or bad conditions? Third, is selection stronger or weaker under good environmental conditions? Together these analyses will allow us to predict the course of evolution under specific time series of environmental conditions - for example systematic climate change. Long-term studies of individually-recognised wild animals such as these are an important source of information on many aspects of ecology and evolutionary biology, and the proposed grant would guarantee continuity of data collection for one of the UK's most valuable ecological and evolutionary field data sets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G004854/1","grantId":"NE/G004854/1","fundValue":"505550","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This is curiosity-driven research in the natural world that may not have immediate application.

The % cover of each plant species for each ha of the study area was estimated. Male and female Lifetime Reproductive Success (LRS) was analysed in relation to two metrics: % Holcus lanatus (a grass) in the home range and % Calluna vulgaris (heather) in the home range. \n\nIn both sexes the % Holcus is associated with increased LRS. In females this higher LRS is due to higher fecundity, higher lamb survival and longer lifespan. The cause of the association is less clear for males. \n\nIn males the % Calluna is associated with higher LRS which comes about through longer lifespan. No effects were seen for females.\n\n\nHow best to predict an evolutionary (i.e. genetic) response to selection?\n\nWe have investigated predictions of the response to natural selection using methods from agriculture (specifically the univariate and multivariate forms of the breeder's equation) and by estimating the genetic tie-up (genetic covariance) of trait and fitness, for four size traits in Soay sheep. There are appreciable differences in the predictions, with the breeder's equation consistently predicting increase in body size while the covariance measure does not. The genetic covariance predictions are closer to observation (the sheep are actually getting smaller). These results suggest that predictions of selection from the breeder's equation are upwardly biased by unmeasured factors in natural populations, i.e. the effects of environmental heterogeneity.\n\nIs there selection against fecundity?\n\nEach year most Soay females have singleton lambs, but some have twins. We have investigated an array of potential effects of twinning on life history (survival and reproduction), and their dependence on age, sex, and environmental conditions. These analyses reveal substantial fluctuations in the costs of twinning (and costs of being a twin) with environmental conditions. We have combined these inferences with estimates of genetic variation for the propensity to twin (simultaneously accounting for ewe age, own twin status, and the population-level probabilistic reaction norm to population density, etc.) in an integral projection model. The model predicts that twinning should be declining in the population. This is curiosity-driven research in the natural world that may not have immediate application. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
