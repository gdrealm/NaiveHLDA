Only then can new, selective drugs be developed. One of these chemicals is ATP, present in all cells and released into the external environment whenever there is tissue damage or inflammation. The sensors for extracellular ATP on the surface of cells are the purinergic receptors. Two members of this family that are expressed in immune cells and have been shown to be involved in pain pathology are P2X4 and P2X7. They have a trimeric structure and form ion channels that allow cations to move into and out of the cell. These two receptors have many different functional properties, not least their sensitivity to ATP; P2X4 is activated by much lower ATP levels than is required to activate P2X7 receptors. In addition, we have recently shown that these two receptors can also associate with each other to form mixed, heteromeric, receptors with properties that distinguish them from either parent type. This diversity of receptors increases the complexity of ATP signalling. Our aim is to determine the subunit composition of these receptors to reveal the structural diversity of receptors expressed, and to understand what role these different receptors play in transmitting the ATP signals in immune cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F001320/1","grantId":"BB/F001320/1","fundValue":"319872","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings from this project have been utilized by the research community who are working on purinergic signaling and who wish to understand the role of these receptors under normal physiological conditions and in diseases associated with inflammation. There has been considerable interest from pharmaceutical companies in developing new therapeutics targeting the P2X7 receptor and therefore our work highlighting differences in the structure and function of the human and mouse isoforms of the receptor is crucially important because the actions of these novel compounds are first tested in mice.

These receptors are particularly important in disease states when levels of ATP outside the cell are raised. In disease their activity is increased and this contributes to conditions such as inflammation and also cell death. We have identified mechanisms that contribute to this increased activity and this will hopefully open up new avenues for the development of therapeutics. We have also identified variants of the receptor and characterized them in order to understand how they behave differently from the original variant. We showed that mice that have been genetically engineered to delete this receptor, still express these other variants. This is important because these mice are widely used to investigate the role of the receptor in mice models of disease. We have also shown that there are important difference in the way that the mice and human receptors behave. This also needs to be considered when utilizing the mice models. There is considerable interest in developing therapeutics that target this receptor for treatment of inflammatory conditions and cancer. Our research has improved our understanding of important differences that exist between the properties of the mouse and human receptors, which is of crucial importance if we are to utilize mice to investigate the role of the receptor in disease and to test new drugs. We are now in a position to generate mice that are effectively null for the receptor so that we can properly understand what role it plays in health and disease.
