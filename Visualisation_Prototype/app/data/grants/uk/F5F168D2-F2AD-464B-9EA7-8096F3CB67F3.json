All current designs have significant drawbacks, but we believe that we have an entirely new method for determining and designing solar concentrators optimised for any latitude or common weather conditions. Our aim is to use mathematical approaches to help design an efficient device which is cheap to manufacture and easy to integrate into a wide variety of buildings (domestic and commercial) and then to produce a prototype.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F027451/1","grantId":"EP/F027451/1","fundValue":"107190","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Malcolm  McCulloch","coPersons":["John  Ockendon"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
