In vitro and in vivo resource for the research community.","abstractText":"The fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) is an important model organism for the studies of normal development and different disease states. It has a relatively small but well annotated genome encoding for approximately 15 000 genes, of which 13500 are protein coding genes. Drosophila has been a successful model organism partly because the great majority (close to 80%) of human disease genes have homologous genes in fruitfly making it a very good model to study various diseases. The rapid life cycle and powerful methods to analyse gene function makes fruitfly an attractive system to study gene function even in a large scale.\n Understanding the function of each and every gene and protein in an organism is the ultimate goal in biology, and this is likely to be significantly easier to achieve in Drosophila than in human. Currently, depending on the organism, up to half of the genes identified through genome sequencing studies are of unknown function and it is a major challenge in the future to understand the function and interactions of all these genes.\n Another challenge in biology is to understand how to exploit the gene information to improve human health. There has been intensive research focus on human disease genes, which when mutated lead to disease. However, a disease mutation does not always lead to disease. Furthermore, very often a drug targeting such a disease gene fails to cure the disease due to unexpected effects. Thus we need to learn more about the other genes that are regulating these diseased genes and deciding factors if a disease gene mutation will cause disease. Some of these genes may not have been identified and that is why we need a new tool to identify such disease regulating genes.\n Genetic research has traditionally used two approaches to study gene function which are complementary in nature. These are decreasing the amount of an expressed gene by mutations or gene silencing or by increasing the expression of the gene with additional copies of the gene. Whereas decreasing the amount of gene expression in a large scale has been relatively easy by generation and utilization of mutant collections or gene silencing, increasing the gene expression has been hampered due to lack of suitable gene collections.\n We aim to isolate the majority of the Drosophila protein coding genes to form such a large-scale collection of genes, which can be expressed in both cultured cells and in live fruitflies to study the function of these genes in different biological processes such as cell growth and animal development. Such genome-scale collections have been or are being made for other species, including the collections of worm (C. elegans), mouse and human genes, but no collections are available for screens in live animals. \n Our aim is that the Drosophila gene collection becomes a resource for the whole scientific community. Having a flexible and thoroughly characterized gene collection covering most of the genome would save significant amount of time and resources and enable researchers to enhance their scientific output. This resource would also be important for the identification of new genes regulating disease progression or any other biological processes.\nFollowing the tradition in Drosophila research where openness and free distribution of research reagents and clones is promoted, this resource of genes, as plasmids and fly strains, will be made available for all researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J006424/1","grantId":"BB/J006424/1","fundValue":"361127","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The cloned genes have been and are being used to generate transgenic Drosophila strains.
