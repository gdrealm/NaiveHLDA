{"id":"24D1157F-7D78-48ED-A484-1854EF31D7E9","title":"ROYAL: Illuminated Manuscripts of the Kings and Queens of England","abstractText":"In 1757 King George II presented the approximately 1950 manuscripts of the royal library to the newly founded British Museum. Since that time, the manuscripts have remained together as a distinct collection: ROYAL. Royal preserves the medieval and Renaissance library of the kings and queens of England, and includes within the illuminated manuscripts most surviving medieval paintings owned by them. Hence its importance can hardly be overstated. \\n\\nYet remarkably, the Royal illuminated manuscripts have been little researched, and have never been presented to a scholarly or wider public as a group. The British Library, home of the Royal collection since its creation in 1973, plans to change this situation by working collaboratively with the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, to present in October 2011-March 2012 a major exhibition of illuminated Royal manuscripts at the British Library in London. To make this possible a research project on these manuscripts will be undertaken, responding to research questions at complementary levels. \\n\\nThe project team will be led by two internationally-recognised experts in illuminated manuscripts: Dr Scot McKendrick, Head of Western Manuscripts at the British Library, and Professor John Lowden of the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London. They will be assisted by a postdoctoral scholar, providing opportunities for this scholar to develop her or his expertise and career, and to develop expertise in medieval and Renaissance art, history, and presenting manuscripts to a range of audiences. The scholarly research resulting from the experience and expertise of this team will allow the Royal manuscripts to be presented and contextualised in new and creative ways. \\n\\nTo build further collaborative relationships between the British Library and higher education experts and fellow curators within the United Kingdom and internationally, the project will be overseen by an international advisory board, and will include an international conference on the collection to be held at the end of the project.\\n\\nEach of the approximately 400 illuminated manuscripts in Royal with significant medieval or Renaissance decoration will be examined individually, to research its patronage, artist, scribe, models and function. The results of this analysis will allow thematic questions to be formulated and answered, and the approximately 150 exhibition manuscripts to be chosen. The exhibition will then be structured around these thematic questions. These themes are likely to include studies in the formation and development of the collection of illustrated manuscripts by English monarchs, the role of pictorial narrative in illuminated vernacular histories ordered by Edward IV, the change in function of monastic illuminated manuscripts after the dissolution of the monasteries, and the way in which illuminated manuscripts in the library were used and received by their owners. \\n\\nThe project will interpret and present medieval and Renaissance painting in Royal manuscripts in an innovative way in an exhibition in London, which will be accompanied by a fully-illustrated exhibition catalogue. The research will also be disseminated freely to an international audience through an online virtual exhibition and online introductory 'tours' for a general audience explaining aspects of the Royal collection of illuminated manuscripts. \\n\\nIn addition, in order to respond to the needs of the wider scholarly community and provide long-term research benefits, the information on all 400 manuscripts will be made available online as part of the BL's free, illustrated Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts (CIM). The research made available through the CIM and the other online resources will allow scholars and the general public to formulate their own further research questions, promoting active learning.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G000808/1","grantId":"AH/G000808/1","fundValue":"265006","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Re-use of exhibition material during the Purbeck Art Weeks, 26 May-10 June, 2012. The organiser of the Purbeck Art Weeks came to the exhibition, and asked to use some of the hanging banners of images from the manuscripts in the upcoming festival, as a backdrop for lectures and performances of early music. Banners were delivered to the festival on 5 April, 2012.\n\n\nUse of exhibition material by the Turner Award-winning Mark Leckey in his Techno-Animism exhibition in 2013. Mark Leckey was inspired by the exhibition, and will be using images from the manuscripts in his new exhibition, Techno-Animism, which will be shown at the Bluecoat Art Centre, Liverpool, from 15 February, 2013 -16 April, 2013, and the Nottingham Contemporary Art Gallery, from 26 April-30 June, 2013. Leckey had requested one of the facsimiles of the manuscripts featured in the exhibition, the Carmina regia, Royal 6 E. ix, and may be exhibiting another Royal manuscript, Royal 9 C. x in the exhibition. Alternatively, Leckey may be developing a 3D digital surrogate of the manuscript to display. Leckey's exhibition has been influenced by the Middle Ages very much as he sees this time period as crucial to the belief of the spiritual and physical worlds overlapping and co-existing together on the same 'plane'. He also deals with the idea of animism and alchemy as his work explores the pervasiveness of modern technology and the fact that we are constantly surrounded by devices that bring non-living things to life. He believes that this is akin to an archaic state of being - a primitive belief of alchemy; when physical states and material processes were used as metaphors for spiritual entities and transformation.\n\n\nRoyal Opera House design inspiration. A set designer worked on a project in collaboration with the Royal Opera House, for George Benjamin's Written on Skin, a new opera set in the thirteenth century. She used research from the Royal project and exhibition to inform this design.\n\nTwo stained glass artists attended the Royal manuscripts study day, and were inspired by the presentations of the project research and the exhibition. These artists are working on a stained glass window project whose general theme is the history and heritage of north Wales from the late 13th century onwards. The artists have been examining different visual and contextual resources and have made several sketches from manuscripts featured in the exhibition, and will be acknowledging these Royal manuscripts as source material in their work.

An early output, addressed primarily to researchers, was new online, illustrated descriptions of over 600 Royal manuscripts within the British Library's Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts (http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/). Each description presents the results of a fresh first-hand appraisal of the physical, textual, palaeographical artistic and historical evidence of each manuscript and an assessment of previous scholarly literature. Many descriptions contain significant new findings about individual volumes and their relationship to other comparable material. All subsequent outputs of the project drew on these descriptions and enhanced them through further targeted research on primary and secondary sources.\n\nThe highly successful exhibition Royal Manuscripts: The Genius of Illumination, held at the British Library from 11 November 2011 to 13 March 2012, was the culmination of the research project, and was seen by 70,000 visitors. Within this exhibition further research undertaken on illuminated manuscripts associated with the English royal family was presented to visitors. The findings of that research determined the overall shape to the exhibition, helped identify its thematic sections and informed the interpretation of each of the exhibits. The same findings provided content for all the associated outputs of the exhibition, ranging from a three-part TV series, an App and regular blog entries on the manuscripts to a two-day academic conference.\n\nThe principal findings of the research are presented in the published exhibition catalogue. In his catalogue essay the Principal Investigator, Dr Scot McKendrick, explored how and why manuscripts produced in France and the southern Netherlands played a significant part in the lives of successive members of the English royal family. He demonstrated how dynastic marriages and diplomatic exchange reinforced shared cultural affinities, providing contexts for both gifts of Continental books to English royalty, and the importation of French books into England by French-born queens. For McKendrick such deluxe books are important signifers of the 'fashionable exclusivity' of English royalty. \n\nThe Co-Investigator, Professor John Lowden, explored the meaning, function, and reception of the royal manuscript as idea and object. By tracking the long history of books produced as gifts from and to kings or associated with monarchs he highlighted the extremely complex patterns of production and consumption reflected in royal manuscripts. \n\nAs her contribution the Project Manager, Dr Kathleen Doyle, showed that there were only three kings and one prince primarily responsible for the collection of illuminated manuscripts for the Old Royal library. Doyle highlighted that all but one of them were collected at a period when manuscript production had virtually ceased and identified a major motivation for their collecting as the establishment and enhancement of an appropriately grand royal library. \n\nIn the catalogue entries the project team, including the Project Researcher, Dr Joanna Fronska, presented their findings on each of the 154 royal manuscripts selected for exhibition. These findings include new identifications of artists, scribes and owners, as well as of the political and cultural contexts in which the books were produced, commissioned or presented. This award was made as a Museums, Galleries, Archives and Libraries Research Grant for research to underpin new displays and temporary exhibitions. The purpose of the grant was to maximise the impact of scholarly research in the arts and humanities by making it available to the wider public through exhibitions.\n\nAs outlined above, this was accomplished by the five month exhibition, Royal Manuscripts: The Genius of Illumination held at the British Library from 11 November 2011 to 13 April 2012attendeding by nearly 70,000 visitors. Other outcomes designed byof the project for non-academic audiences are described in detail in the various outcomes categories: they , and include a three-part TV series, five new interactives, an audio guide, an App, a short film of the exhibition, three new virtual exhibitions, Facebook pages of all of the British Library manuscripts featured in the exhibition, regular blog entries on the Medieval and Earlier Manuscripts blog, a highlights book focussing on forty-one manuscripts, a study day, and the extensive lecture series, published articles, talks, and guided exhibition visits.\n\nThe impact of the exhibition and research as contributions to society are outlined in the Impact outcomes. They, and include the re-use of exhibition material in the Purbeck art Weeks, re-use in future exhibitions by the contemporary artist Mark Leckey, design inspiration for stained glass and for an opera set, and content inspiration for an animated feature film.
