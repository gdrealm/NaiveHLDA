A public discussion on light and sight - the limitations of seeing and the indirectness of sight.","abstractText":"The key aim of the project is to deliver a panel discussion at the Young Vic theatre in London on 18 December, before the evening show of Sound&amp;Fury's Going Dark. This panel discussion will be open to the public, and free to attend, and will be entitled 'How Far Can You See? A discussion on light and sight - the limitations of seeing and the indirectness of sight'. \n\nThrough this, we aim:\n\nTo inform and enthuse audiences about the dynamics of vision - how it is applied to both cosmic views and the everyday world we live in. \n\nTo make audiences aware of how visual perception and optics have been a key aid to astronomy, and how sight is a fragile tool in our perceptual understanding of the world and the universe beyond.\n\nTo offer audiences an understanding of how the brain interprets images, and how we make sense of a vast cosmos stretching the limits of our perception.\n\nThe overall impact of the project will be a deeper understanding of and enthusiasm for the scientific themes explored in Going Dark.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K006010/1","grantId":"ST/K006010/1","fundValue":"1600","fundStart":"2012-12-18","fundEnd":"2013-01-17","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Alice  Massey`","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Fuel Theatre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
