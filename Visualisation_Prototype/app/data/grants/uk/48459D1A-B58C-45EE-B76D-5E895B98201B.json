It is related to concepts of 'social capital'.&nbsp;This project's&nbsp;aims are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>To measure trust and trustworthiness in a representative sample of the British population</li> \n <li>To investigate which individual attributes may affect them. </li>\n</ul> \n<p>The project shall pursue these aims experimentally, through a new design of the so-called 'trust game', administered to a small but near-representative sample of the population. It will measure trust and trustworthiness in interactions between anonymous individuals. </p> \n<p>This will be the first study of its kind for Britain, and one of only a few in the world based on samples from the general population, as opposed to university students. It is valuable as part of the broader field of studies currently challenging the theoretical foundations of micro-economic theory. It also provides behavioural measures, based on experimental evidence, of both trust and trustworthiness. The latter is particularly important, for while there may be some limited value in asking attitudinal questions about trust--of the kind 'do you think most people are trustworthy?' --surveys are useless when one aims to measure trustworthiness. The research makes it possible to overcome the shortcomings of both surveys and experiments using students.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E022030/1","grantId":"ES/E022030/1","fundValue":"78181","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John Francis Ermisch","coPersons":["Thomas  Siedler","SC Noah  Uhrig","Heather  Laurie","Annette Elisabeth Jackle"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
