{"id":"CEEC72C9-CCA0-4852-AB7C-AD28AAC1D318","title":"Rape in the 21st Century: Old Behaviours, New Contexts and Emerging Patterns","abstractText":"<p>Home Office statistics show a continuing decline in the conviction rate for rape over the last three decades, which reached a low of 5.27 per cent in 2003. Building on an existing data set, this project seeks to explore how far the construction of ‘real rape’ – committed by strangers, occurring in outdoor locations and involving weapons and injury – operates as a template from which all other types of reported cases are judged. This stereotype serves to disguise the social realities of rape – that perpetrators are invariably known and that it takes place in the complexity of daily life and everyday routines. </p>\n\n<p>Drawing on a dataset of 3,500 cases and linked qualitative data, the project will involve developing analytical frames to assess the extent to which decision-making by complainants, police, prosecutors and judges at all stages of the process can be predicted through the elements of real rape, and whether the concept needs adapting for the 21st century. The findings will add to our understanding of the attrition process and the justice gap.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1679","grantId":"RES-000-22-1679","fundValue":"38582","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Liz  Kelly","coPersons":["G  Uzelac"],"organisation":"London Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
