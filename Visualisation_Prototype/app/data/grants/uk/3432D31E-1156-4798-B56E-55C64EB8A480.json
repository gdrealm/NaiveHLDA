{"id":"3432D31E-1156-4798-B56E-55C64EB8A480","title":"Diamond based pressure sensors for high temperature harsh environments","abstractText":"The project aims to develop a self-integrated metal-piezoelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MPIS) field-effect transistor device for high-sensitivity and high-temperature pressure detection based on microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology. The fundamental science such as the physical properties of the interfaces between diamond and piezoelectric material, resonant properties of the diamond MEMS cantilevers, and the basic device properties of the MPIS will be investigated. The target is to achieve a high strain factor of 100 (100 times of metal gauge, 10 times of silicon piezoresistance at Room Temperature) and high-temperature (&gt;400oC) pressure sensing. The resulting pressure sensors would be of benefit to major UK industrial players, such as British aerospace, automotive, power generating (especially nuclear power station, as diamond is a radiation hard material), oil, space and manufacturing sectors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K003070/1","grantId":"EP/K003070/1","fundValue":"99336","fundStart":"2013-02-28","fundEnd":"2015-02-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Haitao  Ye","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
