Despite considerable advances in immunosuppression and in short-term graft survival, little improvement has been observed in long-term survival rates. In 2007, 6200 patients were on the waiting list for kidney transplantation. Donor organs are therefore highly precious resources, and any intervention that reduces graft failure would be of enormous benefit. Nevertheless, early dysfunction or primary non-function is still seen in up to 50% of grafts from cadaveric donors and about 10% from live donors; these early failures are largely due to injury caused by blood supply being interrupted during cold preservation and warm revascularization of the graft. On the other hand, this injury may also play an important role in the development of chronic graft rejection and late graft loss. We will develop a therapeutic strategy that protects against the injury through a unique mechanism and thereby improves the survival and function of the transplanted kidney. Prevention or reduction of injury could both prevent graft failure and also allow prolonged storage of organs, thus improving donor allocation. If our strategy protects against the injury through a unique mechanism and thereby improve the survival and function of the transplanted kidney, this can be rapidly exploited in the clinical setting. While our therapeutic strategy is confined to renal transplantation, the clinical utility extends to all organ transplantation in which injury impairs graft function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802392","grantId":"G0802392","fundValue":"288624","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Daqing  Ma","coPersons":["Patrick H Maxwell","Catherine Jane Tralau Stewart","Andrew John George","Mervyn  Maze"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
