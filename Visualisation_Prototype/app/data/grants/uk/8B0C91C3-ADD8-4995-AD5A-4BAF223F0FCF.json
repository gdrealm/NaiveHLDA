{"id":"8B0C91C3-ADD8-4995-AD5A-4BAF223F0FCF","title":"Modeling Working Memory","abstractText":"<p>The project aims at understanding working memory, the part of the cognitive system that is responsible for holding a small amount of information available for processing (roughly speaking, the current contents of our awareness). The research will develop several alternative theoretical models of working memory, based on a common framework in which all models are implemented as neural networks. The models are tested by comparing their behaviour with data from published experiments. The modelling work will be accompanied by a series of experiments that will provide additional data to test and refine the models. The experiments, to be conducted with young adults, test working memory performance with tasks requiring maintenance of short lists of items (eg letters) while at the same time processing other material, or processing part of the memorized material. The main questions to be addressed by the experiments are: (1) Why is information forgotten over the short term â€“ do traces in working memory decay over time, or does interference between memory traces cause forgetting? If interference is important, how exactly does it work? (2) What is the role of rehearsal in maintaining information in working memory; how do people rehearse, and what is the mechanism of rehearsal?&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F038046/1","grantId":"ES/F038046/1","fundValue":"669774","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Klaus  Oberauer","coPersons":["Chris  Jarrold","Simon  Farrell"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
