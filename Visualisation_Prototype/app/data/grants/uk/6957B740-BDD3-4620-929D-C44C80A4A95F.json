These networks will have huge demands will be placed on them in the coming years due to bandwidth-hungry applications such as mobile video and machine-to-machine communication (e.g., data transmitted by sensors and wearable devices). To support the rapid growth in traffic, there is a pressing need to develop communication schemes that are both reliable and spectrally efficient, i.e., deliver the maximum data rate per unit bandwidth. Further, it is essential that these schemes have low computational complexity so that they can be easily implemented in hardware.\n\nThis project addresses the problem of constructing fast, reliable, spectrally-efficient schemes for communication channels with Gaussian noise. The Gaussian channel is widely used to model both wireless and wired communication links. We propose to design coding schemes for this channel using the framework of sparse linear regression. We call these codes Sparse Hadamard Codes since each sequence of data bits is mapped to a codeword (a long vector) constructed from a Hadamard design matrix. \n\nWe will first develop a fast message-passing decoder for these codes whose complexity and memory requirement grows slowly with the code length. A software implementation of the decoder will be used to compare the performance of sparse Hadamard codes with state-of-the-art coding schemes for the Gaussian channel. We will provide rigorous theoretical guarantees on the performance of the decoder, and show that it (asymptotically) achieves the maximum spectral efficiency for a Gaussian channel. The codes will also be extended to multi-user scenarios in which there are multiple transmitters or receivers (Such channels are used to model wireless networks). In the final phase of the project, will develop GPU and FPGA implementations of the sparse Hadamard decoder. \n\nIn summary, the project will develop a suite of fast communication schemes for the Gaussian channel that optimally utilise scarce network resources such as radio spectrum and power to reliably deliver near-optimal data rates. \n\nThe novel algorithms developed in the project are also relevant to applications beyond communications. One such example is compressed sensing MRI, where the goal is to reconstruct an image from a small number of MRI measurements. The small number of measurements (compared to a typical MRI scan) reduces the time a patient has to spend inside the scanner. The message passing algorithms developed in this project can be applied to this setting to recover the MRI image. It can also be readily adapted to other compressed sensing settings where are measurements are made via Fourier/Hadamard matrices. Such applications will be explored towards the end of the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N013999/1","grantId":"EP/N013999/1","fundValue":"98927","fundStart":"2016-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ramji  Venkataramanan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
