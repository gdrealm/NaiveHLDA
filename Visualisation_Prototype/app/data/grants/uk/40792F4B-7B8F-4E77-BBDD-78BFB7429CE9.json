{"id":"40792F4B-7B8F-4E77-BBDD-78BFB7429CE9","title":"Particle Physics Consolidated Grant 2012","abstractText":"The main objective of this consolidated grant is to continue and extend our core science programme through the exploitation of our data-taking experiments at the LHC and at J-PARC. In ATLAS we will seek to confirm the existence of the Higgs boson and to measure its properties. We will search for evidence of new physics including SUSY and Extra Dimensions. In addition we shall perform stringent tests through precision measurements of the Standard Model, including W,Z and diboson production, to confirm its validity at the Terascale. At LHCb we will extend these measurements to the forward region and perform measurements of CP violation and the properties of the B_s. At T2K we will make the definitive measurements of theta_13, study neutrino interactions in the Near Detector, and prepare for the antineutrino programme. Looking towards the future we are leading the ATLAS upgrade and we will continue our R&amp;D for the LHCb upgrade. Our R&amp;D programme underwrites the ATLAS and LHCb upgrades. Through ERC funding we are extending our quark flavour programme to rare kaon decays in NA62. For the future of our neutrino programme we are carrying out R&amp;D in Liquid Argon tracking detectors and we are preparing for a future giant detector facility. We lead the LHeC proposal for a new electron accelerator and an experiment at CERN to study ep/eA scattering at the Terascale.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K001418/1","grantId":"ST/K001418/1","fundValue":"7219750","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Themistocles  Bowcock","coPersons":["Sergey  Burdin","Andrew  Mehta","Timothy  Greenshaw","Philip Patrick Allport","Max  Klein","Joost  Vossebeld","Tara  Shears","Uta  Klein","David  Hutchcroft","Christos  Touramanis","Neil Kevin McCauley","John Bourke Dainton"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
