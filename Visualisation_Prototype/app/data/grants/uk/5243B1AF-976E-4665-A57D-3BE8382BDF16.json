As a result the development of small molecule organocatalysts including chiral Bronsted acids for asymmetric synthesis has gained considerable attention over the past five years. Asymmetric catalysis by Bronsted acid catalysts is presumed to involve proton transfer between catalyst and substrate, however the mechanism has not been rigorously probed thus far. To date, the success of a given Bronsted catalyst is highly substrate and solvent dependent and few broadly successful catalysts exist. There remains ample scope for optimisation of existing catalysts and design of new better catalysts, which is unachievable without a better mechanistic understanding. This research proposal will address several key mechanistic questions about Bronsted acid organocatalysis using solution kinetics and structure-activity approaches.Physical-organic chemistry/the application of quantitative tools taken (historically) from physical chemistry to the solution of problems in mechanisms or in understanding properties-originated and flourished in the UK for several decades. However it is now recognized that in the last twenty years POC has fallen out of step with developments in synthetic chemistry. The present proposal represents an ideal case where detailed POC kinetic and structure-activity studies can be conducted at the crucial early stages of catalyst development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E041531/1","grantId":"EP/E041531/1","fundValue":"208185","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"AnnMarie Christine O'Donoghue","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" The aim of the project was to probe the role of planar chiral ferrocenyl DMAP derivatives as organocatalysts. In particular, many of the fundamental properties of these organocatalysts, such as pKa and intrinsic nucleophilicity, had not been studied despite their widespread application in organic synthesis. The synthesis of the catalysts and a range of analogues proved challenging, however, was eventually achieved. The unexpected instability of the conjugate acids of these catalysts required the development of new stopped flow methodology for pKa determination. The method was developed for the parent catalyst towards the end of the grant period and has since been applied by a PhD student to a broad range of analogues. We have shown that the ferrocenyl substituent acts as a spectator with respect to acidity (Organic Letters, 2012, submitted). The kinetics of addition of a range of nucleophiles towards ketenes in the presence of the series of planar chiral ferrocenyl catalysts has been assessed and evaluated by a Bronsted LFER analysis (manuscript in preparation). Chiral organocatalysts are becoming increasingly popular in academia and industry as 'greener' alternatives to organometallic analogues. Due to the absence of catalytic metals in these catalysts, they are usually cheaper, more stable and do not require expensive disposal. Knowledge of the mechanism of action of these catalysts will facilitate the further application of these catalysts in industry as well as academia. The methodology developed during the course of this grant for the determination of the pKas of unstable acids can be widely applied to other systems. Since the grant period we have developed three additional collaborations specifically focused on the determination of pKas of chiral organocatalysts (e.g. P. Christ, A. G. Lindsay, S. S. Vormittag, J-M. Neud?rfl, Albrecht Berkessel and A. C. O' Donoghue, &quot;pKa Values of Chiral Bronsted Acid Catalysts: Phosphoric Acids/Amides, Sulfonyl/Sulfuryl Imides, and Perfluorinated TADDOLs (TEFDDOLs) &quot;, Chem. Eur. J., 2011, 17, 8524).
