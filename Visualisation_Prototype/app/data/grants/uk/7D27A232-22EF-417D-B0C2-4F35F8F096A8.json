{"id":"7D27A232-22EF-417D-B0C2-4F35F8F096A8","title":"XUV interaction and warm dense matter at QUB","abstractText":"The interaction of XUV photons with matter is an important sub area of warm dense matter studies of key interest in astrophysical plasmas, planetary sciences and fusion sciences. It is also of key interest in advanced lithography methods that will use ~13.5nm XUV photons for processing of next generation electronics. We propose to carry out a study of the interaction of XUV radiation with matter including warm dense matter, with experiments on collisional absorption, ablation with XUV radiation and creation of novel states of matter. We will base the work in large measure at the TARANIS laser facility at QUB but will also use our access to external facilities such as the new XUV and X-ray free electron lasers as well as larger laser facilities.In the proposal our discussion of previous work is centred around TARANIS as this is most relevant and illustrates the potential of the system. In the discussion of experiments, we concentrate on details of a couple of particular experiments that will take a long time to perform and set up as this illustrates the type of complex experiment we will be able to field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I031464/1","grantId":"EP/I031464/1","fundValue":"628251","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  So far the data has been used to undertsand better how intense XUV beams interact with solids Other Cultural,Societal","person":"David  Riley","coPersons":["K Matthew Zepf","Ciaran  Lewis","Marco  Borghesi","Brendan Hugh  Dromey"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" In general we published several papers that helped further undertsanding of XUV interaction with solid targets.
