{"id":"65DBED83-A53A-4361-8844-0BB022DA927A","title":"Crises of Empire: Colonial Economies, Labour, and Post-War Protest, 1945-1966.","abstractText":"<p>During the late 1940s a strike wave swept through the British Empire. Almost no territory was left unaffected, as strikes disrupted key industries in the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, and South East Asia.</p>\n\n<p>However, in spite of the Empire-wide nature of the strikes there have been very few comparative studies of this post-war industrial unrest. Where the strike action has been discussed the protests have been subsumed by a broader narrative of imperial decline, rising anti-colonial nationalism, and Cold War rivalry. Not only does this obscure the social and economic causes of the strikes but by simply characterising the unrest as a response to metropolitan infirmity or anti-colonial nationalism, the specific patterns of labour affiliation and trade union mobilisation are overlooked. Therefore, using Malaya, British Guiana, and the Gold Coast as case studies, the aim of this project is two-fold. Firstly, to investigate the causes of the strikes, examining the relationship between post-war economic conditions, social organisation, and trade union mobilisation. Secondly, to analyse the ‘imperial response’ to the industrial unrest. Here the project will document how the colonial authorities sought to contain the labour disputes through the introduction of metropolitan-style industrial relations machinery and improved social welfare infrastructure.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K008749/1","grantId":"ES/K008749/1","fundValue":"136522","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth Michael Curless","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
