{"id":"7C2283C2-3D16-4089-A639-C78716379759","title":"An Edinburgh Speech Production Facility","abstractText":"The proposal is for a facility designed to record and analyse the movements of the lips, tongue, and jaw during spoken dialogue. This facility will be the first of its kind in the UK, and will be useful for applications in speech recognition and speech synthesis, as well as for developing theories of the cognitive representations and processes involved in normal and impaired speech production. The first output of the facility will be a database of recorded dialogue that will be useful for researchers interested in the relationships between speech movement and acoustics (important for speech technology applications), as well as in the particular types of pronunciations that speakers use during spontaneous dialogue.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E016359/1","grantId":"EP/E016359/1","fundValue":"82388","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"James M Scobbie","coPersons":["William John  Hardcastle","Robin  Lickley","Sonja  Schaeffler"],"organisation":"Queen Margaret University Edinburgh","findingsText":" See the entry for EP/E01609X/1, P.I.
