The further aim is to grow general interest in science among people who may not otherwise have come into contact with science. The Stoke-on-Trent region in particular has a chronically poor history of educational achievement, and we aim to improve this by engaging all sections of society in accessible science activities (meeting them in the street, and taking as little as a minute of their time).\n\nThe impact will be a raised awareness of the nature of the Sun and its relation with Earth, among an audience who would not have taken steps to find out for themselves; an appreciation for science and its relevance to society; increased participation in higher education.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L001489/1","grantId":"ST/L001489/1","fundValue":"4000","fundStart":"2013-07-16","fundEnd":"2014-07-15","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jacobus Theodorus  Van Loon","coPersons":["Joana Maria Oliveira"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
