Our data perhaps surprisingly did not support the premise that extreme longevity is assocaited with enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. In fact pearl mussels were least resistant to oxidative stress compared to shorter-lived freshwater bivalve species. These finding will be of interest to gerontologists who are concerned with investigating the reasons for the extreme longevity in invertebrates compared with short-lived terrestrial mammals.
