Decisions are modelled by variables, which aresubject to constraints, modelling logical and resource restrictions. Theparadigm is sufficiently broad that many interesting problems can be modelled,from satisfiability problems to scheduling problems and graph-theory problems.Understanding the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems has become amajor and active area within computational complexity.The overall goal is to classify CSPs according to complexity, giving acharacterisation for which CSPs are tractable.We will focus especially on characterizing the complexityof counting in Constraint Satisfaction problems.Specifically, we will study the complexity of exactly counting","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E062172/1","grantId":"EP/E062172/1","fundValue":"190177","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  They have led to a stream of research by other academics in theoretical computer science.
