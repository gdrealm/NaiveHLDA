{"id":"F569F331-CD1A-4CA2-BD2A-7495EB55D29E","title":"Allowing for cliffs and slopes in the risk surface when modelling small-area spatial data","abstractText":"<p>There is great interest in how and why the risks of ill health vary from place to place. When assessing these spatially varying risks, scientists need to take into account the fact that places which are physically close together tend to have similar health risks. This spatial similarity affects the statistical methods required to assess these risks, and if ignored, can lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn. There is a problem however, in that existing techniques cannot tell the difference between places that are next to each other and are similar, and those that are next to each other but quite different. This is a particular problem in cities, where two neighbouring areas can have very different characteristics. This project will develop a method that can determine when geographically proximate areas have different characteristics and when they are similar. The method will then apply the right kind of statistical approach in each situation. The project has three parts. First, the new method will be developed. Secondly it will be tested to see how much better it is than the existing technique. Finally, it will be applied to three health problems in the central belt of Scotland. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I015604/1","grantId":"ES/I015604/1","fundValue":"52556","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This research project has developed new statistical methodology for modeling localized spatial autocorrelation, and as such its non-academic economic and societal impact was always likely to be limited, especially in comparison with its scientific impact. However, the project has had the following impact in this area.\n\n• The research has impacted upon the work of the Glasgow Centre for Population Health (GCPH), because it appears in their recent report in April 2013 entitled &quot;Investigating the impact of the spatial distribution of deprivation on health outcomes&quot;.\n• Government agencies such as Health Protection Scotland (HPS), the Information Services Division (ISD) of the National Health Service in Scotland, and the Scottish Government have been informed of our research via a one-page executive summary/briefing note we created.\n• A blog entitled &quot;What if neighbouring areas are very different&quot; posted about our work on our Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health (CRESH) website.

This methodology extends the majority of existing research, which assumes a global level of spatial correlation, i.e. sharing a common border equals spatially correlated risks. In addition, a small amount of literature exists on tackling this problem, but the methods proposed suffer from problems of parsimony and have latterly been shown not to be effective. The methodology described in the grant proposal was developed first, and has been published in two high-ranking peer-reviewed statistics journals (Biostatistics and Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series C). These papers, together with the associated conference presentations, collectively present the following findings:\n• The new statistical methodology can accurately identify the locations of &quot;risk boundaries&quot; in simulated data.\n• The identification of such boundaries leads to more accurate estimation of both the spatial pattern in the risk surface and the effects of covariate factors than are obtained using existing global smoothing models.\n• The risks of alcoholism, cancer and respiratory disease in Greater Glasgow show the existence of many &quot;risk boundaries&quot;, again suggesting that traditional global smoothing models are inappropriate.\n\nIn conjunction with the papers a software package called CARBayes was produced for the statistical software R, which allows other researchers or public health professionals to apply the methods we have developed to their own data. The software goes further than what was promised in the grant proposal, and can fit the models developed to continuous (Gaussian) and discrete (Poisson and binomial) data. This software is an add-on package for the statistical software R. A paper describing the software has been published in the Journal of Statistical Software.\n\nThe statistical methods developed have led us to investigate the factors that might cause &quot;social boundaries&quot; to occur, i.e. what causes rich and poor communities to live side-by-side? One possible explanation is the role of physical barriers, such as railway lines or rivers, which prevent the two communities from mixing. We have a paper in the Annals of the Association of American Geographers on this work.\n\nAs a result of this research project we have been successful in obtaining grant funding for a follow on project from EPSRC (EP/J017442/1), which will extend the research developed here into the spatio-temporal domain. This will allow us to determine whether the locations of &quot;risk boundaries&quot; have changed over time, for example due to shifting population demographics. The main impact of the project to date has been scientific, and aimed at the wider academic community. This has come in the form of two novel statistical modelling approaches, which extend existing methods by allowing for localised rather than global spatial smoothing of areal-unit health data. Two peer-reviewed publications have resulted from this methodological development. This impact has been ensured by the creation of the CARBayes software, which is freely available for others to use via the R platform. This software has a growing user base, and I get regular questions about its use from both statisticians and non-statisticians alike. Education,Environment,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
