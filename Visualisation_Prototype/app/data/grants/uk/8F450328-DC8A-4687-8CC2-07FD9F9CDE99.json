For the product to be successful a set of complementary products also need to be available that will enhance the focal product's value from the perspective of a user (Sengupta, 1998; Casadesus-Masanell and Yoffie, 2007).</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to enhance our understanding of the role of such complementary interdependencies of an innovatorâ€™s products and their implications for firms and industries. To this purpose, the project includes the further development of an existing dataset on technology-based firms which will be analysed using advanced econometric techniques, the development of an international network of researchers working in the area and the diffusion of the results from the research to academic and non-academic beneficiaries. No ethical issues are involved in the project.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001388/1","grantId":"ES/K001388/1","fundValue":"170477","fundStart":"2013-03-18","fundEnd":"2016-03-17","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elena  Novelli","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
