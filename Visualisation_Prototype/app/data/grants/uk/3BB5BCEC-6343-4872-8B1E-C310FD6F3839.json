'Advanced Materials for Nanophotonics'\n Advanced Materials is one of the 8 Great Technologies designated by BIS and marked by EPSRC for prioritised investment. In turn, photonics and nanophotonics is one of the most penetrating technologies of the 21st century with impact in areas of information processing, solar energy harvesting, biomedical sciences, security sensing and many others. Development of new research directions and novel applications in nanophotonics requires access to appropriate nanofabrication and characterisation equipment. The facility will combine a range of state of the art instruments for fabrication of ultrasmooth and ultrathin (&lt; 1 nm) layers and nanostructures and their characterisation with functionalities currently not available in London. The equipment requested will strengthen present research activities in plasmonic and nanophotonics while opening up new avenues of research such as electron beam-induced nanophotonics and nanoscale quantum optics. \n\n2. 'Single-Molecule Biophysics and Photonics'\nUnderstanding the physical mechanisms governing life has been, and still is, one of the most significant scientific challenges of humanity. The molecular mechanisms by which each individual process occurs remains largely unknown, as it requires capturing the (often fast) dynamics of an individual molecule over large periods of time. Single molecule techniques have recently allowed the tracking of individual molecules, either by the use of light (eg. fluorescence STED) or by the use of mechanical force (Magnetic Tweezers, AFM). The equipment requested will be a hub of bespoke single molecule instrumentation, unique in the world, that will unveil the physical laws behind important biological questions. For example, capturing fleeting molecular processes; investigating the physical models that govern protein folding; characterising the phase behaviour of lipid membranes on sub-resolution length scales and investigating the role of lipids on a range of cellular processes.\n\n3. 'Ultrafast spectroscopy for Nano-, Bio- and Chemical imaging'\nThe proposed facility provides a coherent and efficient platform dedicated to both the near and far-field non-linear optical characterization of nanostructured and biological materials and systems. A laser scanning microscope system will enable a simultaneous &quot;multidimensional&quot; characterization of these samples providing, in addition to polarization, spectral and angular resolution, information about processes below nanosecond timescales, and spatial resolutions of the order of the wavelength of light. The system will provide access to laser excitation with pules durations below 25 femtoseconds, providing a powerful pulsed optical excitation of samples. A pulsed white-light laser source will provide a source for a scanning near-field optical microscope to probe non-linear optical properties on the nanoscale.\n\n4. 'Tactile Internet'\nDriven by ultra-reliable &amp; ultra-low delay networking technologies, along with developments in haptics and edge intelligence, the Internet as we know it will be dwarfed by the emergence of a to-date unprecedented Internet, the Tactile Internet. It will be able to deliver physical, tactile experiences remotely and invoke a fundamental shift from content-delivery to skillset-delivery networks. The equipment requested will create new networked autonomous robotic systems, combining telecommunications, robotics and AI planning. This unique combination will allow us to: explore unsolved problems in telecoms; test novel approaches to autonomous planning in geographically distributed production and service systems; test novel communication protocols of robotic remote proxies for haptic exploration of objects in a variety of sectors; test novel algorithms in remote servicing; test novel large-scale applications of AI planning and test the unique juxtaposition of communications, actuation and intelligence through the integration of all the above.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M028054/1","grantId":"EP/M028054/1","fundValue":"803971","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Mottershead","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
