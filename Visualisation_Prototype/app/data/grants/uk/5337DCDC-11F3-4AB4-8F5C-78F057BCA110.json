People tend to relapse and need hospitalisation more often and can become very disturbed. Despite the problems, services are unclear of the best way to help such patients. There have, however, been some promising recent studies of possible treatments. \n\nWe are comparing a new psychological approach with the treatment patients currently receive. This approach tries to increase patientsâ€™ motivation to cut down or stop using drugs and alcohol by helping them to weigh up the costs and benefits of using. It also offers help -cognitive behaviour therapy- in how best to make changes. This may include coping with the most unpleasant symptoms the person experiences, these may be hearing voices or depression or paranoid fears. Sometimes people use drugs or alcohol to help them deal with these problems.\n\nThis research has the potential to influence mental health clinical practice in a very substantial way. The treatment approach might be used both nationally and internationally if found to be successful. There may also be considerable cost savings given that the illness complications associated with continued substance use in schizophrenia are expensive.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200471","grantId":"G0200471","fundValue":"1930450","fundStart":"2004-05-03","fundEnd":"2010-09-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Barrowclough","coPersons":["Til  Wykes","Nicholas  Tarrier","Gillian  Haddock","Jan  Moring","Graham  Dunn","Linda Mary Davies","Thomas  Craig","Shon William Lewis","John  Strang"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
