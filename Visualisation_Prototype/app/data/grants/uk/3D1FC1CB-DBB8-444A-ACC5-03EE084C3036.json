The discovery in 2002 that it is present in many cooked foods was, therefore, quite a shock for the science community, the food industry and regulatory authorities. The disquiet was compounded when it became clear that acrylamide is formed not as a result of the presence of an additive or a change in agricultural or food processing methods that could be readily reversed, but from naturally-occurring substances reacting at the high temperatures achieved during the basic cooking processes of frying, baking and roasting. Any complacency that had built up since that first discovery has just been swept aside by the publication of two studies linking the eating of 'high-acrylamide' foods with cancer in humans. Foods derived from potatoes have a particularly high acrylamide risk. The major route for acrylamide formation is the breakdown of an amino acid called asparagine in the presence of sugars. This is part of the Maillard reaction, which occurs during the cooking of food and is also responsible for the production of flavour and colour. This puts a constraint on what food processors can do to deal with the problem and, despite the fact that some progress has been made, the levels of acrylamide in foods such as French-fried potatoes, crisps and other potato-based snacks are still commonly several hundred parts per billion (ppb). While no limit has yet been set for food, regulatory authorities around the world have stated that they wish to see dietary intake of acrylamide reduced. Methods for lowering acrylamide in foods include reducing cooking times and temperatures and making the processing conditions more acidic. However, these methods are reaching the limit of what can be achieved. The use of asparaginase reduces acrylamide levels in certain processed foods but it is ineffective in, for example, sliced and chipped potatoes and is unsuitable for use in the home. An alternative is to produce raw materials with reduced levels of sugars and asparagine. This is the aim of this project, focusing on potato. The strategic target is to produce potatoes that retain sufficient sugars and amino acids for the generation of colour and flavour compounds but which produce less acrylamide. The project will involve researchers from Rothamsted Research, the University of Reading and Scottish Crops Research Institute, and key companies in potato production, processing and marketing. Outputs will include advanced knowledge of the mechanisms regulating asparagine and sugar accumulation in potatoes, the identification of important genes that are responsible for the differences between varieties and 'proof of concept' using genetic modification. The project will generate new tools for plant breeders to use in breeding programmes and will enable a better understanding of the effects of plant nutrition on acrylamide risk.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G018995/1","grantId":"BB/G018995/1","fundValue":"233922","fundStart":"2009-08-17","fundEnd":"2012-11-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel George Halford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Rothamsted Research","findingsText":" Acrylamide forms during cooking and processing predominantly from the reaction of free asparagine and reducing sugars in the Maillard reaction. The identification of low free asparagine and reducing sugar varieties of crops is therefore an important target. In tyhe first part of this project, nine varieties of potato (French fry varieties Maris Piper (from two suppliers), Pentland Dell, King Edward, Daisy, and Markies; and chipping varieties Lady Claire, Lady Rosetta, Saturna, and Hermes) grown in the United Kingdom in 2009 were analyzed at monthly intervals through storage from November 2009 to July 2010. Acrylamide formation was measured in heated flour and chips fried in oil. Analysis of variance revealed significant interactions between varieties nested within type (French fry and chipping) and storage time for most free amino acids, glucose, fructose, and acrylamide formation. Acrylamide formed in chips correlated significantly with acrylamide formed in flour and with chip color. There were significant correlations between glucose or total reducing sugar concentration and acrylamide formation in both variety types, but with fructose the correlation was much stronger for chipping than French fry varieties. Conversely, there were significant correlations with acrylamide formation for both total free amino acid and free asparagine concentration in the French fry but not chipping varieties. The study showed the potential of variety selection for preventing unacceptable levels of acrylamide formation in potato products, and the variety-dependent effect of long-term storage on acrylamide risk. It also highlighted the complex relationship between precursor concentration and acrylamide risk in potatoes. The project addressed a key issue for the food industry and its findings will help food processors to produce potato-based products that are within the indicative levels for acrylamide that have been set by the European Commission. The project has also provided new knowledge on the genetic and environmental factors that affect the acrylamide-forming potential of potato and this could be exploited by potato breeders to produce new, low acrylamide varieties.\n The project was a LINK and the partner companies and organisations provide the main rouite for exploitation Agriculture/ Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
