An emerging body of evidence indicates that climate models may underestimate the current changes in the global water cycle. It is crucial and timely that the causes of discrepancies between simulated and observed responses of the atmospheric hydrological cycle to warming are identified and addressed. Bringing together important lines of research and collaborators with unique expertise the current proposal seeks to test the following hypotheses: (i) Are limitations of the satellite data hampering our ability to monitor changes in the global water cycle? (ii) Are present day changes in the Earth's energy balance relating to aerosol influencing trends in the hydrological cycle? (iii) What are the implications for projections of future changes in rainfall and its extremes? To answer these questions, an appreciation for the root causes of changes in rainfall is required. Evidence from sophisticated climate models and observations from a variety of sources point to robust increases in atmospheric moisture with warming at about the rate expected from basic physical considerations (around 7% per K warming). Rising moisture fuels intensification of the heaviest rainfall events. This is not the full story: global precipitation is intrinsically linked to Earth's atmospheric energy budget. The relatively slow rises in atmospheric radiative cooling, as the planet warms, can only support modest rises in latent heating through precipitation of around 1-3% per K, much slower than the rises in heavy rainfall. This leads to a reduction in rainfall away from convective regimes. While both climate models and satellite observations indicate that the dry regions are becoming drier and the wet regions wetter, further comparison suggests that the models underestimate this response. To understand the reasons for the important discrepancy between models and data, we bring together important areas of expertise in the Earth's energy balance and the Global water cycle. The three main approaches are to (i) monitor, (ii) inter-compare and (iii) understand and predict changes in the hydrological cycle. These can be achieved by employing a unique combination of satellite and surface-based measurements of precipitation, evaporation and the Earth's radiative energy balance. Inter-comparison of existing and new satellite datasets will allow improved monitoring of changes in key variables such as precipitation and evaporation. Combining the hydrological and radiative components of the energy and water balance in models and observational data will enable a better understanding of the physical processes involved and improve estimates of changes in the surface radiation budget. Carefully constructed model experiments will explore the impact of changes in aerosol on the hydrological cycle through radiative forcings. The results will be paramount in improving estimates of future impacts from changes in the hydrological cycle on societies and ecosystems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G015708/1","grantId":"NE/G015708/1","fundValue":"254387","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The Met Office has used the findings to develop hydrological understanding framework, to communicate policy-related advice and in improving models used in weather and climate prediction.

Projecting how the global water cycle will change in a future climate is only possible using detailed computer simulations, the realism of which must be confirmed. It is therefore of great importance to identify the physical processes and responses in the water cycle that we understand and have confidence in. Through the PREPARE project we have combined detailed computer simulations, satellite and ground-based observations and basic physics to improve monitoring, understanding and simulation of changes in rainfall in the wet and dry regions of the globe. In particular we have demonstrated the pivotal role of the atmospheric energy budget in determining current and future changes in rainfall and its extremes. \n\n\n\nThrough the project, we analysed the latest computer simulations of climate produced by a number of research centres across the world, including the UK Met Office and NASA. We have shown that low-level water vapour is increasing by 7% for each oC of warming in observations and simulations and this is leading to increases in rainfall intensity and a tendency for the wet tropics and high latitudes to become wetter and the dry sub-tropics drier. We used natural variability to investigate how rainfall becomes more intense in warmer months since this may be a useful way to test the reliability of simulations of future climate in which rainfall intensity increases. Observations suggest a stronger response of rainfall intensity to warming than the simulations, yet the discrepancy is smaller than previously thought: the observed changes are at the upper end of the spread in climate model simulations.\n\n\n\nWe compared simulated rainfall variability with observations from satellite measurements and rain gauges since 1979, involving collaborating with scientists from NASA to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the observations. We found that computer simulations of climate are able to reproduce many characteristics of the changes in rainfall that have been observed since 1979. Simulations of the atmosphere (using observed sea surface temperatures as input) are able to capture the observed year to year variations in rainfall over tropical land areas including tropical Africa, the Amazon and South East Asia. We also discovered a discrepancy between satellite data and simulations over the oceans, especially before 1996. In the computer simulations we found global rainfall increases by around 2% for each oC of warming but observations suggest a stronger response. Our comparisons help to build confidence in the realism of the changes in rainfall projected by these simulations which is of importance to policy makers and planners. Yet they also suggest that the simulators may underestimate variation in rainfall over the oceans in the current climate. This indicates that more research is necessary to improve the satellite observations, as well as the simulators, some of which is now being carried out through the NERC PAGODA project.\n\n\n\nAs an additional key finding of the project, we provided the first observational confirmation that the Earth has continued to heat in the 2000s despite the relatively stable surface temperatures. The extra energy was quantified as 0.5 Joules per second for each square metre of the globe (equivalent to 250 billion kiloWatt heaters spread across the world). We discovered that this excess energy is warming the ocean below the surface layers. We were able to match the extra energy measured at the top of the atmosphere using satellite data with extra energy arriving in the oceans down to 2000m depth within the error bounds of the data and resolving a debate in which it was argued that we are unable to track energy around the climate system. The research also has implications for changes in the Earth's radiative energy balance and the effect on the global water cycle and has lead to a new collaboration as part of the NERC DEEP-C project.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the PREPARE project has made advances in monitoring current changes in precipitation and its extremes, provided evidence both for agreement and disagreement between observations and simulations of current changes in rainfall and linking conceptually to the Earth's radiative energy balance, the driving force behind global climate change. This has furthered confidence in projected future increases in the occurrence of flooding and drought. However regional predictions remain a great challenge, since only small spatial shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns such as monsoon systems and jet streams can dominate regional fluctuations in rainfall. This is a key area of future research some of which has also been investigated by the NERC HydEF project. Met Office and modelling centres will benefit from information on realism of simulations and reliability of future projections. Government departments, including the Department of Environment and Climate Change, will benefit from information on what is robust and what is uncertain in terms of future changes in rainfall and its extremes and also current information of how Earth is currently heating up despite the hiatus in surface temperatures. Stakeholders including water companies and the insurance industry were also informed as to the key project results, relating to current and future changes in the global water cycle, Through stakeholder meetings, face to face briefings and the media, the results of this work have been used to inform the general public, including government departments.
