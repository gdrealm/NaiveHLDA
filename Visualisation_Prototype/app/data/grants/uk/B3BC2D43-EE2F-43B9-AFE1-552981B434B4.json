The technology maximises the information that is conveyed while, at the same time, guaranteeing artefact free outputs. The technology is a platform technology, and has a wide scope for potential application. In this proposal,while considering multiple problem domains, we target a specific problem: fusing colour images with infra-red for applications in the security and defence sectors, where there is an immediate and direct need for this technology. A key objective of this project will be to develop prototype software that is tailored to the needs of these end-users. Spectral Edge ltd is a company which was spun out in consequence of this grant. The company which carries out true image visualization is based in Cambridge and raised a significant funding round in March 2014. \n\nThe True Image visualization has attracted 3 TSB grants (with a total amount raised about ?150K)\n\nThe company has a novel current focus: helping those suffering from colour blind see better. Our technology helps colour deficient observers see like we do. Yet, in sodding, we maintain good colour fidelity for colour normals.\n\nOur research is a platform technology. Hence the multiple ticks to sectors of interest.
