Currently there are no effective treatments due to our limited knowledge on how the diseases are developed. It is clear however that a type of nerve cells called cortical interneurons are either lost or do not function properly in the brains of these patients. Abnormal cortical development has also been suggested as a major contributor to the cause of this disease. \n\nPluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are permanent cell lines capable of giving rise to all types of specialised cells, such as nerve cells, in the laboratory culture dish. In this study, we aim to develop ways to generate cortical interneurons from human PSCs. We will design cultures to contain essential identified connections that affected in the diseases. We believe that this model nerve cell culture will serve as a valuable experimental tool to help us to understand how neuropsychiatric diseases are caused. We are also interested in using these stem cell derived specialised cells for transplantation and to develop potential cell therapy for epilepsy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L020807/1","grantId":"MR/L020807/1","fundValue":"556602","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Meng  Li","coPersons":["Adam Clarke Errington","Vincenzo  Crunelli"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
