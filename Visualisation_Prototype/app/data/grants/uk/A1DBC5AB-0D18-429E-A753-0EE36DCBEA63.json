It tries to explain where all the elements around us, the oxygen in the air, the iron in our blood, the silicon in computer chips, come from. Where and how were they formed? On top of this, nuclear astrophysics tries to understand how nuclear reactions affect the life and death of all stars. How do such tiny things influence such massive objects as stars?\nMost stars get their energy by burning stable elements, such as the carbon and oxygen we are familiar with, over long periods of time. The energy is produced by nuclear reactions, turning one element into another. However, not all types of carbon, for example, are the same. Different types have different numbers of neutrons (but the same number of protons) and are called isotopes.\n\nAstronomers can study stars by looking at the light that shines from them. From this light they can tell what elements are produced and this gives nuclear physicists information on which nuclear reactions could be important. The proposed research programme will use the beams available at the TRIUMF laboratory in Vancouver to study one reaction which influences how particular isotopes of fluorine and neon are produced in stars.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J000639/1","grantId":"ST/J000639/1","fundValue":"11773","fundStart":"2011-07-20","fundEnd":"2012-01-19","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Laird","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
