By common consent the NRF is France's most important 20th-century literary-cultural review. Because it reflected and commented on political events, it rapidly attained institutional status. \nDespising defeatism, Petitjean defended republican principles and opposed appeasement policies. Under the Occupation, however, he was compromised, yet Paulhan defended him in the post-Liberation purges.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112697/1","grantId":"112697/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-15","fundEnd":"2006-05-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Martyn  Cornick","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
