{"id":"08566B7A-01F9-4FDB-ABBC-47D26F8094CC","title":"Clock genes and long-term biological timing","abstractText":"Recently scientists have identified a small set of genes shared from insects to man that generate the body‘s daily and seasonal rhythms. Disruption of these rhythms occurs when you experience jetlag, work nights, or feel the winter blues. Surprisingly, the so called clock genes act in most cells of the body to keep time with the outside world, and to synchronise the many chemical events that occur throughout the day in living tissues. Currently we are studying the way clock genes function in the brain and pituitary gland to generate long-term cycles in reproductive hormone secretion, and how the same genes may be used in different ways locally in the reproductive organs to affect male and female fertility. We believe that ‘good timing means good reproductive health‘ - and that understanding the timing systems at the most basic level will lead to new treatments of infertility and disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600678","grantId":"G0600678","fundValue":"781602","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gerald  Lincoln","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
