These babies have a higher chance of dying and those that survive are more likely to have health and developmental problems in childhood and adulthood. Children who are born early are also more likely to have special educational needs, or may not perform as well as their classmates in their school tests. Recent research suggests that even those babies who are born a few weeks early may have more problems in childhood compared with those who are born after a full term pregnancy.\n\nStudies of the long term impact of prematurity need to include a large number of children (at least 100,000). There have been studies as large as this, but their findings may not be relevant to children born today. For example, they are based on children born in the 1960s-90s who experienced different newborn care to babies born today. Also, most of the studies are based on Scandinavian or American children, who will have experienced different health and education systems to children in the UK.\n\nThere is a need for a large UK study to assess the health and educational outcomes and costs, associated with preterm birth in a population of babies born in the 21st century.\n\nAims and objectives\nOur aim is to carry out a study on children born in England in 2005-6 and use it to investigate differences in health and education outcomes for children born early compared with those born after a full term pregnancy. Our analysis will determine whether being born early has a larger impact on children who are living in poverty or are socially disadvantaged. We will also measure the costs of prematurity to health and education services.\n\nMethods\nThe study will include all babies born in England during 2005-2006 (about 1 million) and will follow-up the children through linking together different routine information sources. We will try to obtain data on any hospital admissions or outpatient visits that the children experience until the age of 10, and their school results from national tests which are performed when the children are 5, 7 and 11 years. The school results will also indicate whether the child has special educational needs and what support is given. This information will give us a picture of each child's health and school results, and will enable us to see how much this is affected by being born early. \n\nTwo groups will be formed to advise on the project. One group will include relevant experts, stakeholders (e.g. the support group 'BLISS for babies born too soon, too small, too sick') and will include representatives of families affected by premature birth. Another group will provide a user's perspective on all aspects of the project. Members will include families affected by premature birth (e.g. parents of preterm children, and young adults who were born early). \n\nPotential applications and benefits\nThe results of this study will be made available to the relevant professionals. The results will inform teachers and other education professionals about the type of problems that may occur in children who were born early and what kind of special educational needs support is needed. The results will also assist in counselling of parents about the types of problems that may occur, which will enable them to be more prepared about what to expect and when to seek help from professionals. Our results on the costs associated with prematurity will be helpful to organisations who plan or deliver services in hospital, schools or the community. They will also help ensure that the children who need the most help are identified and given appropriate support. Finally, we will create a resource for researchers who are doing similar record linkage studies, which will describe how we accessed, linked and analysed these large datasets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M01228X/1","grantId":"MR/M01228X/1","fundValue":"626816","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Quigley","coPersons":["Oliver  Rivero-Arias","Claire  Carson","Nirupa  Dattani","Alison  Macfarlane","Elaine Margaret Boyle","Jennifer Jane Kurinczuk","Samantha Jayne Johnson","Pamela Mary Sammons","Stavros  Petrou"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
