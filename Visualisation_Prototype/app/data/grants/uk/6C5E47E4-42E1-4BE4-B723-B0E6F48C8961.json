{"id":"6C5E47E4-42E1-4BE4-B723-B0E6F48C8961","title":"Daniel Calparsoro","abstractText":"The research consists of a study of the contemporary Spanish film director Daniel Calparsoro, who rose to prominence in the mid1990s as a maker of films about life on the margins in Basque and Spanish society. Calparsoro stands out from the clutch of cinema directors who emerged in Spain at this time for his uncompromising approach to film, in contrast to others' incorporation of commercial film values. In the genre of films that feature marginalised urban youth, he is also noted for his prioritisation of a female viewpoint as opposed to the usual young male perspective.\n\nAfter an introduction that sites Calparsoro in the context of Spanish and Basque cinema of the past ten years, the research will undertake an analysis of each of Calparsoro's films in chronological order. It will conclude by a star study of Najwa Nimri, (the actress particularly associated with Calparsoro and widely seen as inspiration for his much of his work) that considers how Calparsoro's vision persists in Nimri's star image.\n\nThe overall purpose of the study is twofold: not only to offer an analysis of Calparsoro's work to date, but also to look at ways of theorising the auteur the film director of specific, individual vision in terms of interrelation with his or her cultural and industrial context. Thus the study will not only talk of how an awareness of the Spanish cinema scene complicates our understanding of Calparsoro's work, but also how the case of Calparsoro problematises current perceptions of Spanish cinema.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E503802/1","grantId":"AH/E503802/1","fundValue":"21808","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ann  Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
