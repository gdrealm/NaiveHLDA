The important fole of tungsten in present (JET/ASDEX) and future (ITER) \nmachines is a challenge for atomic physics and modelling based upon it.\n\nWe propose a series of calculations which are essential to reliably model and interpret observations\nfrom these plasmas. We will also carry-out such modelling applicable to the present day machines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L021803/1","grantId":"EP/L021803/1","fundValue":"326261","fundStart":"2014-11-17","fundEnd":"2017-11-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Badnell","coPersons":["Martin Gerard  O'Mullane"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
