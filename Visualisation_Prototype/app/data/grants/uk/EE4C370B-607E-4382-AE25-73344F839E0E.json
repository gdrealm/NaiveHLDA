As a result, we filled a gap in the provision of authentic audio recordings for use in the classroom by producing online research-based materials on spoken London English with accompanying teacher notes setting out appropriate descriptive linguistic frameworks for their analysis and description. We also produced an online Linguistics Research Digest containing regular summaries of recent research papers on spoken language, to help teachers maintain an up-to-date knowledge of relevant research. The spoken English materials are used in GCE and GCSE English Language classrooms to illustrate fundamental characteristics of spoken English. They could also be used by teachers of English Language and Linguistics at HE institutions throughout the world (in fact they already are used in this way). The Linguistics Research Digest could be read by interested members of the general public (and we have evidence that it is already used in this way).\n\n\n\nThe Linguistics Research Digest is discussed by teachers and pupils and can serve (and has already served) as the basis for pupils' own Language Investigations (required by the GCE A level examination boards). We provide sample Language Investigations linked to Digest summaries. \n\n\n\nThe Linguistics Research Digest is used by journalists and other professionals whose work focuses particularly on language as well as by members of the public. It increases understanding of the nature of language diversity and of systematic ways of analysing language variation and language change Please see below for use in the classroom. Some of the materials have been reproduced in text books for students of GCSE English Language. The materials are used in workshops for teachers of English Language, to illustrate and prompt discussion of spoken English. They are also used in English Language teaching in Higher Education settings around the world. Education,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
