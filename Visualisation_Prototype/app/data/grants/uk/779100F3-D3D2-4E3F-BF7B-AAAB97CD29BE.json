{"id":"779100F3-D3D2-4E3F-BF7B-AAAB97CD29BE","title":"Access to Multi-functional nano-scale analysis system","abstractText":"Working closely with the manufacturers, MMU has developed a unique multi-function analysis facility, based around a state-of-the-art Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscope (FEG-SEM) with nano-scale resolution. This facility provides unparalleled analytical capabilities, with a range of sophisticated complementary techniques that can be applied to a selected sub-micron area of a sample. It is possible, for example, to obtain a magnified view of surface features with resolution of the order of 5-10 nm, to determine chemical composition using Wavelength Dispersive X-ray (WDX) analysis, to study the microstructure by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), electronic properties by Cathodo-luminescence and phase and stress in materials by the in-situ micro-Raman facility. Samples can be held at liquid nitrogen temperatures, allowing biological samples to be studied, or up to 400oC to follow the effects of temperature on the materials studied. A variable pressure facility also allows analysis of insulating materials without the need for gold coating. Many of these techniques are well-established in their own right, but when combined together open up new and exciting possibilities to the researcher. The aim of this proposal, therefore, is to provide access to this facility to members of the academic community seeking to perform high quality nano-scale materials research in a broad range of fields. Access to the instrument will be free of charge at the point of use and users will be given appropriate support and assistance by in-house experts. All levels of user experience can be catered for and we can even offer remote access through internet links. We anticipate a strong demand for this service. Indeed, our own survey of academic colleagues at other UK institutions has generated interest from researchers wishing to enhance their studies in fields including the analysis of particulates, polymeric materials, thin films, carbon nanotubes, solar cell materials, MEMS, semiconductors, minerals, microbiological samples, archaeological samples and forensic work. In order to ensure the successful provision of this service we will put in place the necessary procedures and staff, building on our existing management structures.In order to enable the best academic materials research in the UK to benefit from access to our state-of-the-art facility, an integrated marketing communications strategy will be designed and implemented. This will include the organisation of regular User Group meetings, the provision of training tutorials and user friendly web-based application processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F056117/1","grantId":"EP/F056117/1","fundValue":"219978","fundStart":"2008-12-17","fundEnd":"2012-12-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have provided access for UK academics to our analytical microscope at MMU.
