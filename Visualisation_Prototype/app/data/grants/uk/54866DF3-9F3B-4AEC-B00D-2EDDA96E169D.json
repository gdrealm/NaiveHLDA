The overall theme is whether Britain can embrace cultural difference in its political and legal structures, and so become a genuinely plural community. Five workshops will be held throughout Britain, addressing different but related themes: (1) Immigration and Citizenship; (2) Cultural Identity and Freedom of Expression; (3) Gender Equality and Cultural Justice; (4) Toleration and Multiculturalism; (5) Division, Democracy and the Public Sphere. The workshops will be aimed at academics, officials, lobbyists, and members of cultural minority groups and the speakers will reflect that aim.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119571/1","grantId":"119571/1","fundValue":"9652","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Gideon  Calder","coPersons":["Jonathan  Seglow","Philip  Cole"],"organisation":"University of Wales, Newport","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
