In order for depth perception to occur, humans must move their two frontally placed eyes very precisely in relation to each other such that both eyes look at, or fixate, exactly the same object a particular distance away. Recently computer scientists have developed stereoscopic display screens on which it is possible to present images that have the attribute of depth. We propose to conduct a series of experiments in which we will very precisely measure the movements of both eyes in order to investigate how the eyes are controlled when real scenes and 3D stereoscopic displays are viewed. This work will allow us to better understand how the human visual system perceives depth, and how computer scientists might develop new algorithms to better represent depth in 3D displays.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601757","grantId":"G0601757","fundValue":"89088","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Paul Liversedge","coPersons":["Nicolas S  Holliman"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
