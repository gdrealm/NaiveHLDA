However, at any one time only a proportion of genes are required to be active. An important step in regulating when genes are active is how accessible they are. In this proposal we will investigate the early steps in the packaging of DNA. This is fundamental to understanding how genes are regulated in humans and what goes wrong in a broad range of human diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100021","grantId":"G1100021","fundValue":"440044","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tom  Owen-Hughes","coPersons":["Graham  Smith","David George Norman"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
