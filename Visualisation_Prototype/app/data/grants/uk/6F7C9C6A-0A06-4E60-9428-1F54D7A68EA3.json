Drawing on a wide range of sources and easily searchable by keywords, it will be an ever-expandable information resource which will fulfil a long-felt need for empirical data on what readers read and what they made of their reading in this period. Its uses will cut across disciplinary boundaries and extend far beyond the academic community. This second phase of research and development will concentrate on the period 1800-1945.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119236/1","grantId":"119236/1","fundValue":"292108","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"W.R.
