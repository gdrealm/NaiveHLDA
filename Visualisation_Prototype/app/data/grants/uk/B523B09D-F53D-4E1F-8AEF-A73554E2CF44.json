{"id":"B523B09D-F53D-4E1F-8AEF-A73554E2CF44","title":"From The Sporting Past To Future Wellbeing: Intergenerational Sports Heritage in Glasgow's Southside","abstractText":"'From the Sporting Past to Future Wellbeing' recognises the importance of sport in the community, as well as the connections between the past, present and future. In the shadow of debates about the social and cultural legacy of the London Olympic Games and in light of the prospect of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the project will help a diverse range of people from the community to explore the nature of sport in the community and how it has changed over time. Through a focus on the meaning of sports heritage for different generations in the community, the research will deepen our understanding of how Glasgow's past links to its future.\n\nThe research and community heritage project seeks to engage local sports clubs in inter-generational heritage research with primary school children. The project will explore the history and meaning of sport in communities through intergenerational collaboration between the academic researcher, primary school children and experienced members of Glasgow Southside's sports community. The research will reflect on the process of intergenerational heritage activities to inform future cultural histories of sport, and future wellbeing. It will contribute to the AHRC's theme 'Care for the Future' through a focus on interpreting cultural and social change in Glasgow sport, as well affording opportunities to examine the usefulness of intergenerational communication in community settings.\n\nThe project will investigate the cultural transmission of sporting cultures of the past, and its influence over, or disconnection from, contemporary sporting practices of young people. Specifically, it will explore the connections between sport and its heritage in the community among local sports clubs and school children aged between 8 and 12. It aims to enable sports clubs to connect with the wider community, in order to explore the sporting heritage themes, including places, organisations and people, with the objective of exploring the meaning of local heritage in the community.\n\nThe project intends to open up access to the film holdings of Scottish Screen Archive and other media archives for use in sports heritage projects. School children and sports clubs will be given guidance on the value of film and printed media in heritage projects, and how to interpret media as part of heritage activity. Led by the academic researcher, school children will visit the sites and relics of community sports based in Glasgow. This will encourage children to learn about the history of different clubs and venues and develop a sensory mapping of local sports culture and heritage sites. Drawing on intergenerational encounters and the field research school children will engage in a digital cultural mapping using Google Maps and other social media such as Pinterest on iPads, in order to share knowledge and experience of local sports heritage. The heritage activity will be curated online and process evaluated for its contribution to community learning. The heritage project will have the added value of creating a sense of shared pride in the area's sporting history and identity and help bring together diverse parts of the community - in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and socio-economic difference - to produce sustainable connections, positive social values around sport and provide inspiration for other community heritage groups in this field.\n\nThe researcher will collaborate with other award holders investigating Care for the Future to explore the lessons learned from the research and the share experiences with the theme network through online materials and attendance at AHRC-led workshops to enhance the wider academic impact of the research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K005367/1","grantId":"AH/K005367/1","fundValue":"18452","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Haynes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
