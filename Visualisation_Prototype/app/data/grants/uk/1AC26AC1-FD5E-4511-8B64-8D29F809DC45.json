Our unit has conducted evaluation of several vaccine candidates against H5 and H9 avian influenza in younger adults. Our studies, along with others, have found that it is usually necessary to give at least two doses of vaccine in order to produce effective protection. \nHowever when vaccines against avian influenza have been tested in older people it seems that some individuals react much better than expected and get good responses even after one dose of vaccine. \nWe are planning to look at the immune systems of elderly people before and after being given avian influenza vaccines to see if we can find out why some people respond better. This might allow us to develop better vaccines that protect against different influenza strains","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700846","grantId":"G0700846","fundValue":"564891","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Iain  Stephenson","coPersons":["Jacqueline  Katz","Maria  Zambon","Karl  Nicholson","Giuseppe  Del Giudice"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
