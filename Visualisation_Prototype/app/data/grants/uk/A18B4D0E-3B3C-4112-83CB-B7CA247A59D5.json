The collaboration will result in the development of the world's first open-source Matlab toolbox for acquiring three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound images, and the application of this toolbox to two specific problems: validation of numeric models of ultrasound wave propagation through heterogeneous biological tissue, and visualisation of High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) lesion formation through ultrasonically-induced Lorentz force measurements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K007092/1","grantId":"EP/K007092/1","fundValue":"7016","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings obtained as part of this grant have been used to develop new methods for performing medical ultrasound imaging and to track the positions of medical devices inside the human body.
