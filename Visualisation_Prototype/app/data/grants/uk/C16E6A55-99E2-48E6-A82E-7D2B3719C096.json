This makes it difficult for the grid operator to continuously balance the generation with the demand (a fundamental requirement of power system operation). Energy storage can help but remains expensive on the required scale. Having some control over the demand can be an economic alternative and is known as Demand Side Management (DSM). In many cases, an electrical load, such as air-conditioning, can be operated a little earlier or later without degrading its performance. This is known as Load Shifting and is a very useful aspect of DSM. Loads amenable to DSM can be quite small individually and can be geographically spread throughout the network; a system to employ many such loads for DSM is known as Distributed DSM and is the subject of this project.The team at Loughborough will contribute system modelling and control architecture expertise to a TSB demonstration project, which aims to demonstrate Distributed DSM (D-DSM) as a service to the UK grid operator. This will provide fast response in order to reduce reliance on conventional generation for grid balancing and security and thus permit much greater penetration of renewables and aid in maximising the use of existing assets. The project will deliver a large-scale demonstration of the control of commercial air-conditioning (a/c), with the managed demand aggregating up to the order of megawatts. The project will also deliver a communications, metering and remuneration framework. This framework will be scalable and suitable for extension to other types of distributed demand and to the control of distributed energy resources (e.g. domestic smart appliances and distributed CHP). The value and scope for wide-scale application of the technology across the UK (in terms of financial and carbon savings) will be determined via software modelling and the results of the practical trial.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G002282/1","grantId":"TS/G002282/1","fundValue":"68117","fundStart":"2009-02-23","fundEnd":"2011-02-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The results of this project have served to guide the business policy of the energy utility E.ON in the area of flexible demand.

Flexible demand technology has the potential to allow the electricity supply industry to reduce the need for fossil fuelled generating plants (eg coal and gas) to run in reserve, by introducing new and improved methods for matching electricity supply to consumer demand. The industrial partners on this TSB project are now working on the commercial development of the flexible demand concept, based on the technical demonstration provided by this project.
