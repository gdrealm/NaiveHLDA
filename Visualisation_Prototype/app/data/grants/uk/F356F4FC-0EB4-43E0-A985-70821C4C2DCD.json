{"id":"F356F4FC-0EB4-43E0-A985-70821C4C2DCD","title":"Climate Model Initialization and Improvement using Particle Filters CLIMIP","abstractText":"Policymakers require predictions of regional and local climate for the near-term (the next 1-30 years) in order to plan effective adaptation strategies. Such predictions exist, but are subject to considerable uncertainties, firstly because our global climate models (GCMs) are imperfect, and because of the internal variability of climate, which can mask or enhance the changes due to external forcings, especially on regional scales (e.g. Hawkins and Sutton, 2009). Progress in climate science to improve GCMs and reduce uncertainty, and to use them more effectively to predict some of the internal variability component would therefore be extremely valuable. This project addresses both of these areas by providing a novel new method for initialising the GCMs, comparing that method with the state-of-the-art DePreSys system, and by identifying the processes responsible for model biases, and hence suggesting methods for GCM improvement.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J005878/1","grantId":"NE/J005878/1","fundValue":"401038","fundStart":"2012-06-25","fundEnd":"2016-09-24","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Jan  Van Leeuwen","coPersons":["Edward  Hawkins","Rowan Timothy Sutton"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":" A practicle problem we had to solve is to combine the climate model HadCM3 with our particle filter code to explore fully nonlinear data assimilation in climate models. The standard way of doing this turned out to be impractical, but we found a very efficient new method exploring the parallelisation codes of MPI. The new method is so efficient that it will be the basis of a new publication, now under review, and is expected to revolutionise the way ensemble data-assimilation codes and complex numerical models can be combined.\nAnother paper in which we use EMPIRE to perform nonlinear data assimilation on climate model HadCM3 is under development. These developments might feature in SANGOMA, an EU FP7 project on efficient ensemble data-assimilation frameworks for marine social services. These developments might feature in SANGOMA, an EU FP7 project on efficient ensemble data-assimilation frameworks for marine social services.\nFurthermore, EMPIRE turns out to be so successful that it will form the basis of the NCEO data-assimilation framework and will, as such, form part of a national infrastructure.
