{"id":"D1571E42-AE41-44DE-BCE9-F25F6E7C4BBF","title":"Atomic data for Fe-peak elements","abstractText":"There is an overwhelming need for high quality atomic data for interpreting astronomical spectra. In a new era of high resolution astrophysical spectroscopy, the interpretation of observations is dependent on an ability to understand and model these spectra. While some of the atomic data can be obtained experimentally, they are frequently of insufficient accuracy or limited to a small number of transitions. Computational approaches are the only means by which data of the required quality and quantity can be obtained. In this programme it is our aim to provide high quality, reliable atomic data related to key areas of application. Our work focuses on the provision of atomic data pertaining to the astrophysically important Fe-peak elements, data which is imperative for the interpretation and understanding of observational data from key ongoing, or planned, space or ground based missions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H001778/1","grantId":"ST/H001778/1","fundValue":"347709","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-14","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Anne Ramsbottom","coPersons":["Margaret Penelope  Scott"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
