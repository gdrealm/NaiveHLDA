Our project aims to address this gap by developing new techniques to investigate how mothers' and infants' brains co-operate during language learning. Our hypothesis, based on previous research from our lab and others, is that the electrical patterns of activity in mothers' and infants' brains become synchronised when both are jointly focussed on the same object, and this inter-personal (brain-to-brain, 'b2b') synchronisation boosts infants' learning and memory for new information. This has never been addressed before because nobody has measured the electrical activity in mothers' and infants' brains at the same time. In the past, people have only looked either at mother's brains or at their child's.\n\nOur study will examine joint attention. Joint attention is a state of shared focus between individuals that can be initiated through eye contact, speech (&quot;look!&quot;) or gesture (pointing). Infants learn and retain information more readily when they are jointly attending to new information with their mother. We will then go on to ask: what happens in the brain during episodes of joint attention? In this study, we will simultaneously measure mothers' and infants' naturally occurring electrical brain activity using a technique known as electroencephalography (EEG). \n\nWe predict that:\n1) When mothers and infants are jointly attending, their brains are also highly synchronised; \n2) Stronger brain-to-brain synchronisation helps infants to learn and remember new words better;\n3) Infants' brain synchronisation ability can be strengthened through specialised training;\n\nIn the first study, we will assess the relationship between joint attention, mother-infant b2b synchrony and babies' word learning. 80 pairs of English-speaking mothers and babies will take part in a word learning game while their naturally occurring electrical brain activity is measured. Mothers will be given a few novel objects and asked to play normally with their child, whilst using new names for the objects, such as &quot;look, this is a beelooma&quot;. At the end of the play session, we will test infants to see how well they remember the new names for these objects. Based on previous research, we expect that if the child hears a new name for an object during a period where they were jointly attending to it with their mother, they will learn and remember this name better. We will then look at the patterns of electrical brain activity we recorded to see if mothers' and infants' brains are more strongly synchronised during joint attention periods. We will also look at whether the strength of this synchronisation is related to how well babies learn new names for objects. \n\nOur first study will look at correlations between attention and synchronisation in mothers' and infants' brains. But showing a correlation between two things is not enough to show that one causes the other. In the second study, therefore, we will look at causal mechanisms. We will give a subset of infants special training in the skill of attending. These are specially-designed computer-based training tasks that have been developed by one of our researchers. After training, all infants (including both trained and untrained control groups) will take part with their mothers in the original word learning game again. We expect that the babies who received special attention training will show greater improvements in their brain synchronisation than those who did not. \n\nIf successful, this study would be the first to show that when mums and babies are jointly attending, their brains are also highly synchronised, and this supports babies' language learning. We would also be the first to show that this neural mechanism for learning can be improved through training.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N006461/1","grantId":"ES/N006461/1","fundValue":"195531","fundStart":"2016-01-04","fundEnd":"2017-07-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Victoria  Leong","coPersons":["Samuel Vincent Wass"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
