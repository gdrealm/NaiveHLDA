Within the consortium, there is activity on the development of supramolecularly-organised structures for transistors (molecular- and meso-scale), in-plane diodes single-photon emitters (useful for quantum cryptography), as well as photovoltaic cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). This European consortium comprises groups with the necessary breadth of expertise. The Cambridge activities are directed towards materials processing, electronic properties and semiconductor device fabrication and measurement.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E037526/1","grantId":"EP/E037526/1","fundValue":"264872","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This was a basic research project that produced new understanding of supramolecular semiconductor materials Education,Electronics ","person":"Richard  Friend","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" This Eurocores grant allowed collaboration with leading supramolecular chemistry groups in Europe. The primary outputs from this grant were the studies of a novel polyisocyanide-peptide-conjugated semiconductor structures, developed at the University of Nijmegen, in which the conjugated semiconducting molecules are held in coupled stacks. Studies of exciton transport and efforts to study intra-polymer-stack heterojunctions resulted from this project this project has enabled some long term European collaborations to be developed Electronics,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
