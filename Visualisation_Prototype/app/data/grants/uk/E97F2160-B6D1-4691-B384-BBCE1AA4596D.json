{"id":"E97F2160-B6D1-4691-B384-BBCE1AA4596D","title":"Chemo-enzymatic Production of Specialty Glycans","abstractText":"This project will investigate the enzymatic glycosylation of modified carbohydrate monosaccharides to achieve larger, biologically relevant glycan structures. This will be achieved by extensive screening of glycosyltransferase enzymes (enzymes that catalyse the addition of a new monosaccharide to a growing sugar 'acceptor'), that are able to use modified sugars as the 'acceptor', but also as 'donor'. \nThe biological relevance of the synthesised new type of glycan structures will be validated by investigating their binding profile to a range of proteins that are known to be of relevance in the health sciences, with the immediate aim to develop new diagnostics applications. However, depending on the array results, further applications in other areas in the health sciences are envisaged.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M028879/1","grantId":"BB/M028879/1","fundValue":"364803","fundStart":"2015-10-19","fundEnd":"2020-10-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Ann  Allman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
