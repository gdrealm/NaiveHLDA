It is central to the understanding of how species evolve and adapt. Evolution is the product of two opposing forces. Mutations give rise to genetic variation, but natural selection and genetic drift cause these variants to be more or less abundant. Mutations that cause its carrier individual to contribute more offspring to the next generation are referred to as being beneficial, which are made more and more abundant (on average) by the process of natural selection, until they are present in every individual in the population. The presence of genetic drift, however, renders the reproduction process random and thus may cause beneficial mutations to become extinct as well as spread to the entire population. Which of these two scenarios actually happens to a beneficial mutation is further complicated by the fact that in a large population, there will be many beneficial mutations that compete with each other, reducing the probability that each beneficial mutation will spread. In the 1930's, the eminent evolutionary biologist R. A. Fisher raised the following question: how quickly can populations adapt to a novel environment by incorporating beneficial mutations? This is what I call the rate of adaptation problem and has fascinated many biologists, and more recently physicists. Up to now, researchers can only calculate the rate of adaptation approximately for large populations. In the project, we hope to use a technique from probability theory, known as Girsanov transformation, to calculate exactly the rate of adaptation for any population size. Girsanov transformation is a powerful technique that has found wide applications in probability theory, but has so far not been applied to the rate of adaptation problem. We discovered that we could transform a selected model to a non-selected one, which is considerably easier to analyse. Quantities in the selected model have a delicate and complex relationship with quantities in the non-selected model, and we hope to reveal how they relate to each other in more detail in this project. We hope this project will be a vivid illustration of the power of Girsanov transformation in the study of selection.An equally fascinating question is the evolution of sex and recombination. Considering the reduction is the overall number of offspring, known as the two-fold cost of sex, sexual reproduction must confer some benefit, being so prevalent among living organisms. As early as 1889, A. Weissman already understood that the purpose of sex was to generate genetic variation, upon which natural selection act. Thus a sexually reproducing population may adapt faster than an asexually one. This understanding, however, has not been quantified exactly up to now. The methods we have developed for the asexual model, i.e. Girsanov transformation, can also be applied to study the advantage of sex. We should be able to develop exact formulae for the rate of adaptation for any recombination rate, and thus help to quantify the effects of recombination on the rate of adaptation. On top of being interesting to evolutionary biologists, the rate of adaptation problem has practical applications in the study of evolution of viruses and bacteria. For example, the HIV virus eventually evolves drug resistance in individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy. Being able to predict the rate of adaptation of the HIV virus in this context can help to calibrate drug dosage and combination to maximise their effectiveness, and thus prolong and enhance the quality of life of the patient.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I028498/1","grantId":"EP/I028498/1","fundValue":"99873","fundStart":"2011-11-22","fundEnd":"2013-10-21","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Feng  Yu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
