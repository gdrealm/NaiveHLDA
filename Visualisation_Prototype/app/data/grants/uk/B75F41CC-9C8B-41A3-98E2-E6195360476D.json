It is a trait which is strongly encouraged in children and young people but increasingly is being squeezed out in adulthood amidst the pressures and technologies of contemporary western society. It is often viewed as 'juvenile' and 'unproductive' use of time. Yet playfulness is celebrated in different forms within some arenas - particuarly the creative arts and sport - where the act of play is viewed as offering positive health and well-being benefits, actively encouraged as part of community cohesion agendas and providing spaces for creativity and entrepreneurial thinking. \n\nBy engaging actively with these the arenas of creative arts &amp; culture and sport, and drawing on the experiences and practices which encourage and celebrate playfulness, the proposed research will seek, firstly to characterise attributes of playfulness and, secondly to identify new research questions concerning ways in which it might be fostered in adults in order to promote flourishing, resilience, creativity and therefore enhance wellbeing for both individuals and communities. It will thus also explore how playfulness can help to reconnect people and communities, assisting to overcome conflict and dissonance but reducing isolation, stress, and alienation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011789/1","grantId":"AH/J011789/1","fundValue":"30290","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Rogerson","coPersons":["Josie  Billington","Hayden  Lorimer","Cathy  Treadaway"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
