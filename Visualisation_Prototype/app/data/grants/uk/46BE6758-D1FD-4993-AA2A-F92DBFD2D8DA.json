{"id":"46BE6758-D1FD-4993-AA2A-F92DBFD2D8DA","title":"Ultrafast Laser Plasma Implantation- Seamless Integration of Functional Materials for Advanced Photonics","abstractText":"SeaMatics is an &quot;advanced materials manufacturing project for photonic integrated circuits&quot; for a range of emerging applications in optical communication, sensors, imaging technology for healthcare, and lighting. Unlike the integration in electronic circuits in which electrons flow seamlessly, in photonic integrated circuits at the light does not flow seamlessly due to mismatch of refractive index and materials dissimilarity. In order to facilitate a way forward for fabricating light circuits, the SeaMatics team has embarked on research which will exploit a novel &quot;ultrafast laser plasma implantation (ULPI)&quot; based technique for fabricating complex structures, using following materials: rare-earth ion doped glass, polymers and silicon and GaAs semiconductors. Such a combinatorial approach for materials fabrication will yield photonic circuit for engineering range energy-efficient devices for cross-sectorial applications (health, manufacturing, energy, digital). \nThe project is led by the University of Leeds and is supported by has four academic partners by the Universities of Cambridge, Sheffield and York in the respective areas of research on polymeric devices, III-V semiconductors, and silicon photonics. The EPSRC National Centre for III-V Technologies will be accessed for materials and device fabrication. \nEleven industry partners directly involved in the project are: DSTL, GTS/British Glass, Glucosense/NetScientific, Product Evolution, PVD Products, CST, IQE, Dow Corning, Xyratex, Gooch and Housego and Semtech. The industry links covers from materials manufacturing to optical components and their applications in optical/data communication, sensors for healthcare, energy for lighting. In this partnership the manufacturing is linked with different levels of supply chain, which we aim to demonstrate by researching on exemplar devices as end points.\n\nThe main goals of the project are \n\na) Set up a ULPI manufacturing capability at Leeds which will serve the needs of academic and industrial communities in UK to start with and then expand for international collaboration.\n\nb) Our first application led manufacturing example will demonstrate ULPI based RE-earth doped glass photonic circuits with light splitting, lasing and amplification functions on a chip.\n\nc) In another example we will demonstrate electrically pumped semiconductor lasers (VCSEL and VECSEL) and integrated with rare-earth ion doped glass for broadband and tunable lasers.\n\nd) Approaches developed in b) and c) will be then expanded for manufacturing larger scale photonic integrated circuits on silicon, embodying multiple functions using the techniques developed in a).\n\ne) ULPI as technique will be applied for engineering novel range of polymer-glass sensor devices which will be used for health care.\n\nf) The final goal of project is to provide training, dissemination, and outreach opportunities for new researchers in SeaMatics. Dissemination related activities will be via the standard peer-review publications in prestigious journals, conferences and workshops. Dedicated symposia are planned for dissemination, and also the outreach activities involving UG/PG interns, PhD students and Sixth form pupils.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M015165/1","grantId":"EP/M015165/1","fundValue":"2484940","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2020-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gin  Jose","coPersons":["Richard  Penty","Ian Hugh  White","Richard Andrew Hogg","David Paul Steenson","Animesh  Jha","Kenneth Leslie Kennedy","Thomas  Krauss"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
