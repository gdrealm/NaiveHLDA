Locating fascism within the politics, culture, and society of Western modernity","abstractText":"The project is to complete the monograph on the promontories of Time: Time Fascism's Tumultuous Relationship with Modernism which explores the relationship between fascism (conceived as an international twentieth-century phenomenon) and the various initiatives to regenerate society identified with artistic and political 'modernism'. It is also conceived as the first volume of multi-author series fascism and the modern world. In 1988 Professor Tim Mason called for Nazism to be located 'within something much larger'. My monograph and its sequels will not only place Nazism within fascism, but fascism itself within several 'larger' processes shaping modern social, cultural, and political realities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112666/1","grantId":"112666/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-25","fundEnd":"2006-06-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger  Griffin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
