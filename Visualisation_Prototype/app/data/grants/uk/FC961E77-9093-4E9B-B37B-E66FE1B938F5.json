Over a hundred and fifty years after slavery ended, residents use its idiom in varied contexts (from domestic to work and more largely economics) yet systematically negate its earlier existence, relocating it in its rival former colonial town. While drawing on existing bodies of work on historical memory and social amnesia, the research combines an historical and ethnographic documentation of the slave trade, the practice of slavery, and their contemporary legacies and representations among the residents of Santa Marta.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the research contributes, in the Latin American and Colombian contexts, to the emerging scholarship on slavery within international human rights, reparation and compensation issues. It also situates itself within ongoing discussions of citizenship, especially attempts at building more inclusive 'multicultural' forms thereof. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, (audio)visual and material displays will be prepared jointly with local historians and curators for a museum exhibition on the slave past of the town, retracing the joint history of slaveholders and of people of African descent.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H035079/1","grantId":"ES/H035079/1","fundValue":"157260","fundStart":"2010-05-03","fundEnd":"2011-11-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Veronique Suzanne Benei","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
