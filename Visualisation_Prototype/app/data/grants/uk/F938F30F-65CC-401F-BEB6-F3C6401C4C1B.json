In some cases, emotional areas of the brain overrespond to negative material, and associated regulatory areas are less effective in controlling this responding. This pattern of brain activity may lead to stronger emotional reactions than normal, as well as difficulties in subsequently damping down emotional reactions. \n\nAs yet, little is known about the origins of such individual differences in responding to negative emotional cues. Genes appear to be one source of influence, but there is also evidence to suggest that environmental experiences may be important, particularly those that occur early in an individualâ€™s life. \n\nWe will study the origins of emotion-relevant brain activity by conducting brain scans in a large group of young adults whom we have been studying since birth. We will use detailed information relating to the early family and interpersonal experiences of these individuals to examine the factors that contribute to key aspects of brain activity. This, in turn, may tell us more about the origins of psychological difficulties that involve disturbances in emotional responding, such as depressive disorder.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701514","grantId":"G0701514","fundValue":"377509","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Louise Halligan","coPersons":["Peter J Cooper","Alan  Stein","Lynne  Murray","Iain Thomas  Johnstone","Richard Michael Fearon"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
