{"id":"FCA0CF9B-12E8-403D-A4B3-DD61BE144704","title":"Teaching Buyout to coordinate the ATLAS online operations activities","abstractText":"The ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider is nowadays well known to the general\npublic thanks to the recent discoveries and the attribution of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics which\nwas made possible by the discoveries of our experiment. It is expected that ATLAS will keep\nexploring the realm of particle physics, and will deliver new insight in the oncoming years.\nThis will be possible only if the experiment is able to take data and perform up to expectations.\nDr. Cerri has been elected by the ATLAS collaboration as coordinator of the data collection\nactivities of the experiment. This is a major responsibility which has a critical high profile \nimpact on the quality and amount of data collected, and therefore on the physics potential \nof the experiment. The charge of ATLAS run coordinator is hierarchically directly below the \nATLAS Management, and automatically implies the membership to the ATLAS Collaboration \nBoard (the policy and decision making body of the experiment) and the ATLAS Executive Board \n(directing the execution of the ATLAS project). These responsibilities represent not only a \nmajor recognition of Dr. Cerri's coordination and operational skills, but also a major opportunity for \nthe UK particle physics community to be represented on the international HEP scenario.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M002039/1","grantId":"ST/M002039/1","fundValue":"32499","fundStart":"2014-09-14","fundEnd":"2015-09-13","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Alessandro  Cerri","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
