{"id":"5FF7C40A-D052-48DA-BEFC-94CE58E61486","title":"Development of Water-based DSSCs for Printable Flexible Photovoltaic Power Sources","abstractText":"The principal objective of the proposed project is to develop and produce a water-based Dye-Sensitised Solar Cell (DSSC). Also known as Grtzel cells, DSSCs show great potential, being less expensive to manufacture than current solid-state cells and, significantly, they are printable flexible photovoltaic (PV) power sources. They promise substantial breakthroughs in solar energy development and consumer products. Specifically, the project will develop novel water-based DSSCs that will open up new applications, based on the ability to print on flexible plastic substrates and avoid the need for encapsulation. Instead of trying to eliminate water from the system and avoid water ingress, the idea is to create devices that are compatible with water. The development of a water-stable DSSC will overcome limitations in current options, leading to breakthroughs in applications where light weight, flexibility and portability are required (e.g. e-readers, e-fashion, medicine, etc). Elimination or minimization of battery weight will open new market opportunities, particularly as many mobile plastic electronic applications can be expected to experience outdoor or humid indoor conditions.G24i, the first manufacturer of DSSCs using advanced roll-to-roll processing technology, will partner with Imperial College, home to one of the largest programmes in inorganic/organic electronic devices research in the UK. The partners complement one another, combining basic research capabilities with commercialisation and exploitation capabilities, manufacturing capacity and market access.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/I001832/1","grantId":"TS/I001832/1","fundValue":"273488","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian Coolidge O'Regan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
