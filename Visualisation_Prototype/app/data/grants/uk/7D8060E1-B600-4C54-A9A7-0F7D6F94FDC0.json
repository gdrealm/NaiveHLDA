This limiting factor provides a powerful obstacle to the efficient development of new medicines.\nThe research conducted in this project was aimed at developing reactions that had been known for a long time, but were rarely used by medicinal chemists in the pharmaceutical industry. This reaction employs a transition-metal catalyst to\npromote the reaction between several reaction partners to generate cyclic molecules that feature prominently in drugs and drug-like molecules. Initial research was targeted at the development of iron-catalysed synthesis of cyclic six-membered compounds containing three nitrogen atoms in the ring called triazines, a reaction that had only been reported once before in the scientific literature. Detailed investigation of this reaction revealed that in our hands, the process actually produced bicyclic 4-aminopyrimidines, which are important compounds in drug discovery. These compounds contain two rings, one of which is a six-membered ring containing two nitrogen atoms in the ring and one nitrogen atom attached to the ring. Further investigation revealed that the reaction did not require a transition-metal catalyst, but only required a simple basic metal salt. Using these simplified conditions, a range of diverse 4-aminopyrimidines were produced in generally high efficiencies, and in a much more expedient fashion compared to previously reported methods.\nA second line of research in this project targeted the reaction of compounds called dienamides with various triple-bond containing compounds to produce aromatic compounds (cyclic compounds that are widespread in useful molecules). This\nmethod exploited a new reaction for dienamide synthesis previously developed in our laboratory. This work resulted in\nencouraging preliminary results that allow a flexible, convergent, and modular synthesis of aromatic compounds containing several groups around the ring. Further research is required to improve this reaction to the point of true practicality and to develop more effective reaction conditions and catalysts. This will be the subject of future work. This method could potentially be used to prepare biologically active compounds for use in the pharmaceutical or agrochemical industries.
