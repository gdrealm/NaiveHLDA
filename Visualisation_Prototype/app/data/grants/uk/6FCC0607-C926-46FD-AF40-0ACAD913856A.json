The emerging field of neuromotor prosthetics aims to restore function to paralysed patients by using signals derived directly from the brain to control computers, wheelchairs and other external devices. During normal movement, the discharge of motor cortex neurons is modulated to provide the appropriate drive to muscles. A Brain-Controlled Interface decodes the activity of these neurons to determine control signals that move assistive devices. However, performance of these interfaces must be improved before this approach can yield useful clinical applications. In particular, variability in the activity of individual neurons causes control errors that are only corrected slowly through visual feedback. In recent years, a sophisticated body of theoretical work has described strategies that the brain uses to minimise the consequences of this variability and thus optimise the accuracy of natural movements. This has led to a new understanding of the importance of ?feedback loops? that relay output signals back into the brain?s motor control system. This project aims to apply these principles to design improved interfaces that exploit similar mechanisms for minimising the influence of variability on relevant output signals.\n\nA combined experimental approach will use non-invasive techniques to study operation of neuromotor interfaces by normal human subjects, and related tasks performed by macaque monkeys. The monkey experiments will use electrodes that are implanted in motor areas of the brain to control a computer cursor. Implant surgeries will be performed in sterile conditions under general anaesthesia as is routinely used for human surgery and monkeys will be given post-operative analgesics. Electrodes implanted in the brain do not cause pain, as evidenced by the thousands of human patients who have benefited from Deep Brain Stimulation electrodes for Parkinson?s Disease. The use of permanently implanted electrodes minimises the amount of restraint that is required for each animal to participate in these tests. Some sections of the experiment will be performed during natural movements in the animal?s home environment using a miniature wearable electronic device.\n\nExperimental results will be applied to the development of new methods to decode brain activity, which will then be compared against existing approaches. If successful, improved Brain-Controlled Interface techniques, in combination with new electrode technologies being developed in related projects, could restore function to a large population of patients with spinal cord injuries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802195","grantId":"G0802195","fundValue":"457224","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Jackson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
