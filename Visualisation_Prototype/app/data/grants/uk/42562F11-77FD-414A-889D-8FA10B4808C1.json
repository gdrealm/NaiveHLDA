{"id":"42562F11-77FD-414A-889D-8FA10B4808C1","title":"Quadruplex recognition and discrimination by dynamic combinatorial chemistry","abstractText":"DNA is presumed to exist largely as the Watson-Crick double helix in living cells. There is growing evidence to suggest that the folded structure of DNA is dynamic and that various alternative structural forms can exist. There is a four stranded form of DNA / a quadruplex helix called a G-quadruplex / that is known to form in certain G-rich sequences of DNA known to exist is many different places in our chromosomes. There is evidence to support that the formation of the quadruple helix can switch 'off' certain genes. This proposal aims to explore the possibility of generating small molecule ligands that can specifically recognise such quadruplexes by targeting loop structures that appear to be unique for each quadruplex. This might in the longer term lead to a new class of therapeutic agents that function by selectively targeting DNA secondary structures rather than proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E013481/1","grantId":"BB/E013481/1","fundValue":"331540","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This approach improved and accelerated the lead-structure finding process in the early hit discovery phase. The approach is currently being expanded upon in other aspects of the group's research, enabling the development of ligands that are selective for particular G-quadruplexes. As the importance of these G-quadruplexes is uncovered, this could lead to the development of targeted therapeutics.  ","person":"Shankar  Balasubramanian","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" We invented a method that allows us to probe specific regions and microenvironments on a target surface using small molecules. For the first time nucleic acid structures have been used as targets in order to select specific binders and probe defined binding sites.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this research introduced a streamlined analytical process that has advantages over the conventional DCC approach that requires a more complex analysis of all homo- and hetero-disulphide dimers present in equilibrium mixtures. Furthermore, in contrast to templated dynamical combinatorial chemistry, our new approach does not require large amounts of the target. We are now well positioned to use this approach as a fast screening protocol for large libraries against different nucleic acids and nucleic acid- protein complexes. Our findings also provide a strong basis for the future design of new generation G-quadruplex specific ligands. The fragment-based approach has been introduced for the first time in this field and showed high potential for the discovery of small molecules for G-Quadruplex DNA targets. Further development will lead to selective tools to probe G-quadruplex function and potentially to small molecule therapeutics. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
