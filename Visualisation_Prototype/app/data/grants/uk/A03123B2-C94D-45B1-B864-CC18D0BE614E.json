The blastoderm consists of cells that make the fish body, while the yolk is a structure that is important for storage of nutrients and signalling molecules. Between these two compartments, there is a thin layer of tissue called the Yolk Syncytial Layer (YSL). The YSL is a single cell layer that has many nuclei (the status of a single cell with multiple nuclei is called a syncytium). The precursors of YSL cells are normal cells that have a single nucleus. However, at 500-1000 cell stage, when the YSL is forming, these cell membranes collapse, cells fuse and become single cells with multiple nuclei. The YSL separates the blastoderm and yolk, and the role of the YSL is to transfer and metabolise nutrients as well as to send signals for the patterning of the embryo. As the signalling centre for patterning, the YSL sends signals to neighbouring blastoderm cells and guides these cells to become mesendoderm (precursor of muscle, kidney, gonad, blood, digestive system and others) and also to obtain regional character (e.g. the YSL guides cells to become head, trunk or tail). Although the YSL does not exist in mammals, equivalent cells with similar activities do, therefore the study of the YSL would be of general interest to all vertebrate researchers including physicians studying human development. Despite the importance of the YSL in embryonic development, the molecular mechanisms under which the YSL is formed have not yet been investigated. From our previous genetic screening, we isolated a gene (we named it yugo-b) that is specifically expressed in the YSL. When we knocked down the gene function of yugo-b and related gene, yugo-a, we found that YSL formation is specifically disrupted. Therefore this would be the first gene that has been identified as a crucial regulator of YSL formation. By using this gene as an experimental tool, we aim to investigate the molecular mechanisms of syncytium formation by cell fusion occurring in the YSL. Since the zebrafish embryo is transparent, and YSL formation occurs at specific times in a synchronised manner, the YSL is an ideal system to study cell fusion events occurring in embryonic development. By utilising many tools available in the zebrafish system (genetics, genome information, gene-knockdown using morphlino antisense oligonucleotides, labelling cell structures with fluorescent proteins, whole mount in situ hybridisation, etc.) we aim to obtain a range of results providing insight into the processes of formation of the YSL and the different components, structures, mechanisms and molecules involved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F010222/1","grantId":"BB/F010222/1","fundValue":"356024","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We have established a novel signal transduction pathway including small G protein, Tyrosine kinase and cytoskeleton that regulate cell fusion event in embryos.

Cell fusion is a very important event in embryo development. This occurs in the yolk cells, muscle cells, blood and bone cells in fish and also occur in human placental cells. By cell fusion, each cell can transport materials more freely in wider area. But the mechanisms of cell fusion is not fully understood. We have identifed a novel signalling pathway that regulate cell fusion. This is a very important discovery and therefore reported in a high impact journal. The signalling pathway that we discovered is very important for cell fusion in the zebrafish embryo. It is highly likely such pathway is equally important in human embryo development and placental function. Genetic defects and abnormality in this pathway would cause birth defects and other diseases. Therefore identification of a key pathway is fundamental for learning disease mechanisms and for designing therapies. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
