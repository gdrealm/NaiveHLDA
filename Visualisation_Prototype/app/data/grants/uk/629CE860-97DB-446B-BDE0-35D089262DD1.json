{"id":"629CE860-97DB-446B-BDE0-35D089262DD1","title":"Platform Grant Renewal - Materials for Lithium Batteries","abstractText":"Rechargeable lithium batteries have transformed potable electronics (2 billion cells p.a. in 2009). They are a technology of choice for the electrification of transport and will contribute to balancing the intermittency of electricity supply from renewable sources with consumer demand (load levelling). In short, their high energy density will make them a vital technology in the 21st century, important in tackling climate change. However to achieve the step-change in lithium battery performance necessary to meet the formidable challenges of new markets, such as transport and load levelling, as well as future portable devices, it is essential to investigate radical new ideas and new approaches for the anodes, electrolytes and cathodes and to sustain their study for many years, in order to realise their potential. Achieving this goal demands a long-term strategic approach that embraces high risk research and sustained effort. Here we propose to investigate new ideas and approaches, to continue the investigation of topics introduced under our previous Platform Grant, e.g. the Li-air battery, nanostructured electrodes and crystalline polymer electrolytes, to engage with the best groups nationally and internationally, to engage with private and public sector stakeholders and further the careers of the best research personnel in the group.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I029273/2","grantId":"EP/I029273/2","fundValue":"605430","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"P  Bruce","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
