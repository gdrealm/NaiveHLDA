{"id":"46F95D59-DDCF-4152-A72B-AA7800D971FE","title":"The Historical Geographical Information Systems Research Network","abstractText":"<p>Historical GIS (HGIS) is concerned with how Geographical Information Systems (GIS) can help us to understand the geographies of the past. With its ability to locate data in space and time GIS has the potential to cause a step-change in historical research. It is, however, a highly inter-disciplinary topic and as a consequence does not have a clear organisational focus in Europe (the Social Science History Association can be argued to provide this in the US, see <a href=\"http://www.ssha.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ssha.org</a>). We clearly need a European focus for historical GIS research and this seminar series will provide it. </p> \n<p>The aims of the seminar series are:</p> \n<ol> \n <li> To provide a focus for historical GIS research in Europe.</li> \n <li> To advance our understanding of historical GIS at the technical, methodological and applied levels.</li> \n <li> To encourage the adoption of GIS amongst a broad audience with an interest in the past.</li> \n <li> To investigate setting up and international association to act as a focus for historical GIS research. </li>\n</ol> \n<p>To do this we will be organising one expert meeting, two one-day training courses, and a full conference.
