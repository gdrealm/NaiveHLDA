{"id":"C3AD1900-AC11-4776-ABDA-CE6D5305A893","title":"The Naked Scientists: The Next Generation","abstractText":"The Naked Scientists: The Next Generation seeks to nurture the next generation of ambassadors and advocates for STFC science. We propose to establish a programme of paid internships that will recruit PhD students from STFC-supported institutions and facilities nationally and embed candidates within the Naked Scientists team. Participants will receive hands-on training within a real-world media environment, which will include learning to write and broadcast about science for general audiences. Participants will contribute to the Naked Scientists flagship science radio programmes, which are aired by the BBC and other broadcasters internationally, as well as learning to produce and present their own podcasts and programmes. Whilst with us, their skills and knowledge will also be used to produce dedicated programme episodes of the Naked Scientists, which will focus on the intern's own scientific subject area. These programmes will be distributed to million-scale audiences internationally. Our aim is to empower our trainees to become beacons for good engagement practice, meaning that upon their return to their own local laboratory environment, they may initiate and support their own local outreach programmes, including assisting their peers and seniors to do likewise. By keeping in touch with these individuals after they have completed their training, we also aim to establish a strong network of communicators nationally, and from across the full spectrum of STFC's research portfolio, in order to strengthen and inform future Naked Scientists programme-making ventures.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M000699/1","grantId":"ST/M000699/1","fundValue":"51600","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Smith","coPersons":["Christopher  Lester"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
