Most young people have high aspirations - just not for science\n\nThe ASPIRES research found that, on the whole, most young people aged 10-14 hold relatively high aspirations for professional, managerial and technical careers. We did not find evidence of a 'poverty of aspirations' among students or parents - almost all students reported that their parents value education and want them to do well. Yet very few young people (approximately 15 per cent) aspire to become a scientist. This aspiration We anticipate achieving impact in the following ways:\n\n1. To change the approaches and practices of STEM enrichment organisations. We hope that our findings will be used by STEM educational and delivery organisations to influence the nature of their offer - for instance, to focus on primary-aged students rather than just secondary; to promote messages around the transferability of science and careers from science (rather than just promoting messages about STEM careers per se); to build science c Education","dataset":"gtr"}
