But could there be such a thing as travel in time? Could we visit other times, in the distant past or future? If we could visit other times, could we return to the time we left? Surprisingly, many philosophers and scientists have been prepared to answer 'Yes' to such questions. But can we make sense of the idea of time-travel? What would it mean to say that somebody was a time-traveller? What should we think of the infamous 'grandfather' paradoxes that time-travel seems to promise? If time-travel were a possibility, what might this mean for our ideas about our selves and our actions? What happens to natural laws in time-travel worlds? This book introduces the current philosophical time-travel debate, defending the consistency of some time-travel scenarios and arguing that the philosophy of time-travel can reveal a great deal about the nature of time, the laws of physics, freedom and the human condition.\\n\\nTime-travel in Philosophy\\n The philosophical literature on time-travel has grown over several decades. Time-travel is increasingly seen as offering interesting and applicable philosophical problems as well as mere conceptual recreations or puzzles. Besides hardy perennial time-travel topics like grandfather paradoxes, personal identity and free-will, discussions of technical issues (like the nomological contrivance problem) are now common. A comprehensive philosophical treatment of time-travel would, by now, be a book-length project. So, the time is ripe for a book-length treatment of the topic of time-travel in all its philosophical guises. My proposed book presupposes an absolute minimum of philosophical or physics background but still offers a comprehensive discussion of, and contribution to, the time-travel debate. This book aims to transform the philosophical time-travel debate. Rather than merely defend the consistency of certain time-travel scenarios or survey some philosophical time-travel issues, I hope to show that time-travel problems reveal a great deal about time, physical laws, freedom and identity. As a source of philosophical problems and questions, time-travel is an ideal mental work-out.\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G004080/1","grantId":"AH/G004080/1","fundValue":"22853","fundStart":"2009-01-12","fundEnd":"2009-05-11","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alasdair  Richmond","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" The best-fitting theory of laws of nature for time travel scenarios is some version of the Mill-Ramsey-Lewis (MRL) view, but MRL in turn means that time travel (if non-actual) generates its own peculiar laws of nature\nTime travel spacetime offer unique and otherwise unattainable possibilities for hypercomputation, which evade problems in cosmic censorship faced by temporally standard hypercomputers.\nThe personal/external time distinction essential to time travel radically affects our understanding of the value and extension of personal time, and also sheds light on ancient argument for regarding death as something non-existent.
