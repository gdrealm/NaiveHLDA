{"id":"95E76A8A-BADB-46CA-96F7-D11ED6C6C427","title":"Developmental Clinical Studies - Phase 1 studies on an analogue of peptide YY as a treatment for obesity","abstractText":"When humans eat, the bowels naturally secrete chemicals into the bloodstream which make people feel full and which stop eating. One of these chemicals is known as Peptide YY (PYY). We have previously shown that injections of human PYY reduce appetite and food intake. We have now developed a very similar chemical, Y242, as a treatment for obesity. Y242 has been tested in animals and has been shown to be safe, and to reduce their appetite. This study will test Y242 for its safety and tolerability in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000474","grantId":"G1000474","fundValue":"2747140","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-06","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen R Bloom","coPersons":["Tricia Mei-Mei Tan","Deborah  Ashby","B C Field"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
