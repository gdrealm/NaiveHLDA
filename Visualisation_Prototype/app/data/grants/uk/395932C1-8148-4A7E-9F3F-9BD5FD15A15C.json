This has resulted in positive comments. Although it might be na?ve to expect policy makers to take some of these on board given the contentious and critical nature of the work we have had positive feedback from the policy makers we have interviewed. For example, Jennifer Cole of RUSI (Royal United Services Institute) was interested in the findings in terms of community preparedness. However, most specifically we have had impacts on teenagers and emergency planners in Sussex as a result of the ethnographic and performance work. The young people and the emergency planning professionals who participated in Emergency Exercise 2010, the performance ethnography, were invited to participate in an internet forum after the event to reflect on the project; their responses showed that the young people learnt about the world of preparedness, which they had hitherto known little about, through the performance of the exercise; the young people especially appreciated being allowed into a preparedness site, a nuclear bunker, and this privilege both gave them a feeling of power, but also of responsibility; the professionals involved realised that the contribution that young people may make to preparedness would be useful in the future, this was something they had sought before with little success via questionnaires, but also the professionals discovered the negative preconceptions of emergency professionals, as seen by the young people involved Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Security and Diplomacy ","person":"John Joseph Preston","coPersons":["Namita Elizabeth Chakrabarty","Barry  Avery"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":" 1. Contemporary preparedness makes use of a spectrum of pedagogies\n\nincluding public and dramaturgical.\n\n\n\nContemporary preparedness efforts rely on a mixture of pedagogies. The use of text\n\ninstructions, memory aids, reconstruction activities, and information technologies and\n\nvideo are frequently part of the pedagogical mix that becomes part of a fused pedagogy of affect, behaviour, and cognition. These can be analysed not just in terms of ‘conventional’ pedagogical categories. \n\n\n\nFirstly, they can be examined as public pedagogies, popular cultural forms that are pedagogical through enactment rather than (necessarily) direct teaching.\n\n\n\nSecondly, drama and performance are employed in contemporary sites of preparedness to produce ‘theatres of survival’ which are often racially orientated towards the representation of and prioritising of ‘white’ racial interests. This points towards understanding contemporary preparedness as not only multi-modal and pedagogical but increasingly using new pedagogical techniques (the public and the dramaturgical). This finding has informed future research through an EPSRC and ESRC funded project (John Preston PI) ‘Game Theory and Adaptive Networks for Smart Evacuations’ (October 2010-October 2012) which will examine the ways in which we can understand and improve city evacuations as ‘co-produced’ by the public, usingmulti-modal technologies.\n\n\n\n2. Race, ‘tacit intentionality’ and the ‘absent presence’ of ‘race’ in\n\npreparedness\n\n\n\nIn none of our research did we encounter any participant who was prejudiced or any\n\nevidence of overt racism in policy. However, tacitly assumptions were often made\n\nwhich could disadvantage BME people. Following the work of Gillborn, we would\n\nrefer to these as ‘tacit intentionality’ in that by not taking ‘race’ explicitly into account in preparedness or policy planning some are tacitly advantaged or disadvantaged. Preparedness materials which advantage ‘whites’ also intersect with other social characteristics such as masculinity.\n\n\n\nExamples of good practice included awareness of multiple language materials, taking\n\ninto account access to material resources in preparedness planning.\n\n\n\n3. Who is preparedness for?\n\n\n\nIn our focus group research a common finding was that no one considered that\n\npreparedness was ‘for them’. This lack of connection (and sometimes outright\n\nrejection) of preparedness was due to issues of representation and consultation. The research highlights to central and local government the importance of racial and other types of equity in emergency and preparedness planning. Scientific impacts\n\n\n\nThe project will have impacts in terms of the design of preparedness materials. We have\n\nalerted our networks to our findings via our website. Chakrabarty has developed\n\nconsiderable local authority, national and international contacts in this area of research\n\nthat could lead to future collaborations and we have existing, and expected, future grant\n\nfunding for work in this area as detailed above.\n\n\n\nThis project has made important developments in Critical Race Theory, public pedagogy\n\nand performance theory, bringing these areas together in an inter-disciplinary fashion.\n\nWe and will continue to present our work in high status journals, books and at\n\ninternational conferences. An anticipated future impact will also be a synoptic book as\n\nwe build up a body of work from this project.\n\n\n\nEconomic and Social impacts\n\n\n\nThe project has emphasised the importance of the inclusion of BME groups in\n\npreparedness planning and the importance of this for equity. We will continue to\n\npresent our work at conferences with a practice / academic / social justice focus (as\n\nChakrabarty 2010a, 2010b, 2010c) and to work with groups outside of academia\n\n(‘Emergency Exercise 2010’ as part of the ESRC festival of social science being one\n\nexample).
