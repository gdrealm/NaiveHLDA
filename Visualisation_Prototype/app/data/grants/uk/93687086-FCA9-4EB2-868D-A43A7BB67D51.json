{"id":"93687086-FCA9-4EB2-868D-A43A7BB67D51","title":"EURECA","abstractText":"Recent cosmological models suggest that ~23% of the Universe is dark matter. Underground direct search experiments are continuously improving their sensitivity to dark matter / nucleon interactions, with EURECA being one of the planned tonne-scale experiments exploring the most interesting cross section range down to levels of 10E-10pb. This proposal aims to identify a readout system that can be scaled by a factor of ~100 in a cost-effective way and investigate new ways of single photon detection to improve the discrimination ability of cryogenic phonon - scintillation detectors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G003793/1","grantId":"ST/G003793/1","fundValue":"68669","fundStart":"2009-02-11","fundEnd":"2011-03-10","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Hans  Kraus","coPersons":["Samuel  Henry"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
