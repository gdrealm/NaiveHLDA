{"id":"F1DBF8A3-A251-46BE-BA64-2E1064B90DDA","title":"Confocal microscopy","abstractText":"Researchers at the University of Bristol School of Biological Sciences are using confocal microscopy to obtain high quality images of processes in plants, animals, and yeast. These images provide crucial information that can help us to understand how biological systems work. We request funds for a new confocal microscope to investigate biological questions including: how cells specialise and grow in plant roots, how guard cells on leaves open and close to control the flow of water and gases, how wheat grains form, how pollen and stigmas interact during fertilisation in flowering plants, and how insect ears work. At the moment we use confocal microscopes in other buildings at the University or in other cities or countries to do this work, but it is difficult or impossible to transport delicate experimental material safely and without damage. We request a contribution towards a dedicated microscope for the Department. This bid is supported by funds from within our Department and a substantial discount from the manufacturer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F011709/1","grantId":"BB/F011709/1","fundValue":"241745","fundStart":"2009-01-19","fundEnd":"2010-01-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Suzanne Grierson","coPersons":["Keith  Edwards","Alistair MacCulloch Hetherington","Simon John Hiscock","Daniel  Robert"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
