Efficacy of Saracatinib (AZD0530) in treatment of chronic otitis media in the pre-clinical mouse models Junbo and Jeff","abstractText":"Otitis media is an important medical condition affecting the middle ear. There are a number of distinct forms of the disease and all cause ill health and have considerable health care costs. 80% of children will suffer one or more episodes of earache before the age of three and this condition is one of the most common reasons for taking child to see their GP. In most cases these painful episodes of earache resolve spontaneously. However, about 10% of children go on to have persistent ear problems and one particularly common condition is known as 'glue ear'. Although the symptoms of pain and fever go away, the child may suffer significant hearing loss. Glue ear is the most common form of childhood hearing loss. It occurs as a result of fluid accumulation in the middle ear space behind the eardrum. The fluid occupies a space that is normally air-filled in the healthy ear and this interferes with sound transmission through the three small bones that link the eardrum to the inner ear. Hearing loss manifests itself in delays in the child's language development and can result in learning and behavioral problems. Currently the only effective treatment is surgery to place a grommet in the eardrum. Grommet surgery is the most common surgical procedure performed on children. The NHS performs 30,000 grommet surgeries per year. Grommet surgery is not always effective, but there are currently no alternative beneficial medical treatments.\nIn this work we will use an animal model of chronic otitis media to explore new medical treatments for glue ear. Previously we have has shown that a molecular pathway involved in the response to low oxygen conditions is important in the development of disease and similar process occurs in children. \nOur plan is to use existing drugs that have been developed to target these pathways and look at their ability to moderate hearing loss in our animal model. The particular drug that will be used is Saracatinib that Astra Zeneca developed to treat cancer. Cancer is very different medical condition to glue ear but both diseases share an underlying disease process associated with blood vessel growth and fluid leakiness. In the ear we hypothesize the accumulation of glue and fluid is driven by the leakiness of the blood vessels that line the middle ear space. \nThe use of anti-cancer drugs in children is restricted to serious life-threatening disease because of the potential for significant side effects when given as a tablet. The aim of this project is to investigate the potential of medicating the ear directly so that the drug is delivered to where it is needed to prevent hearing loss. It will be necessary to develop a formulation of drug that will release drug over periods of up to one month. The response to the treatment will be measured in hearing tests and measuring the action of the drug on the blood vessels of the ear. We will also investigate whether drug levels in the blood are sufficiently low after medicating the ear to make them safe for use.\nIf our work is successful it will open up new avenues of research in medical treatment of ear disease. There is a major effort to find new ways of medicating the ear and if this is achieved there will be great interest from pharmaceutical companies to discover new uses for their existing drugs, as well as developing new drugs. This has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of chronic middle ear disease and shift treatment away from surgery to medical treatments such as eardrops that could be prescribed by a GP.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_EX_MR/K014986/1","grantId":"MC_EX_MR/K014986/1","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael T Cheeseman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"MRC Mammalian Genetics Unit","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
