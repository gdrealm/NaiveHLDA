As an organ that covers the body, the skin protects us from a variety of environmental insults, such as mechanical injury, ultraviolet irradiation, and variations in temperature. \n\nThe skin also provides a unique system for studying the mechanisms that control organ development, regeneration and ageing. Skin development results in formation of the epidermis, a stratified self-renewing epithelium. Additional structures of the skin include hair follicles, nails and glands. After birth, the epidermis continuously regenerates using the ability of epithelial stem cells to supply progeny cells that form all epidermal cell layers. Meanwhile, epidermal regeneration, following skin injury, is controlled by stem cells derived from the hair follicle. \n\nData obtained during the last decade has revealed that many cellular signalling pathways controlling skin development and its postnatal regeneration are of particular importance. Recent data demonstrate that activity of these signalling pathways is governed by microRNAs (miRNAs). These are small ribonucleic acid molecules, which negatively regulate gene expression by interaction with their multiple targets in a sequence-specific manner. \n\nThis project will look at how one of those miRNAs, namely miR-214, impacts skin regeneration during normal development and when induced by injury. This project will also explore how miR-214 affects different molecular signals in epithelial stem cells and their progenies (that form skin and hair follicle epithelium), and its involvement in wound healing. \n\nStudying the skin as a model system in this way, will cast light on the mechanisms that control the development and regeneration of other epithelial tissues, such as the epithelia of the intestine, teeth, kidney and lung. The knowledge gained from this study will also provide new opportunities for the development of novel microRNA-based therapies to cure aberrant tissue growth and regenerative conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K011324/1","grantId":"MR/K011324/1","fundValue":"354405","fundStart":"2013-04-15","fundEnd":"2016-04-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Natalia  Botchkareva","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bradford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
