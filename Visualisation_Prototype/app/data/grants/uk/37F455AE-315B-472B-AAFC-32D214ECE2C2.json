In this project we address both these sets of concerns by focusing research effort onto a number of key case study localities in London and by using a range of approaches to address these issues.</p>\n\n<p>In economic terms the life and functioning of rich neighbourhood spaces appears intuitively important. For example, attractive and safe spaces for captains of industry, senior figures in political and non-government organisations are often regarded as major markers of urban vitality and the foundation of broader social networks that may make-up the broader glue of civic and political society. Yet we know very little about how such neighbourhoods operate, who they attract and how they are linked to other cities and their neighbourhoods globally.</p>\n\n<p>We will employ a multi-method research design which will include both the analysis of existing data and detailed case studies of six carefully selected neighbourhoods in and around London.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002503/1","grantId":"ES/K002503/1","fundValue":"466650","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger John  Burrows","coPersons":["Rowland Graham  Atkinson","Mike Antony Savage","Timothy Stephen Close  Butler","Caroline  Knowles"],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
