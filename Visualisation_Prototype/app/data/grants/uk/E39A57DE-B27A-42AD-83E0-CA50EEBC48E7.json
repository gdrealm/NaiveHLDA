{"id":"E39A57DE-B27A-42AD-83E0-CA50EEBC48E7","title":"CoSMoS: Complex Systems Modelling and Simulation","abstractText":"Our proposal builds capacity in generic modelling tools and simulation techniques for complex systems, to support the modelling, analysis and prediction of complex systems, and to help design and validate complex systems. Drawing on our state-of-the-art expertise in many aspects of computer systems engineering, we will develop CoSMoS, a modelling and simulation process and infrastructure specifically designed to allow complex systems to be explored, analysed, and designed within a uniform framework.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E049419/1","grantId":"EP/E049419/1","fundValue":"391850","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"P  Welch","coPersons":["Frederick Robert Barnes"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
