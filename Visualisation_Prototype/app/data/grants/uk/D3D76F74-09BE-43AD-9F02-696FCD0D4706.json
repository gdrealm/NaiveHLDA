The focus of this project will be on one of the most complex, and as yet unsolved, challenges incorporating measurement, control and protection aspects: the design of a new closed-loop coordinated corrective control scheme, which can be applied to eliminating frequency instabilities, cascading outages and catastrophic blackouts in networks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G055211/1","grantId":"EP/G055211/1","fundValue":"415474","fundStart":"2009-11-19","fundEnd":"2012-11-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings were a base for creation of new approaches for power system monitoring, protection and control, using GPS synchronized technology (the so called Synchronized Measurement Technology).
