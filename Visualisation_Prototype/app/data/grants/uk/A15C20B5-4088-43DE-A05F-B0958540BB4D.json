{"id":"A15C20B5-4088-43DE-A05F-B0958540BB4D","title":"Quantum dynamics in Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics","abstractText":"CCPQ is a collaborative computational project which serves the needs of the UK Atomic and Molecular physics community in respect of leading edge software development, especially in its five principal areas of interest: collision physics, antimatter physics, multiphoton physics, cold atom physics and molecular physics. Formerly known as CCP2, this collaboration has existed continuously since 1978, \nbut has been constantly evolving and adapting to address new problems. A spin-off company &quot;Quantemol&quot; was formed in 2004 to market some of its electron-collision software. The software will be applied to generate new data for applications like the simulation of industrial plasmas or to investigate electron-induced damage to biological molecules, including positron annihilation processes in PET scans. Software developments to provide molecular line data for the search for exoplanets will also be undertaken.\nThe proposed flagship project, &quot;Coherent control of many body systems&quot;, represents a completely new initiative. It will combine recent cutting edge developments in the UK with a well-known and well-respected open-source international project. It will develop new software to tackle previously intractable problems, hence enabling UK researchers to investigate accurately, for the first time, the time-evolution of strongly correlated quantum systems in a range of subfields encompassing ultracold atom physics, quantum information and driven condensed matter systems. \nCCPQ will run an active programme of meetings and workshops with a view to stimulating collaboration and training researchers to address new problems in computational atomic and molecular physics, as well as High Performance Computing. As well as new initiatives and flagship software development, the collaboration will maintain an ongoing programme of maintenance, curation and upgrading of its existing software suite. Its activities will also support two projects funded by previous software calls in particular the &quot;UK R-matrix Atomic and Molecular Physics HPC Code Development Project&quot; (UK-RAMP) as well as the &quot;Wavepacket dynamics for the future: A general purpose HPC-compliant program&quot; project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J010561/1","grantId":"EP/J010561/1","fundValue":"167723","fundStart":"2012-01-23","fundEnd":"2015-07-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used to simulate work by by experimental groups developing solid state qubits (particularly donor spins in silicon) and reported in our 4 key publications to date (listed in ``key findings'').

The network also funded a one-week placement of the first flagship PDRA (Dr Sarah Al-Assam) at Quantemol.\n\nIn addition, this grant covers 12 months PDRA support on the UCL component of the CCPQ flagship project. The original project was for development of a Tensor Network Library for the investigation of strongly correlated many-body dynamics; the major component of the project is being carried out at the university of Oxford, is well established and has been considerably augmented by a 5-year software development grant. The outcomes are reported separately, under a different grant code.\n\nThe UCL project, and the 12-month PDRA covered by EP/J010561/1 has focussed on a related algorithm, also for solution of correlated many body dynamics, appropriate for the situation where there is clustering. This algorithm, the Cluster Correlation expansion (CCE) enables one to accurately simulate the decoherence of spin systems interacting with a surrounding bath which is not just a source of random noise, but which has memory effects and is subject to ``back-action''; from the system of interest.\n\nThe motivation for implementing this CCE algorithm was to be able to realistically simulate experiments by the spin-dynamics groups at UCL and Warwick by groups investigating solid-state spin qubits; in addition, there is also interest in using the observed T_2 (coherence) times for sensing applications at the single spin level.\nTo date the CCE code has been used in four studies carried out jointly with experimental groups; in [1] speed-up of the operations for 'hybrid' qubits; [2] the first simulation showing orders of magnitude enhancement of coherence at optimal working points of bismuth qubits [3] simulation of experiments at these optimal working points [4] a study of decoherence of nuclear spin registers using Si29 impurities surrounding a phosphorus donor (although no data is atually reported here in [4] this study is joint with members of the group carrying out related measurements).\n\nThe network funding has enabled bilateral visits to the UK/USA/Hong Kong enabling us to interact with W Witzel of Sandia Labs and RB Liu of Hong Kong, two leading proponents of the original CCE algorithms which are being developed/adapted at UCL.\n\nFor the remainder of the grant, a key objective will be to optimise a version of the software developed by the 12-month PDRA funded by the grant (Dr R Guichard who began work in April 2014) , for use by the experimental community, onto CCPForge.\n\nReferences\n[1] Morley et al, Nature Materials, 12,103( 2013).\n[2] S.
