{"id":"23382C39-DDDF-424F-94BA-397BDB348883","title":"Marine Heat Waves - Global Patterns of Impacts and Risks","abstractText":"The global ocean has warmed significantly in recent decades, causing shifts in species' distributions and alterations to the structure and functioning of marine communities and ecosystems. Superimposed onto this gradual warming trend are discrete extreme climatic events, where seawater temperatures may be considerably higher than normal for periods of weeks to months. As such, some of the highest seawater temperatures on recent record have been observed during contemporary warming events, which can drive step-wise changes in the distribution of biodiversity and the structure of entire ecosystems. In general, discrete extreme climatic events are increasing in frequency and intensity as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change, so that understanding and predicting biological responses to 'events', rather than 'trends', is becoming increasingly important. In the terrestrial realm storms, droughts, floods and heat waves can have catastrophic effects on ecosystems, with significant socio-economic ramifications, but knowledge of how extreme climatic events shape marine ecosystems pales in comparison.\n\nThis project will bring together an international team of scientists to collate evidence on the physical properties of marine heat waves and their biological impacts. The team will analyse existing sea temperate records to examine trends in the frequency and magnitude of short-term extreme warming events and use sophisticated ocean climate modelling approaches to predict the frequency of marine heat waves in the future. The team will then synthesise information on how marine heat waves affect the distribution of life in the sea, and make predictions of the structure of marine ecosystems impacted by future warming events. The project will significantly advance our understanding of how heat waves may affect marine biodiversity patterns and the sustainability of ecological goods and services provided by marine ecosystems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N00678X/1","grantId":"NE/N00678X/1","fundValue":"37667","fundStart":"2016-01-07","fundEnd":"2017-01-06","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel Alexander Smale","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Marine Biological Association","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
