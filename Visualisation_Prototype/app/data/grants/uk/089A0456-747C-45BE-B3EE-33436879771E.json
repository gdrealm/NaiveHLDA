Almost all signals from the senses pass through the thalamus on the way on their way to the cerebral cortex. Thalamus is also crucial for communication between different parts of the cerebral cortex. Thus, when thalamus is damaged, for example by stroke, the consequences for the patient are devastating.\n\nWhen we are awake, we actively control the sensory input to our eyes/hands using our muscles. Perception is thus an active process that integrates motor control with sensory input. Under anaesthesia, this motor control is inactive. Although we know a lot about how thalamus operates in the sleeping/anaesthetised brain, we still do not understand how it functions when we are awake and actively sensing the environment.\n\nHere, we propose to investigate how thalamus operates in the awake, behaving animal. Fortunately, thalamic circuitry is remarkably similar in different mammalian species and across different neural systems, so it is possible to get insight into thalamic function that is applicable to human health by studying rats and mice. The whisker system of rats and mice is particularly well-suited to such research, since there is a modular structure whereby signals relating to a given whisker are primarily processed by discrete regions known, in thalamus, as 'barreloids'.\n\nDue to technological progress, it is now feasible to perform experiments on the whisker system of mice that were not previously possible. In this project, we will use the new methods to study how the whisker-related thalamus operates when mice use their whiskers to solve a discrimination task (identifying the location of an object). We will first investigate how thalamic neurons represent object location and exactly what whisker movements it is that evoke activity in thalamic neurons. Finally, we will study how, during object localisation behaviour, thalamic neurons are modulated by feedback from the cerebral cortex.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L01064X/1","grantId":"MR/L01064X/1","fundValue":"559547","fundStart":"2014-05-26","fundEnd":"2017-05-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rasmus  Petersen","coPersons":["Mark Daniel Humphries"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
