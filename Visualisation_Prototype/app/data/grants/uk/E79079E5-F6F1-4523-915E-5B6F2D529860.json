The incredible economic growth of China and India in the last decade has led many commentators to suggest that the 21st Century will be an ‘Asian century’. This shift in relative power to the East is predicted to have a profound effect on the ethical norms of international society. Understanding Chinese and Indian attitudes to that society, and the norms they promote, is therefore of fundamental importance to theorising what forms of order and ideals of justice will prevail in the coming decades.</p>\n\n<p>This theme will be addressed over three one-day workshops.The first explores the historical record on managing the aspirations of rising powers and seeks to identify Chinese and Indian attitudes to international society. The second examines their views on normative challenges to that society, including the legacy of the American exception, deepening international criminal law, and the expansion of global civil society. The third looks at how the international community could respond to these challenges by reforming global institutions and adapting civil society to encompass non-Western values. It welcomes contributions from across the methodological spectrum.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021261/1","grantId":"ES/J021261/1","fundValue":"17032","fundStart":"2012-10-15","fundEnd":"2014-09-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Papers distributed via the website and disseminated to government officials and NGO workers.
