It is clear that the mechanical energy of sub-photospheric motions is transported somehow into the upper solar atmosphere, where it may be dissipated leading to the heating of the ambient plasma. A key role in the energy transport is played by the magnetic field because: the magnetic field (i) outlines the shape of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waveguides; (ii) guides MHD waves; (iii) determines connectivity topology; and (iv) contributes to plasma heating. A viable scenario of this energy transport is that the convective motions and solar global oscillations may excite MHD waves in the (sub-)photosphere, which may then propagate through the chromosphere carrying relevant energy into the corona. If MHD waves play a role in the energy transport process(es), it is of great importance that these waves are tracked observationally from where they are generated in the lower solar atmosphere. It is also of fundamental importance to understand the nature of magnetic topology (e.g. force free or non-force free, helicity, etc.) in order to reveal the available free energy stored in magnetic structures. Here we propose (i) observing and tracking MHD waves from photosphere to chromosphere in magnetic bright points; (ii) Next, by means of magneto-seismology of bright points, we will determine not just the nature of these important features (potential or not) but will also construct for the first time their 3D magnetic map.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I000844/1","grantId":"ST/I000844/1","fundValue":"1500","fundStart":"2010-06-29","fundEnd":"2010-07-28","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Von Fay-Siebenburgen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
