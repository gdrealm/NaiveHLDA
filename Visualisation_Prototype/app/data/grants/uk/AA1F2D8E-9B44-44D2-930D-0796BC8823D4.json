A topic for particular attention will be the impact of upratings in the minimum wage on the wage distribution. A recurring issue in the ongoing debate on minimum wages has been whether rises in the minimum wage have effects on wages beyond the increases required to bring those previously below up to the new minimum, and if so how extensive such “spill-over” effects are. The project will investigate the potential spill-over effects of the upratings of the UK minimum wage since its introduction using various alternative approaches to the estimation of the crucially important “counterfactual” wage distribution. The second inter-connected aspect of wage dynamics to be considered concerns movements in individual wages within the distribution. The focus will be on the extent of persistence in wages. Both persistence in general and persistence in low wages, ie at or near the minimum wage, will be examined and both continuous and discrete wage models will be used to investigate this persistence.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2611","grantId":"RES-000-22-2611","fundValue":"80722","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Brian Stewart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
