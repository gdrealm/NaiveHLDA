Much has been learnt, in the past few decades, about the interactions of positrons and Ps with atoms and molecules thanks to the ability of performing controlled reactions with these projectiles, of analyzing final-state products with improved sensitivity together with increasingly sophisticated theoretical descriptions. The aim of this proposal is to advance this knowledge and explore particular aspects of fundamental antimatter-matter interactions. Of particular interest here are reactions resulting in fragmentation of atoms and molecules as driven by positrons.In order to study these, a major instrumental development is proposed consisting of a 'positron reaction microscope'. It will require the development of a bright positron-beam, a cold gas jet and a spectrometer. The reaction products from the intersection of the two beams will be imaged and their trajectory termina and times-of-flight will be determined. From these, a complete picture of the reaction will be extracted and unprecented insight in positron driven reactions will be gained.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E053521/1","grantId":"EP/E053521/1","fundValue":"604471","fundStart":"2007-09-03","fundEnd":"2011-03-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Results are being used primarily by other academics.

It has required the development of a brightness-enhanced positron-beam, a cold gas jet and a spectrometer. This work has been supplemented by investigations of ionizing collisions involving excitation of the target and/or the positronium atom formed as well as positron-induced fragmentation of molecular targets. In particular, cross sections for ionization excitation of CO2 and N2 by positron impact have been measured for the first time and found to exceed those for electron impact factors of 3-5, the enhancement arising primarily via positronium formation. The cross sections for the formation of positronium in the 2P state in collisions of positrons with He, Ar, and Xe atoms have been determined by measuring coincidences between the remnant ion and the Lyman-alpha photon from positronium. The maximum fractional contributions to the total Ps formation cross sections have been found to increase progressively in going from He to Xe. The energy distributions of positrons forward scattered from H2O have been measured in coincidence with the remnant ions (H2O+, OH+ and H+) . The maxima of the energy distributions associated with the production of OH+ and H+ are about 5-10 times smaller than that for (HO+)-O-2. In the long term, positron/Ps scattering may also impact upon the risk assessment associated with medical diagnostics and therapeutic protocols of positron-emission-tomography, material characterization (primarily through annihilation and positronium formation). The public/industrial sector will also benefit through knowledge transfer as well as the training of talented young scientists in performing world-class science and in developing a variety of skills (e.g. problem-solving, creativity, communication, etc). The immediate beneficiaries of the research will be other scientists studying positron and positronium physics, atomic and molecular physics, astrophysics. The theme of the research is ionization, a process which is particularly interdisciplinary, with relevance in chemistry, environmental studies, plasma physics.
