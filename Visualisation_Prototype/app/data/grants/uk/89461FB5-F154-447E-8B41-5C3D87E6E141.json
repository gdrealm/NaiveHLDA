It also allowed him to become familiar with disciplinary approaches and practices. It generated several new collaborations that continue beyond the life of the project, and enabled the PI to establish a new interdisciplinary research programme in music computing. The approaches developed in the project and documented in its publications are applicable to various types of musical performance studies and have been applied by other researchers in their work.
