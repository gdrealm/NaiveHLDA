The nature of the coastline depends on the local conditions of geology and water flow. Rocky coastlines are found where the energy of the sea is high, while mud and sand are found where the energy is lower and these sediments can be deposited. These low energy muddy and sandy (depositional) habitats, are very important for the ecology and economy of the UK. They provide food for many species of birds and fish, but also protect the coastline from the erosive forces of the sea. In addition, they act as a &quot;filter&quot;, where pollutants from the rivers are captured and eventually degraded. Because of the importance of these systems, their natural behaviour and stability is of increasing concern as sea levels rise and storm events increase in frequency with climate change. The movement of sediment around the coast of Britain has vast economic and ecological consequences, but surprisingly we have very little scientific information that helps us to predict how natural mudflats and beaches will respond to the changing forces of the tides, wind and waves. When water flows over the sea bottom, the energy of the flow shapes the sediment into wavy features called bedforms (such as ripples). These bedforms help control the erosion and transport of sand, mud, nutrients and pollutants. Information allowing us to predict the shape, size and movement of bedforms is essential for environmental management, hydraulic engineering, benthic habitat biology, computer modelling of particle transport, sedimentary geology, and many other scientific disciplines. However, there is an almost complete lack of knowledge concerning bedforms consisting of mixtures of sand and mud. Sandy sediments are known to be &quot;non-cohesive&quot;, because the sand particles do not stick together, whereas muds are made up of smaller particles that do stick together and so are called &quot;cohesive&quot; sediments. \n\nThis project, COHBED, will take advantage of the latest developments in measurement technologies to produce information about the growth, movement and stability of bedforms that consist of natural mixtures of sands and muds, a natural condition that is very common but has rarely been studied before. In a new departure, this work includes a multidisciplinary team to combine the physics, mathematics, sedimentology, and biology of these systems, since we recognise that the organisms (from bacteria to sea grasses) that inhabit natural systems also change the erosional characteristics and bedform behaviour. This is why COHBED will include laboratory experiments and field surveys. A series of experiments in laboratory flow channels will investigate key factors that control the behaviour and properties of bedforms, such as: \n- System energy: effects of flow velocity, bed friction and flow depth\n- Bed properties: particle size, proportion of mud and sand, and biological effects\n- Time: the speed of bedform growth and rate of change as flow energy changes\n- Particle erosion: changes in the bedforms as smaller particles are eroded away\n\nThe results of the laboratory studies will be compared with the behaviour of natural systems. Field surveys will be conducted to validate the predictions derived from the laboratory studies, using new techniques that for the first time allow essential simultaneous measurements of flow, sediment and bedform properties. The COHBED project will maintain the UK at the forefront of this research area and will help us to manage our coasts in the face of climate change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I027223/1","grantId":"NE/I027223/1","fundValue":"316599","fundStart":"2012-01-05","fundEnd":"2015-07-04","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Manning, A.J.

These studies will complement the large scale flume studies at Bangor and Hull universities and provide information on the dissolution rate and loss of EPS from the sediment bed over time. Preliminary experiments have been carried out to develop improved protocols, including carbohydrate analysis for studies involving small quantities of xanthan gum and new equipment has been constructed for flume and benthic chamber studies. \n\n \n\nLaboratory experiments are supported by a seasonal field campaign in the Eden Estuary, Scotland and these will add contextual information to the laboratory studies. The influence of biological and physical factors on sediment stability in various natural sediment types will be investigated by sampling various water column and sediment bed characteristics. One such characteristic is the presence and variation of natural biofilms within and between seasons and sites. The xanthan gum used in laboratory experiments will be used as a proxy for the EPS found in natural sediments. \n\n\n\n\n\nKey findings\n\n\n\nLaboratory studies \n\n\n\nLaboratory studies aim to investigate the effects of natural and artificial EPS on bedform behaviour as well as continuing field studies. Findings to date, suggest that the artificial polymer is removed from the forming ripples throughout flume experiments. This also coincides with the level at which the clay is lost from the system, perhaps suggesting that the polymer and clay are more tightly associated, with the sand forming the ripples. The underlying substrate contains all three components of the mixtures; sand, clay and polymer. Water samples will be analysed to gauge whether the polymer is removed through dissolution from the bed.\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the erosion and transport of carbohydrate in biological and artificial mixes of cohesive sediments was carried out using mesocosms (artificial sediment and xanthum gum) and an 8m linear flume (natural sediment and EPS) by Louise Russell, a masters student. \n\n\n\nResults from preliminary trials (flow resulting in no erosion of the surface) did not show any change in carbohydrate content with time. Very low concentrations of carbohydrates were found in the water samples. Following on from the preliminary trials the maximum achievable flow rate of 72 RPM was used and the sediment surface was artificially disturbed at the start of the experiment immediately prior to switching on the mesocosm motors. This artificial disturbance was designed to be representative of any natural disturbance event which causes erosion. The experiment was run for 3 hours with 3 sampling time points; T0 = the start of the run before the motors were turned on; T1 = 1.5 hours after the motors were turned on; and T2 = the end of the run 3 hours after the motors were turned on. All sampling at T0 was done prior to the disturbance event to provide baseline readings against which any changes in carbohydrate content could be measured. Water at all three time points, but sediment samples were taken at T0 and T2.\n\n\n\nTotal carbohydrate:\n\nNo significant differences in sediment total carbohydrate content (&micro;g g-1) were found between the start and end of the experiment.\n\nA statistically significant difference was found in the water samples (K-W p=0.000). It was determined that there was a significant difference between T0 &amp; T1 (p=0.004) and T0 &amp; T2 (p=0.000) but not between T1 &amp; T2 (p&gt;0.017). Although there is no statistically significant difference between T1 &amp; T2 the mean and median total carbohydrate content (&micro;g g-1) continues to increase with time.\n\n\n\nColloidal carbohydrate:\n\nThe colloidal carbohydrate content (ug g-1) was analysed from water samples. There were no significant differences found between time points within the control water samples (p&gt;0.05), however a statistically significant difference was found between T0 &amp; T1 for the experimental group (p=0.008). No significant differences were found between T0 &amp; T2 or T1 &amp; T2 (p&gt;0.05) \n\n\n\nA flume study was carried out in an 8m Armfield linear tilting flume to test the null hypothesis that EPS is lost from the surface of natural sediment under conditions of flow, and there is a detectable change in EPS concentration with depth. The flume study was run for 6 hours; T0 represents samples taken at the start to provide baseline readings and T1 samples were taken at the end of the 6 hour period. Sediment samples were taken using syringe cores (2cm diameter). The surface 1.5cm of each core was sectioned into 0.1cm segments which were analysed for total carbohydrate content. This produced a depth profile of bulk carbohydrate content within the surface layers of the sediment. Time constraints meant that only the top (surface) 1.0cm of sediment could be analysed. The remaining samples have been stored in a -80oC freezer for later analysis. No significant difference in total carbohydrate content was found between depths in experimental (flume) samples (p&gt;0.05) at either time point \n\n\n\nHowever when the top 1cm core was combined it was found that the total carbohydrate content in T1 was significantly lower than that of T0 (p=0.000) (Figure 3), suggesting that EPS was being lost from the surface layers of the sediment. Due to the scale of the flume set up we were unable to test whether the EPS was buried or lost to the water column.\n\n\n\nFieldwork\n\n\n\nPreliminary results from the fieldwork in the Eden suggests that influence of biogenic stabilisation depends on the sediment type, and how the relative influence of biological and physical factors changes throughout the seasons in very different ways at each of these sites.\n\n \n\nSoluble EPS (colloidal carbohydrates) correlates significantly with sediment stability measurements (p&lt;0.001). Colloidal carbohydrate content was also significantly different at each site. The muddy site had significantly higher values for all biological measurements. This site also produces significantly higher erosion thresholds than the other two sites.\n\n\n\nResults to date suggest that EPS content may significantly correlate with sediment stability across different sediment types. Granulometry for each time point is likely to reveal variation in the sediment types at each site throughout the year and follow any relationships between particle size distribution and biological characteristics. EPS may reduce the erosion from tidal immersion as well as impact on ripple formation and development in mixed sediments. \n\n\n\nCurrent laboratory analysis is being carried out on samples collected from the Dee field campaign. This aspect of the work will determine where EPS is found in the surface sediments of different areas of the bed forms. A depth profile will be created indicating where EPS is concentrated in three different areas of the bedform (lee, crest and stoss). This data will be paired with data collected by the University of Bangor.  ","dataset":"gtr"}
