We are taking a testimonial theatre production - entitled Nanay - to Manila to bring the experiences of Filipino caregivers into conversation with debates happening within the Philippines.</p>\n\n<p>Nanay transforms traditional qualitative research transcripts into testimonial theatre; our script is based entirely on verbatim monologues taken from interviews conducted over a fifteen year period with Filipino domestic workers, their children, employers, and nanny agents. As social scientists, we turn to theatre because it embodied quality offers space in which to encourage audiences to think about their world differently, to temporarily suspend judgment, and to extend the terrain of political discussion on the ethics of care in productive ways. We work with the awareness that because labour migration from the global south to the global north is a transnational issue, we must reconfigure the scale at which discussions of justice, care and need take place.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000594/1","grantId":"ES/K000594/1","fundValue":"46937","fundStart":"2012-11-12","fundEnd":"2013-02-27","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Caleb Fraser Johnston","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
