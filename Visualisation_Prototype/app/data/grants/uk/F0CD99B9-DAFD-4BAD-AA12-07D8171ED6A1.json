The overall aim of the network is to transfer techniques, models and scientific insights between engineering and mathematics, as well as promote mobility between academia and industry. Initially, the key areas of scientific research will include: large scale computational modelling, fundamental pore-scale physics, inverse problems and history matching, reservoir simulations, soil science and shallow ecosystems, theoretical biology and physiology, groundwater remediation, subsurface storage of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste, uncertainty quantification, homogenisation and multi-scale methods, visualization, numerical analysis and random field modelling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J02080X/1","grantId":"EP/J02080X/1","fundValue":"145471","fundStart":"2013-01-28","fundEnd":"2016-01-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This is a network grant - there are no direct \n'findings'  ","person":"Gabriel  Lord","coPersons":["Sebastian  Geiger"],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":" The overall aim of the network is to transfer techniques, models and scientific insights between engineering and mathematics, as well as promote mobility between academia and industry.
