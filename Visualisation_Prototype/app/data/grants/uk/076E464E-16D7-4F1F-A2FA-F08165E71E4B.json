It displays exceptional heat and electron conduction properties. Graphene also has a high potential for\nanti-corrosion properties as it displays ultra-high resistance to the diffusion of gases and small molecules and due to its\nexcellent stability towards oxidation. However, graphene suffers from the drawback of being poorly soluble/dispersible in\npolymer matrices and hard to process, unless stabilisers are used. Unfortunately, although the use of stabilisers leads to\nimprove processability, it also decreases the performance of graphene based nanocomposites.\nThis project aims to develop a novel approach for the stabilisation of graphene using a type of smart ultra-thin graphene\nsurface functionalisation, termed polymer brush. In particular, we will design polymer brushes that can be cleaved from the\ngraphene surface by irradiation with light, hence enabling their use to improve the processing of graphene without impairing\nits exceptional heat and electrical conduction and anti-corrosion properties. This technology could have a considerable\nimpact on the application of graphene to a wide range of technologies.\nIn collaboration with FormFormForm Ltd., the company behind the range of silicone-based resins called Sugru, we will\nexplore the use of these materials to generate heat and electrically conductive silicone based matrices, as well as the\napplication of such composites as anti-corrosion coatings. Achieving high performance for such flexible silicone-based\ncomposites, thanks to the exceptional properties of graphene, could open up a wide range of applications for such siliconebased\nmaterials. Hence we will explore the use of this new technology to address some of the current challenges in the\nmanufacturing industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507726/1","grantId":"EP/M507726/1","fundValue":"88336","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Emiliano  Bilotti","coPersons":["Julien Ezra Gautrot"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
