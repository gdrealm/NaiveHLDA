It reduces yield and quality, and its persistence in soil imposes a major constraint on where faba beans can be grown. The crop provides a large and lucrative export market for the UK, but this is currently significantly under-supplied, indicating considerable potential for an increased growing area. If stem nematode could be effectively controlled, growers would be able to expand faba bean acreage and have confidence that output would not be adversely affected. Resistance to the pest provides a cost effective and environmentally benign means of control. Sources of resistance are known in faba bean germplasm, yet there are no resistant varieties available appropriate for the UK and its markets. Recent developments in the generation of molecular markers in faba bean, and improvements in phenotypic screens for nematode resistance, provide an opportunity for the rapid, marker-assisted development of resistant varieties. The objectives of this project are to locate genes conferring stem nematode resistance in a new purpose-designed faba bean segregating population, and to select for these genes within the current breeding programme so that resistant varieties with export quality can be achieved. The project will bring new, efficient and affordable breeding techniques to a crop which has had little research support in the last decade, and is prone to some major biotic stresses, but which has a high value market outlet for the UK and delivers many desirable environmental benefits.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/I001301/1","grantId":"TS/I001301/1","fundValue":"170463","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Donal Martin O'Sullivan","coPersons":["Jane Elizabeth Thomas","Amanda-Jane  Cottage"],"organisation":"National Inst of Agricultural Botany","findingsText":" New SNP markers and assays in faba bean have been discovered and validated. Novel phenotyping techniques have been used to track stem nematode resistance in a faba bean breeding population. The techniques developed will be taken forward into commercial breeding programmes by one of the project partners, and have demonstrated how new breeding technologies can be applied to the major leguminous crop in the UK. The introduction of stem nematode resistance using the techniques developed in our project will greatly improve yield potential of the crop and increase the area on which it can be grown.
