{"id":"E263CE31-1B78-483F-823B-58AB04E6795F","title":"Molecular analysis of the lymphocyte cell surface","abstractText":"My first aim is to continue to ensure that our work is published as soon as possible in mainstream journals and in the form of reviews to meet a wider audience. The WWW is becoming very important in disseminating information and our WWW pages are regularly updated. I am keen on open access and I have contributed to the recent government enquiry on this subject. I have recently published an article in BMC Biochem with another to submitted later this month. The nature of our basic research is relatively technical and not disease oriented which limits interest to the media. However in the past press releases have led to TV and radio interest and I will continue to encourage these where appropriate. I will continue to take the opportunity to discuss the work and recently I was the focus for an article in the magazine Genome Technology (Feb 2003). We will continue to encourage visits from school members and one visit to a school is planned shortly (MHB). In addition two members of my group presented at the recent British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Manchester along with a former Post doc and this type of contact will be encouraged.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400808","grantId":"G0400808","fundValue":"1200130","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"A Neil Barclay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
