{"id":"59C15BEE-8AAC-4A7D-A127-25B20A708282","title":"The Vehicle Routing Problem with Split Deliveries and Pickups","abstractText":"<p>This project proposes a new business model, the <em>Vehicle Routing Problem with Split Deliveries and Pickups</em>. This model caters for situations where customers wish to both send and receive goods and accept more than one visit.&nbsp; Such situations can arise in the transport of mail or in supermarket chain logistics (recycled or returned items constitute the backward flow).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this project is to develop a model of this problem, to create an appropriate problem-solving tool by developing and applying a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence based methodology and to investigate the applicability of this model by analysing the results of extensive computational experiments, hence being able to provide companies with advice regarding the tangible and intangible benefits and disadvantages of applying this model in practice.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>To solve the model a meta-heuristic method called reactive tabu search will be used. Meta-heuristics are tools of artificial intelligence techniques and provide approximate solutions to large complex problems within a reasonable computing time. The effectiveness of the method will be tested and a thorough analysis to answer the research questions will be carried out by the design of experiments and empirical testing.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3451","grantId":"RES-000-22-3451","fundValue":"25716","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  To date we do not have feedbakc on paractical use of our research.

(It is also a very complex mathematical problem.) Our research highlighted the advantages of a strategy whereby deliveries to customers may take polace at a separate occassion to pikcing goods up from customers. It may be developed for a variety of other routing problems; alternatively, the underlying mathematics problem can be explored in more depth. Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
