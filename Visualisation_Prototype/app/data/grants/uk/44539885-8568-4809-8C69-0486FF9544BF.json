{"id":"44539885-8568-4809-8C69-0486FF9544BF","title":"A novel enzymatic means to confirm correct and safe nasogastric tube placement","abstractText":"At least 1 million nasogastric feeding tubes are used by the NHS every year. Tube misplacements can and do have disastrous consequences, including death (National Patient Safety Agency data 2003-10). Existing methods to verify tube placements, including standard pH testing and the gold-standard chest X-rays, have major drawbacks in cost, usability or safety. We have a new enzymatic test to verify correct tube placement, that our pilot study show to be reliable and accurate, while low cost, simple and requiring no extra user training. The new test has great potential to translate into clinical practice. This project will refine the biochemistry and design of the test to provide a new diagnostic product into the NHS supply chain. It will carry out a clinical trial to further validate the technical performance of the test. Data on cost-effectiveness, clinical utility, clinical pathways and mitigation of barriers will be generated to assess the impact of its commercialisation and promote its adoption by the NHS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_15008","grantId":"MC_PC_15008","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"George B Hanna","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
