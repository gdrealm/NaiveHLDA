However, typical CFS wall-panel structures have the following limitations that should be addressed before they can be widely used in modern building construction: 1) Low buckling resistance and ductility in CFS members and joints; 2) No generic method for optimisation of CFS structural systems, capable of taking into account both manufacturing and construction constraints; 3) Extensive reliance on fixed load-bearing walls. \n\nThe main aim of the research is to develop a novel performance-based optimisation framework to address the challenging optimisation problems associated with complex CFS structural systems at both element and structural levels. The framework will be used to develop a new generation of high-performance dual wall-frame CFS systems, which are suitable for tall buildings and resilient to extreme load conditions. The overall objectives of the project are to: \n\n1- Enhance strength and ductility of CFS structural systems to increase collapse resistance and overall safety under extreme events (such as blast and strong earthquakes), through the development of special connections and high-performance dual wall-frame systems.\n\n2- Decrease structural weight and construction cost through advanced CFS section optimisation, accounting for dimensional and manufacturing limitations, and by developing a novel performance-based optimisation framework to obtain cost-effective CFS structures with better structural performance at serviceability and ultimate limit states. \n\n3- Increase structural and architectural design flexibility by developing optimised CFS frame systems that eliminate (or reduce) the need for fixed CFS load-bearing wall panels.\n\nThe output of the proposed research will give a competitive advantage to the UK construction sector and will have a long term impact on UK economic growth by developing more efficient light-weight steel structural systems that can reduce overall construction costs and provide higher strength and ductility. The work will be conducted in partnership with key UK CFS industries. Industrial liaison and dissemination activities, including a project conference, are planned to ensure the take-up of the new technology and benefit international researchers and UK organisations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L019116/1","grantId":"EP/L019116/1","fundValue":"101035","fundStart":"2014-03-15","fundEnd":"2015-09-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The preliminary results of this study have been used by BW Industries (one of the industrial partners) to make more cost-effective cold-formed steel (CFS) sections.

The results are CFS beam and column sections with up to 30% higher flexural and axial strength compared to existing standard sections.\n\noBased on the proposed optimisation methodology, a computer programme (open source) is developed to obtain optimum CFS sections for practical design purposes. This programme can be efficiently used by engineers and practitioners.\n\noFor the first time, optimum CFS sections are obtained for 10 different standard prototypes using different design parameters (e.g. length, coil width and sheet thickness). These standard elements can be used by structural engineers as 'off-the-shelf' elements or as part of optimised CFS structural systems.\n\noThe results of this study showed that a folded flange section can provide better design solutions by satisfying all manufacturing and construction constraints. This novel cross section can be efficiently used in the construction of CFS modular structures and can reduce the total structural weight by up to 25%. \n\noThe optimised sections developed in this study can considerably decrease the structural weight and construction cost of CFS structures and provide higher load resistance, which makes them suitable for tall buildings and resilient to extreme load conditions. This can also reduce the CO2 emissions and embodied energy for new constructions. UK CFS industry, consultants, contractors, engineers, practitioners and governmental agencies are the most likely non-academic beneficiaries of the results of this research. Special efforts have been made to ensure these parties have full opportunity to benefit from the research undertaken. To help the findings of this research be taken forward:\n\noThe practical outcomes of the project have been presented to a few key potential industrial beneficiaries in the UK. More direct visits will be arranged in future.\n\noThe preliminary results of this study have been presented in three conference papers. More publications are planned in scientific journals as well as professional journals widely read by engineers and practitioners.\n\noA design tools has been developed for engineers and practitioners. The PI and the industrial partners will encourage incorporation of the developed optimisation methods in commercial software applications by alerting the developers of CFS software.\n\noShort technical presentations will be given at events which are attended by engineers and representatives of UK consultants (e.g. SCI, ICE, and IstructE events). \n\noLeaflets and posters will be distributed and displayed at University Open Days, Headstart Engineering Summer School (a four day residential course for year 12 students) and Researchers' Night events, using the assistance of school liaison office of the University of Sheffield.\n\noOne day workshop will be held at the University of Sheffield at the end of the project by inviting the project's supporters, engineers, CFS software developers, and prominent researchers from UK, EU and US to discuss outcomes of this research and to map future research directions. As a part of the programme, the efficiency of the developed optimum design tool will be demonstrated by using practical example, followed by an open discussion.
