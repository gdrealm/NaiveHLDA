{"id":"74B690F3-ECED-47D3-A1BD-034B8874E4F9","title":"Workshops on Shareholder Value and Corporate Social Responsibility","abstractText":"<p>Executive pay, fairness and employee engagement concern academics and practitioners. The proposed Knowledge Exchange workshop brings together the expertise of Manchester academics and Hay Group consultants in dialogue with senior human resources staff and non executive directors from FTSE 100 and 250 companies. Jointly developed presentations, by academics and consultants, aim to open up a broader perspective on issues usually discussed at firm level, as a matter of relating pay to performance in one company with or without comparators. <br />How do large rewards for top executives feed broader patterns of increasing wealth and income inequalities? What are the unintended consequences of action at individual firm level, and can shareholder value be delivered and rewarded, without frustrating stakeholder expectations? Against this broader background, the workshop will continue the debate regarding how managers are and should be incentivised.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J020680/1","grantId":"ES/J020680/1","fundValue":"4997","fundStart":"2012-05-11","fundEnd":"2012-07-10","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karel  Williams","coPersons":["Julie  Froud"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
