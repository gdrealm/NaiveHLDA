{"id":"F79EA820-1D5A-4109-9312-87F42AA6EBAF","title":"A Synthesis Programme at Cambridge","abstractText":"The research presented in this proposal, encompasses a broad range of challenging projects. The total syntheses will require the development of existing reactions and the invention of new processes. We will develop new synthetic methods and new tools for molecular synthesis. There is much to commend an integrated programme of science as presented in this document. The desire for more efficient syntheses stimulates the discovery of new reactivities to solve particular problems. New reactions can open up areas for total synthesis and analogue generation that were previously inaccessible. These drivers impact on the development of new methods for synthesis. The added value that arises from having a closely coupled programme containing the development of new synthetic methods, new ways of performing reactions and total synthesis is considerable. All these disciplines will drive the creative process. It is undoubtedly a grand challenge, but one we feel is worthy of investment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F069685/1","grantId":"EP/F069685/1","fundValue":"3418100","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  New methods and new tools have been developed for the synthesis of molecules of biological interest.

So far the total syntheses of iso- and bongkrekic acids, chloptosin and O-methyl siphonazole have been accomplished. Significant contributions have been made to the development of new synthesis methods. In particular the use of pyrrolidinyl-tetrazole as a versatile organocatalyst The developed methods and equipment are used worldwide to assemble and create new functional systems that benefit mankind in general. In particular, the new tools for synthesis are already having a very significant impact on the way modern organic synthesis is conducted in industry. Both of our laboratories including the Innovative Technology Centre enable us to lead in this competitive area of science enhancing the development of partnerships with manufacturers and industry thereby maintaining Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
