A prominent region for shape coexistence is in the light lead nuclei, where the nucleus is spherical in its ground state but can easily take on oblate or prolate deformations. We intend to perform a discriminating test of nuclear models by investigating the structure of the very exotic lead nucleus, 180-Pb, for the first time. This isotope with 26 neutrons less than the common, stable isotope of lead has a half-life of only a few milliseconds. This challenging measurement will allow us to explore the exotic effects observed on reaching the proton drip-line.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H002529/1","grantId":"ST/H002529/1","fundValue":"1920","fundStart":"2009-04-06","fundEnd":"2009-10-05","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  They have been taken up by theorists who want to better understand shape coexistence in nuclei and can use the data to challenge their models.
