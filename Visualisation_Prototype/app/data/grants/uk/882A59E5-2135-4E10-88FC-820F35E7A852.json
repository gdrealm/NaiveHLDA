Converted from their former function as huge oil containers the Tanks at Tate Modern are the only designated museum space for 'live' art (installation, performance, new media and film) in the world. The Tanks present a unique challenge and opportunity for the gallery to understand the experience of live art, not least as the opening 15 week Art in Action programme attracted 565,000 visitors. A key element of Art in Action was Undercurrent, a multi-disciplinary 11 day festival programmed by and for young people. Attracting young visitors from across the UK, the Undercurrent programme actively questioned how young people engage with and develop mainstream and alternative cultural forms and, as with much live art, troubled the barriers between artists and audience and involved multiple layers of involvement.\n\nThis study draws on the unique potential offered by Tate as a site of cultural creation and engagement for young people. The project builds on on the museum's existing good practice in involving young people working collaboratively with artists in the making and viewing of live and participatory art. It extends this work by addressing the methodological challenge of accounting for the value to participants of engaging in processes of cultural production. \n\nThe research is an in-depth case study which explores the potential of a participant-led, creative evaluative methodology to evidence the cultural value of making and viewing live performance in the art museum. In tune with the practice it addresses, this study is cross-disciplinary. It draws on methodological approaches from art practice, ethnography and participant evaluation. The study is both a formative and summative evaluation. Its focus on process relies on an innovative use of the practices of individual and group film editing as a means of stimulating critical reflection. One of its prime contributions will be an assessment of the possibilities offered by film and social media as a means of enabling wider peer assessments of cultural value and ongoing critical meaning making. Film also offers a medium for the representation and communication of the participant's experiences to peers and to wider audiences. \n \nThe case study focuses on 15 young people working as performers and researchers. They will take part in two hour workshops with a dancer. They will work each morning for five days to develop a piece of live art, culminating in a public performance on the fifth day in the Galleries at Tate. The workshops will be filmed by a film-maker and each afternoon the young participants will split into groups and, alongside the dancer, work with the film maker to produce rough edits of the day's activity. Embedded within this editing process will be evaluative judgements, as participants will be asked to shape their films according to the following question: What part of the creative process that you have been a part of do you consider the most valuable, and what does it look like? At the end of each day the rough edits will be posted on a vimeo site. Participants will be invited to comment on each other's films alongside a wider cohort of young people who Tate will recruit as peer reviewers prior to the project. \n\nOver the following four month period participants and peer reviewers will continue to edit their own and other's films. The young participants and dancer will reconvene at Tate in March 2014 for a two-day workshop led by the film makers. During these sessions, the group will collaborate to produce one film that takes account of the varied representations of their experience of the dance workshops and performance. This will articulate the cultural value to them of engaging in the process. To gather further evidence of the cultural experiences of young participants and to assess the integrity of the evaluative process, two participant researchers will also observe, film and interview participants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L005352/1","grantId":"AH/L005352/1","fundValue":"30958","fundStart":"2013-08-30","fundEnd":"2014-05-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Researchers are still working on the findings.  ","person":"Patricia  Thomson","coPersons":["Emily  Pringle"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" We are still working on our results. An interim finding is that film can communicate some of the experience of a youth live art workshop, and the editing does indicate what events had the most impact on young people involved. However if the text is also an art object, it raises doubts for the audience as to the veracity of their interpretations. We intend to work more on the question of how this use of film differs from the ways film is used in other disciplines. We also intend to work with some of the young people from this workshop on a co-designed project which also combines a workshop in a contemporary art practice and the use of film as data and as representation.
