Failure of adhesion can result in heart failure or extremely unpleasant, potentially lethal skin disease. \nTo cope with everyday wear and tear normal cells must vary their adhesion. In order to repair a wound, epidermal cell must weaken their adhesion so that they can rearrange themselves and spread over the wound surface.\nWe believe that strong adhesion is mediated by minute structures called desmosomes that are like little Velcro patches on the cells. Our hypothesis is that desmosomes have a special property that distinguishes them from other cell adhesions and Velcro. Once they have formed initial weak adhesion between cells they can lock themselves into a strongly adhesive state in which they remain unless the tissue is wounded when they revert to the weaker state.\nWe will use electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography to investigate how desmosomes are able to do this.\nOur results may suggest novel disease treatments and ways to accelerate wound healing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700074","grantId":"G0700074","fundValue":"891404","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Ronald Garrod","coPersons":["Michael  Sherratt","Lydia  Tabernero"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
