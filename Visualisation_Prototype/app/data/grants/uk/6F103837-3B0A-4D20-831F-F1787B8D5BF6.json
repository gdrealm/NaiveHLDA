This recollection of the idiosyncratic status of the Sitwells in the late 1920s articulates their position as the arbiters of a singularly baroque and ornamental experimental aesthetics. Together and in their individual works, Edith, Osbert and Sacheverell Sitwell pursued an alternative avant-gardism to the standards of a functionalist or classicist modernism, subsequently resulting in the critical disavowal of their impact as avant-garde writers and patrons within the retrospective conceptualisation of the history and theory of modernism. While biographical studies (Pearson, 1978; Glendinning, 1981; Bradford, 1993; Ziegler, 1998) have gone some way to readdress the obscurity of the Sitwells within the literary heritage of the second half of the twentieth century, they remain significantly marginalized within literary and art historical criticism (see only Cevasco, 1987; Peters Corbett, 1997). The current proposal seeks support to complete the writing of a monograph critically reappraising the role of Edith, Osbert and Sacheverell Sitwell as avant-garde writers, art critics and patrons within the literary, art historical and cultural scene of 1920s London. I consider the influence of the Sitwells on a cult of baroque and rococo aesthetics, pervasive within the inter-war years, articulating a counter-history of post-war modernism that remains significantly occluded from disciplinary art historical and literary historiography. This forms a discrete planned stage of a longer-term projected series of work (to include a conference in December 2009, and an online edition of Sitwell correspondence and works for which I intend to submit a research grant application in 2009) readdressing the question of the critical and cultural significance of the Sitwells and 'Sitwellism' within twentieth-century literary and art history. \\n\\nI will be undertaking British Academy funded archival research at the Sitwell archives at the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, Austin in April 2008, beginning the monograph in the summer semester and period, and continuing it during my HEI leave in the Autumn of 2008.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G005338/1","grantId":"AH/G005338/1","fundValue":"27738","fundStart":"2009-01-15","fundEnd":"2009-05-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Deborah  Longworth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
