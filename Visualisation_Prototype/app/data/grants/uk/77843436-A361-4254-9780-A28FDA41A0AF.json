It will explore fundamental questions concerning the demands that reading, writing, speaking and listening to poetry present to learners and teachers and how these demands are addressed in pre-service education and continuing professional development.&nbsp;The series brings together academics who research in this field in institutions which are geographically distant from each other and will provide opportunities for colleagues in schools, local authorities, colleges and arts organisations and poets to network and learn from each other and explore new approaches to teaching and researching poetry.</p>\n\n<p>The Poetry Matters series will create a research database on poetry education which will explore different research methodologies and poetry matters of concern. International collaboration will be initiated between the UK, Europe and North America and a unique poetry wiki will be established to ensure continued dissemination and collaboration throughout the period of the seminar series and beyond.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I001549/1","grantId":"ES/I001549/1","fundValue":"18219","fundStart":"2011-01-04","fundEnd":"2012-07-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sue  Dymoke","coPersons":["Anthony Charles Wilson","Andrew  Lambirth"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
