First is the heterogeneous and hidden quality of inputs a barrier to technology adoption? If so, this would lead to the recommendation of interventions that guide the farmers toward the right inputs, through regulations or through the diffusion of information. Second, do estimates regarding returns to new technologies coming from agricultural research in on-farm trials provide biased estimates for the response to inputs in real life conditions? If so, what are the most important sources of such bias, and how can trials be designed to avoid them? The study hence aims to reinforce the bridge between agronomic and development economics work. Third, does learning-by-doing and learning-from-others regarding new agricultural technologies differ depending on soils, skills and gender? And does this heterogeneity provide useful lessons for the design of more inclusive extension models and on the role of own experimentation in such models? \n\nTo answer these questions we propose two Randomized Control Trials (RCT). The first &quot;research trial RCT&quot; will allow the farmers in the randomly selected villages to participate to the on-farm trials carried out by the agronomists of IITA in order to test inputs of different quality. Second, in the &quot;technology dissemination RCT&quot; village based advisors will be trained in randomly selected villages to promote the best inputs identified in the research trials. For each RCT we will collect several rounds of panel data to study the dynamic adoption processes. This will be complemented with information from soils sample and with detailed information on farmers' cognitive, non-cognitive and technical skills. The study has been jointly designed with IITA scientists during a series of meetings and field trips, drawing on the expertise of agronomists and economists. A specific objective of the collaboration between PSE and IITA is capacity building for IITA social scientists in rigorous impact evaluation methods, through hands-on collaboration in all the different steps of the research.\n\nThe research will provide guidelines on how to address the issue of heterogeneous input quality to our partners at IITA, and more broadly to policy makers and stakeholders interested agricultural productivity in Africa. It will also aim to provide guidelines for future research by scientists within and beyond the CGIAR, and provide key insights to economists and other social sciences studying the puzzle of low adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa. We will therefore actively engage with different stakeholders throughout the project, and aim to publish the results in high quality peer reviewed academic journals. \n\nThis proposal addresses a number of key issues highlighted under the call for proposals' Theme 1 &quot;Agriculture and Growth&quot;. It is also of relevance to Theme 3 &quot;Innovation and productivity growth in Low -Income Countries&quot;.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L012324/1","grantId":"ES/L012324/1","fundValue":"394082","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Macours","coPersons":["Rachid  Laajaj"],"organisation":"Paris School of Economics","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
