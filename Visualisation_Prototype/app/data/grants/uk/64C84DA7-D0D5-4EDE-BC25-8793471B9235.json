It is technically challenging to detect these interactions and understand what changes are occurring in the proteins when they bind their target ligand. However, such information is vital, not only for a better understanding of the process, but also if we are to be able to control them or to create new treatments. This problem is even more stark for one set of interactions, those between proteins and the cell-surface receptor heparan sulfate (HS). This is because the current techniques, based on circular dichroism (CD) and infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy do not cope well with HS, which exhibits signals that interfere with the analysis of the protein component of the complex. We propose to explore two approaches which may enable us to selectively probe the structural changes in proteins in the presence of HS. The first is based on selection of an active but structurally modifed HS fragment from our existing library of structures. This will be selected so that it lacks particular groups and will present no interferring signal in infra-red (FTIR) but will retain biological activity. This we term a 'transparent' HS ligand. Using this, the signal for HS should disappear while that of the protein is detected. Structural changes should then only be reported from the protein. The second method utilises a technique called vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), which should detect the regular structures present in the protein but not those of the less-regularly structured HS ligand (a normal, not a modified HS ligand). This may enable the protein to be selectively observed even in the presence of HS. The proposed research is to test these two possibilities with two proteins that are known to change shape on binding HS. One is the normal (non-infectious) form of the prion protein (PrPC) and the other is an enzyme involved in plaque formation in Alzheimers' disease; BACE-1. If successful, the approach will be widely applicable to studying the great number of protein-HS interactions that occur between protein and cell-surface HS ligands, which currently cannot be accurately followed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D020794/1","grantId":"BB/D020794/1","fundValue":"100764","fundStart":"2006-07-28","fundEnd":"2007-10-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Edwin Alexander Yates","coPersons":["Richard  Nichols"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
