{"id":"F6E05D93-E990-48CA-9D15-410B0728572F","title":"Cell Separation Device","abstractText":"The project will develop a technology for the separation and detection of individual important cells in a biological fluid for the diagnosis of major diseases such as cancer. It will use uniquely nanostructured materials on a photographic surface to select for rare cells in a mixed population of cells, in order to achieve sensitivity of 1/1,000,000 not achieved to date by any other technology. The objective of this proposal is to develop early stage light tight units initially for use as laboratory research tools, followed by a device that is suitable for a small scale clinical feasibility study. The consortium partners bring together unique skills in photographic manufacture, design engineering and academic know-how in the behaviour of cells, and an understanding of health care needs for early detection and diagnosis that will underpin the early prototype design and future product manufacture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F006748/1","grantId":"DT/F006748/1","fundValue":"265161","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Yes we have a Beta test production run of the equipment we've developed Healthcare Cultural,Economic","person":"John Alan Hunt","coPersons":["John  Neoptolemos","W  Greenhalf"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" We have developed a technique using light to purify single type of cells from large mixtures of cells.
