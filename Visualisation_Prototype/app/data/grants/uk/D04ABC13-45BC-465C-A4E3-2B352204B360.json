We focus on how shock impact on urban and regional systems and the response of policy stakeholders. Resilience is the ability of a system to bounce back from a shock; the community is at the forefront of resilience responses. Fail safe/back-up ('redundancy') is crucial to establishing equilibrium in ecological and engineering systems following shock. Rather than being viewed as an insurance policy for when things go wrong, redundancy is associated with employment loss and as a wholly negative property in socio-economic systems.</p>\n\n<p>In these research seminars, we identify how ‘redundancy’ can enhance the adaptive capacity of urban and regional systems following slow-burn/sudden shock events and aspects of planning policy that help cities and regions to cope with both kinds of shock. In Birmingham a one day theoretical ‘scene setting’ seminar is followed by a site visit and discussion of the Longbridge closure, its slow-burn consequences and planning responses. In Japan, seminars in Tokyo and stakeholder conference in the Tohoku region will build on the Birmingham seminar and pose questions for how redundancy forms a key component of longer-term adaption following natural shock events.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J013838/1","grantId":"ES/J013838/1","fundValue":"14520","fundStart":"2012-06-25","fundEnd":"2013-06-24","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Following the seminar series the PI established a role as adviser to Birmingham City Council on policy review scrutiny committee reports on 'Fair Finance and Devolution' and 'Place Making and Neighbourhood Services'. The concept of resilience has been used at city and city-regional level in Birmingham in a way that has not considered diversity or redundancy (resource) within communities. The concept of redundancy has contributed to ideas around diversity of delivery and has assisted the city in looking differently at resources within communities. Recommendations for a new funding formula for devolved finance of services has been written by the PI and has used the concept of redundancy to inform the process of allocation by basing it on a more diverse and context specific formula including need (deprivation), resource (social capital and physical assets), path dependency (function of district, urban morphology and infrastructure utilisation) and intensity (movement and population). In devolved structures, communities can only be resilient if the underlying structural limitations (or opportunities) are recognised and that context specific mechanisms and resources are put in place to deliver 'good' outcomes.

Redundancy of design in city-regional planning networks and information / knowledge exchange is a necessity; \nii. there is a need for a more 'realistic' evaluation of interventions and outcomes placing emphasis on context-mechanisms-outcomes of resilience discourses; \niii. a blending of top-down regional planning knowledge with more tacit level knowledge of households and communities;\niv. recognition that diversification, which may not have arisen without the emergency situation or shock event, can assist the opportunity for recovery;\nv. community engagement is key to resilience and the need for diversity and linking of groups who have experienced shock events to let the communities learn from each other.\nThe research project assisted Birmingham Resilience in the development of Recovery Planning as the project reinforced the emphasis on the need to consider more than replacement in recovery. More emphasis has been placed on this in the city's resilience guidance document and the emphasis on opportunities for regeneration and growth. Both the Resilience Strategy and the Neighbourhood Strategy for Birmingham reflect perspectives developed in the seminars. The seminar series was successful in aligning a number of local and regional policy actors including Neighbourhood Services, Planning, Local Strategic Partnership, Birmingham Resilience and West Midlands Councils and challenging their thinking on resilience and the role of redundancy in resilient urban systems.
