{"id":"ACDC1184-477F-47D5-B0E4-53BE7A2FF6D5","title":"Understanding Runoff and Erosion Dynamics","abstractText":"Soil erosion by water is leading to an accelerated loss of the world's food-producing lands, threatening global food security. Models are a vital component of attempts to understand the impact of agricultural processes, land-use and climate change on soil erosion. However, current approaches to modelling soil erosion, despite a long heritage, have shown little overall improvement in their predictive capability. All models are constrained by the experimental base upon which they rests, much of which, for soil erosion, dates from experiments and technologies of a generation ago. Thus far, technological limitations have constrained experimental work to steady-state measurements for what is actually a highly dynamic process. For example, experiments to derive the parameters of soil-erosion models typically use constant-intensity rainfall and then apply these parameters to model erosion under temporally varying natural rainfall, although we now have evidence that parameters derived in this way will make incorrect predictions for temporally varying natural rainfall. A way out of this impasse is to use optical diagnostic techniques, developed in the field of mechanical engineering, which enable the study of highly dynamic multiphase flows. Recent developments in pulsed laser-illumination sources and digital camera technology allow the recording of particle/flow interactions at rates up to 20,000 frames per second. Using these techniques it is now possible to make a step change in our understanding of the dynamics of processes of soil erosion. This research will (i) refine existing high-speed, high-resolution imaging and PIV techniques to track sediment particles of 0.063 mm to 2.0 mm simultaneously in shallow overland flows that typify soil erosion; (ii) use these refined techniques to develop datasets of high resolution and high accuracy that will characterize the dynamics of the different components of the detachment, transport and deposition processes in shallow overland flows; (iii) make these datsets available to the wider soil-erosion community for their own model development and testing; (iv) use the data obtained to develop submodels within an existing soil-erosion model (MAHLERAN) which we have previously developed that are capable of representing dynamic properties of erosion processes, rather than steady-state conditions; and (v) test the revised version of MAHLERAN against existing datasets for unsteady conditions. The work will provide an important contribution to key NERC Strategy areas such as Living with Environmental Change and the analysis of the impact of environmental change on ecosystem services, with consequences in terms of sustainability, global poverty and carbon sequestration. The research will also lead to the production of more effective tools for environmental managers to implement practices of integrated river-basin management as required under current legislation such as the EU Water Framework and Nitrates Directives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H006176/1","grantId":"NE/H006176/1","fundValue":"381371","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  1. attempt to develop a project with the EA to evaluate the potential of the MAHLERAN-MiC model in an applied context to look at pollution episodes.\n2. ongoing project with Wear Rivers Trust on erosion impacts on infrastructure Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment Policy & public services","person":"John  Wainwright","coPersons":["Anthony John Parsons"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" This research has focused on tracking the movement of soil particles eroded by water.\nDetachment of soil by the impact of raindrops is the mechanism by which about half of all soil erosion is initiated. In this research we have used, for the first time, particle-imaging velocimetry to track soil particles detached in this way. Our study has shown that there are two distinct mechanisms involved in the splash process, which had not previously been recognized. Furthermore, only about 2 % of the momentum of a raindrop is transferred to transport sediment, the first time a measurement of this type has been possible.\nOnce soil particles are detached, they move a finite distance mainly by being transported by flowing water. Thus the amount of soil erosion is a function of both how many particles are detached and how far they are transported. In this project, we have developed a novel model for tracking the movement of detached particles, termed the MAHLERAN marker-in-cell model we have successfully demonstrated that it is possible to simulate the timing, amount and spatial pattern of movement using data where splash, and both unconcentrated and concentrated (rill) erosion occur. The work on tracking particles detached by raindrops can be used to improve the parameterization of soil-erosion models, which are the primary means by which rates of soil erosion are assessed for management purposes, which has generally depended on empirical soils data but has been poorly carried out in the UK. By working at the level of fundamental particles, it should be easier to transfer information from setting to setting.\n\nLand managers (e.g. EA, Rivers Trusts) have a particular interest in understanding how far sediment travels, and especially sources of inputs to rivers. Without such knowledge it is impossible to initiate effective remedial measures. \n\nOur marker-in-cell model has received interest from the EA as a practical tool for use in evaluating pollution episodes. A follow-on application to NERC to support the development in this context was unsuccessful. We are currently working with the Wear Rivers Trust to use the model to look at impacts on infrastructure of erosion episodes.
