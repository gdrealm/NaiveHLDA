{"id":"66708735-A41F-4C45-AB03-8F357C2AECFD","title":"New homotopy-type invariants of knots.","abstractText":"To a mathematician knots are essentially the same as they are to anyone - tangled up pieces of string. Studying when two knots are different turns out to have deep implications for a wide range of mathematical areas. In this project we are developing a new way to distinguish between two knots and we hope that our research will lead not just to a better understanding of knots, but also to a better understanding of weird 4-dimensional spaces.\n\nThis hope comes from the fact that one can consider knots sitting in 3-dimensional space as living on the boundary of 4-dimensional space. When one pulls the knot through the 4-dimensional space, analyzing what sort of surfaces you can produce tells you about that 4-dimensional space. Our way of distinguishing between knots should have something to say also about these surfaces, and hence about 4-dimensional spaces.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M000389/1","grantId":"EP/M000389/1","fundValue":"201750","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Jay Lobb","coPersons":["Dirk  Schuetz"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
