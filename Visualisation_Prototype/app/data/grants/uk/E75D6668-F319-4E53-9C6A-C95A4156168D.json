Currently, renal replacement is expensive and cost-effective provision of kidney transplantation constitutes a major global health priority. The number of patients receiving renal replacement therapy exceeds 1.4 million worldwide and is growing by 8 percent annually, in excess of the growth rate of the general population. Solutions for the prevention or reversal of renal disease have so far failed to significantly change the development of global patient numbers. An economically viable alternative to allograft transplantation is not foreseen in the mid-term future; hence renal transplant is the only solution. \n\nThe successful outcome of a transplantation depends on how well the donor and recipient are matched for tissue proteins called HLA. Since only about 25 percent of transplants can be fully matched many needing a kidney have developed antibodies against HLA and these can cause transplant rejection. Patients with preformed HLA antibodies wait longer or cannot receive a kidney. \n\nAIT has been pioneered making it possible to reduce levels of antibody before surgery and transplant 'mismatched' patients. More than 40 percent of kidneys are however still rejected. This is because complete elimination of antibodies is not possible. Types of harmful antibodies and levels to which they must be reduced are also not known. Traditional clinical studies utilise standard statistical analysis that requires very large number of participants and have until now failed to predict kidney rejection. The project will therefore employ an alternative approach that combines statistical analysis with the development of novel methods of dynamic patterns analysis. \n\nThe human immunological reaction to kidney transplantation will be modelled in the framework of non-linear stochastic systems approaches followed by their translation into clinical context via following objectives: (1) to develop an appropriate methodology and subsequently analyse dynamic and static properties of antibody evolution in AIT (2) to provide the most informative data processing tool for antibody risk assessment (3) to create a rigorous foundation for a comprehensive data source based on the available research data. The research aims to address the following clinical questions: (a) what types of preformed HLA antibodies are most harmful and associated with significant risk of kidney rejection; (b) what are critical levels of preformed antibodies at the time of surgery i.e. how much of the antibodies can be tolerated to ensure safe acceptance of the donor kidney? \n\nThis engineering and primarily non-medical strategy has not been attempted before. The strength of this project lies in its translational aspect from areas of maths/engineering to tackling medical challenges thus strengthening the cross-disciplinary Biomedical Engineering interface. This is concomitant with the unique clinical data set available for the project. The key aspect of the data concerns the patients being sampled daily in the critical first 3-4 weeks following transplantation when antibody levels change rapidly thus capturing key events in the behaviour of antibodies. This is the only programme anywhere in the world to have carried out with such level of antibody monitoring.\n\nFor the long term perspective, the project outputs will bring significant clinical benefits through an in-depth understanding of the humoral immune response in AIT. Also, this will improve risk management of transplants and the provision of access to transplantation for many untransplantable patients. The database created will consolidate research activities in this emerging field and advance outputs of the research of national and international significance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K02504X/1","grantId":"EP/K02504X/1","fundValue":"98763","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-03","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Natasha  Khovanova","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" It is known that donor specific antibodies (DSA) represent a risk factor for early transplant rejection and influence allograft survival times. The aim of this research was to investigate the role of all DSA IgG subclasses (1-4) in the immune response in order to identify any potentially damaging antibodies and their influence on short and long postoperative outcome. 77 transplanted samples were available for analysis. \n\n1) We have demonstrated that IgG4 subclass was predictive of acute antibody mediated rejection (p=0.003) in the early post-transplant period. Long term graft survival times were also affected by the increased presence of the IgG4 subclass in pre-transplant samples: graft survival was significantly worse in cases with pre-transplant IgG4 positive compared to cases with negative IgG4 (p = 0.004). These results highlight a clear link between the presence of IgG4 subclass in serum before transplantation and unwanted postoperative outcomes such as acute antibody mediated rejection and long term graft failure. Therefore, IgG4 can be additional biomarker that could be used to risk stratify kidney transplant recipients.\n\n2) We have developed a novel application of classification Decision Trees (DTs) for prediction of acute antibody mediated kidney transplant rejection. In the dynamic field of renal transplantation the vast potential of DTs is not sufficiently explored due to costly experiments, underlying complexity and uncertainty over causality in the data. We demonstrated that the DT approach can successfully identify the optimal hierarchy of principal parameters associated with the early graft rejection for risk assessment preceding transplantation.\nThe novel DT model provides accurate predictions for kidney transplant rejections, whilst simultaneously estimating the highest risk factors and the specific antibody subclass levels associated with the increased risk of rejection in the early post-transplant period. In engineering: novel methodology has been developed to assess risk factors for medical applications with small and wide data sets. \n \nIn clinical practice for pre-transplant antibody risk assessment: IgG4 can be additional biomarker for risk stratify kidney transplant recipients.
