{"id":"D75561CA-DCFB-42AC-BB3E-FF55F9E48335","title":"3D Detectors for Synchrotron Applications","abstractText":"The 560m circumference third generation synchrotron light source known as Diamond is currently under construction on the Chilton/Harwell science campus in Oxfordshire. This device will provide an unparalleled facility in the UK for the X-ray diffraction, spectroscopy and microscopy investigation of biological and chemical materials.The facility will eventually have approximately 30 experimental stations for material investigation. Existing detector technologies are insufficient to cover the wide range of applications. This grant application primarily focuses on an instrument for the powder diffraction station. The development of technology for this station is the highest priority for the Diamond detector group, although we note that technologies related to those under study here will also have potential applications on a number of other beam-lines.The Glasgow group has already started development of a novel 3D Detector technology in which thousands of holes are made through a semiconductor (here silicon) wafer. This technology has significant advantages over conventional planar technologies for synchrotron and other applications: the 3D devices are edgeless (they are active to 10 microns from the cut edge); the 3D pixels are self-shielding preventing charge sharing and improving energy resolution capabilities; the devices have a linear response over a large dynamic range; the fast pulse developments make the device intrinsically radiation hard. The aim of this project is to design and fabricate a viable prototype sensor integrating existing readout electronics. At the end of this three year project a prototype devise will be tested at Diamond and the technology will be sufficiently mature to transfer to industry for the build phase of this project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D014573/1","grantId":"EP/D014573/1","fundValue":"125436","fundStart":"2006-05-02","fundEnd":"2009-05-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher John Parkes","coPersons":["Victoria Anne Wright"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
