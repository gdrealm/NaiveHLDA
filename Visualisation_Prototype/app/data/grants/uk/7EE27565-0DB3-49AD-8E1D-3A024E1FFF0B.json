Mankind has learnt to exploit many of these natural compounds, not least those that act as antibiotics. One class of compounds, the polyketides, are of great importance because they include many molecules with a great diversity of structures which cover a whole range of useful activities - not just antibacterials, but also antifungals, anticancer and anticholesterol agents, to name just a few. Typically, the molecular 'backbones' of these compounds are made by joining simple building blocks on an assembly line, each building block being added by a separate 'module' that also processes the new segment to one of a number (normally three) of modifications (known as the Type I PKS pathway). The resulting molecular chain can be of different lengths and combinations of modifications and can then be decorated with different side chains to produce a unique product ('tailoring'). However, an increasing number of atypical pathways are being uncovered that appear to use additional mechanisms not yet defined. These provide ways of producing new structures in a controlled way. One such pathway, found in Pseudomonas fluorescens, synthesises the clinically important antibiotic mupirocin. It is most active against Gram positive bacteria and is particularly used against MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus), one of the most dangerous 'superbugs'. Biosynthesis of mupirocin involves an atypical Type I PKS along with a large number of 'tailoring' enzymes some of which we have discovered act in tandem with the PKS in building the backbone of mupirocin. This is in contrast to typical type I PKS modules which within themselves contain all the information needed to build the backbone. This project integrates microbial molecular genetics, biochemistry and chemistry to study the biosynthetic machinery both in living cells and with purified enzymes to understand the role of the different PKS and 'tailoring' components in building the final active product. It will explore the reactions carried out by different parts of the pathway and their flexibility to produce new compounds. These will be made available for screening for new biological activities that may be of use as prophylactic or therapeutic agents.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E021611/1","grantId":"BB/E021611/1","fundValue":"430344","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Thomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" We sequenced the genome of the bacterium producing thiomarinol and identified all of the genes for thiomarinol biosynthesis, demonstrating that there are independent pathways to the antibiotics marinolic acid (an analogue of mupirocin) and a pyrrothine analogue of holomycin, plus a gene that joins these together.\n\n\n\nWe demonstrated that thiomarinol can overcome the mupirocin resistance in Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and that mutants of the thiomarinol producer can add holomycin to mupirocin, allowing it also to overcome this resistance. This opens the way to using mutasynthesis to generate new, more potent hybrid molecules that could be used against other resistant bacteria.\n\n\n\nWe made significant progress in defining the steps of the mupirocin biosynthetic pathway to underpin manipulation and exploitation. We identified the gene responsible for the epoxide ring and showed that over-production of mupU eliminates pseudomonic acid B production, allowing fine tuning of composition of the final antibiotic mixture. We hope this research will lead to the development of new and useful bioactive compounds. We are exploring possible collaborations with manufacturers of mupirocin to identify collaboration to increase production or modify production.
