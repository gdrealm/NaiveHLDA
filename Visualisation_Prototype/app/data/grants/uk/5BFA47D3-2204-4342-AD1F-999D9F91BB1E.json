{"id":"5BFA47D3-2204-4342-AD1F-999D9F91BB1E","title":"Supercomputer support for the Astrophysics Group at the University of Exeter","abstractText":"The Astrophysics Group in the School of Physics at the University of Exeter urgently requires access to supercomputer time in order to conduct its numerical research. This research includes magnetohydrodynamical and radiation hydrodynamical modelling of star and planet formation and the interstellar medium and radiative transfer modelling of young stars and protoplanetary discs. In this application, we request STFC funding to purchase three years of computing resource on the Exeter supercomputer. We believe that providing funding for access charges to Exeter's local machine is the most cost-effective and rapid way for STFC to provide the Astrophysics Group with the supercomputer access and programming support it requires.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H008535/1","grantId":"ST/H008535/1","fundValue":"190629","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Findings were published in refereed journal papers.
