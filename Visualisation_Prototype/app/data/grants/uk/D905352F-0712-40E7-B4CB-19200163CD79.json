This has been complemented by an extensive experimental programme, notably in manufacture of novel fibres and degradable composites and in development and optimisation of automated carbon fibre preforming technologies. Models at fibre scale have developed understanding of degradation for medical implants, mechanics of dry and impregnated tows, and influence of thermal and chemical shrinkage on residual stresses in thermoset composites. RVE models have enabled engineering science models for textile mechanics, fluid permeability, and elastic and failure behaviour for textile composites.Given the above, we propose to implement a multi-scale modelling approach for polymer composites, encompassing models at fibre tow, unit cell (RVE), laminate and component scales. The same philosophy that we have used successfully at the RVE scale, encompassed in the TexGen schema, will be applied - encompassing the critical engineering science within a user-friendly and flexible software environment, made publicly available where commercial considerations allow. For example one crucial area where this will be applied is in yarn/tow modelling, where we need to develop a schema representing fibre arrangements, incorporating statistical information for fibre paths. This will be an essential building block in the modelling strategy, and will be the focus of one of the Research Fellows.The strategy will be underpinned by an extensive experimental programme, validating the models and developing new processing technologies for our target application areas. We do NOT aim primarily to model standard materials or processes with high technology readiness levels; rather we aim to utilise our unique modelling capabilities and understanding to develop exciting new directions. This approach will be applied across our research portfolio, concentrating on:- automated manufacturing and processing- mechanical and physical performance- medical materials- technical textiles","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F02911X/1","grantId":"EP/F02911X/1","fundValue":"842601","fundStart":"2009-04-15","fundEnd":"2013-04-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our TexGen textile modelling software underpins the modelling and analysis of the behaviour of textile composites and technical textiles.

Our textile modelling software, TexGen, has been developed to a stage where it now facilitates &amp;amp;quot;virtual testing&amp;amp;quot;, i.e.. it forms the basis for predictions of manufacturing and mechanical behaviour which are accurate enough to use instead of experiments in many cases.\n2. TexGen is available as open source software (see URL below) and has been downloaded over 17000 times. This has resulted in a number of collaborations within the UK and internationally.\n3. Supported by our Platform Grant we initiated a programme of simulation studies which, for the first time, demonstrated the effects of materials variability on the manufacturing process. \n4. Our work on permeability characterisation resulted in international collaboration within a benchmarking exorcise, which over time should lead to standardisation of this test method. As stated above TexGen has been downloaded extensively and is used by academic and industrial groups around the world. This led to collaborative research with a German textiles company, and a UK company manufacturing fabric conditioners, both of which can be attributed to their downloading of the software. \nWork on permeability measurement and flow modelling underpins research and consultancy projects with industry, and most recently forms the focus of a KTP with Formax, a local textiles manufacturer.
