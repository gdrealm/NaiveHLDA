Research shows that ensemble performance participation raises self-confidence in children and adults. However ensemble music-making grinds to a halt when non-music readers participate - with the result that they feel excluded. Can a system be developed which integrates them? \n\nA vast library of ensemble music exists in infinite archive form: http://imslp.org/ (International Music Score Library Project - 295,000 scores at 21/11/14). This offers everyone the chance to play many culturally valued pieces of ensemble and orchestral music because parts are typically available alongside scores. However these files are often scans of 19th century and 20th century editions, and therefore static, and of variable quality. Could critical and curatorial approaches, including careful preparation of files in a more suitable format (e.g. MIDI) drive a networked music notation system suitable for a wide range of users? And thereby interface between the infinite library resource of the online music score library project, and the real-world possibility of ensemble performance for newcomers to participatory music, facilitated by networking technology?\n\nLibraries such as imslp.org increasingly represent to the public the body of historical and contemporary notated music available to live music ensembles. New beneficiaries of ensemble music through active computer networking in live ensemble performance contexts could be many and multiple, ranging from school children to adult amateurs to people engaging in music therapeutic treatments or recovering from an experience of isolation. On our advisory group we will have representatives from Education (the head of Brighton &amp; Hove Music Service), Health (the research lead from Intensive Care Medicine Research, Brighton and Hove), Cultural organisations (the head of the Brighton Science Festival) and Arts Policy (the learning producer from the Arts Council funded organisation Sound and Music). In addition we will have academic experts in public engagement and digital material culture.\n\nIn the first instance we will create a system which dynamically updates to indicate current position in the score. This could be conductor-led (with a 'smart baton' counting beats and so updating position in score) or computer controlled, in the case that a conductor was not available. The scores for orchestral members would be networked and either digitally presented and highlighted on a tablet, or paper scores augmented with digitally controlled LEDs. Once we have a system which can synchronise networked information, then we will also be interested in how this could support other forms of notation for ensemble performance.\n\nDuring the pilot, we will consider questions about the legibility of tablet displays; the flexibility and future-proof status of the underpinning software; and possible approaches to music notation digital networking that do not involve screens. We will explore how effective technologies can be in bringing mixed ability musicians and complete beginners together. \n\nThis work may have exciting implications for non-classical ensembles where synchronised notations could be productive in group work and musical forms requiring coordination hand in hand with creative flexibility in tempos and/or transpositions (e.g. electric guitar ensembles, concert bands, laptop orchestras). \n\nThrough this practice project, using Arts and Humanities critical and collaborative approaches, the project team and the advisory group will meet regularly to debate, scope and prepare the ground for a larger project on the future relationship between networked ensemble performance and online infinite archives of notated music, such as imslp.org, by creating a prototype with school children as initial subjects and then publicly debating its potential wider applications with a range of interested parties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M010120/1","grantId":"AH/M010120/1","fundValue":"39386","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward Dudley Hughes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
