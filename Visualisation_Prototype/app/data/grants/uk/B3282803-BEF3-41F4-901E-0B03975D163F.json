This behaviour - imitation - is important for social interaction and learning new skills, but it can also have undesirable effects, for example copying antisocial behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>Imitation is thought to rely on &quot;mirror&quot; neurons, which are cells in the brain that are active when we perform an action and also when we see someone else perform the same action. This research project investigates both imitation behaviour and the responses of mirror neuron areas in the brain, using behavioural and neuroscientific methods (functional magnetic resonance imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation). The project has two aims:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>is to understand how we acquire the ability to imitate other people</li>\n\n <li>is to investigate how the brain controls imitative behaviour, and how the ability to control imitation is affected by context - for example, when people feel part of a social group.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The outcomes of the research could help design training methods for people who have trouble imitating (such as people with autism), or to improve imitation learning of skills, sports, or dance. It also has implications for understanding - and perhaps for influencing - people's imitative behaviour in group situations. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00140X/1","grantId":"ES/K00140X/1","fundValue":"171867","fundStart":"2012-12-21","fundEnd":"2014-12-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline  Catmur","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
