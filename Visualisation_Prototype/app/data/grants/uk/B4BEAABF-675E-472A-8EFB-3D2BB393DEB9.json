In this project we will exploit new techniques and instrumentation for time-of-flight neutron scattering with position-sensitive detectors at the ISIS Facility. This proposal is timed to coincide with the completion of the MERLIN and LET spectrometers, the latter on the new ISIS-TS2 facility. The ability of these instruments to measure complete maps of spin excitation spectra will make possible experiments that cannot be done at present, so there is an exciting opportunity in the next few years to make significant advances in the field.The award will provide a project student with a thorough grounding in experimental techniques to investigate interacting-electron phenomena and will train the student in the necessary skills and knowledge required to become a next generation user of neutron scattering facilities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F020694/1","grantId":"EP/F020694/1","fundValue":"124868","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been reported to the academic community.

For instance, in one family of manganese oxide compounds the application of a magnetic field can change the state of the material from an insulator to a metal, an effect known as colossal magnetoresistance, while in another family the application of a magnetic field induces an electric polarization, and vice versa. These and other recently discovered phenomena can be traced back to collective behaviour of the electrons in the material: the electrons organise themselves so that a small external stimulus can produce a large response.\n\nThere are still many unanswered questions about the microscopic mechanisms behind collective phenomena in magnetic materials, and one of the most direct ways of tackling these problems is to investigate the atomic-scale dynamics by neutron spectroscopy. In this project we carried out a programme of neutron and X-ray scattering experiments at Research Council facilities (ISIS, Diamond, ILL, ESRF) to investigate three different topical problems in manganese oxide compounds.\n\n\n\n1. We performed elastic and inelastic neutron scattering at the ISIS Facility in collaboration with Prof. T.G. Perring to measure the spin-wave spectrum in a half-doped manganate PSCMO. The data were analysed critically using sophisticated software to fold the spectrometer resolution with a theoretical model. We compared the results with two competing theories for the electronic ground state in half-doped manganates and showed that one of them (the Zener polaron model) could be ruled out. The results are consistent with the other (Goodenough) model, and based on other considerations we proposed an improvement to this model. The results of this study have been submitted for publication.\n\n2. We used X-ray resonant magnetic scattering to investigate the magnetic order of the Dy and Mn ions in the multiferroic DyMn2O5. This material displays a relatively strong magnetoelastic coupling for a so-called improper ferroelectric. We obtained a clear description of the magnetic structures in this material and found the moment direction to differ from that in other members of the same family, a feature which may be significant to the magnetoelastic mechanism.\n\n3. We studied the magnetic moment distribution in another half-doped manganate LSMO by polarised-neutron diffraction. Theory has predicted the existence of a significant magnetic moment on the oxygen atoms in this material due to electron delocalisation from the manganese 3d orbitals. Good quality data were obtained and the results are currently being compared with theoretical predictions. The findings consolidate theoretical models for the systems studied, providing a better understanding of these types of materials which can be applied to other systems. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
