Plant growth is important not just to farmers and foresters, and the consumers that they supply, but is also now understood to play a critical role in the global carbon cycle, and to affect the climate of our planet. Recent advances have identified the components and workings of the photosynthetic machinery in leaves and many of the genes that control the timing of plant activity, together with tools for monitoring gene activity in the laboratory. By combining these advances, we have shown that the synchronization of biological activity in plants (circadian rhythms) with external day-night cycles confers a growth and survival advantage. This result provides the first evidence of an advantage to daily plant growth arising from rhythmic behaviour; existing models of plant growth cannot account for this behaviour and are thus inadequate. Plant rhythms are synchronised to the day/night cycle, and the principles involved are very similar to the synchronisation of the human body clock that enables travellers to overcome jet lag, and that can be difficult for shift workers to achieve. Our goal now is to determine how this synchronisation works at the level of the clock genes, through a series of experiments and linked modelling studies. Previous studies in my lab and others have identified the relevant clock genes and the photoreceptor pathways involved. Both are complex. My lab has recently proposed the first mathematical models of the plant clock, which allow the many interacting parts to be simulated in a computer. The model led us to new experiments, identifying an additional part of the clock network. This was a first for plant science and is still a rare achievement in any organism, despite a wave of interest in the 'systems biology' approach that often aims to make this type of prediction. We have since developed an extended model that is even more realistic (so far as we know it's the best available anywhere) though it still simplifies or leaves out a lot of our current molecular knowledge. Fascinatingly, the new model very much resembles current models of the clocks in animal brains, despite the fact that those clocks involve connected neurones whereas our model occurs within a single plant cell. We now wish to understand how plants and animals both synchronise their clocks to the day/night cycle, despite the differences in the clock mechanisms. A major part of this proposal is based on our models, testing the effect of light on the clock genes much more carefully than before, and using these data to refine the models. We propose to use a new experimental method to get much finer data than before. This method has been proven to work but has not been extensively tested, nevertheless it is in an area of experiments that we know very well, it promises major benefits that will be useful for many other plant researchers and it will keep us ahead of our competitors. We also propose to extend the types of experiment that have proved reliable in the past. On the modelling side, we will also use new technology, part of it mathematical, part of it exploiting a very fast computer that is available to us through the Physics department in Edinburgh. If this work is successful, it will provide an example for other labs to follow, to understand other complex gene networks with multiple input signals / these are the types of network that control cancer, diabetes and other complex diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E015263/1","grantId":"BB/E015263/1","fundValue":"678040","fundStart":"2007-03-12","fundEnd":"2010-09-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The academic publications arising from this award have been used by other researchers, sufficiently to warrant citation in their own publications:\n\nPokhilko et al.

This was the first test of molecular data from such detailed environmental manipulations against any in vivo clock model. It also stretched the limits of the experimental methods, and the models. Edwards et al. MSB 2010. \n\nWe developed a new clock model that explained the major discrepancy between the original models and the new data. The new model predicted a molecular interaction that was independently verified in our group and by a group in Japan. It also explained why one clock function is performed by a gene family (the five PRRs), not a single gene. Pokhilko et al. MSB 2010.\n\nWorking with a biotechnology company, Mendel Biotechnology Inc., we undertook a systems biology project on two crucial plant proteins, transcription factors that are degraded by light. Company scientists did experiments, we created a mathematical model (Pokhilko et al. J. Theor. Biol. 2011). \n\nWe also discovered that a clock gene, ELF3, that was identified several years ago is a repressor, not an activator as first thought: Dixon et al. Curr. Biol. 2011. This insight in turn led to a further revision of the clock gene circuit and together with the light-regulated degradation model, to a new clock model: Pokhilko et al. MSB 2012. Homologues of these clock genes are important in flowering time in crops (e.g. ELF3 in barley) and are likely to control seasonal physiology in many plants.
