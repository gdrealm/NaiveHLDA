Current field-based mapping methods produce very limited datasets which result in significant gaps in structural information with consequent severe effects on the accuracy of geological interpretation. A wide range of remote mapping methods, at a variety of spatial scales, have previously been implemented to resolve geological composition and structure of onshore hydrocarbon basins with limited success. These remote mapping approaches have used a reflectance-based approach covering the entire solar spectrum (VNIR to SWIR). Reflectance-based approaches have a fundamental limitation in that most of the key mineralogical types found in igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, e.g. chain and sheet silicates, are not identifiable at these wavelengths. \n\nA NERC-funded project, awarded to the applicant, has developed a highly novel, instrument capable of acquiring high spectral resolution remote sensing imagery covering the thermal waverange. This instrument (the MicroFTS) is lightweight, rugged and low-cost enabling it to be deployable in the field on an operational basis. The instrument also has the capability of being mounted in a variety of observation configurations (ground, UAV, aircraft) providing the potential for practical application in a range of fields apart from geology including agriculture, environmental monitoring and civil engineering. The high spectral resolution of the imagery enables a range of key physical parameters to be retrieved remotely directly from the imagery including surface temperature and composition and atmospheric composition. \n\nEmission spectra, covering the thermal waverange, have a number of significant advantages over reflectance spectroscopy including the capability to identify (i) a wide range of minerals not detectable in reflectance spectra; (ii) variations in rock fabric and bulk chemistry and (iii) petrological level mineralogical information. These capabilities enable individual stratum to be classified into specific sedimentological facies and diagenetic types using their diagnostic emission spectral profiles. These classification approaches could enable a high level of sedimentary analysis to be automatically implemented at high spatial resolution, over continuous areas from site-to-basin scales. The ability to automatically resolve individual stratum and stratigraphic sections in borehole cores and outcrops at site-to-basin scales would provide a means of correlating stratum across entire basins enabling sequence stratigraphic analysis and key structural data such as fault throw to be determined and incorporated into geospatial models. These new remote observational datasets would not only provide a significant increase in the amount but also produce new types of observational datasets of the key compositional and structural information required by sedimentary petrologists and basin analysts. At the site scale continuous, complete coverage of compositional and structural features, even across inaccessible localities such as quarry walls, would be a significant new data resource. At the landscape scale the increase in the volume, the improvement in the spatial distribution and the continuous nature of the coverage would be equally as important. These new compositional and structural observational datasets would provide a means of significantly improving the accuracy of analysis of hydrocarbon basins at a fraction of the cost of the overall project budget at locations anywhere in the world. The potential market for the proposed methodology is extensive, global and the industry uptake is likely to be significant and immediate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N007948/1","grantId":"NE/N007948/1","fundValue":"10014","fundStart":"2015-08-24","fundEnd":"2015-10-23","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Ferrier","coPersons":["Douglas Alan Paton","Alwyn Hugh  Mortimer"],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
