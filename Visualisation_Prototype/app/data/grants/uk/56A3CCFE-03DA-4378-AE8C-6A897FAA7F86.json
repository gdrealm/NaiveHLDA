This project proposes to use design as a kind of Trojan Horse to 'smuggle' QM approaches into areas where UGs have traditionally found the use of statistics difficult and unappealing. Our initial pilot work at the University of Birmingham suggested that students can more easily appreciate complex aspects of design (with a subsequent comparison of means for example) than a complex post hoc analysis, and that the former leads to greater willingness to tackle the latter. The project has aimed to develop template teaching materials, using design as a basis; explain the proposed approach to a wide circle of methods trainers and student representatives; enthuse them, and together convert the templates into useable teaching resources for many specific areas of social science; trial and adapt them, and then make them widely and sustainably available for QM teachers across the UK. \nJuly - October 2012: Meta-synthesis\nA meta-synthesis of the focused discussion has been developed as an outcome of the Phase I. This document includes the barriers in the learning and teaching of research design and QM as\n4\nreported by the teachers. The development of these points is based on the group work by the participant teachers. The task was to discuss and present their main difficulties in learning and teaching of research design and QM.\nIn each of the workshop the groups were divided among experienced teachers/ researchers, new teachers/ researchers and PhD students. These three groups brought their varied experiences and through discussions amongst each other they were able to address the barriers in successful teaching of research design and QM.\nThe meta-synthesis given below illustrates the reported barriers and difficulties according the frequency of issues mentioned. This highlights the aims of Phase I of the project in the end of which we have achieved a substantial amount of information to develop an action plan that includes trials of simple teaching methods and assessment of teaching/learning techniques and resources.\n1. Teachers/trainers: Variability, diversity in teachers/trainers: confidence, expertise and experience in teaching/training/supervising; decisions about: mode of delivery of teaching in quantitative methods ('off the peg' or bespoke); problem-based learning or not; specifics (e.g., NHST or effect sizes); 'faulty' teaching, particularly in relation to statistics; - randomness, population data, sample sizes, research designs all are taught with varied ideas and often wrong information; FEAR - inexperience, lack of knowledge, lack of support from colleagues; unexciting teaching; teachers confuse data collection methods and research design; the examples used for teaching QM are often irrelevant to group of targeted students or from an insufficient range of designs; presentation of quantitative data is often complex and inaccessible to understand; real life examples are not included (enquiry and interpretation - use of 'real' examples and 'real' analysis - makes it exciting); presentation of quantitative data is often complex and inaccessible to understand; generalist versus specialist statistics [20]\n2. Curricular/course/module pressures: Teaching and practice of QM is not sufficient according to the available time: too much to cover; small amount of time to teach a great deal; courses too full; curriculum design issues; courses isolated and disjointed; titles of modules and courses should have appeal for novice researchers or beginners; quantitative 'methods' (design, statistics) teaching divorced from content teaching: teachers/trainers; structure; modules; assignments; time for teaching QM is very limited and often not repeated in the complete syllabus; ancient inherited teaching materials and quality control across modules [9]\n3. Research questions and design: Research questions not the starting point of research; the discussions about research topics instantly skip the development of research questions. The common mistake is to pick random methods with less thought on the nature of research questions; teachers confuse data collection methods and research design; teachers' perceptions about methods are passed on to students; supervisors become barriers to students learning experiences; supervisors - relationship with research methods trainers; lack of integration of 'stats' with 'design'; 'quantitative'/'qualitative' divide: methods bias (institutions, teachers/trainers; students; disciplines; traditions; teaching/training); Stats 'in a box; how to focus on high level concepts (design) rather than on 'stats'; Focus on research design - not separate 'qual'/'quant' [8]\n4. Students: Variability, diversity in students: interests; learning styles; prior knowledge (particularly in statistics); perceptions about statistics and QM.; expectations and goals; motivations; engagement (lack of early engagement); FEAR - of numbers - unfamiliarity, irrelevance, technical barriers, lack of motivation, prior perceptions and knowledge [7]\n5. Resources: Journals and journal articles: Lack of knowledge and practice to read research articles; better resources (text books; journals) needed; access to accurate and simplified knowledge.\nabout\n5\nQM is not widely available; readability of journal articles; journal articles - 'quant' methods not transparent, not accessible [6]\n6. Terminology and language: Students' difficulties in understanding; language barriers; language/terminology daunting and complicated [3]\nCardiff (Cardiff Workshop addressed the barriers and desired solutions of the problems)\n7. Standards: There are no set standards of Research Design modules across all social science disciplines. There is an essential need to validate Research Design courses by higher educational councils that must ensure the main elements of research design techniques.\n8. Dichotomies: Method presented, taught and 'evangelised' to students as divided between qualitative and quantitative. These adverse dichotomies of QM should be discouraged through writing journals and training of researchers/ teachers.\n9. Have the students design their own study in Year 1. They would develop a research question and then a design which best answers that question, choosing from among available methodologies without labelling those approaches as either quantitative or qualitative. This allow the question to lead the design without the student making choices based on value judgements of qualitative or quantitative being intrinsically better or worse than each other, but simply better fitted for gathering and analysing different types of data.\n10. Encouraging critical thinking by introducing a consideration of research methods in other content areas. For example, when talking about evidence in a social psychology class, including an evaluation of the methods would highlight both good and bad practice for students and model an understanding of the strengths and limitations of different methods and analyses.\nUniversities\nUniversity staff are in a position to both model and teach good research practice, and so there are several actions which could improve both practice and the teaching of undergraduates.\n1. Staff should receive on-going training to enable them to integrate better practice into their teaching and curriculum(for example, points 1 and 2 above).\n2. Departments could scrutinise course materials and text books to ensure they adhere to a high standard in their explanation of research methods. They could also identify gaps in publishers' lists relating to areas such as research design to encourage more attention and writing in these areas.\n3. Highlight and reward positive examples of good practice to encourage a higher degree of academic honesty and integrity.\n4. Increase the value and profile of the teaching of research methods by making it part of funding conditions, REF and validation, to make sure cutting edge researchers are involved in teaching undergraduate research methods so that senior, experienced leaders are passing on their expertise to future researchers.\n5. Reduce the artificial divide between qualitative and quantitative methods in the minds university staff and researchers through renaming courses, training, and departmental discussion. Done properly, both methods should be of equal value and rigour.\nThe culture and practices of the wider research community also need to be challenged if better practice is to become a reality. Journals demand particular statistical analyses, and the need to be published and the demands of editors in turn affect the attitudes and practices of researchers, who develop their study designs and analyses with publication in mind. Changes in this culture.\ncould be achieved by:\n1. Letter-writing campaigns could target both poor practice and the divide between different methods, such as qualitative and quantitative, and be directed to both professional and government bodies as well as the editors of journals who publish studies with faulty statistics and design.\n6\n2. Publishing papers or other media (such as blogs and social media) which highlight good practice and the consequences of basing public policy on problematic research, in the way that authors such as Ben Goldacre do for medical science. -To be used by teachers and researchers\n-To be used by HE policy makers Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education","dataset":"gtr"}
