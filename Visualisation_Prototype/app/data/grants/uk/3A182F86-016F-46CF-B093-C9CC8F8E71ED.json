There are strong cultural beliefs that the pursuit of materialistic values - money, fame, material goods - leads to a happy, satisfied life. Yet, the research literature provides theories and evidence to the contrary: strong endorsement of materialistic values is linked to lower well-being. Materialistic individuals have lower personal well-being, are less likely to engage with community/environmentally friendly activities, suffer more dysfunctional consumer behaviours, and have less positive personal and social relationships. There is also recent evidence that materialism may lead children to perform less well in school.</p>\n\n<p>This existing, large research literature needs systematic evaluation through meta-analysis, a higher-order form of data analysis that assesses the link between materialism and well-being across all studies containing relevant, quantifiable measures. It provides a systematic assessment of the actual strength of this relationship. Second, it investigates the link with different dimensions of well-being not examined together previously: personal, environmental/community, financial, interpersonal, and performance. Finally, it assesses factors that increase, diminish, or help explain the strength of the materialism-well-being link.</p>\n\n<p>Given low well-being, environmental degradation, and economic difficulties, this analysis helps identify avenues for intervention and positive change.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H036547/1","grantId":"ES/H036547/1","fundValue":"38110","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helga Elfriede Dittmar","coPersons":["Roderick Andrew Bond"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
