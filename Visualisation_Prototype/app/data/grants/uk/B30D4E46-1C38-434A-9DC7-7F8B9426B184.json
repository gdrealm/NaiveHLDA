This work will examine the heat use within three key stages of the baking process (i) proving (where dough is conditioned) (ii) baking in continuous ovens where dough enters on a conveyor and exits as baked product (iii) cooling where the bread is reduced in temperature over a period of 2 hours. This information will be used to guide a study where the potential for (a) reduction and (b) re-use of heat will be assessed. This will be through a two-pronged approach. Firstly a study will be made to retro-fit existing installations for heat recovery and reduction, for example using a 'heat exchanger' to capture waste heat in one part of the process and use it in another. The second approach will be to make a detailed study of the exact conditions within the oven using experimental measurement and computational predictions. The aim here is to establish the baseline conditions for baking, and then determine enhanced equipment setup and designs. The results of this work in the short-to-medium term will be optimised process lines, in the longer term it will guide future design work of ovens and offer better competitiveness to UK industries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G058504/1","grantId":"EP/G058504/1","fundValue":"466597","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nikil  Kapur","coPersons":["Vassili  Toropov","Malcolm  Lawes","Harvey  Thompson"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
