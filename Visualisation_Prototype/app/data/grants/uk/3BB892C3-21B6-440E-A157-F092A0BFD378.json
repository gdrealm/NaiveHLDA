These women acquired a role in civil society through providing welfare services and interacting with the public and with local government agencies. The role constitutes an unacknowledged early stage of woman's emancipation from the private domestic sphere. The project also illuminates woman's contribution to philanthropy through establishing lasting institution, enlarges our understanding of emerging public life and civic consciousness in the empire, and adds to current views of the relationship between the state and society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112687/1","grantId":"112687/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-30","fundEnd":"2006-05-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Wendy  Rosslyn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
