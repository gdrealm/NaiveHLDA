This research is aimed at the rational development of molecules that are able to prevent the docking of IgE to its receptor protein on the surface of certain cells, thereby preventing the generation of the harmful inflammatory agents following activation by allergens. The molecules identified as being effective for blocking this key protein-protein binding event are expected to constitute exciting leads for the development of anti-allergic drugs. Moreover, since related protein-protein binding events are widespread in human disease processes, an increased level of understanding of the manner in which these interactions can be disrupted is likely to be of significant therapeutic value in many areas of medicine and healthcare.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601116","grantId":"G0601116","fundValue":"670095","fundStart":"2007-08-13","fundEnd":"2011-03-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Spivey","coPersons":["Andrew J Beavil","Brian John Sutton","Robin John Leatherbarrow"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
