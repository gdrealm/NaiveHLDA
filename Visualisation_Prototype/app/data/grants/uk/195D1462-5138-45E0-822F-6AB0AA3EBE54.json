The research will examine the pre-history of ITV and place the development of the commercial channel in the context of wider debates surrounding the representation of Wales on screen, national identity and nationalism and television and the Welsh language. Whilst some of these issues have been debated in the past, this research will ground the debates firmly in empirical data generated by a throrough and systematic study of a range of sources.\\n\\nThroughout its history, ITV pioneered with its output, particularly in the area of Welsh-language programmes. In 1958, Television Wales and West (TWW) launched a quiz show in Welsh whilst the ill-fated Wales (West and North) Television/Teledu Cymru company pioneered a comprehensive Welsh-language news service.\\n\\nThe research, therefore, aims to redress an imbalance in terms of media history in which the BBC has 'stolen the limelight'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F004362/1","grantId":"AH/F004362/1","fundValue":"23230","fundStart":"2008-09-24","fundEnd":"2009-01-23","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Public lectures/media interviews at the time of the 50th anniversary of ITV in Wales Creative Economy Cultural","person":"James Lynton Medhurst","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":" A history of ITV in Wales, focusing on the 1950s and 1960s in particular Further work to be done on ITV in Wales from the 1970s onwards, particularly given the decline in fortunes of ITV's regional engagement Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
