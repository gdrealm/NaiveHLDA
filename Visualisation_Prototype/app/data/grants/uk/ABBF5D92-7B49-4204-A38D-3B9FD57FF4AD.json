Lone mothers of children from mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds.","abstractText":"<p>Parents of children from mixed racial or ethnic backgrounds constitute one of the highest lone parent groups in the UK and, like other lone parent families, these are overwhelmingly headed by lone mothers. Such families are often susceptible to negative assumptions and stereotypes, particularly as regards mothers' abilities to raise their children with a strong and healthy sense of self. Yet emerging research suggests it is often attitudes and issues beyond the immediate family environment that are more significant for this family group, particularly regarding their status as 'insiders' or 'outsiders' in the neighbourhoods in which they live. </p>\n\n<p>In collaboration with Single Parent Action Network, this exploratory project seeks insights into the everyday experiences of 30 lone mothers of children from mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds in three differing neighbourhoods in an English city. </p>\n\n<p>Drawing on Census data and in-depth interviews with the mothers, the research will explore how mothers' understandings and negotiations of their children's racialised identities are shaped, supported or challenged by social attitudes to racial or ethnic mixing in their neighbourhoods.</p>\n\n<p>The project also investigates the challenges of conducting research around 'mixedness' generally, particularly regarding the commonalities and specificities of experience across different mixes and circumstances. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3723","grantId":"RES-000-22-3723","fundValue":"80800","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Findings from the project have been used to inform public and practitioner understandings of lone mothers of mixed racial and ethnic children and their families. For example, the findings have fed into a BBC2 Newsnight report on 'Mixed Race Britain' (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15164970) in 2011 and formed the basis of an article published in the journal Adoption and Fostering. In response to the article, the Head of Research at the British Association for Adoption and Fostering recommended that it should be required reading for social workers.

In addition to racial, cultural and ethnic mixing in their own backgrounds, mothers were also diverse in terms of their trajectories and experiences of lone motherhood, their relationships with children's fathers and their families, their social class and employment histories and their approaches to parenting. The diversity of personal histories and experiences of the mothers strongly challenges presumptions made about them and highlights the limitations of essentialised understandings of mixed racial and ethnic families. Certainly, the findings seem to suggest there may be a disparity between the types of support useful to these mothers and the types of support they are sometimes assumed to need. Furthermore, it was clear that the terminology used by the mothers and the children to describe their mixedness and that commonly used by practitioners and policymakers was very different, suggesting further discrepancies between 'lived' and official perspectives. \n\nSecondly, while traditional perspectives on white lone mother mixed racial and ethnic families have tended to assume a lack of what Twine has called 'racial literacy', this was strongly refuted by the majority of the white mothers in this study. Drawing on familial and social networks, as well as their own skills and resources, these mothers mostly worked consciously to impart racial and cultural knowledge to their children to provide them with a sense of identity and belonging, though the ways in which they did this differed. \n\nThirdly, whilst mothers' experiences varied within as well as across neighbourhoods, some experiences and issues appear more specific to residential area. Mothers had very strong feelings about neighbourhood - each neighbourhood in the study was seen to have its own clear social identity, which mothers felt had a significant influence on their and their children's experiences. Mothers across the sample frequently considered choices around residential location and schooling in relation to identity and belonging, though their reasons and opportunity to do so differed. The significance of neighbourhood - amongst other factors - in shaping mothers' everyday experiences is a key part of moving towards a more multi-dimensional understanding of mixed racial and ethnic families. As a small-scale exploratory study, care should be taken to understand the findings as insights rather than generalisations. Nevertheless, these insights are useful for contributing towards scholarly understandings of lone mother mixed racial and ethnic families, as well as those for relevant practitioners and professionals.
