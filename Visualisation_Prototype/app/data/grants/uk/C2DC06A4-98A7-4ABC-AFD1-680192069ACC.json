MODE aims to develop methodologies that look beyond language to allow social scientists to study how people behave and interact in contemporary digital environments. It will provide systematic ways to investigate different forms of communication used in digital environments:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>what people say, write, draw</li>\n\n <li>how they use lay out and navigate through rooms, websites and other spaces,</li>\n\n <li>how they use their hands and other parts of their bodies to interact with computers, devices and other people in face-to-face encounters.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>It will conduct two research projects on how people use new technologies in different digital environments. One research project is located in an operating theatre, where screen technologies are used to look inside people's body cavities, and another one in learning environments where mobile technologies, Geographic Information System technologies and touch screen interactive tables are used to facilitate learning.</p>\n\n<p>Mode will offer a program of innovative research and Training and Capacity Building activities including seminars, lectures, introductory courses and summer schools, and online discussion and support for social scientists from a range of academic disciplines, government, private sector organisations and the public sector.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-576-25-0027","grantId":"RES-576-25-0027","fundValue":"911654","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Carey  Jewitt","coPersons":["Rosie  Flewitt","Jeff  Bezemer","Diane Elizabeth Mavers","Myrrh  Domingo","Sara  Price","Neil  Selwyn","Gunther  Kress","Roger  Kneebone","Andrew Nicholas Burn"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
