It is multi-disciplinary in nature and considers the European context to the area. Its objectives are threefold: to shape the research agenda for the future, to help develop research capacity, and to support the translation of current knowledge into policy and practice. In doing these things, it is hoped that the seminar series will promote the contribution of the social sciences to this important area.\n\nThe seminars will review and discuss six different perspectives each reflecting on the involvement an important stakeholder group. These range from that of the person with cancer, through those of the health care professionals, the employers and their occupational health providers, those involved with legal and insurance matters to those concerned with the labour market and wider economic contexts. The final seminar in this cluster will concern the European perspective. These 6 seminars will be framed by 3 seminars that have been designed to manage the development of the series in terms of the knowledge gained, lessons learned and conclusions arrived at. These development seminars will assure the effective delivery of the seminar series outputs.\n\nThe seminar series will deliver four different outputs in the short to medium term. First, those involved will publish a short series of papers and an edited volume which will capture the content of the seminars; the background, the discussions and the conclusions. Second, it will also produce a series of short Guidance Notes tailored to the needs of the key stakeholder groups. Third, it will build a collaboration towards an application for funding under the Horizon 2020 (Societal Issues) Programme. Finally, as part of this initiative it will establish a development programme for early Career Researchers in this area involving them, as appropriate, in the funding bid and in any subsequent research.\n\nThe importance of the seminar series lies not just in the issue that it addresses but also in the ways that it will shape future research and support the exploitation of current knowledge to better understand and manage the engagement in work of those with cancer. Beyond this, it attempts to secure the future in this area through the development of young researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M00189X/1","grantId":"ES/M00189X/1","fundValue":"29992","fundStart":"2014-11-06","fundEnd":"2017-11-05","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Cox","coPersons":["Heather  Brown","Juliet  Hassard","Philip  Dewe","Sara  Maclennan","James  N'Dow","Luke  Vale","Steven  Heys"],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
