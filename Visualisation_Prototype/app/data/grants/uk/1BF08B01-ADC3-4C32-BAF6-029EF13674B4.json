{"id":"1BF08B01-ADC3-4C32-BAF6-029EF13674B4","title":"Conversations on the Political Economy of Constitutional Change in Scotland","abstractText":"<p>This project will deliver a series of high-level 'conversations' involving social scientists, businesspeople and policymakers in Scotland. The aim is to foster knowledge exchange that uses social science research to inform business and policymaker views in policy debates on constitutional change in Scotland. The focus is on the political economy of constitutional change: the ways in which alternative constitutional choices may impact on economic policy and performance.</p>\n\n<p>This knowledge exchange activity will be designed by a liaison group of academics, businesspeople and policymakers to produce and evidence base, and make possible evidence-based analysis of the economic dimensions of constitutional change in the run-up to the constitutional referendum planned by Scotland's SNP government. We propose dispassionate and non-partisan evidence and analysis that brings together Scotland-specific and UK-wide considerations on the political economy of constitutional change.&nbsp; </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J010685/1","grantId":"ES/J010685/1","fundValue":"46338","fundStart":"2012-05-31","fundEnd":"2013-05-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlie  Jeffery","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
