{"id":"7BB3193D-7A48-4C91-8A4B-A6BF1EE787E9","title":"Devices based on Entanglement in Cold Arrays of Trapped Atoms","abstractText":"Quantum physics involves not only the physics of very small systems, or small amounts of energy, but also subtle correlations between particles and fields which result in entanglement. Creating large-scale arrays of entangled atoms for quantum applications is both highly topical and challenging. Quantum simulations, which involve quantum systems modelling other quantum systems, are just emerging as a powerful new tool of calculation, and yet quantum information processing (QIP) has many unrealized applications. In this context this proposal aims to transform the promising atom chip technology with new tools from quantum optics. We will design methods for entangling large numbers of atoms with applications to desirable and realizable quantum devices: e.g. high precision interferometers, motion sensors, realistic designs for large-scale quantum simulations, and quantum logic modules leading to quantum processors. Tools for controlling and trapping cold atoms in arrays will be formulated - and new designs for micro-structures that trap atoms above micro-fabricated surfaces will be made. After further commercial development the proposed devices have a number of end-user applications including rotation sensing and navigation, mineral and petroleum prospecting, decryption, and searching unsorted lists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I010394/1","grantId":"EP/I010394/1","fundValue":"721174","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Barry  Garraway","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
