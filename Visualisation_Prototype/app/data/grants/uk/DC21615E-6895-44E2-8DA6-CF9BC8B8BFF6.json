{"id":"DC21615E-6895-44E2-8DA6-CF9BC8B8BFF6","title":"C-Cycle","abstractText":"Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and so a major environmental pollutant. Energy production produces vast volumes of the gas that is released in to the atmosphere. While carbon dioxide is taken up by plants and converted into useful chemical building blocks such as sugars, deforestation, increasing urbanisation and an ever increasing demand to energy means that the carbon dioxide cycle is becoming increasingly unbalanced. Furthermore, global oil and gas supplies are decreasing at an alarming rate and these are the feedstocks of the energy and petrochemicals industries.In this project which is located at eight top UK universities, we intend to capture some of the carbon dioxide produced in industrial processes and reconvert it into chemical feedstocks using advanced materials technology and specifically designed catalysts. The aim is to develop a sustainable carbon economy through efficient recycling of waste materials: the C-Cycle. Recent UK government initiatives have placed the emphasis for waste management in the hands of the municipal incinerators (which produce carbon dioxide) with a move away from the environmentally harmful landfill that are used in many regions. Not only will this project directly address UK government policy in waste management, it will take it one step further by producing high value products from the process: as the saying goes where there's muck there's brass! .","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E010601/1","grantId":"EP/E010601/1","fundValue":"88660","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2010-04-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Joseph  Wood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" The adsorption of carbon dioxide and nitrogen on hydrotalcite-like compounds was investigated. Two different powdered hydrotalcites were used containing the cations nickel and iron. The powdered materials were screened for carbon dioxide adsorption using a thermogravimetric method and it was found that NiMgAl hydrotalcite has the largest capacity for CO2, adsorbing 1.58 mmol g-1 at 20 ?C, and highest rate of adsorption of up to 0.17 mmol g-1 min-1. In order to improve the rheological behaviour of hydrotalcite paste for extrusion, hydrotalcite powders were combined with boehmite (70:30 and 50:50 ratios of hydrotalcite: boehmite) before extrusion in to pellets suitable for use in a fixed bed adsorber. These pellets were then re-crushed and further tested by thermogravimetric methods. The effects of temperature, composition and pre-treatment of the hydrotalcites on the adsorption of carbon dioxide and nitrogen are reported. At 20 ?C, the amount of carbon dioxide adsorbed was between 2.0-2.5 mmol g-1 for all the hydrotalcite/alumina samples in this study, although this decayed rapidly with increasing temperature. The results are compared with silica gel as a common sorbent reference, and with literature values. Hydrotalcite/alumina samples have thermal stability and a high adsorption capacity for carbon dioxide over a wide range of temperatures. Adsorption decreases with temperature and data fitting to the mixed gas adsorption data showed selective adsorption of carbon dioxide over nitrogen. The composition of the hydrotalcite/alumina pellets investigated in this study has less effect upon the adsorption behaviour compared with the non-calcined hydrotalcite powder, thus allowing a wide choice of pellet compositions to be used. The work is of interest to power companies such as E.ON and Doosan Babcock. Alta Innovations at the University of Birmingham will assist with patent and technology transfer issues.
