This is likely to reflect the influence of hormones, genetics, diagnostic practice, or all three factors. This program grant tests the first of these by following up children whose mothers had amniocentesis, and where the amniotic fluid tesosterone levels are measured. It tests in both a small British Biobank (linked to 500 children) and in the much larger Danish Biobank (linked to 90,000 children) if foetal testosterone levels are elevated in children who later show more autistic traits, or who go on to receive a diagnosis of autism or Asperger Syndrome. In addition, since amniocentesis samples may not be representative of the general population, we test if foetal testosterone is correlated with newborn testosterone levels measured in blood spots collected at birth, and in saliva at 3 months, since ultimately such tests are less invasive, have less risk, and could be taken from every baby. We also measure neonatal testosterone levels in children later diagnosed with autism. Finally, we test a rare medical condition (AIS) in which males cannot bind foetal testosterone, to test the prediction that such males should have fewer autistic traits than typical males. The range of planned studies will help answer the question as to whether foetal testosterone increases the risk of autistic traits and ASC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600977","grantId":"G0600977","fundValue":"943891","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Baron-Cohen","coPersons":["John  Schwabe"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
