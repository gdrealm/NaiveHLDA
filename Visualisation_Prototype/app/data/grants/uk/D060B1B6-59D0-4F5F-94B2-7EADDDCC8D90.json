{"id":"D060B1B6-59D0-4F5F-94B2-7EADDDCC8D90","title":"WORKSHOP: The future for wave element methods","abstractText":"This proposal addresses algorithms for computational modelling of wave propagation. The finite element and boundary element methods that have become established for these studies are well known to be limited to problems in which the wavelength under consideration is not small in comparison with the problem domain size. For short wavelengths, these methods quickly become inapplicable. There has been much activity in the Engineering and Mathematics research communities over the last decade to develop algorithms that can extend these element-based methods to higher frequencies. One such method involves 'enriching' the elements using various wave functions. The developments have been international and multidisciplinary, with major contributions from France, the United States, Finland, Spain and others, but it is true to say that UK universities have been prominent in the field. These universities include Swansea, Reading, Bath, Southampton (ISVR) and Heriot-Watt as well as Durham.This proposal seeks modest funding for a workshop to be held at Durham, and in which participants discuss the open questions in wave-enriched elements. The aims of the workshop are to form a consortium and to decide upon the form and content of a future proposal requesting funding for a significant collaborative research programme across all the interested research groups.The following researchers have all confirmed their interest in attending the workshop and participating in the proposed consortium bid for future collaborative research funding:Dr. Jon Trevelyan (PI), School of Engineering, University of DurhamProf. Jeremy Astley, Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, University of SouthamptonProf. Simon Chandler-Wilde, Department of Mathematics, University of ReadingDr. Eric Darrigrand, Institut de Recherche Mathmatique, Universit de Rennes, FranceDr. Gwenael Gabard, Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, University of SouthamptonProf. Ivan Graham, Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of BathProf. Oubay Hassan, School of Engineering, University of SwanseaDr. Mick Honnor, School of Engineering, Design and Technology, University of BradfordDr. Tomi Huttunen, Department of Applied Physics, University of Kuopio, FinlandDr. Daan Huybrechs, Department of Computer Science, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, BelgiumDr. Omar Laghrouche, School of the Built Environment, Heriot-Watt UniversityDr. Stephen Langdon, Department of Mathematics, University of ReadingProf. Ken Morgan, School of Engineering, University of SwanseaDr. Emmanuel Perrey-Debain, Universit de Technologie, Compigne, FranceProf. Valery Smyshlyaev, Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H016252/1","grantId":"EP/H016252/1","fundValue":"8137","fundStart":"2009-10-21","fundEnd":"2010-01-20","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  No - this was a grant to hold a workshop bringing together the leading researchers in wave element methods.
