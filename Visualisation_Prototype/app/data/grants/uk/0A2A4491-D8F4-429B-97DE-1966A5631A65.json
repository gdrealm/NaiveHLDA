{"id":"0A2A4491-D8F4-429B-97DE-1966A5631A65","title":"Particle Physics STFC Consolidated Grant 2012","abstractText":"Experimental particle physics addresses some of the fundamental questions about the structure and behaviour of the\nUniverse at the level of the smallest particles of matter, the quarks and the leptons, and the forces acting between them. We are exploring fundamental properties of particles at the the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and also exploring the nature of dark matter by developing and employing novel detection systems.\n\nWe are contributing to the preparation of the ATLAS project at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN that will\nbegin taking data in 2009. We have constructed and commissioned electronic systems and the software that drives them.\nFrom 2009 onwards we will be analysing the data as it becomes available. In particular we will be searching the data for\nevidence of the existence of the Higgs boson, one of the key missing elements of the Standard Model of particle physics\nat present, and for supersymmetric particles and other exotic phenomena, that are expected to exist. We are also\nplanning to understand better the properties of the top quark and the structure of the proton.\nBeneficiaries.\n\nCosmological measurements determine that dark matter makes up five times more of the energy density of the universe than the particles we know of. Although the existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational interactions, it has not yet been directly detected in terrestrial laboratories. Direct detection experiments seek to observe dark matter scattering on target detector nuclei. To explore these fundamental issues, we have set up a new dark matter group to participate in a world-leading dark matter search on DEAP/CLEAN, a liquid Argon detector with unique potential for scaling to multi-tonne masses, and with the DMTPC detector development program to measure the dark matter wind, which can correlate a dark matter-induced recoil signal with the earth's motion through the galactic dark matter halo, distinct from relatively isotropic terrestrial backgrounds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K001264/1","grantId":"ST/K001264/1","fundValue":"1922080","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Glen  Cowan","coPersons":["Jocelyn  Monroe","Tracey Sharon Berry","Pedro  Teixeira-Dias","Veronique  Boisvert","James Algot Nikkel"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
