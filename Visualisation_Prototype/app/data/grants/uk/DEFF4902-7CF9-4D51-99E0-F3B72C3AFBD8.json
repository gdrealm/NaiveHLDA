{"id":"DEFF4902-7CF9-4D51-99E0-F3B72C3AFBD8","title":"Realising Global Rights to Health: An ethnographic analysis of rights-based organisations in promoting reproductive health in India","abstractText":"<p>This research is an empirical and theoretical study of the processes through which global rights to reproductive health are understood and operationalised by state and non-state institutions in India. It will trace the transmission of rights ideas and practices trans-nationally and through to local recipients, producing an analysis of how rights operate within different discursive spaces. It will provide explanations as to how global ideas of women's rights, rights to sexual and reproductive health are translated into local contexts, and as to why certain rights, concepts and practices take root and others do not. </p>\n\n<p>The empirical study will be carried out in Rajasthan, which has amongst the worst reproductive and child health indicators in the country. It will especially focus on rights discourse and practice in three areas: non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the private health sector and in the law. Data will be collected through anthropological field methods including organisational life-histories, focus group discussions, illness narratives as well as interviews. Though based on intensive empirical investigation, the research is primarily an academic and conceptual exercise in evaluating rights discourse and practices as they emerge in these domains. The findings will be used to develop theoretical understandings of rights, and through a close association with NGOs will be used to inform practices of realising rights. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1609","grantId":"RES-062-23-1609","fundValue":"234985","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Maya  Unnithan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
