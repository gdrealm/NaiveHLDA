However the evidence base upon which policy support relies is at best shaky. The idea for this seminar series came from discussion between researchers and social enterprise practitioners concerned at what they saw as a reality gap between the idealised notion of social enterprise presented in academic and policy literature, and the day to struggles of those practising social enterprise.<br /><br />The overall aim of this seminar series therefore is to build an international community of academic researchers, policy makers and practitioners that seek to advance critical research into SE.The broad objectives within this are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>to bring together academics from different disciplines and countries who are researching SE from a critical perspective</li>\n\n <li>to make critical research accessible to and useful for practitioners and policy makers</li>\n\n <li>to engage practitioners and policy makers in developing research</li>\n\n <li>to develop an internationally focused critical research agenda around SE and democratic renewal</li>\n\n <li>to relate the insights derived from our research to Critical Management Studies.</li>\n\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021709/1","grantId":"ES/J021709/1","fundValue":"14887","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alex  Nicholls","coPersons":["Michael Frederick Bull","Simon  Teasdale","Pascal  Dey"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
