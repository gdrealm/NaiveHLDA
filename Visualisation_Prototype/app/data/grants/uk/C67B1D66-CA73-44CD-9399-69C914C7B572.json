{"id":"C67B1D66-CA73-44CD-9399-69C914C7B572","title":"The Reflected Process of a Random Walk","abstractText":"The reflected process of a random walk is the difference between its running maximum and its current value. As such, it is used for modelling in many different application areas, including queues, genetics, and insurance . However the current project addresses some fundamental problems about the reflected process, viewed as a random process in its own right. In particular we are interested in the overshoot of the reflected process over a high level, and specifically wish to establish exactly when this is asymptotically neglible, in comparision with that level.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G002827/1","grantId":"EP/G002827/1","fundValue":"12324","fundStart":"2008-09-04","fundEnd":"2009-01-03","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ronald  Doney","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
