{"id":"B7C0D016-A4B6-4FFD-AE66-FCAFB5D01ADF","title":"Food Marketing Regulation and Childhood Obesity Prevention","abstractText":"<p>Food marketing has been associated with growing rates of obesity, a problem which has taken ‘pandemic’ proportions worldwide and entails heavy social and economic costs. This project aims to achieve a better understanding of the need and constraints involved in regulating food marketing to children as part of effective obesity prevention policies worldwide, and in the UK more specifically.</p>\n\n<p>The Project has three related strands. The Grant Holder will first spend five months at the World Health Organisation in Geneva to help selected states from across the world identify potential barriers to the development and implementation of policies on food marketing to children and find potential solutions. The second part of the Project consists in the organisation of a one-day conference in London which will focus on what the UK should do to fully comply with the WHO Recommendations on food marketing to children.</p>\n\n<p>The Project will conclude with the publication of a monograph intended, first, to capture existing knowledge on food marketing to children and, secondly, to replace practical concerns within a broader theoretical framework to bridge the gap existing in this area between academia and practice.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J020761/1","grantId":"ES/J020761/1","fundValue":"98745","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Amandine  Garde","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
