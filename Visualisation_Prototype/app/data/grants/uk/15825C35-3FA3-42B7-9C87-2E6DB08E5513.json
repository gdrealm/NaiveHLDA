Examples include the machineries that replicate DNA, synthesize proteins and generate energy (ATP). These complexes must be assembled correctly in a controlled way, far from where they function, as partially or incorrectly assembled complexes might interfere with the normal processes. We wish to study the assembly of one such cellular machine, the signal recognition particle that is intimately associated with protein secretion from cells. Previous understanding indicates that this takes place within the nucleus, and largely within a subnuclear region termed the nucleolus, which is also the site of assembly of a number of other complexes, notably the protein synthesizing ribosome. Our aim is to identify components of the assembly and localisation path of signal recognition particle and to determine the role that each of these plays in these events.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D008816/1","grantId":"BB/D008816/1","fundValue":"258609","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  No direct impact that I am aware of. However, there are companies working in the area of post-transcriptional control of gene expression that are interested in RNA quality control. It may be that the work will be of interest to them.  ","person":"Jeremy David Brown","coPersons":["Nicholas James Watkins"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" The work carried out focussed on how complexes of RNA and protein assemble in the cell and how this is quality controlled. A key finding is that the integrity of the SRP RNA relies on the presence of the La protein and several components of the RNA quality control pathway what are normally associated with degradation, rather than protection of RNA. The work contributes to the field of RNA quality control and processing. As such it informs the many researchers working in this area. No clear contribution to non-academic routes at this point.
