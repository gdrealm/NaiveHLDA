The proposed research is based on a recent discovery by the two investigators (Driscoll, UCAM and Wang, TAMU) and by Dr. Jia from LANL. The discovery opens the door to a brand-new avenue for lattice strain control in two-phase nanocomposites: By growing epitaxial nanocolumns in a two-phase mixture, it is possible to control the strain vertically in the system, independent of the interface. The elimination of interface control in the VSCN systems allows much thicker strained films (&gt;300 nm) to be grown compared to lateral heteroepitaxial systems and thus allows a whole range of novel functional device possibilities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F028563/1","grantId":"EP/F028563/1","fundValue":"269864","fundStart":"2008-02-29","fundEnd":"2011-02-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith Louise Driscoll","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" This is an amazing new field where we make nanocomposite thin films for functional (electronic and magnetic applications). We showed how to increase the operation temperature of BaTiO3 by 700C. We showed how you can understand the tune structures. We showed how you can copy structures in nature. This is an entirely new field which is just emerging and which we have pioneered. It is very exciting indeed. We make nice art images for science shows and for conference competitions. We have one global patent (done at Los alamos as Cambridge want licensers within one year of filing and this is unrealistic!). Electronics,Energy,Environment,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
