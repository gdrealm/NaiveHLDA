{"id":"736DD893-5AC0-46A1-A9FD-8B629D977202","title":"Pervasive Computing Support for Market Trading","abstractText":"Much commerce in the UK happens in more informal marketplaces than in High Street shops, such as flea markets, record and antique fairs, and auctions. Our aim is to investigate how we decide to trust in an interaction within these marketplaces, and using this information, build technologies and software to support these interactions, ranging from techniques to allow easy tracking of inventories through to enabling participation in distributed auctions. By studying how trust is used in these arenas, we believe we can make a fundamental contribution to how we can build pervasive computing technology that both is, and shows itself to be trustworthy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D077052/1","grantId":"EP/D077052/1","fundValue":"446934","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Wakeman","coPersons":["Vladimiro  Sassone","Dan  Chalmers"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
