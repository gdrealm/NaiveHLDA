{"id":"CB116027-D8C6-41D6-AB33-F54834A3C109","title":"Effects of Attentional and Motivational Training on Reducing Excessive Drinking","abstractText":"Within the framework of a cognitive-motivational model, two major factors govern alcohol abuse: automatic cognitive processes and maladaptive motivation.&nbsp; The Alcohol Attentional-Control Training Programme (AACTP) is designed to help drinkers become aware of the automatic processes underlying drinking, and gain control over them through a series of volitional exercises. Brief Personal Concerns Counselling (PCC-B) is designed to help drinkers develop adaptive motivation for leading a satisfying life without excessive drinking. The research will test (a) whether each intervention is effective in reducing drinking, and (b) whether the two interventions used in combination have additive, multiplicative, or no effects over each used alone. The impact of the interventions on both drinking and well-being indices will be tested.&nbsp; Apart from its theoretical significance, the research will have important implications for improving health-care delivery and reducing the use of health-care services.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1269","grantId":"RES-000-23-1269","fundValue":"248384","fundStart":"2006-01-03","fundEnd":"2009-05-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"W.
