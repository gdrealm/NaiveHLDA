{"id":"6DB93CDA-19E5-4A39-9F76-4E3B76361EDA","title":"Integrated cardiopulmonary modelling for the investigation of the management of disturbed tissue perfusion","abstractText":"The management of low cardiac output states (where inadequate blood flows to the organs, causing organ damage) is poorly researched. These ?shock? states are a common feature of critical illness, and consume a large part of the healthcare budget. \n\nPrevious attempts to investigate shock states have had conflicting results because of the complexity of human and animal models, and the difficulty of measuring outcomes of interest. This issue could be investigated in great detail and depth using computer simulation of multiple organs, and this is the basis of our proposed project. Findings from this research will be directly applicable to critically ill patients, and have the potential to save many lives and reduce healthcare expenditure.\n\nStep 1: We will design and develop ground-breaking computer simulations of heart, blood vessels and tissue. We will combine these with our existing, published lung simulation. The resulting, multiple organ simulation will include great detail of the structure and function of these organ systems and will allow very detailed interrogation of microscopic areas to determine the interaction between organ systems and treatment strategies in critically ill patients.\n\nStep 2: We will apply ground-breaking validation (testing) techniques to test and improve the accuracy and usefulness of the new multi-organ models; these will include techniques from space and flight-control engineering and techniques designed in our labs for ?smart? validation against individual patient monitoring data and previous clinical studies.\n\nStep 3: Using the multi-organ models we will investigate the disturbed physiology of shock states and potential treatment strategies. Initially, we will address poorly understood aspects of the disorder of normal function, and the potential to affect tissue blood flow and oxygenation (e.g. how does lung-protective life-support affect organ oxygenation during shock?). \n\nStep 4: Using the knowledge generated in the previous phase, we will construct simple algorithms for the management of various types of shock state and test these in a large population of simulated subjects, assessing the ability of the algorithms to improve outcome from shock.\n\nOutcomes: Successful completion of the project will yield novel multi-organ models that may be re-used in investigating critical illness, greater understanding of shock states and potential treatment pathways, and, finally, treatments that may be used in patient care to optimise methods of treating critically ill patients with shock states.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002017","grantId":"G1002017","fundValue":"172706","fundStart":"2012-02-06","fundEnd":"2013-02-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Grant Hardman","coPersons":["Declan  Bates","Iain  Moppett"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
