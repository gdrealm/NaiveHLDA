The EU is undertaking such a review and the UKâ€™s DTI (Department for Trade and Industry)&nbsp;has called for European research cooperation in this area. However, the newly enlarged Europe is a diverse entity in which traditions and practices vary; so&nbsp;which elements of good corporate governance and company law practice at the national level should be adopted EU-wide and why?</p> \n<p>This project investigates one aspect of corporate governance practiced by a minority of EU members: expanded statutory auditor commentary in long form (extended and detailed) audit reports. In Poland (in contrast with Austria and Germany) such reports are publicly available for listed companies providing a unique research opportunity to describe, analyse and evaluate their content and to question Polish statutory auditors on the perceived benefits of this practice.</p> \n<p>This research is also relevant internationally because the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has initiated similar research in response to favourable responses from US users on the utility of such commentaries. This ESRC funded project will provide balancing European evidence on their perceived benefits.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D004624/1","grantId":"ES/D004624/1","fundValue":"36865","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marek Aleksander Schroeder","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
