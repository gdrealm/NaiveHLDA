Even though India had previously tested nuclear weapons in 1974, the late 1990s showed an escalation in the nuclear arms race in South Asia and caused much concern elsewhere. The subject became a sustained part of national and international media coverage, and a topic of popular discussion. It also played a prominent part in much of the cultural productions in India from that year on.</p> \n<p>This research considers the way nuclear issues pervade peoples' lives in contemporary India. It does so by focusing on peoples' perceptions and representations of nuclear science and missiles in a locality of Mumbai. With the help of fieldwork, the research reassesses nuclear issues so as they do not remain simply the concern of nation-states and political parties, but are intricately entwined with notions of self, community and imaginings of 'national' and 'international' communities. This is complemented with a focus on how nuclear debates have percolated into aspects of Indian popular culture, such as fiction, dramas, festivals, television and film, and their reception. Thus the research will provide a significant contribution to the available literature that considers nuclear issues and film or popular culture in general in post-war Europe and America.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1312","grantId":"RES-000-23-1312","fundValue":"111132","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Raminder  Kaur Kahlon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":" oThe project enabled the recording of idiosyncratic and lesser known accounts about atomic science which had been erased from India's national history in its bid to control atomic science to develop the post-independent nation.\noThe atom bomb and the atomic metaphor have been simultaneously fetishised as a source of incredible power, and normalised through repeated use in the culture industries.\noBy analysing the local impact of international treaties such as the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement (2008) and national decisions on nuclear development, the study provided a unique, 'ground-up' perspective on nuclear issues, from culturally-embedded perspectives to provide further insights into 'nuclear popular cultures' in south Asia including Pakistan and surrounding plans for a nuclear plant in Bangladesh\nhow scholarly work can be used to creatively engage wider publics to take interest in the nuclear issue\na focus on anti-nuclear movements which will be covered in forthcoming book\nexploring user-friendly and people orientated energy networks\n'sustainable cultures' that do not depend upon large development projects Creative Economy,Energy,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
