We propose that von willebrand factor, a blood protein made in the lining of blood vessels, plays an important role in regulating this process. Production of von willebrand factor is extremely variable in the population and thus may be an important contributor to disease. We have preliminary evidence that this can be observed and investigated using cells isolated from routine blood samples.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600868","grantId":"G0600868","fundValue":"393401","fundStart":"2007-06-25","fundEnd":"2010-06-24","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anna Maria Randi","coPersons":["Michael A Laffan"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
