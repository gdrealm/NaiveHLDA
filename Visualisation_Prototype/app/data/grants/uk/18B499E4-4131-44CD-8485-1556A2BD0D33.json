Tuberculosis research relies heavily on animal studies, but these are simply not the same as disease in patients. We will develop an entirely new way of studying tuberculosis infection by using human cells and the tuberculosis bacteria sprayed into tiny balls incorporating fibres that support the human lung. We will use this model to study how the body responds to tuberculosis infection and investigate new treatments which may reduce the lung damage in patients with tuberculosis and also speed up the killing of the bacteria. This approach will replace the need for extensive screening experiments in laboratory animals and accelerate the development of new treatments which are urgently needed. The approach will also be valid to investigate other human diseases by using cells in culture to model the complex 3-dimensional interactions that happen in patients, and so has the potential to replace animal experiments used to study a wide array of human diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/L001039/1","grantId":"NC/L001039/1","fundValue":"74449","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Liku Bekele Tezera","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
