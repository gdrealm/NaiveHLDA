{"id":"CC16099E-61C2-44BC-B125-0DB790DFA69C","title":"The Study of Magnetized Electronegative Depositing Plasmas","abstractText":"The importance of electronegative species in technological plasmas is currently of great interest, both from a theoretical and experimental point of view, with much of the recent work concentrating on reactive ion etching discharges.However, other very important plasma systems have been somewhat neglected by scientist and engineers in terms of the role of negative ions, for instance, pulsed magnetized discharges (the sputter magnetron) used for the reactive deposition of thin films which contain electronegative gases such as oxygen. In this project, we will perform the first detailed study of the role of negative ions on the structure and dynamics of the pulsed magnetron plasma. In particular, it is our aim to make quantitative temporal and spatial measurements of the concentrations, energies and fluxes of electronegative species such as O- and O2- in the magnetron. The experimental study will be supplemented by modelling activity necessary to fully understand and interpret our diagnostic tools and shed light on the fundamental physical processes. The plasma measurements will be useful in understanding thin film growth dynamics and the fundamental data can be used in other more surface engineering orientated projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E035183/1","grantId":"EP/E035183/1","fundValue":"371172","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"James William Bradley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" The first ever measurement of the O- denisty in reactive DC and pulsed DC O2 magnetron sputtering discharges.
