{"id":"EE070684-ADD6-44D6-8C66-D218368EFE26","title":"Hidden Histories of Exploration: Exhibiting Geographical Collections","abstractText":"This project seeks to enhance knowledge and understanding of the part played by indigenous peoples in the history of exploration, by developing and disseminating research on the subject based in the collections of a major scholarly society. It builds directly on research undertaken to date as part of a Collaborative Doctoral Award supported by AHRC and supervised by the PI in collaboration with the Royal Geographical Society (with Institute of British Geographers) This project seeks to develop and transfer this knowledge into the public domain, by means of an exhibition in a prominent site of metropolitan learning as well as by an online electronic resource, and to consider the wider implications for contemporary research into similar collections of material relating to travel, exploration and discovery.\\n\\nThe project responds to criticisms of the standard narratives of voyages of exploration, which have until recently dominated the historiography of travel and discovery. In much of this literature, the role of the inhabitants of territory through which explorers and travellers passed is relegated to the margins. Where their contibutions to the development of geographical knowledge have been explicitly acknowledged, there has been a tendency to accord them a lower status - as 'local' assistants or informants, as guides or porters, as background characters, rather than as truly participants in the production of new knowledge. The project seeks to offer an alternative perspective grounded in scholarly research into the RGS-IBG collections.\\n\\nIn addition to its specific focus, the project has wider methodological and conceptual dimensions relating to research with geographical collections. The research raises questions about the extent to which certain voices and experiences have been systematically 'hidden' in the archival record of travel and exploration, and the possibility of their 'recovery' by means of new approaches to such collections.These are difficult questions which have no easy answers: the purpose of the project is to highlight not only the challenges, but also to suggest possible new ways of working with well-established collections, drawing on new approaches developed by curators and researchers in the context of related collections in Britain, Australia and the USA. These will be the subject of an international workshop on geographical collections held in parallel with the exhibition itself.\\n\\nThe project is designed to stimulate new ways of thinking about geographical collections which will have significant practical applications within the educational and exhibition programmes of the RGS-IBG and other bodies. On the basis of the success of the Society's recent exhibitions in the Crossing Continents series (notably those devoted to 'Bombay Africans' and 'From Kabul to Kandahar') it is envisaged that the exhibition will also highlight aspects of the Society's collections of particular interest to minority ethnic communities which have diaspora links to the areas visited by explorers in the past. This aspect of the project will be sustained through an online exhibition on the Society's website, which will be designed for a wide range of users.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G000336/1","grantId":"AH/G000336/1","fundValue":"168799","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The underpinning research suggested that innovative curation and exhibition of the RGS-IBG collections could communicate a more inclusive history of exploration, in which the contributions of a wider range of people were recognised and valued than has traditionally been the case. The AHRC evaluated this work as outstanding – ‘a highly effective project which has had a significantly greater public impact than anticipated’ – and presented it as a case study of ‘world class research and its impact’.The research exhibition and website have been visited by large numbers within the UK and overseas; a travelling exhibition has visited various venues; the RGS created schools teaching resources around the topics of the exhibition; the media gave the exhibition extensive coverage and several newspapers produced their own online image galleries in addition to those of the web version of the exhibition; exhibition resources were used in university courses, teaching publications and in diversity training and education; the RGs and other institutions holding heritage collections have been inspired by the success of the project to develop collaborative, collections-based research. More specifically, some of the materials highlighted in the research (including film, watercolours and photographs) have subsequently been used in other exhibitions, publications and projects, at the RGS, the British Museum and the British Film Institute.

That it is possible to highlight the contribution of marginalised or forgotten groups to the history of exploration using the collections of major UK institutions such as the Royal Geographical Society.\n2. That public interest in new approaches to exploration and empire is substantial (the success of more traditional approaches notwithstanding)\n3. That research and exhibition-making can be mutually supportive activities\n4. That collections-based research is a powerful research model for historians of exploration and encounter Similar kinds of collections can be approached the same way.\nThe exhibition provided a model for new approaches to the history of exploration in the UK and internationally: for example see:\nhttp://timetoeatthedogs.com/2009/11/04/interview-with-felix-driver/\n\nhttp://history.cass.anu.edu.au/event/conference-local-intermediaries-international-exploration\n\nhttp://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/events/travellers-tails-exploration Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
