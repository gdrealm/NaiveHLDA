Possible topics to be discussed include:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>the slow adjustment of exchange rates to international prices,</li> \n <li>the slow adjustment of stock prices towards their equilibrium values, and</li> \n <li>the asymmetric response of output to monetary policy shocks.</li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4260","grantId":"RES-451-25-4260","fundValue":"12251","fundStart":"2006-11-30","fundEnd":"2008-11-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Costas  Milas","coPersons":["Theordore  Panagiotidis","Chris  Martin"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
