Possession of very-long OAg chains is important for colonisation of the chicken reproductive tract, survivial in albumen and contamination of eggs. Additionally, the increased ability of SE to survive in albumen compared to STm is conferred in large part by the presence of tyvelose rather than abequose side-chains in the O-antigen.\n\n2) Five genomic islands investigated for a role in reproductive tract colonisation are not important for this phenotype, but have a small role in colonisation of the spleen.\n\n3) An 89 kb conjugative plasmid confers a phenotype of high-level growth in eggs.
