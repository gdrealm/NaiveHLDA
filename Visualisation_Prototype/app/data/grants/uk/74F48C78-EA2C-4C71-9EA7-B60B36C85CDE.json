Similarly, no catalytic addition of a diorganozinc species (ZnR2) to an unsaturated esters (Case 2) has ever been reported. In collaboration with DowPharma we have recently uncovered the first examples of these two transformations. We wish to carry out a highly focused proof of application study for these remarkable reactions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E030092/1","grantId":"EP/E030092/1","fundValue":"94053","fundStart":"2007-04-02","fundEnd":"2008-04-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"S  Woodward","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
