The research assistant named in this proposal, Dr. Andrej Aleshin, was part of the team participating in the Japanese project. Some Ni nanocrystals (NCs) were studied in that project and this work has inspired new ideas for studying such materials with the benefit of our group's expertise on grain boundaries and grain boundary migration in the presence of segregants. We wish to explore the use of a new method for studying grain growth in NCs during this yearlong feasibility study. If it is successful, further support will be sought to enlarge on the findings to explain fully the mechanisms of grain growth in NCs and to exploit new ideas on how impurity additions to NCs might be used to control the grain size stability in such materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C525388/1","grantId":"EP/C525388/1","fundValue":"62698","fundStart":"2006-02-21","fundEnd":"2007-02-20","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Roy  Faulkner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
