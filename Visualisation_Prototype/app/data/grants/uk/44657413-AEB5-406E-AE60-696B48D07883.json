{"id":"44657413-AEB5-406E-AE60-696B48D07883","title":"Astrophysics Research at Liverpool John Moores University: Consolidated Grant Renewal","abstractText":"We will continue to pursue ground-breaking astrophysical research at the forefront of knowledge through both observational and theoretical work.\n\nUnder the heading of star formation, we will test the predictions of an evolutionary scenario for producing stars in the Galactic Centre which has the potential to open a new frontier in such research. We will find the pristine birth sites of the most massive stars, directly testing predictions of models seeking to explain the observed stellar mass distribution. In addition, we will measure how efficiently gas clouds are converted into stars across much of the Galaxy, producing the first constraints on the dominant mechanisms or environmental factors regulating star formation, thereby laying the foundations for a predictive empirical model of star formation. We will exploit our access to the UK's investment in the world's best mm observatory, ALMA and we will convert significant UK investments in SCUBA-2 and Herschel into an international lead in science outcomes.\n\nIn time-domain astrophysics, we will perform an in-depth study of the circumstances of core-collapse supernova explosions (SNe Ib/c) and identification of the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia). This project capitalises on expertise in the ARI supernova and nova groups and exploits our privileged access to data from the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory and other facilities. We will continue and expand our study of the physics of Gamma Ray Bursts, exploiting our world-leading capabilities in rapid follow-up, polarimety and MHD modelling. A combination of new robotic telescopes, instruments and data analysis will enable us to investigate new types of transients, laying the foundation for a UK lead in time-domain astrophysics beyond Gaia, into the LSST, SKA and gravitational-wave era.\n\nUnder the heading of the structure and evolution of galaxies, we will exploit our novel technique to measure chemical compositions of individual stars at Mpc distances. We will thus measure abundance patterns in nearby galaxies, and provide the best measurement yet of the Mass-Metallicity Relation in the local universe, a crucial diagnostic of the theory of galaxy formation and evolution. The project is supported by significant awards of time at major international observatories and is part of the E-ELT MOS instrument science case. We will also investigate mass assembly of galaxies using measures of mass distributions in groups and clusters. By comparing to the latest numerical models this will answer key questions regarding the star-formation efficiency of galaxies, the baryonic mass distribution, and the size-mass relationship of galaxies. \n\nWe will gain new insights into the formation of our Galaxy, by integrating state of the art models of galaxy formation, stellar evolution, and orbital analysis techniques with data from a cutting-edge new survey of Milky Way stars (a part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey), in which LJMU will play a leading role. We will also use hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies and clusters, to make predictions for surveys such as Planck, REFLEX-II. This will address the number counts discrepancy of Planck clusters and the exciting possibility of free-streaming by neutrinos. We will use a new prescription for AGN feedback for the most luminous powerful radio jets, which has been missing in simulations to-date.\n\nAll of our research uses the most advanced ground-based telescopes, satellites and data analysis techniques. In turn, ARI staff lead many of the new generation surveys with these telescopes. The projects we propose are technically demanding and require computer software support to aid the delivery of the science. \n\nThe structure and organisation of the ARI is designed to deliver internationally excellent research. The ARI is known worldwide for developing and exploiting outreach activities to engage the wider population in STFC science, and we aim to enhance these.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M000966/1","grantId":"ST/M000966/1","fundValue":"1314850","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Alfred Collins","coPersons":["MF  Bode","Iain Allan  Steele","Ian George McCarthy","Paolo A.
