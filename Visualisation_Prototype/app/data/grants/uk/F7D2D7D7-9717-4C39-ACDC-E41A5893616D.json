Current optical communication systems use binary modulation and transmission/coding schemes matched to binary modulation. As optical fibre systems rapidly approach the limits of binary modulation and direct detection, alternative optical data coding, processing, transmission and detection techniques will play increasing roles in a more efficient use of a fibre's information capacity. The project will take advantage of the existing experimental and theoretical research being performed in the Photonics Research Group. Though the fundamentally new approaches will be addressed, the practical engineering design considerations will be an important part of the proposed research. We believe that the proposed multidisciplinary research programme based on a synergy of methods from very different fields of science, has a right balance between an adventure and the research quality to make an important contribution into development of future generation of communication networks, systems and devices operating beyond the limits of current systems and increasing information data-rates by orders of magnitude.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D050812/1","grantId":"EP/D050812/1","fundValue":"163573","fundStart":"2006-11-06","fundEnd":"2009-11-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sergei  Turitsyn","coPersons":["Ian  Bennion"],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
