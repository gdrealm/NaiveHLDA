These measured increases in atmospheric CO2 are partly controlled by changes in the ability of the world's oceans to absorb CO2 at the surface (e.g. via diffusion and the biological pump) versus release of old carbon to the atmosphere from deep ocean reservoirs (e.g. via upwelling and out gassing).\n\nOf the world's oceans, the Southern Ocean has been identified (by models) as playing a major role in modulating global atmospheric CO2, particularly on glacial-interglacial timescales. This is because surface nutrients are high indicating their incomplete utilisation by the biological pump, and because wind driven changes in ocean circulation can bring old carbon stored in deep ocean reservoirs to the surface. \n\nChanges in the strength of the Southern Hemisphere Westerly Winds (SHW) influence Southern Ocean circulation and control how much of this carbon rich deep water reaches the ocean surface. Thus any change in the strength or position of the SHW such as the recently observed intensification of the winds, could influence whether the Southern Ocean acts as a net source or sink of atmospheric CO2.\n\nAt present our understanding of past changes in the SHW is based mainly on geological proxy records from South America, one record from South Africa, and two from New Zealand. With the exception of Campbell Island there are no studies of changes in the SHW in the Southern Ocean where the core of the SHW wind belt is located. This lack of spatial resolution has been identified by Stager et al. (2012) as a major limitation in our understanding of past climate. As a result, although present General Circulation Models use a variety of processes (biology, ocean chemistry, and ocean physics), they either fail to produce the magnitude of past atmospheric CO2 variations or do not agree with geologic field data. \n\nHere we propose to substantially improve the spatial resolution of the geological data by generating proxy records in each of the three major sectors of the Southern Ocean, focusing on sub-Antarctic islands situated in the core belt of the SHW. We apply a novel diatom proxy for past wind strength independently controlled by a range of standard sedimentological and biogeochemical proxies. The new proxy is based on the direct transfer of sea spray across the islands by wind, and its effect on the salinity of west coast lakes and ponds. This works on sub-Antarctic islands where there is a marked west-east conductivity gradient in water bodies across the island. This conductivity gradient determines which diatom communities are present in the lakes. Once this diatom- conductivity relationship is established quantitatively, the subfossil diatom communities deposited in radiocarbon dated sediment cores can be used to reconstruct changes in conductivity through time, and hence past relative wind strength.\n\nWe have demonstrated that this approach works at Macquarie Island and we have also tested its feasibility at Marion and Campbell Islands. This proposal is for funding to support further work on Campbell and Marion Islands, and in the Cape Horn archipelago. \n\nTo interpret our data we will carry out a series of General Circulation Model runs to explore the long term changes in SHW strength and the processes driving them, by taking advantage of the new Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project 3 (PMIP3) AOGCM (climate model) simulations. These experiments will allow comprehensive model-observation evaluation of the new proxy wind strength reconstructions.\n\nUltimately this work will help provide improved boundary conditions for models which simulate the impact of past changes in wind strength on the upwelling of deep ocean carbon reservoirs, and improve our understanding of the relationship between past changes in global atmospheric CO2 and temperature.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K004514/1","grantId":"NE/K004514/1","fundValue":"664479","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2017-03-29","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Research not due for completion until 2017  ","person":"Dominic  Hodgson","coPersons":["Steve  Roberts","Claire Susannah Allen","Louise Claire Sime"],"organisation":"NERC British Antarctic Survey","findingsText":" Late Quaternary changes in the Westerly Winds over the Southern Ocean The research is in its very early phases with fieldwork now completed at sub-Antarctic Marion Island (supported by the South African National Antarctic Programme in March-May 2013) and at sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island (supported by the Australian Antarctic Division in Oct-Dec 2013). Analytical work begins in earnest in April 2014 when a new postdoctoral research assistant and BAS technical technical support come on line. This project brings together researchers and funding from NERC and the Universities of Bern and Ghent to develop new high-resolution records of late Quaternary (last 20000 years) changes in the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds (SHW) and explore how these changes have interacted with, and influenced, global climate. The project involves visiting sites on the west coast of selected sub-Antarctic Islands, in the core belt of the Southern Hemisphere Westerly Winds, to collect lake and peat sediment cores.
