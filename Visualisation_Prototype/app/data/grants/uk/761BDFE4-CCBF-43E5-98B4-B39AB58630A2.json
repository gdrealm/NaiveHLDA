{"id":"761BDFE4-CCBF-43E5-98B4-B39AB58630A2","title":"Role of coagulation factor XIII in fibrin clot structure and thrombosis","abstractText":"Clot formation within a blood vessel is the predominant cause of heart attacks, stroke and deep vein thrombosis. The clot is composed of a protein called fibrin which undergoes cross-linking by an enzyme called transglutaminase (factor XIII). The role of factor XIII in clot structure and thrombosis is not well understood. Our research is aimed at discovering how the thrombus is modulated by factor XIII, using model systems of clot formation, engineered proteins and in vivo models. This study will develop better understanding of processes involved in clot stability and in the future will help to design new anti-clotting drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901546","grantId":"G0901546","fundValue":"330620","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Ariens","coPersons":["V  Ridger","Helen  Philippou"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
