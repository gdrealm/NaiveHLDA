However, in contrast, when a normal muscle is taken out of the body, it will not contract unless externally stimulated in some manner (e.g. electrical stimulation). We have recently found a very special skeletal muscle that goes against this central biological principle. This muscle is called the lymph heart and it beats even though it is not linked to any nerves. We want to carry out research to understand what allows this muscle to contract when it should not really be able to do so. In particular, we want to look at the molecules that allow it to make its own electrical signal and find out how this electrical signal spreads across the muscle to enable contraction and so to function as a pump. We believe that this muscle represents an intermediate form of tissue that shows features of both heart and muscle. At present we know very little about this muscle and investigations into the working of this tissue will be of great interest and use to scientists studying both of these tissues. We believe that a strong basic understanding of this tissue, may enable us and others to engineer muscle into self-contracting tissues like the heart, thereby opening new avenues for developing treatment in heart and muscular diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H01022X/1","grantId":"BB/H01022X/1","fundValue":"352967","fundStart":"2010-10-04","fundEnd":"2013-10-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ketan  Patel","coPersons":["David  Becker","Benjamin Jason Whalley"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":" The lymph heart represents the first skeletal muscle described in literature that does not require innervation to mediate contraction.\n\n\n\nWe have profiled a number of molecules that allow it to contract without acetylcholine mediated signalling and found that the HCN channels permit it to contract. This is very interesting as we believe now that all skeletal muscle have an intrinsic pacemaking ability but that all lose it. These studies could pave the way to develop cell based therapies for a pateints with compromised heart function. Development of skeletal muscle that continues to beat without undergoing fatigue could be of great interest in the development of regime to augment a failing heart Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
