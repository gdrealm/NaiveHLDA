Under certain conditions, these cells can be made to develop into different types of tissues, such as nerve or pancreas which it is hoped in the future, may be useful in treating degenerative diseases such as Parkinson s disease and diabetes, or in spinal injuries by replacing the diseased or damaged cells with healthy cells which have been grown in the laboratory. The number of embryonic stem cell lines that have been developed worldwide is still quite limited and further research is required to find out the best means to grow them in ways which will allow them to be safe for clinical use. In order to facilitate these developments, a National Stem Cell Bank has been established in the UK where stem cell lines can be deposited and stored, tested for safety, and then made available for research and clinical use. All stem cell derivation from embryos is strictly monitored in the UK and requires a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. It is also a condition of licence that a sample of any suitable stem cell lines developed must sent to the UK Stem Cell Bank from where they are made available to research scientists in the UK and abroad\nDeriving these embryonic stem cells ethically is critically dependent on identifying those patients who are prepared to donate to research any suitable embryos that are no longer needed for their IVF assisted conception treatment. In 2003 the MRC made funds available for the appointment of Nurse Coordinators, not involved directly in the stem cell derivation, who could counsel and advise patients that may be prepared to donate surplus embryos to stem cell programmes. They have been very successful and a number of lines have been submitted to the stem cell bank from this source. They have also established a UK network of stem cell coordinators (hESCCO) which facilitates their collaborative working and through which they have developed a national consent form for patients wishing to donate to stem cell research. The bid to the MRC is to continue funding of the nurse coordinators and their network.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700092","grantId":"G0700092","fundValue":"239312","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Riven  Braude","coPersons":["Daniel R Brison","Helen  Mardon","Madhurima  Rajkhowa","Franchesca  Houghton","Lorraine Elizabeth Young","Christopher  Barratt","Siladitya  Bhattacharya","Alison  Murdoch"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
