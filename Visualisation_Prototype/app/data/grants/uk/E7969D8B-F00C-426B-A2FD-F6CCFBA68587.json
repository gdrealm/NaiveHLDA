The research has featured in TV/radio broadcasts, in newspapers, and in professional and lifestyle magazines. We have run workshops for mental health, business, and sport professionals, conducted events for the public (including an interactive exhibition) and user groups, and worked with a range of organisations.

In a follow-up study, we found that individuals who used the most effective strategies most frequently had better affect-related outcomes 1-yr later.\n\n• Identification of brain areas involved in i) interpersonal emotion regulation and ii) automatic control of emotion regulation.\n\n• Empirical evidence concerning the links between interpersonal emotion regulation and a variety of outcomes including risk-taking, quality of relationships, job performance, and the well-being of employees. \n\n• Discovering that mood appraisal patterns can distinguish between bipolar disorder and unipolar depression, and between symptoms of hypomania and depression. \n\n• Development of effective clinical interventions for affect-related problems including a protocol that helps individuals with bipolar disorder manage their mood swings as part of their cognitive behavioural therapy, and a new transdiagnostic therapy.\n\n• Demonstrating that simple interventions in the form of if-then plans can be used to overcome the effect of mood on risky behaviour, reduce social anxiety, and augment the effectiveness of self-help materials.\n\n•Production of new validated measures of emotion regulation. Emotion regulation is something that everyone does on a daily basis and it affects many aspects of people's lives, including how good they feel, how well they perform, and how they get on with others. Our research has identified effective forms of emotion regulation, shown how emotion regulation can be modified, and how emotion regulation problems can be treated. It is therefore relevant to a range of non-academic contexts and we have worked with a wide range of organisations and individuals during the course of the research (including healthcare workers, shop workers, driving instructors, athletes, prisoners, teams, couples, parents). Our research on emotion regulation can be put to use wherever there is a need to enhance well-being, relationships, and performance. Areas where it is particularly relevant include: treatment of mental health problems (such as bipolar disorder and social anxiety), competitive performance (e.g. sport), occupational health (well-being and relationships at work), and personal relationships.
