The ageing of populations is a global phenomenon and presents a new dynamic to the process and pattern of transfers. Its impact on transmissions of wealth and poverty between generations could be one of the key challenges of the 21st Century. This raises complex issues for individuals, families and government that are best explored through collaboration.<br /><br />The function of globalised markets is central to the unequal generation of wealth and assets across developed and developing nations. Whilst cultural, social, political and regulatory regimes provide the context which further promote or inhibit generational transfers. The <a href=\"http://integratenet.st-andrews.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">International Network of Generational Transfers Research (INTEGRATE)</a> will bring together existing knowledge and understanding with a view to facilitating knowledge exchange, identifying gaps in understanding, generating ideas and themes to create new, research projects which address this international, indeed global, problem.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J019259/1","grantId":"ES/J019259/1","fundValue":"25152","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Beverley Ann Searle","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
