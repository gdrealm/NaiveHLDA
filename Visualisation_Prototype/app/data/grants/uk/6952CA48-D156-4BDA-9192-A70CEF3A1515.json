{"id":"6952CA48-D156-4BDA-9192-A70CEF3A1515","title":"Knowledge Led Structure Prediction for Nanostructures","abstractText":"Nanoparticles are key to a wide range of day-to-day technological applications, including petrochemical catalysis, biomedical imaging, optoelectronics, paints, inks, coatings, and nanomedicine. To develop and optimise such applications, one needs a good understanding of the atomic structures of the involved nanoparticles that is difficult to obtain from experiment alone. Similar structural models are relevant to understanding the toxicology and environmental effects of nanoparticles and their role in astrochemistry. We will develop a linked nanoscale structure prediction code (WASP@N) and web-interfaced database aimed at generating and archiving such structural models of nanostructures. This combination will provide a fast and efficient way of predicting the atomic structure of both fundamentally new systems that have never been studied before and known systems embedded in a realistic environment; e.g. in solution, in the pores or on the surface of a material, and/or with an organic capping agent, rather than isolated in a vacuum. The latter is crucial for understanding nanoparticles in many industrial processes (e.g. liquid phase nanoparticle catalysis, inks, coatings) and, for instance, nanotoxicology, but has not been done routinely before due to additional computational cost of including the environment. We strongly believe that the combination of new algorithmic approaches to be included in WASP@N and access to all low energy structures for the particles in vacuum in the cluster structure database will make predicting the atomic structure of nanoparticles insolution, for example, much more efficient and a standard technique in the repertoire of the applied computational chemist. The cluster structure database, finally, will also be useful as a stand-alone resource for experimental and computational chemists, chemical engineers, physicists, electronic engineers and toxicologists looking for information on the structure of materials on the nanoscale.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K038958/1","grantId":"EP/K038958/1","fundValue":"665124","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Findings will help academia and industry in their work to predict properties - based on atomic and electronic level of theory - of materials. This project has two components: the development of a database of atomic structures for inorganic nanoclusters and the software that will be able to exploit this database.\nThe starting point for modelling at the atomic scale is of course the initial atomic coordinates. For crystals, the atomic structure is readily obtainable from diffraction experiments. For small sized nanoparticles, or nanoclusters, obtaining atomic structure from experiments is currently not possible. The expense of predicting atomic structures is dependent on the number of atoms and, for any reasonably sized system, computationally demanding, if not impossible. Therefore, the database of atomic structures already published would be an invaluable aid for computational scientist.\nThe solutions used in the automated software that will access and update the database will also aid the development of other client-server codes (which need not be in the field of Materials Modelling). In fact, the experienced gained by the PI on the development, exploitation as well as practical aspects of the database (ownership of data, access control, liability, etc) has resulted in the PI becoming a member of the ERC's European Materials Modeling Council (EMMC), which is developing plans for connecting industry to the wealth of materials modelling knowledge (software and generated data). \nThe methodology implemented within developed software and the results on the prediction of atomic structure and properties of nanoparticles from the use of the developed software will be of use to the wider computational physics and chemistry community, as well as provide guidance to experimental design.

So far the funding has allowed us to develop the first version of a searchable web-database for storing atomic structures of inorganic nanoclusters. The database will be installed on the head node of a dedicated computer resource. The intention is that scientist can: (a) check whether their predicted atomic structure for a particular compound and size is a previously unknown low-energy configuration; (b) upload data that has been published; (c) search and analyse data stored in the database; and (d) download atomic structures for use in further studies. One key aspect is the development of a standard set of atomic structures, which all predictions can be tagged (the available nodes will be used to refine uploaded atomic structures and to compute its energy using our chosen standard settings so that atomic structures and energies can be compared). Work on algorithms for comparing atomic structures is also in process. The software and database development initiated in this project aligns itself with the Physical Sciences, Energy, Engineering and Manufacturing the Future themes of EPSRC. There are strong links to EPSRC research areas: Catalysis, Computational and Theoretical Chemistry, Condensed Matter and Electronic Structure, Energy Storage, Materials for Energy Applications, Particle Technology, Functional Ceramics and Inorganics, and Solar Energy; all research areas earmarked either to maintain or grow in the recent capability reshaping exercise. Nanostructures are key to an enormous wealth of important technological applications (e.g. petrochemical catalysts, battery materials, security inks, biomedical imaging, nanomedicine). Development and optimisation of such applications without good structural models of nanoparticles is extremely difficult, as one is limited to serendipity. Similar structural models will be of use in understanding the toxicity of nanoparticles, an important issue with the increasing technological use of nano-structured materials and their environmental effects. We will provide interested academic, industrial and governmental parties both with new tools to develop structural models of nanoparticles and the opportunity to find models previously developed by others in our web-database. We will provide unique functionalities - for example, to generate structural models of nanoparticles in the presence of a solvent, to gain insight in industrial processes, toxicity and environmental systems. Finally, the proposed work also links to Directed Assembly of Extended Structures with Targeted Properties and Nanoscale Design of Functional Materials grand challenges, both of which would greatly benefit from a proper understanding of the atomistic and electronic structure of nanostructured materials.\nThe software and database developed in this project will have three types of academic beneficiaries. These will benefit academic groups using computational methods to elucidate the physico-chemical processes occurring at the nano-scale. Externally, UK academic beneficiaries would include the groups whose research typically starts with known atomic structures. A second group of beneficiaries consists of experimental groups working with nanoparticles that need structural models to interpret their results or to guide the direction of their efforts. Finally, the new functionalities/ algorithms developed in our software will be of interest to the wider global optimisation community, working on other materials/systems.
