The hearts will be in live, developing zebrafish and mouse embryos. This is extremely challenging as the living heart is large (on a microscopic scale), is embedded in the body of the animal (meaning it must be imaged at depth) and is beating, and therefore moving, at a rate of around 300 beats per minute. As well as providing a challenge to demonstrate the advanced methods we will develop the study of cardiac development is important both for investigating the development of the healthy heart and for determining the causes of heart problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I010173/1","grantId":"EP/I010173/1","fundValue":"506510","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We developed a selective plane illumination microscope - incorporating adaptive optics for high resolution imaging.
