This information is organized schematically, so that a familiar twinge, or something we hear or read can ‘trigger’ all the information contained in the schema to come to mind. This project investigates whether ‘triggering’ an illness schema can actually lead people to behave in ways that resemble illness, perhaps without them realizing it. The experiments will utilize computers to subliminally prime (activate) people’s illness schema and assess any deterioration in their performance on a series of tasks. Subsequent experiments will investigate some of the particular social circumstances in which illness schema activation is more or less likely to lead to ‘sick behaviour’. For example a person may be unwilling to adopt ‘sick behaviour’ because it is associated with a negative social identity, such as in the case of the person who experiences symptoms related to loss of hearing but avoids seeking diagnosis or a hearing aid because of reluctance to adopt a ‘hard of hearing’ identity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F032927/1","grantId":"ES/F032927/1","fundValue":"78611","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sheina  Orbell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
