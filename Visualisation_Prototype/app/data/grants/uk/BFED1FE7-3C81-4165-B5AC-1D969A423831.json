As such, there are many ideas and principles that research students need ot learn in order to become effective researchers in the area. This summer school is the principal mechanism in the UK by which the body of research students is able to learn these ideas and principles, and has the added bonus that expert practitioners from industry are able to show how these principles are realised in practical systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E06227X/1","grantId":"EP/E06227X/1","fundValue":"86313","fundStart":"2007-06-28","fundEnd":"2010-06-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Summer School on Computer Vision has educated &gt;150 PhD students in the techniques of computer vision, and also given them a chance to meet each other and form a community.\n\nMy involvement in teaching on the Summer School (as opposed to organising it) has influenced my research, and a number of papers that involve performance evaluation (one of the subjects I lecture on the summer school) are provided for illustrative purposes.
