One component of number proficiency is basic calculation, the addition of whole numbers with sums less than 20 and corresponding subtractions. When children start school they can solve some basic calculation problems. During the primary years, most learn to solve all basic calculations accurately and quickly. Children differ markedly in their skill and these differences seem important because research suggests:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>basic calculation proficiency is related to more general mathematical attainment</li>\n\n <li>deficits in basic calculation are common in children with number difficulties</li>\n\n <li>there is continuity between number difficulties at primary school and adult number difficulties.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>This project tracks a cohort of Year 3 Primary schoolchildren and their teachers over a year and collects data on psychological, social, and educational factors that previous research has identified as important.

Although mathematics is more than computation, a surprisingly substantial correlate of attainment is simple computational skill, involving numbers less than 20. \n\n\n\nThis project aimed to understand more about how simple computational skill develops and why it is related to mathematics attainment. We assessed the skills and number understandings of over 250 children in Year 3 and again in Year 4. We also collected information on other measures that previous studies had shown to be related to children's mathematical attainment. These included social factors, such as parental support, cognitive factors, such as memory and language, and other number skills, such as number sense. \n\n\n\nUnderstanding of number and computational skill were highly related. Nevertheless the results were more consistent with idea that skill develops from understanding. Understanding better predicted later skill than skill predicted later understanding.\n\n\n\nOur data suggest simple computational skill is mainly related to more general maths attainment because both are affected by the same factors. There is very little diversity in maths attainment that can only be explained by simple computational skill. Also simple computational skill is not necessary for high mathematics attainment. Even children who were mathematically advanced for their age did not know many number facts. Many children who were doing well made occasional mistakes on simple sums. Imperfect skill in simple computation is not the barrier to success it is often assumed to be. The findings and tasks used could inform the design and evaluation of interventions to support primary school children's mathematical development, particularly those for children making slower than expected progress.
