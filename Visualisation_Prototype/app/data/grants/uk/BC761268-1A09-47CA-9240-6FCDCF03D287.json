{"id":"BC761268-1A09-47CA-9240-6FCDCF03D287","title":"Pervasive Mobile Environmental Sensor Grids","abstractText":"The impact of road traffic on local air quality is a major public policy concern and has stimulated a substantial body of researchaimed at improving underlying vehicle and traffic management technologies and informing public policy action. Recent work hassought to use a variety of vehicle-based, person-based and infrastructure-based sensor systems to collect data on key aspects ofdriver and traffic behaviour, emissions, pollutant concentrations and exposure. The variety and pervasiveness of the sensor inputsavailable will increase significantly in the future as a result both of the increasingly widespread penetration of existingtechnologies (e.g., GPS based vehicle tracking, CANbus interfaces to on-board engine management system data) within thevehicle parc and the introduction of new technologies (such as e.g., UV sensing and nanotechnology based micro sensors). Aparticularly exciting direction for future development will be in the use of vehicles as platforms for outward facing environmentalsensor systems, allowing vehicles to operate as mobile environmental probes, providing radically improved capability for thedetection and monitoring of environmental pollutants and hazardous materials.However, these developments present new and formidable research challenges arising from the need to transmit,integrate, model and interpret vast quantities of highly diverse (spatially and temporally varying) sensor data. Our approach in thisproject is to address these challenges by novel combination and extension of state-of-the-art eScience, sensor, positioning andmodelling (data fusion, traffic, transport, emissions, dispersion) technologies. By so doing, we aim to develop the capability tomeasure, model and predict a wide range of environmental pollutants and hazards (both transport related and otherwise) using agrid of pervasive roadside and vehicle-mounted sensors. This work will be at the leading edge of eScience, stretching thecapabilities of the grid in a number of aspects of the processing of massive volumes of sensor data.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E002129/1","grantId":"EP/E002129/1","fundValue":"861163","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The main exploitation has been the commercialisation of the wireless sensor networks by an UK SME Envirowatch. They have commercially installed the system in several UK locations including MEDWAY and STOCKPORT. More recently Envirowatch won a contract with NATS (National Air Traffic Control Centre) to install a network of sensors to measure noise generated by aircraft arriving and leaving Gatwick Airport information on this deployment can be found here: http://nats.aero/blog/2014/07/measuring-reducing-aviation-noise/\n\nThe underlying e-science and data base management and techniques developed in the MESSAGE project was carried forward into a new project funded by the TSB - Ultra Low Carbon Vehicle Demonstrator Projects which monitored and analysed electric vehicle movements using data loggers.

The underlying e-science to collect and analyse the data in real-time was ground breaking at the time. The system has been deployed and demonstrated in cities in the UK and around the world with several commercial installations of the equipment We exploited the wirless sensor network technology in several related domains including installing a knowledge gathering central sensor bub in vehicles under the EU Project TRACKSS and developed an embedded sensor system in vehicles and in the infrastructure in the EU project EMMA - this delivered embedded middleware for sensor management which was then exploited by Bosche in Germany and TRW Connect in the UK. Wireless sensors were also developed from this for indoor navigation and POI applications in the EU project ASK-IT.
