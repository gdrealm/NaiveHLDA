Which marine scientist has never dreamt of such sales on data loggers and satellite transmitters? Our project proposes to develop a high precision GPS tag that offers the potential of tracking 20x as many individuals as traditional techniques for a similar price. Such a cost-effective tag would enable researchers working on marine species to perform studies with unprecedented large sample sizes or research groups in developing countries to carry out large scale tracking projects. In this project, the tags will be deployed on a marine group of particular topical interest: jellyfish. Indeed, in the current context of climate change and overfishing, coastal seas are threatened with an increase in jellyfish populations, yet to date there is incredibly little known about the ecology of jellyfish largely because of a lack of targeted research. Data that we will collect thanks to our new GPS technology are thus urgently needed for the effective management of marine ecosystems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I00050X/1","grantId":"NE/I00050X/1","fundValue":"86092","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Graeme Clive Hays","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
