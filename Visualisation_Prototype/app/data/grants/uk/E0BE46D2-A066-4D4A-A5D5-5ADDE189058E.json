This will be achieved through an examination of how the recently-established war crimes chamber of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBiH) has attempted to reach out to the Bosnian citizenry through public outreach initiatives.</p>\n\n<p>Public outreach is emerging as a key area of activity for war crimes courts that seek to build trust in new legal populations with victims, witnesses and veterans. The research will focus in particular on the attempt by the CBiH to establish a Court Support Network (CSN) in 2005, comprising six non-governmental organisations (NGOs) distributed across the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). In policy terms the research will establish the extent to which public outreach activities can assist in developing trust in trial processes, establishing the legitimacy of new judicial instruments and fostering popular participation in judicial institutions.</p>\n&nbsp;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I009213/2","grantId":"ES/I009213/2","fundValue":"123209","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander Sam Jeffrey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
