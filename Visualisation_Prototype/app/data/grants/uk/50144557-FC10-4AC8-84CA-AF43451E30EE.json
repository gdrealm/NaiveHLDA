One of the type of protein molecules that is particularly challenging to make are antibodies e.g. herceptin. These protein drugs are produced for the treatment of diseases such as cancer by cells kept in culture under defined conditions. One problem with this is that the cells we use to make proteins for therapeutic uses are not as efficient as we would like them to be and therefore we may not be able to produce enough of these drugs and the cost and demand for them is high. Protein synthesis is the process by which the information in the genetic material in the cell, DNA is converted via an intermediary substrate mRNA, into proteins. For proteins to be synthesised the mRNA must interact with a large complex called the ribosome which consists of RNAs and proteins. Ribosomes are able to decode the genetic information that is held in the mRNA and carry out the synthesis of the proteins. There are two distinct mechanisms by which mRNAs can interact with the ribosomes. The most common mechanism requires the binding of a protein complex to the 5' end of the mRNA and this complex then recruits the ribosome. However, certain mRNAs contain 5' regions that do not code for sections of proteins (termed untranslated regions; UTRs) and these sequences of RNA harbour the information that is required to form a complex RNA structure. These RNA structures allow the ribosome to be recruited to the mRNA generally a considerable distance from the 5' end and so this method of ribosome recruitment has been termed internal ribosome entry. Interestingly, messages that use internal ribosome entry generally encode proteins that are used under situations of cell stress including under temperature reduction (cold-shock). This information is of industrial relevance since the production of commercially valuable proteins (e.g. antibodies) is hindered when cells become stressed later in culture and by the cold-shock that is commonly induced during fermentation. We aim to use the 5' UTRs of mRNAs that are translationally active during cold-shock to enhance the production of proteins that are important to industry. Achieving this is very important as it is expected that with an increasing number of protein 'drugs' being developed we will lack the capability of producing large enough amounts to meet the required demand for these new drugs for the majority, as opposed to for those who can afford what must currently remain prohibitively expensive, but very effective, medicines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F018908/1","grantId":"BB/F018908/1","fundValue":"367628","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We have used these findings to understand how cultured mammalian cells engineered to express biotherapeutic recombinant proteins respond to changes in temperature and translation efficiency (how efficient they are are making the target recombinant protein) during culture.

The finding that the decrease in translation rate (protein synthesis) following hypothermia is mediated via phosphorylation of a specific protein eIF2alpha (subsequent grants have shown a second factor eEF2 is also key in its phosphorylation). This is accompanied by a selective decrease in the number of 40S ribosomal subunits and changes to the synthesis/turnover rates of other small ribosomal subunit associated proteins. \nii. Confirmation that upon coldshock there is an increased association with polysomes of specific mRNAs that are required for the stress response and that elements within the 5â€™ of these mRNAs allow their selective synthesis in the cold. \niii. That exposure of CHOK1 cells to hypothermia activates a specific signalling pathway (the ATR-p53-p21 signalling pathway) and is a key control mechanism upon hypothermia and that cold-induced changes in membrane lipid composition are correlated with the activation of this pathway. Further, that the molecular chaperonin CCT is central to the control of gene expression via the folding of translation eIF3 subunits. The identification of specific parts of mRNAs that are responsive to cold are being developed by ourselves for the potential to improved therapeutic recombinant protein production of high cost biological based drugs (e.g. antibodies) from cultured mammalian cells. These may be used by others as well to try and improve the amounts of these proteins that may be made and possibly to also improve the quality of such proteins for use in the clinic in the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions.
