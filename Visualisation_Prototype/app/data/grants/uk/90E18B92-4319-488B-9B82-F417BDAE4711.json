{"id":"90E18B92-4319-488B-9B82-F417BDAE4711","title":"Software and Hardware Architectures for High Performance Molecular Dynamics Simulation","abstractText":"This research project will develop and broaden knowledge, in both the UK and Japan, in the field of high performance molecular dynamics simulation using state-of-the-art computer technology. This will be achieved through exchange of experiences in the field between two world leading research institutions in the field, namely the University of Edinburgh in the UK and the RIKEN Institute in Yokohama, Japan. The project is timely as it coincides with the achievement of two major supercomputing platform developments, namely the Maxwell reconfigurable supercomputer at the University of Edinburgh, and the MDGRAPE-3 supercomputer at the RIKEN Institute. The latter has been developed specifically for protein interaction simulation and uses ASIC technology as hardware accelerators, whereas the former is a recent novel development in the field of high performance computing as it uses reconfigurable hardware technology (or FPGAs) as hardware accelerators. As such, mapping and benchmarking of various applications onto this new platform has just started. It is hoped that the experiences gained at the RIKEN Institute in molecular dynamics simulation and their mapping onto a high performance computer platform will help the ongoing work at the University of Edinburgh on the Maxwell machine. Equally, it is hoped that the experiences gained at the University of Edinburgh in building the Maxwell reconfigurable supercomputer will help the RIKEN institute in exploring the use of FPGA technology as a future accelerator technology for their MDGRAPE-3 supercomputer. Indeed, a major aspect of this project consists in studying the technological and economic viability of FPGAs as a platform for high performance computational biology. The multi-disciplinary nature of the project will also contribute towards the production of highly trained and knowledgeable researchers in the important field of high performance computational biology through dissemination of knowledge, skills, and best practices. It is hoped that this work will form the foundation of a long-term research collaboration partnership between the University of Edinburgh and the RIKEN Institute, which will attract other stakeholders from industry and beyond.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F038593/1","grantId":"EP/F038593/1","fundValue":"14801","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Khaled  Benkrid","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
