It will investigate more effective ways to improve the impact and uptake of educational technology in the classroom, such as supporting dialogue and interactions between research users, producers and intermediaries. It will examine existing evidence-based technologies which have and have not been successfully scaled up, in order to identify the key levers for achieving impact at a national level. The work will directly inform the scale up and dissemination of projects from EEF's dedicated digital technology funding round.&nbsp;</p>\n&nbsp;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L00738X/1","grantId":"ES/L00738X/1","fundValue":"179783","fundStart":"2013-09-02","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Mark  Sharples","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
