{"id":"D2095B7C-9878-4451-82D0-9E23ABC3D42A","title":"Northern Peripheries: An Interdisciplinary Network","abstractText":"In the UK, northern regions are often distinguished by reputations (and occasional realities) of harsh climate, emptiness, atrophy (both social and economic) and disjunction (both geographically and relationally) from centralised nodes of power. Imaginings such as these have been further narrated, and circulated throughout diverse forms of political and cultural representation; with characteristics of insularity and pre- or anti-modern 'otherness' - often synonymous with the (primitive, mythical) past - generally prevailing. \n\nIn an attempt to counter such readings, this proposal, by way of marked contrast, contends that northern regions can be more positively perceived as hybrid, generative and transgressive. These are properties both constructed by and emergent through these regions' implication in multiple and heterogeneous networks; networks that are, at once, local and global, transcultural and transnational, and which work collectively to enhance more positive narratives and performances of place and locality. Indeed, the proposal's stated aim - of forging a vibrant interdisciplinary network focusing on historical, present and future representations and practices in relation to a range of sites, including specific sections of the English-Scottish border, and the island locations of Lindisfarne, Skye, Orkney and Shetland - turns on an understanding of these sites as performative and relational; as continuously reforming 'collective' creations. Hence, the Network's concern lies not with the reading of these sites as fixed entities, but as emergent through social interaction and embodiment. As such, it promises to uncover important new knowledge of value and relevance to the academics, communities and policy-makers constituting the network (all of whom are currently immersed in debates relevant to the planned research), and others in similar geographical and relational situations, including those residing on the northern margins of Europe. \n\nIndeed, it is with northern regions more generally in mind that the two-day conference, 'Northern peripheries now' will, in particular, bear witness to important international (comparative) perspectives on the status of the UK's 'Northern Peripheries', both from distinguished academics and from various of the public, private and third sector organisations enrolled in the wider workshop events. Lead by appropriate network members and focussed around key research themes - including, 'Land and Language', 'Transcultural and transnational northern peripheries' and 'Reframing northern spaces' - each will comprise presentations and group discussion; screenings, exhibitions and installations; and visits to archives and sites specially selected for collaborative research and practice. \n\nIn different ways, each of the above-cited elements promises to support and underpin the Network's main promised outputs: a special edition of the international peer-reviewed journal Visual Studies; an interdisciplinary anthology of essays co-edited by Holt and McClanahan on behalf of Edinburgh University Press; a two-day conference - Northern Peripheries Now - and the Network-curated exhibition - The Journey North - whose formal launch the conference will additionally mark and celebrate; and the Network's dedicated website.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K005030/1","grantId":"AH/K005030/1","fundValue":"23871","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Each network event generated key points which effectively shaped subsequent events, informed present and future planned publications and culminated in the structure and choice of participants at the closing conference.

Through inter and multi-disciplinary consideration of creative engagements and interpretations in particular, the network has proposed ways of 'furthering' the interests of the north, geographically and culturally. The network has outlined the value of multi- and inter-disciplinary perspectives and of collaborative engagements in developing ways of understanding the past, present and future of particular northern environments Creative Economy,Energy,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
