{"id":"C6043474-8B3C-4134-A2D2-9DC3F5CE7940","title":"Advanced SOFC technologies for low carbon, energy efficient and affordable power","abstractText":"This project involves the research, design, development and validation of complex Solid Oxide Fuel systems for stationary power generation applications. It leverages unique aerospace system integration techniques to address durability, power density, high efficiency and affordability. The work packages range from basic research on ceramics and system materials, thermal cycles and innovative components, through to applied research into the design and development of sub-systems and testing of integrated systems. The research programme will be conducted in collaboration with predominantly UK companies and universities, and will complement work already funded by EPSRC, Carbon Trust and EMDA; it will also leverage work being undertaken in Singapore, USA and Europe where state support has been successfully attracted. The programme will reinforce the UK as a leader in this environmentally friendly fuel cell technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E010105/1","grantId":"DT/E010105/1","fundValue":"262311","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Walter  Johnstone","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":" Techniques to measure the concentrations of specific gases (mainly methane and water vapour) extracted from various active regions of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) at temperatures of over 800C and pressures up to 8 atmospheres were successfully realised and tested in situ. Spectroscopic analytical tools, hardware, software and measurement procedures were researched, developed and validated for this purpose during the course of the programme. Indeed Rolls-Royce Fuel Cells Systems (RRFCS) stated that these are the only viable techniques to make such measurements in future commercial products. Indeed, RRFCS, with our assistance are still using these approaches in their research and development programmes and are intending to develop the techniques further to become suitable for commercial product. Strathclyde is continuing to assist them in moving towards that. \n\nSome of the key findings were published as follows: M Lengden, R Cunningham and W. Johnstone, &quot;Tuneable diode laser gas analyser for methane measurements on a large scale solid oxide fuel cell&quot; Journal of Power Sources, 196, 20, pp8406-08 2011 DOI: 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.020.\n\nIn addition further work has beed submitted recently for publication in Journal of Lightwave Technology. Instruments have been built by OptoSci Ltd. for use by Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Ltd. (RRFCS) to measure methane and water concentration at strategic points in their solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) development set-ups. They are now in use and assisting RRFCS in their research and development programmes. RRFCS have stated that the technology developed under this programme is the preferred approach to in-situ, real time health monitoring in future commercial products. It is planned to develop Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
