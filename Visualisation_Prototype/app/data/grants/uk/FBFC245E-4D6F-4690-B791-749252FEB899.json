Poor mental health impacts on the welfare of afflicted individuals as well as the social and economic development of societies. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common mental health disturbances in women. The peri-menopause is another time in women's lives that is characterised by psychological distress. Depressive illness also has a high prevalence in women. Despite the female bias in mental health disorders, the vast majority of basic research into psychiatric diseases and development of new drug treatments continues to be carried out almost exclusively using male animal models. \n\nOur programme of research has been designed to educate th public about mental health issues specifically related to women. We also aim to improve training got young research workers in order to strengthen the research base in the field of female mental health. There are three main objectives: \n\n1.to consolidate and expand an existing collaboration between research groups in the UK and Brazil working on female mental health disorders\n2. to set up training programme for young scientists on the special approaches required for research on females \n3. to develop an educational programme to stimulate public engagement and understanding of mental health issues.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M026574/1","grantId":"MR/M026574/1","fundValue":"48410","fundStart":"2015-01-31","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Thelma  Lovick","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
