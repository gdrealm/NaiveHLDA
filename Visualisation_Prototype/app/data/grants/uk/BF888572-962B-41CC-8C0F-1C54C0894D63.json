Additionally, they face significant price volatility and\noverall cost for Ag electrode structures. Second and third generation PV cell manufacturers also face high costs for ITO\nand high performance TCO coated glass. Therefore technologies that enable cell efficiency gains and that facilitate the\nreplacement of expensive materials with cost effective alternatives generate strong business opportunities. The HIPROSPECTS\nteam will deliver a high resolution (&lt; 3 microns) electrostatic ink jet (ESJET) technology capable of printing\ncost effective nano Cu front contact electrodes for Si cells and fine line Cu grid structures as a cost effective alternative to\nITO. In addition, the team will develop Si-Perovskite tandem cells with an efficiency of up to 26% at a cost &lt; &pound;230/ kWp.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N509917/1","grantId":"EP/N509917/1","fundValue":"247698","fundStart":"2016-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Paul Whitfield  Stark","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
