{"id":"1D2A990A-5D7C-4DFF-8185-52D26AACBC3B","title":"New wheat root ideotypes for improved resource use efficiency and yield performance in reduced input agriculture","abstractText":"This proposal for LINK funded project will build on a solid base of work currently underway, funded through existing LINK programmes, BBSRC, directly by industry, the Scottish Government and the NIAB Trust fund. The proposed study will seek to initiate a better understanding of wheat root growth, morphology and functional relationships with nutrient and water uptake. Methods to describe roots in a diverse range of winter wheat types will be implemented in controlled glasshouse conditions and in the field. The project will form the foundation for improving nutrient sequestration and conversion in this important UK crop through initiation of pre-breeding and development of ideal root ideotypes suitable for use in current and future wheat production. The consortium will concentrate on efficient or enhanced use of resources, especially nitrogen and phosphate and will consider interactions with water availability. In addition, the importance of interactions with beneficial mycorrhizal fungi on nutrient sequestration and the negative impact of soil-borne pathogenic fungi on susceptible genotypes will be considered under field conditions. Finally, the potential impact of agrochemical seed coats on root performance will be assessed. Overall, research in root biology leading to increases in nutrient uptake efficiency will contribute to reductions in diffuse pollution and will substantially reduce green house gas emission due a reduction in the use of nitrogen fertilisers in wheat cultivation","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H014373/1","grantId":"BB/H014373/1","fundValue":"95521","fundStart":"2011-06-16","fundEnd":"2015-06-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The results are available to our LINK project partners, who include seed and agrochemical companies. There is a potential to expand the method to monitor disease agents as well as beneficial fungi. The project is ongoing, so no direct impact has arisen yet.

These fungi are important symbionts, supplying phosphorus to the plants and sometimes conferring other benefits including protection against drought and disease. The methods can be used to improve our understanding of the role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing sustainable crop production, and potentially to allow us to intervene to improve the outcomes.
