Thomas, Macklin, Smith and Gamarra Summary Malaria is a vector borne disease - we become infected by the bite of an infected mosquito. There is currently great concern that climate change may improve conditions for many disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, and that diseases like malaria will increase. The main burden of this disease falls in Africa, where changes in rainfall and temperature are projected to occur over the next century. While we have a reasonably good understanding, from laboratory studies, of how changed temperature may effect mosquito populations, we have very little on the effect of changed rainfall, which controls the availability of mosquito breeding sites. The distribution of these breeding sites in relation to human hosts is the main driver of local epidemiology, and in many locations across Africa it is likely that changes in precipitation, not temperature, will drive changes in transmission. This is the critical gap our project aims to fill, not by developing new science, but by adding value to existing knowledge by coupling different disciplines. Modern challenges require interdisciplinary thinking, and our project is an example of this. We aim to link well-established tools from geophyscial hydrology with mathematical models of malaria transmission, models that have been around for over 50 years. To quantify this relationship we will spend a year in the field in Tanzania, with a parallel program of hydrology and entomology, working in a large valley with the highest levels of malaria transmission in the world. We will then spend a further year analyzing the data and linking the mathematics. Our idea is that if we can predict where the breeding sites for vector mosquitoes will be at any given time, based on rainfall and terrain, we can estimate the malaria transmission. If we can prove this simple idea works, it will pave the way for future studies linking climate change projections to impact on this disease in Africa. It may also prove useful for health planners: it may prove more effective to target resources in key locations, and it may be that different interventions are more effective in different landscapes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H022740/1","grantId":"NE/H022740/1","fundValue":"504530","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  High resolution malaria incidence mapping is being developed by our Tanzanian partners and other stakeholders for operational use.

In this project we investigated this through process-based understanding of habitat hydrology and geomorphology.\n\nWe conducted the first catchment scale study of fine resolution spatial and temporal variation in Anopheles habitat and productivity in relation to rainfall, hydrology and geomorphology for a high malaria transmission area of Tanzania. Monthly aggregates of rainfall, river stage and water table were not significantly related to the abundance of vector larvae at individual sites. However, these metrics showed strong explanatory power to predict mosquito larval abundances after stratification by water body type, with a clear seasonal trend for each, defined on the basis of its geomorphological setting and origin.\nWe have therefore discovered that hydrological and geomorphological processes governing the availability and productivity of Anopheles breeding habitat need to be understood at the local scale in order to effectively target larval source interventions. Mapping and monitoring these processes is a well-established practice providing a tractable way forward for developing important malaria management tools, particularly in combination with high-resolution satellite remote sensing. We have shown that local geomorphological and hydrological characterisation is required in order to interpret which water bodies are 'turning on or off' for mosquito production. This varies with rainfall so is a dynamic process. Moreover each water body type appears to follow a characterisitic trajectory of suitability thus presenting the potential for predictive mapping - perhaps up to several weeks in advance of peak productivity. Hydrological and meteorological instrumentation of landscapes such as conducted here is not feasible outside test areas. However, high-resolution (time, space) radar remote sensing of water bodies can now be considered (we have previously piloted this with the European Space Agency), now that we understand that the imagery needs to be interpreted in relation to local hydrology and geomorphology. We have shown the salient features can be characterised from high resolution terrain models and archive optical satellite imagery. We are thus working toward near real-time monitoring of the environment and prediction of malaria mosquito production, in order to target local interventions.
