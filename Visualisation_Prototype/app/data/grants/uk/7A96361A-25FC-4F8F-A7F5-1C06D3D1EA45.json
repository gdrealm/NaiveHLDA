Secondly, focusing on individual behaviours as 'entry points' for policies, it will investigate the patterning of health and environmental behaviours through a scoping review of existing studies and analyses of the UK Household Longitudinal Study.&nbsp; In addition, it will commission questions in the ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey to examine the weight that people give to policies that promote their health relative to the health of children and grandchildren.</p>\n\n<p>The project team will work closely with research and policy leaders of key local organisations, national bodies and international programmes. Outputs from the project will be shared with the research leaders and policy leaders groups and the wider stakeholder community through an innovative engagement programme.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003015/1","grantId":"ES/L003015/1","fundValue":"199271","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Hilary  Graham","coPersons":["Piran  White"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
