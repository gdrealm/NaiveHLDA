Without prejudice to other disciplines we developed the architecture - psychoanalysis collaboration as a worked example. The project has 5 components: \n\n Literature review of humanities databases beginning with keywords 'architecture and community'; \n Paper based on this work titled â€žArchitecture and its Communities? drafted by Thomas Deckker;\n Study visit to recent housing in the Netherlands in which social science and humanities people advised the design team; \n Symposium in Dundee: a presentation of findings to our humanities advisory group + a discussion of future collaborative research; \n Proposals for collaborative research with the humanities disciplines (item 9 of this report + appendixes 1&amp;2).\n\nRegarding architecture research,... The resolution of a complex plan - like the resolution of an argument in philosophy - is itself the affirmative answer to a research question. Additionally architecture has a long legacy of mapping projects, in which the social relations and affections of a community can be visualised and spatialised as part of a research project.\n\n'Architecture and its Communities' and the IJburg study will be published in architecture journals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J501146/1","grantId":"AH/J501146/1","fundValue":"24209","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lorens  Holm","coPersons":["Neil Keith Burford"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" Although architecture is acknowledged by the literature of the humanities and the social sciences to have a role in the creating of communities, this role is for the most part understood in a limited and trivial way. This is perplexing to architects, who are trained to be stewards of the built environment, and who regard the built environment as the single most important platform for communities.
