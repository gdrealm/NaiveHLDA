This disorder is not only associated with higher health care utilisation and impaired quality of life, but it is also highly comorbid with psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety. </p> \n<p>This project aims to integrate research from different fields by obtaining information via postal questionnaires on symptoms of insomnia, associated emotional and behavioural problems, cognitive style and life events in a genetically sensitive sample of approximately 2000 young adults comprising sibling and twin pairs who are all part of the ongoing Genesis 12-19 (G1219) study. </p> \n<p>Five specific research areas concerning the heritability of different types of sleep problems and associations with other difficulties and risk factors will initially be addressed. The project will examine:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>genetic and environmental influences on different subtypes of insomnia;</li> \n <li>genetic and environmental influences on insomnia in males and females separately;</li> \n <li>concurrent and longitudinal links between insomnia and behavioural and emotional problems;</li> \n <li>associations between insomnia and different cognitive styles; and</li> \n <li>whether there are associations between genetic and environmental factors influencing insomnia. <br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E019943/1","grantId":"ES/E019943/1","fundValue":"79337","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alice Maria Gregory","coPersons":["Fruhling Vesta Rijsdijk","Thalia Catherine Eley","Barbara  Maughan"],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
