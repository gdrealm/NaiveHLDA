It's unique feature is that it is capable of processing contaminated and mixed waste from end-of-life components. In this project commercial applications for the carbon fibre recyclate will be developed. The recyclate processing route will be to make non-woven fabrics using technology already demonstrated by the Collaborating Partner and then develop end markets for this material.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I502009/1","grantId":"EP/I502009/1","fundValue":"100768","fundStart":"2011-10-17","fundEnd":"2012-10-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen John Pickering","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
