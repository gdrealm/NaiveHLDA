{"id":"DF6584D5-A4A9-4660-AD23-C757C3F63D72","title":"Establishing an R+D collaboration to improve antimicrobial prescribing in primary care","abstractText":"Resistance to antimicrobials (eg antibiotics) is a significant health problem and is driven by antimicrobial prescribing patterns. The majority of antimicrobial prescribing for humans in the UK is by GPs, but efforts to change prescribing patterns have so far met with limited success. A R+D collaboration is to be established between the key functions of the Health Protection Agency and 3 Universities with complimentary expertise relevant to improving antimicrobial prescribing in primary care. The collaboration will achieve its objectives via 4 mechanisms:\n - ensuring that best practice guidance on antimicrobial prescribing is available to GPs and other primary care staff and regularly updated.\n - ensuring that best practice on how to change prescribing in primary care is identified, publicised and regularly updated.\n - developing and establishing a system for routinely monitoring antimicrobial prescribing in primary care to assess implementation of recommendations and to act as a tool for furure research.\n - acting as a focus for further research bids in this area.\nThis bid is for a project manager to implement the collaboration and organise bids for funding to develop the 4 strands of work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701560","grantId":"G0701560","fundValue":"61610","fundStart":"2008-01-14","fundEnd":"2008-10-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  Hawker","coPersons":["Georgia  Duckworth","Gillian  Smith","Cliodna  McNulty","Andrew  Hayward","Christopher John HYDE","Babatunde  Olowokure","Heath  Heatlie","James  Bashford"],"organisation":"Public Health England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
