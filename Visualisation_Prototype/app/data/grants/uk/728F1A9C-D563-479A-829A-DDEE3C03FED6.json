But with such a complex and busy network of roads, it does not take much for rush hour to go wrong: just one breakdown can mean gridlock, particularly if the system is already made vulnerable by roadworks. Brains are similar: normally they work well when left to their own devices, but complex diseases like schizophrenia (which afflicts around 1 in 100 people) emerge from very subtle causes, particularly in patients already made vulnerable, by drug abuse for example. Unfortunately, effective treatment of schizophrenia is still hampered by the fact that we do not know exactly what these complex causes are.\nWe do know that the most important vulnerability factor is family history. If you inherit a faulty secondhand car ? even if it works at first ? it may be you that breaks down and causes rush hour chaos. And if someone in your family has schizophrenia, genes you inherit from them increase your risk of developing the disease. Identifying these genetic faults is therefore critical, since it allows us to identify people at risk, to understand disease mechanism by studying the mechanics of what particular genes contribute to brain function, and hopefully to develop better treatments.\nOur recent work surveying around 60,000 people, their genes and their diseases has identified variations in one particular gene consistently linked to schizophrenia. But for this information to be useful, we need to understand what the gene does and why particular versions of it put people at risk of developing debilitating psychotic, depressive and learning problems. To do this, we have engineered mice that also carry variations in the mouse equivalent of the schizophrenia-linked gene. This project will study brain structure, behaviour and brain activity of these mice to see if they share any features in common with schizophrenia patients (e.g. changes in anxiety, learning and memory, sleep). Although schizophrenia cannot be modeled fully in mice, showing that subtle variations of this gene cause symptoms reminiscent of the disease in animal models will provide direct evidence that it is the culprit. These models can then be used to develop and test better therapies that keep brain traffic flowing smoothly.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002179","grantId":"G1002179","fundValue":"875159","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Lawrence Stephen Wilkinson","coPersons":["Michael John Owen","Matthew Warwick Jones","Michael  O Donovan"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
