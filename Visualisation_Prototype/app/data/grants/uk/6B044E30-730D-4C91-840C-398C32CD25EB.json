{"id":"6B044E30-730D-4C91-840C-398C32CD25EB","title":"Identification of protective Chalmydia antigens using a novel technology","abstractText":"BBSRC funded research led to the discovery of a unique approach to identify antigens that confer protective immunity. This approach, known as Protecta Antigen Finding (PAF) allows discrimination of pathogen-derived antigens that mediate protection from the larger cohort that simply stimulate a response. PAF has stimulated significant interest within the vaccine industry, Seed Fund and Venture Capital sectors. To realise the commercial potential of PAF we have demonstrated PAF utility in vaginal Chlamydia infection. The key objective of this FOF application is to perform the next phase of PAF and identify the antigens that afford protection. A panel of new protective antigens against Chlamydia will provide a foundation for commercial exploitation via spin-out and/or licensing routes. The PAF project has a solid IP platform and has attracted a small amount of seed funding and developed a robust commercial and technical plan necessary to succeed in this competitive and high impact arena.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J010855/1","grantId":"BB/J010855/1","fundValue":"156608","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Adrian  Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
