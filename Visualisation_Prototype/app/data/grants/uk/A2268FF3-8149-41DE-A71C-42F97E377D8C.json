It is estimated that Campylobacter infections cost the UK economy around &pound;1 billion per year. Infection is characterised by acute and sometimes bloody diarrhoea, particularly in children. The last few years have seen a marked rise in cases in compromised elderly populations and in such people, particularly those with bowel cancer, infection can be fatal. Chicken meat is the most important source and vehicle for human Campylobacter infections and around 80% of chickens on sale in the UK are Campylobacter-positive. Campylobacter are natural inhabitants of the intestinal tract of chickens and other food animals. Contamination of chicken meat takes two forms. Carcass surfaces can carry high levels of Campylobacter and this can lead to cross-contamination in both domestic and commercial catering. This is an important risk factor for infection. However, and perhaps more importantly, Campylobacter have been recovered from deep muscle tissues of up to 27% of chickens tested. Furthermore, liver tissues are also commonly contaminated. In these tissues the bacteria will be better protected from the effects of cooking. Undercooked chicken meat and chicken liver pate are internationally important vehicles of Campylobacter infection. To improve public health in the UK it is essential that the number of contaminated chickens on sale is reduced. The proposed research will examine the different systems in which UK chickens are grown to identify cost-effective farm-based control options. Our work will focus on chickens reared intensively in housed systems as these comprise ~90% of the UK market. The work will be in collaboration with the three biggest poultry producers in the UK and all the major UK food retailers are giving financial support. The proposed research builds on past studies which showed that chikens (broilers) reared under higher welfare systems are less likely to have Campylobacter than birds reared more intensively. The higher welfare systems generally use slower-growing birds and stock houses with fewer birds than the more intensive systems. Our work showed that birds reared in the more intensive system had poorer welfare, as shown by high rates of endemic disease and general health and leg problems. This might explain why these birds were more likely to be Campylobacter-positive, as birds compromised by poor health and/or welfare are more susceptible to these bacteria. These differences might be due to the birds used and/or the in-house environment and we will determine this. Our field work might also indicate that the slower-growing bird types may be inherently more Campylobacter-resistant. We will conduct longitudinal studies on flocks reared under different systems and determine when birds first become Campylobacter-positive and relate this to changes in bird health and welfare. We will also determine whether the spread of Campylobacter from the intestine of the birds to edible tissues like liver occurs on farm and if it is linked to poor welfare for endemic disease. Our aim is to provide the UK poultry industry with science-based and cost-effective control options, which will help it meet customer demands and comply with forth-coming EU legislation aimed at reducing the number of chickens that are Campylobacter-positive.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I024674/1","grantId":"BB/I024674/1","fundValue":"458538","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Understanding the impact of Campylobacter on chicken welfare is a factor in driving change in chicken breeds used for meat production.\n\nBetter understanding of where carcass can be contaminated in processing.\n\nImpacts fed directly to industry via stakeholder meetings.

This can lead to diarrhoea and as a result of the birds standing on wet litter, it can lead to damage on their feet and legs.\nWe have also shown how Campylobacter spreads through a flock and that there is huge variation between different strains or types of Campylobacter in where they infect and the risk they pose in causing human disease. 1.
