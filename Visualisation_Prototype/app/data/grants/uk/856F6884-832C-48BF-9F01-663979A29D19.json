It will enable clearer identification of the values and their social and ethical implications and, as such, will help policymakers to reason more cogently in their deliberations and, ultimately, to render their decisions more socially justifiable.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J011061/1","grantId":"ES/J011061/1","fundValue":"78257","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The framework developed in the project has been converted into a social values audit tool that is currently being applied and developed as part of a London Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) project, run by Professor Peter Littlejohns of KCL Medical School. The intention is that it be applied internally by and externally to decision-making organisations such as CCGs for improved transparency.

However, the key insight from the research is that social values, other than benefit maximization, play an important role in determining a justifiable and politically accountable allocation of health care resources. This is set out in various publications associated with the award. I am continuing to collaborate with Professor Peter Littlejohns in on-going work to extend to a wide range of health care commissioners the use of the template. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
