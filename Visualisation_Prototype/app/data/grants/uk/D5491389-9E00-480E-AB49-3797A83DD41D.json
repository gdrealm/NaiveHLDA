It seeks to fill an evident knowledge gap regarding the relevance of China’s misunderstood past to its eye-catching present and important future via a more thorough investigation of a period whose relevance has escaped the academic and policymaking community alike.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The study will explore the hypothesis that decisions and choices made (not necessarily consciously) during the 1970s laid the foundations for the economic growth that would fuel China’s rise to its current status of potential challenger to US economic pre-eminence. To explore this idea, the project team will analyse the relationship between domestic developments within China and Hong Kong; the great change of emphasis within China, from ideological warfare to modernisation and economic development; Hong Kong’s role in the reorientation of China; and the relationship between these phenomena and broader global patterns of the 1970s.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010468/1","grantId":"ES/K010468/1","fundValue":"83568","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The purpose is to do research on the relationship between the transformation of China in the 1970s and processes of global change.
