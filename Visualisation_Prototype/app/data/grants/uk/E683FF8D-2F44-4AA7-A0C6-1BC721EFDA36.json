{"id":"E683FF8D-2F44-4AA7-A0C6-1BC721EFDA36","title":"Ethnic differences in diet, physical activity and obesity","abstractText":"<p>In England more than half of all adults are classified as being overweight or obese; among children aged 2-15, over one in five boys (22 per cent) and over one in four girls (27 per cent) are overweight or obese. This study is concerned with ethnic differences in two of the most important factors in causing obesity: diet and physical activity. The Department of Health has set recommended levels for both and has launched public education campaigns to meet those levels. However, such intervention strategies need to recognize cultural and gender differences both between and within ethnic groups.</p>\n\n<p>This study uses the 1999 and 2004 ethnic boosts of the Health Survey for England (HSE) to examine ethnic differences in diet, physical activity and Body Mass Index based on factors such as gender, age, education, social class, religion and length of residence in the UK. The research also looks at how parental behaviour influences children's eating patterns and level of physical activity. Data is available for 1999 and 2004 and so the research will examine any observed change of behaviour in response to government campaigns. The project will also include a small element of methodological work related to dealing with item non-response.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F003285/1","grantId":"ES/F003285/1","fundValue":"74099","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Vanessa  Higgins","coPersons":["Angela  Dale"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
