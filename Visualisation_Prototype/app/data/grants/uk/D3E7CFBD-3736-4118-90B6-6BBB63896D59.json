Research participants will also be observed acting in management and leadership roles at school. Based upon findings from the above the Project intends to develop rich descriptions of school organisational practice in specific school contexts. By knowing more about the distributed school leadership the intention of the Project is to contribute to debates and the development of strategies about how organisational arrangements might be created to support and enable learners.</p>\n\n<p>It is also intended to contribute to debates and strategies relating to the leadership of teachers and to better understand the limits and possibilities for distributed leadership<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H003177/1","grantId":"ES/H003177/1","fundValue":"78414","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David John  Hall","coPersons":["Helen  Gunter"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
