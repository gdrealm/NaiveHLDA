Hormones are mobile molecules that carry signals to coordinate growth and initiate responses to environmental cues. Auxin is a very important hormone in plants because it is involved in mediating almost every aspect of a plant's life, from embryogenesis to responses to gravity. In order for auxin to trigger all these responses it needs a receptor, a protein which binds the auxin and in doing so acts as a molecular switch, initiating a chain of events that ultimately leads to an appropriate change in the plant's development. We have recently identified a protein called TIR1 as an auxin receptor and this proposal describes a set of experiments that allows us to link whole plant responses to auxin back to the molecular events of auxin perception by TIR1. Aims and objectives: As noted above, auxin is involved in many very different developmental responses. Therefore an important question in plant biology is; how can this one molecular signal give rise to so many outcomes correctly? TIR1 turns out to be a member of a small family of related auxin receptors in the model plant Arabidopsis and it is apparent that there are differences in the receptor activity of these family members. To begin to understand these differences, once we have described auxin binding to TIR1, we will compare the rates and affinities of binding to each family member to identify the molecular basis of these differences. Once auxin is bound to TIR1 and its family members they act by binding another family of proteins, caled Aux/IAAs, which are then labelled for degradation. This degradation allows auxin-regulated genes to be switched on and a cascade of secondary reactions then proceeds. To determine whether or not each receptor has a preference for these Aux/IAA targets we will measure the reaction rates for association and dissociation with a representative sets of Aux/IAAs in both the presence and absence of auxin. These data will give us a matrix of interaction preferences and indicate a molecular basis for specificity, with high affinities in the presence of auxin likely to maximise the chances that this target will be degraded. To be sure that these measurements are relevant in intact, living plants the lifetimes of these target proteins will be measured. We will also generate mutant versions of Arabidopsis which lack particular receptor proteins, or present altered versions of receptors, and relate the auxin responsiveness of these plants to their genetic makeup and our biochemical data. These complementary datasets will add robustness and allow us to quantify the contribution played by selectivity at the receptor complex in specifying particular auxin responses. Potential applications and benefits: The data collected above all relate to the action of the natural plant auxin IAA. However, there are many synthetic auxins used in research and in agriculture and they each have slightly different activities. Examples of agricultural use include treatments to flowers, fruits and nuts and also as selective weedkillers. Auxinic weedkillers kill broadleaved plants, not cereals and grasses and are of great agricultural value. In order to address how these auxins can be selective we will perform experiments on cereal versions of TIR1 and compare both genetic and biochemical similarities and differences. Further, using both types of receptor we will establish a test system to help design and screen new compounds with auxin-like or antagonistic behaviour with the aim of creating a new generation of safe, selective and low dosage agricultural tools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F013981/1","grantId":"BB/F013981/1","fundValue":"290558","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  To date impacts have been principally academic although, given the commercial value of auxinic herbicides, it is likely that our findings are in use by Ag-Biotech companies in the development of new herbicides chemistries.

The list includes root hair formation formation, the extent of lateral branching in the both the root and the shoot, and the angle at which plant organs grow with respect to gravity. These are all traits which are becoming increasingly important targets in crop improvement programs. Further understanding of how auxin signals are recognized and translated into this array of responses will therefore help in the battle for future food security. This project has helped us understand how one such a tiny chemical signal can mediate in such a huge variety of responses. \n\nOne of the key players in the perception machinery is the small family of auxin receptor proteins known as the TIR1/AFBs. We have isolated representatives of this family and used biophysical and biochemical measurements to watch how fast they bind auxin and how fast they separate again. In fact, we found that a third party, a substrate protein, was also required to make up a co-receptor complex. These co-receptors are called Aux/IAA repressor proteins, transcription factors that act to repress the expression of auxin-regulated genes. After binding in the auxin co-receptor complex the Aux/IAAs are modified to carry a signal that marks them for rapid breakdown. In this way auxins regulate the expression of many hundreds of genes. Understanding the molecular detail of this three-way association of hormone (auxin) and two, distinct co-receptor partners that each contribute to the active site for the hormone is novel. It may also help us understand how other plant signals work.\n\nA number of studies have shown that individual TIR1/AFB proteins are specialized with respect to their biochemical properties and biological function. We have tested a range of different Aux/IAAs against different TIR/AFBs to work out the relative preferences of complex association. Some bind weakly, others strongly and we have been able to rank a matrix of interactors. By also comparing whole Aux/IAA proteins with selected sections of the same proteins we have been able to specify parts of the structure that are important for co-receptor binding. Understanding which complexes may form in vivo helps explain how auxin may contribute to such a wide range of developmental responses and why different responses arise from different doses of hormone. \n\nA number of synthetic auxins are used commercially, especially as selective herbicides. We have used a diversity of these and other, related compounds to establish that there is binding site selectivity conferred by the TIR/AFB co-receptor and, to a lesser extent by some Aux/IAAs. We have also developed a set of novel small molecules that can regulate the formation of the TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA receptor complex and this work has revealed new possibilities for the development of novel, more specific agrochemicals that can act as herbicides or even as beneficial plant growth enhancers. Further, we have adapted our biophysical techniques to devise a novel, fast laboratory screen to help discover new auxin-like and anti-auxin molecules. The screen has been validated using a small library of compounds from our commercial project partner. The need for new, effective, selective herbicides remains an important goal if we are to maximise food production from existing agricultural land areas.\n\nWe are left in no doubt over the complexity and diversity of the auxin perception mechanism, and many questions remain, but by being able to assign parameters to some of the interactions at the centre of auxin binding we have greatly improved our understanding of auxin perception and our ability to translate decades of research on auxin into meaningful opportunities for improving crop production and so food security. This work has laid the foundation for the development of novel agrochemicals for both crop protection (i.e. herbicides) and crop yield improvement Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
