After each of a series of eight taped listening activities teachers will either provide information about new target vocabulary via a codeswitch or by French definition or paraphrase. The vocabulary will include concrete and abstract, cognate and non-cognate, and low and high frequency lexical items. Post and delayed&nbsp;tests will measure vocabulary gains in a sample of 180 students via the two approaches and these in turn will be compared to a control group of 60 students not receiving the lexical information. To determine the most effective pedagogical approach, additionally, a sub-sample of 18 students will take part in stimulated recall of listening activities and be asked to report what their strategies were for dealing with the new vocabulary when confronted with the two teaching approaches. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G036209/1","grantId":"ES/G036209/1","fundValue":"157841","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ernesto  Macaro","coPersons":["Victoria  Murphy"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
