Since the Russian Federation was created in 1992, there has been one turnover in leadership. The constitution's term-limits clause should prevent President Putin from standing for re-election in March, 2008. However, the clause could be amended or ignored.</p>\n\n<p>The project's aim is to test whether popular support for the Russian regime has become durable or will be altered by the challenge of term-limits. It will extend a unique trend data set, the New Russia Barometer, started in 1992, to the year 2009. We will produce innovative statistics to test the effect of the passage of time, since the longer a regime endures, the stronger the pressure on individuals to accept what elites supply, even if it is not what they want. Russia's energy resources make it important for British and G-8 policymakers and businesses to understand the risks arising from a change in Russia's leadership. </p>\n\n<p>The CSPP website, <a href=\"http://www.abdn.ac.uk/cspp\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.abdn.ac.uk/cspp</a> and <a href=\"http://www.russiavotes.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.RussiaVotes.org</a> will disseminate results promptly from monthly sample surveys of Russian public opinion and long-term trend data.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0341","grantId":"RES-062-23-0341","fundValue":"425120","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Rose","coPersons":["William  Mishler"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
