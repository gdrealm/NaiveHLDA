The UK Collaborators will first investigate the gaze strategies that support expert compared to novice laparoscopy skill. Secondly, this research will examine if changes in gaze strategies accompany the breakdown of laparoscopy skills under pressure. The HK collaborators will build upon this work and test the efficacy of an intervention that uses an observational learning paradigm to train the gaze strategy of learner surgeons to mimic that of expert surgeons. </p>\n\n<p>The project is timely in that it is proposed during a period of flux in the health services of the UK and Hong Kong.

To date the research has had the most impact on academic surgeons and urologists, who are the readership of the journals in which we published. There is interest in how surgical curricula should be developed to support the acquisition of technical surgical skills (particularly in laparoscopy). The fact that two of our studies created sufficient interest to cause surgeons to respond by letters to the editor is testament to this interest. However, we have yet to directly inform current practice, although there is hope that we can initiate this work during the upcoming year. Healthcare ","person":"Mark  Wilson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" This bilateral project explored the role of experience, stress, and training in the performance of laparoscopic surgical skills. In Exeter, we first uncovered consistent expert-novice gaze strategy differences on a virtual reality simulator: Experts focused only on the object to be manipulated (&quot;target locking&quot;), whereas novices switched gaze between the target and their tools. We then developed two novel training protocols to teach novices to adopt this target locking gaze strategy: one using observational learning and one using a bespoke training template that implicitly guided the novice where to look. Not only did trainees using the gaze training programs learn the skills more quickly than those adopting traditional training instructions, but they were also more robust under stress. We further tested the validity of our gaze measurements by examining the eye movements of consultant surgeons in theatre. We found that they utilised similar gaze strategies as when performing virtual reality training tasks and simulated operations. \nIn Hong Kong, we manipulated stress in a variety of ways to determine how and why it might impact on technical skill performance in trainee surgeons. This included examining a personality characteristic (&quot;reinvestment&quot;) that influenced technical skill performance under stress, and developing a workload assessment questionnaire for surgery. This information was used to develop a laparoscopic training program (implicit learning) that used fewer attentional resources than traditional explicit instructions. Differences in attentional processing were assessed using brain imaging (EEG), uncovering advantages for implicit learning for performance under stress. From a clinical perspective, this project enabled us to gain further funding from a simulator company (Intuitive Surgical Ltd.) to see what the benefits of robotic surgery might be over traditional laparoscopic surgery.\nWe are also looking at the possibility of setting up workshops with surgeons at Exeter RD&amp;amp;amp;E hospital to translate our findings into practical training advice for trainee surgeons. \n\nMr McGrath (our surgical lead at Exeter hospital) is the Clinical Lead in the South West of England for SIMULATE (the new National Initiative by the British Association of Urology Surgeons [BAUS] to introduce simulation to all current and future UK urology trainees). Our collaborative group hope to inform SIMULATE curriculum by generating educational theory related to the transfer of motor learning to stressful environments, and indeed our current work is already cited on the SIMULATE website (www.surgical-simulation.com.) with more to follow. \n\nIn a separate industry we have also applied our training techniques developed in this grant to the military - with a grant from Dstl.
