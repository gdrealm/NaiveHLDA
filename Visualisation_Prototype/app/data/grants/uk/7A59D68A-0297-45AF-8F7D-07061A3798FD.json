{"id":"7A59D68A-0297-45AF-8F7D-07061A3798FD","title":"libhpc: Intelligent Component-based Development of HPC Applications","abstractText":"Libhpc aims build and demonstrate an environment for the component-based construction of HPC applications. This environment will enable method implementers to publish and share their contributions as multi-implementation adaptable components, shareable across domains and architectures, making them inherently more re-usable. End users will then be able to compose applications without reference to underlying machine or processor architectures. The aim of libhpc is to initiate a software development pattern for HPC that has knowledge capture and re-use at its core.Libhpc will be based on the combination of two long lines of research: that of Professor Sherwin in the development and application of spectral/hp element codes and that of Professor Darlington in the development of innovative application development methodologies. The project will take as its starting point the Nektar++ methods library and its application to the modelling of blood flow through an aortic arch. This application and the library will be re-factored to identify the necessary re-usable components and co-ordination forms required. These components will be designed and implemented, targeted at a variety of architectures, including, distributed memory clusters, shared memory clusters and GPU processors. A software methods repository with supporting meta-data will be constructed along with application-construction and mapping tools. This environment will then be used to re-express the aortic modelling application and map it systematically to a number of different architectures and machine configurations. These applications will be benchmarked to assess their performance and the improvement in human productivity and reusability gained.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I030239/1","grantId":"EP/I030239/1","fundValue":"483099","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Darlington","coPersons":["Spencer John Sherwin"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
