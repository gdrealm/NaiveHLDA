The combination of vomiting, diarrhoea and fever is extremely unpleasant. Though rarely fatal, noroviruses inflict a significant economic burden in terms of work absenteeism and the costs of hospitalisation (where the virus is often spread). Other caliciviruses infect domesticated animals and can harm the productivity of the biotechnology industry. Though simple in construction - caliciviruses consist of a protein shell surrounding a single molecule of RNA that encodes the virus genes - these pathogens have a complex replication cycle. We are particularly interested one of the smallest viral proteins, VPg, which is chemically attached to the start of the virus's RNA genome and has two unusual, but critical, roles in the virus replication cycle. Using a mechanism that has only recently been discovered and is still not well understood, VPg directs the viral RNA to the cell's protein synthesis machinery, as part of a covert operation to trick the cell into making virus proteins. Once new virus proteins have begun to accumulate, VPg can assume its second critical role, which is to initiate the process of making copies of the viral RNA for packaging into new virus particles. It does this by binding to the virus polymerase and serving as the attachment point for the synthesis of short chains of RNA that form the primers needed to initiate copying of the RNA genome. We propose to investigate how exactly VPg contributes to the initiation of viral protein synthesis and RNA replication by focusing on the mouse norovirus (MNV). This is an important model system for human norovirus infection, since it has a similar mode of replication and causes a very similar pattern of infection. The study of MNV is all the more important since it has so far proved impossible to work with human noroviruses in the laboratory. We have recently made significant breakthroughs by determining the structures of VPg from MNV (and from a related virus, feline calicivirus) and of the MNV polymerase. The VPg structures were a particular surprise since they had been widely supposed to be unstructured. However, they are extremely informative and have immediately suggested a novel hypothesis of how VPg interacts with the polymerase to kick-off RNA copying: we propose that VPg must unfold to interact productively with the enzyme. Moreover, one of our collaborators (I.G. Goodfellow) has recently shown that MNV binds to the middle domain of eIF4G, a key component of the cellular protein synthesis machinery. This interaction directs the translation of the viral RNA (to which VPg is attached) into the proteins needed for viral replication. These exciting preliminary results put us in a uniquely advantageous position to launch a new program of investigation that will significantly advance our understanding of how VPg works at the molecular level in driving calicivirus replication. We will round out our structural analysis of VPg by determining the structures of human norovirus VPg and that from RHDV (another type of calicivirus) that is deadly in rabbits. Our preliminary structural results have allowed us to design a program of work to fully characterise the mode of action of VPg in RNA replication (Does it unfold? What parts of VPg bind to the polymerase? Does the viral RNA aid that binding?). These experiments should enable us to determine the structure of the VPg-polymerase complex, the ultimate test of our mechanistic hypothesis. Finally, we will also be able to analyse in detail the interaction of MNV VPg with the middle domain eIF4G, though binding experiments and structural analysis by NMR or protein crystallography. In total our plan of investigation will provide a new level of understanding of key aspects of calicivirus replication.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J001708/1","grantId":"BB/J001708/1","fundValue":"371251","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our first findings from this project were published in 2013. Though of significant interest to scientists interested in noroviruses and mechanisms of translation initiation, they have yet to have much broader impact. I used the research in a blogpost discussing the messy nature of scientific results (see Engagement activities). We are also presently exploring the potential of using some of our findings in the development of antiviral drugs. This is at a very early stage and will require additional funding.

This project aims to investigate the structure and function of a small protein, VPg, that is chemically attached to the RNA genome of caliciviruses. The protein plays important roles in RNA reproduction and translation of the RNA genome in to viral proteins during infection. Caliciviruses include noroviruses which cause the dreaded winter vomiting bug. \n\nThe project is still ongoing. \n\nKey findings include: \n\n- determination of the structures of VPg proteins from feline calicivirus (FCV) and murine norovirus (MNV) and demonstration that these have interesting similarities (a conserved helical core) and differences (different numbers of helices in the core).\n- testing of the hypothesis that VPg proteins have to unfold in order to interact productively with the viral polymerase (a requisite step in the initiation of RNA replication)\n- detailed investigation of the direct interaction between MNV VPg and the host cell protein eIF4G which is necessary for the initiation of viral protein synthesis We are presently exploring with the Drug Discovery Unit at Dundee to prospects of using the VPG-eIF4G interaction as a target for antiviral drug development.
