{"id":"1FAB6BAF-EACF-47A1-B21D-00F6E41BAE34","title":"Improving Educational Evaluation and Quality in China","abstractText":"This study is an essential and timely investigation of the nature and extent of school effectiveness in China using innovative quantitative methodology (multilevel modelling) and the local application of new evaluation methods to educational policy and practice in rural and urban secondary schools. The research seeks to provide new insights and extend current theories about (i) the impact of student characteristics, and classroom, school and contextual factors on students attainment and progress at school, (ii) the relevance of these factors in the evaluation of school performance in China and (iii) how western approaches to evaluating educational quality have been adapted and developed to take account of local contexts and priorities. It aims to provide quality in-depth data to enhance understanding of the complex nature of school effectiveness in China and how local context may play a key role in determining definitions of educational effectiveness and quality through two interrelated studies, and a systematic literature review, thereby addressing the lack of previous research on these topics. The studies are intended to lead to the development of innovation in school evaluation and guidelines for implementation via bottom-up and top-down dialogues involving key stakeholders (eg policy makers, LEA and examination officers, teachers, students).\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0353","grantId":"RES-167-25-0353","fundValue":"217346","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sally M Thomas","coPersons":["Wen-Jung  Peng"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
