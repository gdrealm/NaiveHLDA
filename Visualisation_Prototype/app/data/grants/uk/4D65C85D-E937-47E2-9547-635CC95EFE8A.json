The research program is entitled 'The production and application of Japanese alloys and patination' and will run from May 2007- April 2010. \\n\\nIn this application we seek funding to support research into the application of the niiro patination technique which is used to patinate irogane alloys. This research was outlined in the original fellowship application and is central to the overall research program. Funding from AHRC will ensure that the research is carried out to the highest quality. \\n\\nThe Western tradition of metal patination and colouring is based on the use of a small range of metals and alloys which are coloured by the application of a wide range of patination solutions. In contrast to this, Japanese metalworkers developed a wide range of irogane alloys which are coloured with a single patination solution (the niiro eki or boiling colour solution). This approach allows different alloys to be combined in one piece and patinated, producing a multi-coloured piece of metalwork.\\n\\nThere are several barriers to consistent niiro patination. For example, the frequent 'patchiness' of the colour obtained results in time consuming re-polishing and re-patination. Variations in colour and colour consistency make the planning of a workpiece difficult. There is disagreement amongst Japanese craftspeople on the optimum composition and correct application of the niiro patination solution. In this study we aim to develop a reliable and easy-to-use patination process using standard ingredients available in the UK.\\n\\nThe research will ask:\\n\\n1. How should the surface be prepared prior to patination to ensure even patination?\\n\\n2. How can we optimize the ingredients and composition of the niiro solution to achieve good patination on the alloys prepared in our earlier study?\\n\\n3. How should we apply the patination solution to the alloys?\\n\\n4. What is the full range of colours that we can achieve with the niiro patination solution?\\n\\nIt is proposed to study the effects of niiro colouration on the alloys developed in the previous proposal, paying particular attention to the performance of alloys produced and finished by hand and by semi-commercial processes. Traditional niiro solutions and solutions made with laboratory or commercial grade chemical agents will be tested on both samples and studio work, and any differences between them will be characterised. \\n\\nA limited number of researchers have published work on the chemistry of niiro patinated surfaces, on surface preparation, and on substitutes for some parts of the traditional recipes. However, a full understanding of the process and the variations that occur is still to be achieved.\\n\\nThe research will be located at Sheffield Hallam University using the facilities and expertise of the Art and Design Research Centre (ADRC) and the Materials and Engineering Research Institute (MERI). There is a strong team of highly experienced and internationally recognised Metalwork and Jewellery staff at ADRC to support the research. MERI has the background of precious metals research, and the extensive equipment and materials characterisation techniques essential to support this research. \\n\\nPapers will be submitted to scientific, design and craft related journals and at least two conferences. The University website will be utilized for the publication of papers etc. Commercial collaborators will be sought through SHU to exploit any materials or processes that are developed.\\n\\nThis project is a fundamental part of the larger research programme as understanding and control of the niiro solution is crucial to the patination of the irogane alloys. The niiro solution will be tested under laboratory conditions and through studio work. A combination of laboratory based testing on small samples with practice based testing on larger workpieces in the studio will allow for a through study of niiro patination.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F020082/1","grantId":"AH/F020082/1","fundValue":"16403","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Coilin  O'Dubhghaill","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":" The effect of traditional polishing materials on the surface texture of copper including magnolia charcoal, paulownia charcoal, pumice, tonoko (clay), and tsunoko (calcined deer antler) has been studied with optical microscopy and measured in terms of surface roughness (Sa) using an Infinite Focus Microscope. These were compared with results for standard polishing materials aluminium oxide and silicon carbide. A system for polishing and cleaning test pieces has been developed based on this work.\n\nTraditional ingredients used in the niiro patination process have been studied including daikon radish, rokusho verdegris and plum vinegar.\n\nThe application of grated daikon radish to the alloys before patination has been studied. A reduction in the formation of silver chlorides on fine silver and shibuichi has been identified as the main positive benefit in the use of daikon. A number of possible active ingredients in the daikon radish have been identified, further testing will be needed in this area.\n\nRokusho has been tested and found to contain copper acetate, sodium chloride and calcium carbonate. The presence of salt and calcium carbonate has not been reported extensively in the previous literature on the subject. Lead, tin and zinc are also present in rokusho at significant levels, the presence of which could be a barrier to the use of niiro in the West. The development of a 'safe' solution is desirable.\n\nThe effect of plum vinegar on niiro has been studied, and the resultant formation of chlorides on fine silver and shibuichi has been identified. Although the plum vinegar can 'improve' the colour of niiro patinated copper (bright red/brown rather than dull brown), the formation of chlorides on silver and shibuichi (yellow/brown colour rather than white or grey colour) is not a desirable result. Active ingredients in plum vinegar such as citric acid, malic acid, and sodium chloride have been identified and testing is underway to characterize the effect of these ingredients individually.\n\nTraditional niiro solutions and solutions made with commercial grade chemical agents were tested on sample alloys and the differences between them were characterised. A systematic method of recording and quantifying the colours produced by niiro patination has been developed and a database of alloys, niiro compositions, conditions of immersion and colours has been produced and will be used in further work and in comparison with other research.\n\nThrough this research we have characterized the various pre-patination polishing techniques, clarified the composition of traditional solution ingredients, developed and tested a solution made from commercial grade chemicals, and described the influence of solution ingredients on patination colour. Overall the research has greatly improved our understanding of the niiro patination process and clarified the areas that will require further exploration.
