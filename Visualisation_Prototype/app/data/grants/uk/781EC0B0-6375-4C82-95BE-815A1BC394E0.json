{"id":"781EC0B0-6375-4C82-95BE-815A1BC394E0","title":"Home Ownership, Housing Collateral and Aggregate Fluctuations","abstractText":"<p>Aggregate household debt and house prices have risen sharply throughout the world. This has led to concerns that economies may have become more vulnerable to shocks. An alternative, more benign, view stresses that greater macroeconomic stability and financial flexibility have reduced the risks faced by households, facilitating higher levels of debt to be incurred by the household sector.</p> \n<p>To better understand these issues, we develop a model of the &quot;household as a small business&quot; where house prices play a crucial role in determining consumer behaviour&nbsp;due to collateral constraints. The endogeneity of borrowing limits leads to a two-way interaction between prices and real quantities. Simultaneously, we undertake an empirical analysis to better understand the interaction between housing markets and aggregate fluctuations. The empirical analysis offers stylised facts that the theoretical model can replicate. Moreover, the insights from the empirical work will guide our modelling choices and increase the fit between the model's empirical implications and actual facts.</p> \n<p>Having developed empirically relevant models, we use them to quantitatively analyse the macroeconomic and welfare implications of policy changes (for instance, greater financial flexibility through a lower collateral requirement) on the volatile housing sector, homeownership rates, house prices and aggregate consumption fluctuations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-165-25-0024","grantId":"RES-165-25-0024","fundValue":"243942","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander  Michaelides","coPersons":["Nobuhiro  Kiyotaki"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
