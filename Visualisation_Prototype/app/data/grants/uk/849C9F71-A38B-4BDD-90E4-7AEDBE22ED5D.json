The papers delivered at the seminars will form the basis of an edited book, Reinventing the curriculum for the 21st century: new trends in curriculum policy and practice, to be published by Continuum in 2013. The seminars have raised awareness of curriculuar issues in a number of non-academic contexts, for example within Scotland's local authorities. The seminars have stimulated discussion on a number of key issues. The mixed nature of the participants means that such discussions embraced academic and non-academic concerns in curriculum development. The forthcoming book is intended for academic audiences, particularly postgraduate courses in curriculum development. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
