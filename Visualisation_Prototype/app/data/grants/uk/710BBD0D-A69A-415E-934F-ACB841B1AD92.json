It is believed by many to be made up of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) - but they have not yet been detected experimentally. This is because they bounce off atoms only very rarely and weakly such that their presence is extremely difficult to detect. Despite this, scientists have been working on constructing sensitive detectors capable of registering WIMP interactions should they occur. The trouble is that there are many other particles interacting in these detectors that may mask the few and faint WIMPs.\n\nSince WIMPs will interact so rarely the experiments must be shielded from all the cosmic-rays bombarding Earth from space, forcing them deep underground. However, this is still not enough to provide the quiet environment required; they are therefore shielded from natural radioactivity found in underground rock - harmless to us but catastrophic to the sensitive devices. A final background remains, coming from the very materials the detectors are made from. Tiny amounts of uranium and thorium produce signals by radioactive decay that are often indistinguishable from those expected from WIMPs. This means that extensive material screening campaigns must be conducted to select only the purest materials in constructing detectors.\n\nDeveloping ever more sensitive detectors in the hunt for WIMPs has demanded ever-cleaner construction materials. However, we have now reached a technological maturity such that our next detectors could have the sensitivity theoretically predicted to finally detect Dark Matter. The trouble is that capability to screen materials from which to construct them has not kept pace. We have traditionally relied on 'High Purity Germanium' detectors (HPGe) to measure materials before using them to build experiments. However, HPGe requires many weeks to screen a single sample - unacceptable when we need to check hundreds of materials in the coming years. Furthermore, HPGe cannot actually measure U and Th directly. Instead it measures elements that U and Th decay into.\n\nInductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) is capable of measuring U and Th directly. It cannot tell us about the decay products from U and Th as HPGe can, but together they produce the complete picture we need. Moreover, the time taken to screen materials - about a day or less, is just what is called for in building the next generation of experiment. However, ICPMS requires all materials to be 'prepared' - dissolved in acid and introduced as a liquid. ICPMS will only achieve high sensitivity if the materials are digested, prepared and introduced cleanly. With traditional techniques, heating materials in open glassware exposed to the elements, sensitivity can suffer dramatically.\n\nThis proposal is to enhance the UK's existing ICPMS with closed microwave ashing and digestion ovens with ultra-pure, high concentration, aggressive acids, to support the UK's Dark Matter R&amp;D programme. Such new capability would give incredible sensitivity, in only hours. This would elevate the UK's R&amp;D programme to unique world-class status now and well into the future, at a time when internationally HPGe and ICPMS facilities are struggling to cope with demand and do not possess enough sensitivity.\n\nIt will also aid other rare event searches that require ultra-low activity, such as those seeking to observe neutrino-less double beta decay. These experiments could tell us about the fundamental properties of neutrinos, and in doing so explain the tiny imbalance between particles and anti-particles shortly after the Big Bang needed for any matter to exist today. ICPMS also has powerful application in food safety, pharmaceutical, environmental, forensic and clinical studies, where elemental analysis of low levels of contaminants is a rich area of research with significant societal and economic impact potential.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M006891/1","grantId":"ST/M006891/1","fundValue":"99845","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Chamkaur  Ghag","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
