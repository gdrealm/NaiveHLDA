{"id":"21457DB8-0078-475D-8DFA-EF96A8494F57","title":"The Developing Brain","abstractText":"The second half of pregnancy is a time of exuberant brain growth. We are exploring how brain structure develops and how its functional capabilities mature. We seek to study both normal and abnormal brain development by directly observing the fetus in the womb using advanced imaging techniques. Our studies straddle the birth process, enabling us to explore effects of premature birth and of brain damage caused by shortage of oxygen during birth at the right age. Our research aims to create novel imaging techniques and analysis methods to study the developing brain; to learn about both normal and abnormal brain development; and to develop and test novel cerebral rescue treatments for neonates that suffer brain damage from lack of oxygen or premature birth.\nBy combining imaging with genetic analysis and clinical follow-up we seek to learn about the brain and how it develops in this critical early period of life. The outcomes of our research include new imaging and analysis methods that we apply to study the developing brain but may prove useful in other applications as well, basic insights concerning brain development, clinical tools for characterizing and managing brain problems, and novel therapies for improving outcome.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K006355/1","grantId":"MR/K006355/1","fundValue":"7287950","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Edwards","coPersons":["Mary Ann  Rutherford","Joseph V Hajnal"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
