{"id":"71714115-A8AA-4303-B73E-593C4BE3C37D","title":"Statistical Modelling of Interdependence in Economics","abstractText":"<p>This project focuses on statistical methods for the representation and measurement of interdependence among economic agents, and their use in empirical problems. In the last few years, there has been a growing literature both empirical and theoretical on the role of interdependence among agents in determining economic outcomes. A first source of correlation can be associated to the existence of aggregate or common shocks, both financial and real, that perturb the economy as a whole and simultaneously affect the behaviour of economic agents. Another source of interdependence arises from local interaction among individuals.<br /><br />Econometric literature has suggested a number of techniques for representing and measuring interdependence, including spatial models and common factor analysis. This project contributes by proposing a general framework that includes the models considered in the literature as special cases, focusing on estimation of a number of alternative specifications. Monte Carlo experiments are employed to investigate the small sample properties of the proposed estimators and tests. These methods are adopted to extensively study the key factors of health expenditure in different health care systems. An empirical study in the field of housing market also illustrates how these methods work in practise, offering insights and raising new questions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0317","grantId":"RES-061-25-0317","fundValue":"277380","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Francesco  Moscone","coPersons":["Stephen George Hall"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
