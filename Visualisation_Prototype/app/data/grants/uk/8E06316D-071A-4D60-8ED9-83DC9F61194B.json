{"id":"8E06316D-071A-4D60-8ED9-83DC9F61194B","title":"Poetry and Ignorance: Epistemologies of Literature","abstractText":"A study of the idea of ignorance, in relation to Romantic and post-romantic literature. The project will investigate ways in which ignorance, not knowing is both thematized and performed in literary works and deployed in contemporary criticism and theory. By contrast with other discourse and other disciplines, it can be argued that the literary is bound up with a fundamental sense of its own constitutive ignorance. What is the status of a literary work if it is impelled by and structured around ignorance? What is the purpose, mode of procedure and constitution of literary 'study' within such a context? And what is involved in reading such works.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111851/1","grantId":"111851/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew John Bennett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
