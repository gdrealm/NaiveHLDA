This was derived from the views of older people themselves. It is ready for use in population assessment, and in the evaluation of policy outcomes directly aimed at older people, including ethnically diverse groups. </p>\n\n<p>The research, which also supported the importance of having socio-psychological resources, is relevant to programmes promoting older-people's well-being. The aims of the award are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>dissemination of the OPQOL to policy and practice audiences for assessment of public policy\n</li>\n <li>dissemination of the findings on how QoL in older age can be promoted, and active ageing enhanced to policy and practice audiences, and lay audiences.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The collaborators are the International Longevity Centre-UK (ILC-UK) Policy and Research team, Age Concern England and Help the Aged Policy Unit, and an experienced journalist with experience of working on ESRC programmes (Pamela Merritt). We will develop policy reports and disseminate them to multi-sector policy makers, practitioners, lay people, and the press, and to hold dissemination meetings. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H030530/1","grantId":"ES/H030530/1","fundValue":"23615","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ann Patricia Bowling","coPersons":[],"organisation":"St George's University of London","findingsText":" Far more of the ethnically diverse, survey respondents had poor QoL than other respondents.\n\n\n\nThe OPQoL had good reliability and validity in all three surveys.\n\n\n\nBaseline indicators of QoL were able to predict follow-up OPQoL scores in the QoL Survey follow-up sample.\n\n\n\nRespondents' perceptions of active ageing were multi-faceted.\n\n\n\nDespite being more likely to be aged 65&lt;75 than 75+, respondents in ethnic minority groups were far less likely than the other survey respondents to consider themselves as ageing 'very' or 'fairly' actively.\n\n\n\nHow QoL in older age can be improved: the policy implications of the research\n\no Survey respondents emphasised the importance of living in a neighbourly and safe area, and having good local facilities to promote friendly and helpful relationship with other people, including neighbours.\n\no Respondents mentioned the importance of having someone for 'companionship', 'to take me out', 'to make life bearable'.\n\no Meaningful contact, face to face or by telephone, with sons and daughters was important to most respondents for enjoyment, help and security.\n\no Contact with grandchildren (and being able to play and go out with them), was frequently mentioned. It was through their grandchildren that they felt able to play a reciprocal role, and to feel useful and valued.\n\no Many respondents referred to the importance of having social or voluntary activities in the context of the importance of 'keeping busy' - to stop them worrying, feeling alone, or dwelling on the past.
