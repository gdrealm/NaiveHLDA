{"id":"5FF1352B-FAEC-45DE-90DF-EA7BBFC9C00B","title":"Biomolecular archaeology of ancient tuberculosis in Britain and Europe","abstractText":"Tuberculosis (TB) is a reemerging infection that was also common in the past in Britain. Poverty, drug resistance, the HIV, and migration are key factors in its occurrence today. The disease can be caused by any one of five related bacteria known as the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. In Britain the two most likely candidates are Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis. M. bovis can infect many different animals, including cows, and humans were often infected by drinking milk, which is why it is pasteurised in Britain. Today, most TB infections occur in the lungs, because it is transmitted via coughing, but other parts of the body can also be infected, especially if the disease is caught by eating or drinking infected foods. If left untreated the infection can cause damage to different bones in the body, most commonly the spine, ribs, hips and knees. Archaeologists have used this information to study TB in the past, but visual examination of skeletons does not reveal which bacterium has caused the infection, nor which strain of either species is present. We would like to be able identify species and strains because this would enable us to trace the origin of TB in Britain. We think TB came to Britain from the Mediterranean region but to confirm this idea we would have to compare the particular strain present in early British skeletons with that in bones from southern Europe. Similarly, we believe that there were changes in the frequencies of different strains of Mycobacterium over time, and these changes were possibly influenced by factors such as immigration, changes in population density, and changes in the environment. There are also interesting questions about the evolution of TB in the New World after contact with Europeans. All of these questions could be addressed if we could identify the particular strains of Mycobacterium in skeletons from different places and different time periods. Until recently, this was impossible, but now there are techniques for studying the small amounts of 'ancient' DNA that are preserved in some archaeological skeletons. We will therefore extract ancient DNA from a variety of skeletons that show the bone changes associated with TB, and use DNA sequencing to determine which Mycobacterium strain is present in each case. The proposed project will carry out this work with skeletons from Britain and Europe. Our Project Partners in Arizona State University are doing similar work with bones from North America, and by comparing our two sets of results we will be able to study the impact that Contact had on TB in the New World.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E015697/1","grantId":"NE/E015697/1","fundValue":"342141","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  To write papers, to present lectures to the public, for an exhibition and school packs\nThe exhibition was also part of an Impact Case Study 2014 on Charlotte Roberts' research Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Societal","person":"Charlotte Ann  Roberts","coPersons":["Terence Austen Brown"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" Tuberculosis is a reemerging infection that was also common in the past in Britain.

Until recently, this was impossible, but now there are techniques for studying the small amounts of 'ancient' DNA that are preserved in some archaeological skeletons. We used these techniques in this project, with 361 archaeological skeletons that we collected from all over Europe, all showing signs of tuberculosis, and dating from the Roman period to the 19th century AD. About half of the skeletons did not appear to contain any ancient DNA, and in many of the others the DNA was so poorly preserved that it was very difficult to study. However we obtained positive results with a few samples and these have enabled us to learn more about tuberculosis in the past. For example, we discovered that a variety of different strains of tuberculosis have been present in Britain during the last 2000 years, and that some of these were present at the same time in different parts of the country. We even identified one unfortunate person from the 3rd century AD who was infected with two different types of tuberculosis at the same time. We also discovered an individual from 19th century Leeds who had a variety of tuberculosis very similar to the type that is common in Europe today. The bacteria that this person was infected with were not identical to the modern version, but the differences suggest that it might have been an ancestor of modern tuberculosis. This was the first time that any ancient variety of tuberculosis has been identified with such a degree of precision. We have worked closely with museum curators, bioarchaeologists, and contract archaeologists who have provided us with access to skeletal remains identified with evidence of tuberculosis. We initially provided them all with a description of the project, including methods to be used for sampling and analysis, and the role within it of the material for which we asked them for access. We have communicated with the academic end users via conference presentations and scientific publications, and we have provided some data from the project to York Archaeological Trust for an exhibition.\n The main users are: bioarchaeologists, archaeologists, historians, and medical historians who have benefited from the greater understanding of tuberculosis in the past that has resulted from our study; museum curators who have benefited from the specific information that we have obtained regarding the presence of tuberculosis in populations represented by skeletal remains in their collections; biomolecular archaeologists who have benefited from the new approaches to the study of pathogen ancient DNA that we have devised.
