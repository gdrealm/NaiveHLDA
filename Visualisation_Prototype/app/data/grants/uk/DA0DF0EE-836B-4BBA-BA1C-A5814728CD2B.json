The majority of nematodes are free-living, feeding on microorganisms, but a significant number are parasites of animals or plants. Nematode parasites of humans make a substantial contribution to the global burden of disease, with a handful of nematode species annually accounting for some 46 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs), and plant parasites are responsible for global crop losses estimated at $100 billion each year. Although there are some effective treatments for these parasites, increases in the number and distribution of strains that are resistant to these drugs mean that there is a need to develop new therapeutic treatments. Ideal targets for the development of new therapeutics would be molecules and processes that are found only in nematodes, but are absent from the animals and plants that they infect. Ideally the therapeutic target would be one that is found in all nematodes enabling the development of a drug active against a broad range of nematode infections. One such process is spliced leader trans-splicing, which is an essential part of the way that genes are expressed in nematodes. While we have a good understanding of the main events in this process there have been no systematic investigations into the molecules that are involved. We have identified a new experimental approach to investigate this process in the major experimental system used to study nematode biology, C. elegans. Using this system, we have shown for the first time that is possible to visualise, through changes in the expression of a fluorescent protein, alterations in spliced leader trans-splicing in living animals. We will use this breakthrough to better understand sliced leader trans-splicing, and thereby improve the knowledge upon which the development of new anthelmintic drugs depends.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J007137/1","grantId":"BB/J007137/1","fundValue":"350236","fundStart":"2012-08-13","fundEnd":"2015-08-12","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The work to repurpose our genetic screen into a high throughput drug screen, in collaboration with the Drug Discovery Unit at the University of Dundee, shows that we can in principle screen for anthelmintics that specifically target the nematode SL trans-splicing system.

We have refined our screening strategy as outlined in the original grant application. The screen uses a green fluorescent protein (GFP) based transgene that lacked a translation initiation codon (consisting of the bases AUG), so in wild type nematodes there is no fluorescence. However, there is an engineered AUG codon upstream of the trans-splice site, which is removed during SL trans-splicing of the pre-mRNA. Animals with reduced SL trans-splicing accumulate mRNA that contain this engineered AUG and are thus able to express GFP and fluoresce. \n\nWe carried out a pilot genetic screen and showed that two mutations identified from this screen, define two genes, smg-3 and smg-6, which have previously been characterised as components of the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. However, in both smg-3 and smg-6 mutants we were unable to detect loss of SL trans-splicing using independent molecular assays. Further investigation showed that the SL trans-spliced GFP mRNA can be translated with low efficiency from the CUG codon that replaced the original AUG codon. Previous studies have shown that CUG can be used with low efficiency to initiate translation, since it differs from AUG by only one nucleotide. We found that wild type animals the levels of this SL trans-spliced GFP mRNA are kept low by NMD function, but in the smg mutants it accumulates to high enough levels that the low efficiency translation results GFP fluorescence. Thus the recovery of mutations in the NMD pathway was an artefact of our original assay system. \n\nSince our initial transgene was shown to be sensitive to loss of NMD function, we further modified the GFP transgene to prevent the low level translation of the SL trans-spliced mRNA. This revised transgene is not sensitive to loss of NMD function. We have now carried out a large-scale clonal genetic screen using this transgene and identified 18 mutations that cause GFP fluorescence. Importantly, two of these mutations are alleles of sna-1, a gene previously shown to be involved in SL trans-splicing, thus validating our revised assay. We are currently determining the nature of the genes affected by the remaining sixteen mutations. Since the majority of these do not correspond to genes known to be involved in SL trans-splicing this will significantly extend our knowledge of this important nematode gene expression process. \n\nIn parallel to this work we have investigated the relationship between SL trans-splicing and operon organisation in other nematodes. This work, which was published in Genetics, is important because it shows that operons (clusters of genes which produce polycistronic pre-RNA and require SL trans-splicing for processing) are conserved throughout the nematode phylum. Thus the development of drugs that target SL trans-splicing would likely significantly impair gene expression in a wide-range of nematode parasites. Although our transgene assay was originally designed to identify molecules involved in spliced leader trans-splicing, we are aware that the assay might be used as the basis of a high-throughput system to identify compounds that inhibit SL trans-splicing. Since this process is essential for nematode gene expression, but is not found in vertebrates or plants, it represents an excellent target for the development of novel anthelmintics. We have thus collaborated with the Drug Discovery Unit at the University of Dundee to develop high throughput drug screens based on our assay. Using a BBSRC 'Sparking Impact' award we are commissioning market research into the anthelmintic market in preparation for an application for a BBSRC Follow On Fund application in Summer 2015.
