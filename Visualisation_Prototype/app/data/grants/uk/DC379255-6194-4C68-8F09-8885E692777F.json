In NW Argentina in particular, the Formative period (1500 BC-600 AD) sees the blossoming of sedentary communities that connected across the landscape to access a variety of resources, while expanding their social world beyond daily face-to-face interaction. The project will develop our understanding of the role of the circulation of artefacts in the construction and reproduction of social life among early sedentary communities, at a time when new categories of artefacts emerged and became part of more frequent long-distance relationships. The project seeks to answer the question of how diversified social networks were in the period, by carefully examining rather than assuming the nature, scale, direction, frequency and significance of such contacts. \\n\\nThis project will expand the initial results of previous research conducted by the PI on provenance and technology analysis of lithic artefacts and pottery from the southern Calchaqu&iacute; valleys of north western Argentina (NWA). This previous pilot study, funded by a British Academy Small Research Grant, proved the sensitivity of the methodology to identify the multiple and possibly competing links that were active between communities at the time, which were sustained through transactions and decisions around the use and manufacture of everyday crafts. The potential revealed by this preliminary project calls for substantive work to be completed through a larger sampling program. While the previous study has provided a useful baseline for a confident discussion of some of the key assumptions that underlie the study of social interaction in the region, it is still far from the sampling sizes that have resulted in robust comparable studies worldwide. Funds are requested for a period of 12 months to carry on with the sampling, processing and publication of the results. \\n\\nThe project will analyz archaeological materials from the valleys of Santa Mar&iacute;a, Caj&oacute;n, El Bols&oacute;n, Hualf&iacute;n, and the western slope of the Aconquija Mountains. The human settlement of the area in sparse villages unfolded throughout the first millennium AD, which encompasses the Formative period and the transition to the Late Period when larger polities emerged. Ongoing studies by the PI and collaborators have uncovered little evidence of internal differentiation, yet despite their non-elite characteristics the sites were well-embedded in regional networks involving a wide array of materials and crafts. This contradicts standard models of the period, which have argued for centralized elite control of social networks. Combining geochemical provenance analysis of pottery and lithics, petrography, stone tool analysis and regional mapping, the project will build upon existing research to develop a solid database that will allow the building of an alternative model of social interaction in the period. Except for the previous pilot study, there are no antecedents in the region of comparable research combining materials traditionally studied separately. The project will strongly place the region as an empirical, methodological and theoretical counterpart to related debates worldwide.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I025417/1","grantId":"AH/I025417/1","fundValue":"57924","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Marisa  Lazzari","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
