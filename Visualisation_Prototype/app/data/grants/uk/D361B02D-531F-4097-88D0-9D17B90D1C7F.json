The economy gradually opened up to international trade and investment, and unique social programs were put in place with substantial implications for regional and income inequality. Despite many successes from such a process of economic restructuring, the challenges that Brazil faces are still extensive and include a great diversity in wealth and welfare among different regions, too widespread inequality and crime, and unabated environmental degradation. </p>\n\n<p>The proposed research examines the relationship between economic restructuring, on the one hand, and the accelerating environmental degradation, crime, industrial concentration, and regional inequality in this period in Brazil, on the other. Each of these areas represents one important barrier to the sustainability of the process of economic restructuring. Crime, inequality, industrial concentration and environmental degradation all entail social costs and the project will document and analyse how the potential importance of each has increased (albeit in rather different ways) in Brazil since the mid-1990s and discuss the wide implications for policy as well as for future academic research.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-238-25-0008","grantId":"RES-238-25-0008","fundValue":"56437","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nauro  Campos","coPersons":["Marcelo  Resende","Tulio  Kahn","Maria Cecilia LUSTOSA","Carlos Eduardo Young"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
