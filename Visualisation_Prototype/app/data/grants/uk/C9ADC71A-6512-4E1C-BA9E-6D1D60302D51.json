{"id":"C9ADC71A-6512-4E1C-BA9E-6D1D60302D51","title":"Computational Counting","abstractText":"Computational complexity is typically concerned with decision problems, but this is a historical accident, arising from the origins of theoretical computer science within logic. Computing applications, on the other hand, typically involve the calculation of numerical quantities. These applications broadly fall into two types: optimisation problems, in which the goal is to maximise or (minimise) the value of a function, and counting problems, broadly interpreted, by which we mean computing sums, weighted sums, and integrals including, for example, the expectation of a random variable or the probability of an event.This project will consider all aspects of computational counting, with a particular focus on foundational questions in computational complexity (characterising the inherent difficulty of problems) and the development of algorithmic techniques. The goal of the project is to provide a better understanding of the inherent computational difficulty of counting (including approximate counting) and to provide efficient algorithms where they exist.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I011935/1","grantId":"EP/I011935/1","fundValue":"354826","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Jerrum","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" o We have investigated in depth the computational complexity of the Tutte polynomial, a two-variable polynomial associated with a graph G that encodes much useful information about G. The complexity of exact computation was already well understood, but we now have substantially greater knowledge of the complexity of approximation within specified relative error.\n\no We have established a general result about the computational complexity of computing good approximations to the partition functions of conservative counting CSPs. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) arose in artificial intelligence, and are normally studied in their decision and optimisation variants. However the counting variant encodes many spin systems studied in statistical physics, and is well worth investigating. The &amp;amp;amp;quot;conservative&amp;amp;amp;quot; qualifier appearing above can be interpreted as indicating the presence of an external field acting on individual spins. Our result precisely characterises the complexity of conservative counting CSPs, and hence of the related spin systems.\n\no We have made some contributions to the as yet underdeveloped study of the parameterised complexity of counting problems. Parameterised complexity is a framework for dealing with computational problems that are intractable in general, but which may be tractable on instances of interest. The\ndifficult aspect of the problem is captured in a parameter which one hopes is small in instances occurring in practice. o In our work on fixed parameter tractability, we developed an approximation algorithm for the problem of counting so-called motifs in a graph with a vertex colouring. This is an abstraction of a problem arising in molecular biology.\n\no There is increasing interest in the theoretical computer science community in the parameterised complexity of counting problems. We believe that the general class of problem we have introduced will be of value in promoting future work in this area.
