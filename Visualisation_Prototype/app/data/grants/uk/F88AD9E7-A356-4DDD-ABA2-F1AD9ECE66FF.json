These new particles have not been found, hence exclusion limits have been set on the masses of these particles.These are among the strongest existing limits worldwide. These exclusion limits are used by both theorists and experimentalists to test the predictions of several SUSY models. The constraints set by my work together with other ATLAS colleagues are among the most stringent. Education,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
