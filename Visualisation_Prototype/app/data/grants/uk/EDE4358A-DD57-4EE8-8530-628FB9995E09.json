There is an urgent need for low cost instrumentation that can provide an early warning of slope instability to enable evacuation of vulnerable people and timely repair and maintenance of critical infrastructure. This project aims to design and assess field performance of a prototype acoustic slope displacement rate sensor. Sensors developed through research will be re-engineered and these new sensors will be installed at problem road and rail slopes to investigate how they perform compared to traditional more costly instrumentation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I50205X/1","grantId":"EP/I50205X/1","fundValue":"37887","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2012-08-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Ian Meldrum","coPersons":[],"organisation":"NERC British Geological Survey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
