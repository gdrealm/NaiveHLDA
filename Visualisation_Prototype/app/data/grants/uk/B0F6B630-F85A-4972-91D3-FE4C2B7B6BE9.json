In particular, we do not know how European rainfall patterns might change. Observations of rainfall suggest that there have been increases in northern and central Europe, especially in winter, and also increases in rainfall intensity. These changes are consistent with atmospheric physics which indicate that warmer air can hold more moisture. We use climate models to examine how climate might change in the future and these suggest more frequent and intense heavy rainfall even in regions experiencing lower rainfall totals. This may cause an increase in the risk of flooding of the sort witnessed over the last decade across the UK and Europe. Although climate model ability to simulate observed processes has improved in recent years, there are still biases in their outputs due to uncertainties in the levels of future greenhouse gas emissions, due to the large-scale resolution of climate models compared to many natural processes and due to natural variations in the climate. There is also a lack of climate model simulations on the small scale needed to model some of the heaviest rainfall events, in particular summer storms. This research advances the study of extreme climate events by looking at the causes of climate model biases in the simulation of extreme rainfall, particularly with regards to heavy summer storms. We will first identify the historical characteristics of heavy rainfall using observed storms and, after we have identified the atmospheric causes for these events, we will try to provide physically-based explanations for any detected trends. Climate models represent physical processes in different ways and this can have an important influence on the simulation of heavy rainfall. We will assess which of these affect the simulation of heavy rainfall by comparing different model simulations with observations. Weather forecasting and climate models will also be run at a 1.5km resolution to see if such models are able to tell us more about how heavy rainfall events such as thunderstorms might change in the future. This research will provide new estimates of future changes to heavy rainfall and examine the atmospheric mechanisms responsible for such changes. This information will tell us which aspects of heavy rainfall and relevant processes are simulated well by models and which projections for the future we should use in informing any adaptation to climate change. Those that are not will be identified and this research will provide guidance on improvements that are needed in the next generation of climate models as well as weather forecasting models. As we use many different climate models, we can also produce estimates of how uncertain we are about future changes in extreme rainfall and flood risk. The summer 2007 floods cost the UK over &pound;3 billion and the UK Government has announced increased annual budgets for flood risk management that will reach &pound;800 million by 2010 but when and should this investment be prioritised. The Pitt Review in 2008 suggested that more information is needed for 'urgent and fundamental changes in the way the country is adapting to the likelihood of more frequent and intense periods of heavy rainfall'. We need to know how heavy rainfall and flood risks may change in the future, particularly for surface water flooding which is very poorly understood. The information provided by this research is vital for agencies responsible for future flood risk planning and management such as the Environment Agency, DEFRA and the Emergency Services and crucial for updating the climate change allowances used in flood risk management.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I006680/1","grantId":"NE/I006680/1","fundValue":"464635","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  As CONVEX approaches its conclusion the focus of our efforts is increasingly towards the use of project results in providing information for the management of the risk of flash flooding through providing policy guidance.\n\nTo meet this aim a report on the &amp;quot;First realisation of future changes in hourly rainfall over the southern UK with a convection-permitting model&amp;quot; was provided to DECC/Defra in March and a guidance report on the strengths and limitations of climate projections from coarse resolution models has been produced as an internal Met Office deliverable, and this will be prepared for wider dissemination.

Initial discussions have taken place with colleagues from Bristol University with regards to collaboration on the construction of a gridded precipitation product and funding has been obtained from NERC.\nThe project has gained a high public profile - our paper &amp;quot;Heavier summer downpours with climate change revealed by weather forecast resolution model&amp;quot; generated a lot of media interest including interviews on TV and radio. There was coverage in several national newspapers - including The Times, Independent and Guardian. In total 93 print/online articles (excluding social media) covered the research. An article titled &quot;Batten the hatches as summers to have more heavy downpours&quot; written for The Conversation website (a website for academics) got over 10,000 hits in the first day. This has increased awareness of the potential for increased flash flooding in the UK as a result of climate change. Environment Policy & public services","person":"Hayley Jane  Fowler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" A key finding of the project has been that new model simulations have indicated that extreme summer rainfall may become more frequent in the UK due to climate change. While summers are expected to become drier overall by 2100, intense rainfall indicative of serious flash flooding could become several times more frequent. Until now, climate models haven’t been able to simulate how extreme hourly rainfall might change in future. The very high resolution model used in CONVEX allows us to examine these changes for the first time. It shows heavier summer downpours in the future, with almost five times more events exceeding 28mm in one hour in the future than in the current climate – changes we might expect theoretically as the world warms.\n\nClimate models, which generally work at coarse resolutions, have been able to accurately simulate winter rainfall and have suggested generally wetter winters with the potential for higher daily rainfall rates in the future. In summer, however, it is the hourly rates that are more important as rain tends to fall in short but intense bursts – as seen during the Boscastle flooding of 2004. Climate models have so far lacked the resolution to accurately simulate the smaller-scale convective storms which cause this type of rain. To deal with this issue CONVEX used a climate model with a higher resolution than ever used before to examine future rainfall change – using 1.5km grid boxes instead of the usual 12km or larger – the same as the Met Office weather forecast model. This model gives a realistic representation of hourly rainfall, allowing us to make future projections with some confidence.\n\nOther findings indicate that the projections suggest intensification of both summer and winter extremes at the end of 21st century. However, summer extreme intensification is partially counter-balanced by the lengthening of drought periods.\n\nEmerging results indicate that temperature is an important driver of intense summer rainfall in the UK (as previously demonstrated elsewhere). This has been shown using new, quality controlled hourly rainfall observations and radar data. The project’s latest research also suggests that this temperature influence is dependent on particular atmospheric conditions. In addition, a method for objectively identifying areas characterised by different atmospheric flow types has been developed. A further significant finding is that the intense rainfall-temperature relationship noted in the observed data has also been identified in the detailed climate model, indicating that it is able to reproduce important processes in the generation of extreme rainfall. \n\nThe project is currently investigating changes in rainfall intensity and duration at the 10-minute timescale. The findings might be taken forward by being incorporated into policy guidance for adaptation to increased flood risk. This is being pursued by working with CH2M Hill and UK Water Industry Research (UKWIR) to apply the outputs from CONVEX to obtain improved estimates of changes in intense rainfall, providing guidance on uplift factors to be applied to improved planning for sewer design. The project is also collaborating with CEH Wallingford who are taking output from the 1.5km climate model and running it through their grid-to-grid hydrological model, to examine flood impacts. A report on the &amp;amp;amp;quot;First realisation of future changes in hourly rainfall over the southern UK with a convection-permitting model&amp;amp;amp;quot; was provided to government (DECC/Defra) in March and a guidance report on the strengths and limitations of climate projections from coarse resolution models has been produced as an internal Met Office deliverable, and this will be prepared for wider dissemination.\n\nThese findings might also be taken forward in the academic climate modelling community. The project has engaged with this group by convening a session on high-resolution modelling at the European Geophysical Union General Assembly in Vienna in 2014. The project was also invited to give a keynote speech at a RCM workshop in Lund, Sweden, in June 2014. CONVEX was also represented at a NERC-sponsored one-day workshop event on Global Climate Models in London. The meeting examined how to best use climate model data and considered the uncertainty of this data brought together with other academics.\n\nA project workshop at The Royal Society in January 2015 will bring together a wide range of policy makers, stakeholders and academics to discuss how the project results can be incorporated in policy guidance and future research.
