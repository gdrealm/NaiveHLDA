However, prolonged, chronic stress can have a significant negative impact on health, and is thought to underlie and contribute to the onset of several diseases. At the cellular level, stress hormones can change neuronal function, but our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these effects is currently limited. Our overall objective is to examine how stress contributes to ageing in the brain. More specifically, we're interested in determining how dynamic communication between nerve cells can be dysregulated by stress hormones. Our project focuses on the role of a protein named tau, and how it might mediate the impairing effects of stress. Tau has well-established roles in several neurological pathologies, and our preliminary investigation has revealed a possible causal relationship between stress hormones and the aberrant regulation of tau protein in neurons. Our proposed research is of a fundamental, basic science in foundation. However, findings from our study could well improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying stress hormone-dysregulation of the central nervous system, and may shed new light on why stress might contribute to ageing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N001893/1","grantId":"BB/N001893/1","fundValue":"353130","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kwangwook Kei Cho","coPersons":["Daniel  Whitcomb"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
