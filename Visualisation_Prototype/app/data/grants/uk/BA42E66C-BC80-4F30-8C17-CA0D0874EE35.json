These ingenious machines bind structurally unrelated drugs and toxins at the inside of the cell, and then move these compounds to the outside of the cell. Hence, multidrug transporters act as drug pumps that are able to lower the drug concentration inside the cell to levels at which these drugs are inactive and useless. As drugs now have lost their therapeutic effect, the cell has become multidrug resistant. Multidrug transporters provide the cell with a defense mechanism against toxic compounds that are harmful. However, the activity of multidrug transporters also interferes with the drug-based control, termed chemotherapy, of human tumours and infectious pathogenic microorganisms, in which drugs are used that should kill the cell. This project focuses on the human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which is one of the major drug pumps in human. Surprisingly, we have been able to functionally express BCRP in Lactococcus lactis, a harmless bacterium which is used in the production of yoghurts and cheeses, and which is very easy to handle. We will now study how BCRP recognizes and binds drugs, and how BCRP is able to move drugs out of the cell. This knowledge may allow us to rationally design new drugs that can poison or circumvent the activity of BCRP and related transporters to improve chemotherapy of human cancers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401165","grantId":"G0401165","fundValue":"179050","fundStart":"2005-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Hendrik Willem  Van Veen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
