However, human cells require multiple enzymes to function normally, and the ‘active sites’ of many of these are similar in structure. Therefore, drugs that block the active sites of enzymes are not sufficiently selective, leading to poor activity, and unwanted side effects in patients. We are developing new ways of making drugs, not by targeting the active sites of enzymes, but by disrupting interactions between proteins, which are necessary for cells to work correctly. We will not only devise methods to find the best targets to disrupt, but will also pioneer new methods to find drugs that disrupt these interactions, and find new ways to test the effect on human cells of the drugs we discover in this way, to evaluate their potential for further development. This work has the potential to transform the basic scientific research that helps us to understand human diseases, as well as the way new drugs are discovered and developed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001522","grantId":"G1001522","fundValue":"3221390","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ashok R Ventikaraman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
