While improvements in lifestyle are benefiting people at risk for these diseases, many already suffer from previous illness and others will nevertheless experience life-threatening episodes. Our work will strive to harness recent developments in the field of stem cell research to benefit those at risk for heart and circulatory diseases. This will be accomplished by studying the fundamental processes of cell growth, specialization and function that can be done in the Petri dish using modern microscopy and also by other imaging techniques. We will study cells that make up the normal and diseased heart and also those that form the lining and walls of the blood vessels. We expect our studies to provide the insights for future methods for diagnosis and treatment of lung disease and atherosclerosis, which together account for most cardiovascular disease risk.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000847","grantId":"G1000847","fundValue":"741793","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger Arnold Pedersen","coPersons":["Nicholas  Morrell","Martin  Bennett"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
