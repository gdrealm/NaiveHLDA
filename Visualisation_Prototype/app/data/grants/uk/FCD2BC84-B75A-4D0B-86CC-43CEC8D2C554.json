{"id":"FCD2BC84-B75A-4D0B-86CC-43CEC8D2C554","title":"Chemical Control of Molecular Recognition in Anion Exchange Materials","abstractText":"The proposed program of research combines exploratory synthesis of new layered double hydroxide materials with a systematic investigation of their anion exchange chemistry and theoretical studies to provide an insight into the origins of their properties. Layered double hydroxides are a large family of materials which have found diverse applications in fields ranging from catalysis to medicine and from molecular recognition to minerals extraction. The compositional flexibility and diverse properties of layered double hydroxides make them an ideal candidate for combining exploratory synthesis with a theoretical investigation of their structure-property relationships. The most recent major chemical breakthrough in this area has been the discovery of a hydrothermal synthesis of layered double hydroxides with a layer composition and therefore layer charge distribution completely different from all previously known members of the family. This research aims to further investigate the chemistry of these new materials and their potential applications in a variety of areas as well as to further exploit the new synthesis, as well as more conventional ones, in the discovery of new materials. The research will also utilise computational chemistry to probe the structures and the interactions between the host lattice and guest molecules in these materials. This will identify the key interactions which give rise to properties such as molecular recognition in these materials and allow the experimental research to be focussed on the compounds which are potentially of the greatest interest.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D060664/1","grantId":"EP/D060664/1","fundValue":"127204","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Michael Fogg","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
