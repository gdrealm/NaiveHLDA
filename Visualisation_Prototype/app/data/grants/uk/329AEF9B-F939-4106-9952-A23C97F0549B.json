Current systems cannot vary numerical expressions, but Williams will develop a new grammar (a means of representing variations in proportion phrases) and a selection algorithm allowing the system to vary phrases according to maths ability.\n<br />\n<br />Increasing Linguistic knowledge about English proportion phrases\n<br />\n<br />Although these are common, there is surprisingly little relevant linguistic research, e.g. why 'half a teaspoon' but not 'fifty percent of a teaspoon'? Williams will analyse texts that present proportions in different ways, eg sets of articles about scientific discoveries, build the grammar from the results, and evaluate it by measuring how successfully it can generate variations.\n<br />\n<br />Communicating proportions to different audiences\n<br />\n<br />The selection algorithm will be developed from Key Stages in The National Curriculum for Schools (eg 'nearly three-quarters' for people at Key Stage 2 and '0.732' for people at Key Stage 3). Maths tutors will judge the appropriateness of selected phrases. \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2760","grantId":"RES-000-22-2760","fundValue":"70569","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sandra  Williams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
