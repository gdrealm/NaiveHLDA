This grant explores how language learners balance generalisation and exception learning using the Artificial Language Learning (ALL) methodology, ie experiments where participants learn and are tested on novel experimenter-designed languages. Earlier research (Wonnacott et al. 2008) had used only adults - an important limitation given evidence for maturational differences in language learning (Newport, 1990).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This grant therefore consists of a series of ALL experiments conducted with both child and adult participants, designed to address the following questions: (i) Do children, (like adults in previous studies) use distributional statistics eg word and construction frequency to determine which words should generalise/are exceptions? (ii) How do learners weigh such information against other sources of information such as semantics (eg if words with similar meanings tend to behave similarly). (iii) Do these processes differ across adults and children? (iv) Are there any factors that predict the extent of generalisation/exception learning for individual learners (eg &nbsp;working memory)?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The long-term goal is to shed light on why language learning is generally more successful when it begins in childhood and the loci of individual differences in learning.</p>\n&nbsp;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F028717/2","grantId":"ES/F028717/2","fundValue":"38740","fundStart":"2012-01-16","fundEnd":"2013-05-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth Anne Wonnacott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" 1) Like adults in previous work, children are sensitive to both lexical frequency and higher level distributional statistics (e.g. construction type-frequency) with these factors determining extent of generalization. Although such statistics affected learning in both adults and children, age influenced the extent of generalization for matched input. For example, Wonnacott et al. (2012) found that adults generalized a verb-argument construction more readily than children. However Wonnacott, et al As with most research that addresses processes involved in typical language development, short term impacts are mostly scientific. However, in the longer term, understanding the processes by which we generalize, and the constraints on these processes, will inform interventions for children with language impairment. There is also potential for impact in second language education. Educational practice in this area usually assumes that children will pick up on general grammatical structures in the Education,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
