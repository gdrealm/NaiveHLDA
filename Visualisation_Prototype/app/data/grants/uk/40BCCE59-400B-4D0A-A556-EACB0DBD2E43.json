{"id":"40BCCE59-400B-4D0A-A556-EACB0DBD2E43","title":"International Health Humanities Network","abstractText":"Health care practitioners around the world are searching for creative new ways of making sense of the human condition and ameliorating distress, often in the face of complex problems and financial austerity. The humanities have a key contribution to make to a variety of healthcare disciplines, but so far the field of medical humanities has been limited by a narrow focus on medicine and a preoccupation with literature, history and philosophy.\\n\\nThis project addresses a pressing need for a broader and strategically inclusive approach to applied humanities in health care. Our term Health Humanities is chosen to represent progress away from this largely medical focus, with a groundbreaking project to develop an International Health Humanities Network (IHHN) aiming to provide a platform for an evolution towards a more inclusive and impactful 'Health Humanities'. Based at the University of Nottingham, but in partnership with an expanding base of UK and international collaborators the IHHN will provide the first internationally accessible focal point for humanities and healthcare scholars to network, find shared objectives, develop resources, contribute to training, and undertake research with health and social care professionals who comprise the majority of the caring workforce, as well as informal carers, service users, self-carers, and charitable and voluntary sector.\\n\\nThe IHHN will spearhead the involvement of humanities disciplines in innovative health and social care practice, offering a pioneering response to the call for social relevance and impact. To begin such an exploration, four invited workshop sessions will be held that focus on the themes of health and well-being in terms of: media and film; ecology/ environment and literature; applied health linguistics; and music. These workshops will act as a starting point in expanding the way the humanities can inform and transform healthcare. The IHHN will encourage collaborative research, further funding applications, and provide a generative field for dissemination and exchange of ideas.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J002208/1","grantId":"AH/J002208/1","fundValue":"30254","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Working with a range of partners, including the Institute of Mental Health and the US National Institutes of Health, the International Health Humanities Network (IHHN) promotes research and collaboration in the emergent field health humanities and encourages the translation of knowledge into healthcare practice. It provides a platform for interested parties to engage in online debate and to forge collaborations between humanities scholars, healthcare practitioners and the public.\n\n\nThe IHHN and its website at www.healthhumanities.org was launched 13th April 2012 and has quickly developed a community of over 270 members forming a thriving global community of researchers, academics, services users, clinicians, carers and other professionals all continents. The website has quickly become a leading resource, attracting significant web traffic worldwide, particularly from the US and UK. Within its first year, it had attracted 2,199 unique visitors, 12,699 page views, with 76% of these being longer than 60 seconds. The IHHN is supported by a top class International Advisory Board of leading scholars and has incorporated impact narratives from a variety of congruent projects, a new blog, key links, presentations and/or podcasts from four AHRC-funded health humanities workshops on the themes of music, ecology, language and media/film (see below) and hosts since 2014 the informations and archive space for the new AHRC/RCUK Connected Communities large &pound;1.5m research programme 'Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery for Mental Health and Well-Being', led by Professor Crawford at the University of Nottingham. The archive will be developed from 2013-18.\n\nNational Seminar Series\nThe series of four invited UK-based seminars were held at the Institute of Mental Health and the Centre for Advanced Studies, The University of Nottingham, with talks by important scholars examining health-related aspects to ecology, music, language and film media and health. Each of these one-day seminars on average attracted 20 scholars from the subject fields, other humanities and social science disciplines, senior health service managers, clinicians and service users. Where permission was granted, podcasts, Powerpoints or audio files from the seminar days were made available at www.healthhumanities.org. The seminars/ workshops were as follows:\n1. Music and Health\nVenue: Institute of Mental Health, Jubilee Campus, The University of Nottingham\nDate: 9th March 2012\n• Plenary 1: Professor Leslie Bunt (UWE), &quot;Music as an agent for transformation: its place in contemporary health and social care&quot;\n• Keynote: Professor Brian Abrams (Montclair State University, US), &quot;Musica Humana: When Music Breaks the Sound Barrier in Music Therapy&quot;\n• Plenary 2: Professor Aaron Williamon (Royal College of Music, UK), &quot;Rhythm for Life: Music and wellbeing in older adulthood&quot;\n\n2: Ecology, Health and Literature\nDate: 30th March 2012\n• Plenary 1: Professor Terry Gifford (Bath Spa University), &quot;Ecopoetry, Healing and Public Health: The case of Ted Hughes&quot;\n• Keynote: Keynote: Professor Catrinona Sandilands,\n• Plenary 2: Dr Adeline Putra-Jones (University of Exeter), &quot;Borrowing the World from our Children: Gender, Posterity and Well-being in the Climate Change Novel&quot;\n\n3. Impact of Applied Linguistics in Healthcare\nVenue: Institute of Mental Health, Jubilee Campus, The University of Nottingham\nDate: 26th January 2013\n• Professor Brian Brown (De Montfort University), &quot;Re-imaging health through language&quot; \n• Professor Srikant Sarangi (Cardiff University), &quot;Janus-Faced Translational Research in Health Communication: Some Reflections&quot; \n• Professor Peter J. Schulz (Lugano University, Switzerland), &quot;Between the humanities and health sciences: Health literacy and patients' empowerment&quot; \n\n4 Media and Film in Healthcare\nVenue: Centre for Advanced Studies, The University of Nottingham\nDate: 28th June 2013\n• Professor Danny Wedding (Alliant International University, US), \n• Professor Jenny Kitzinger (King's College London, UK),\n• Dr Ahmed Hankir (University of Manchester)\n\n2nd International Health Humanities Conference\n\nThe 2nd International Health Humanities Conference: Music, Health, and Humanity was held at Montclair State University, New Jersey, on 9-11 August 2012 with major US keynote speakers (Kate Pierson of the B52s, Joel Thome) alongside other prominent UK and US academic speakers. The conference was attended by academics, service users and carers, from all over the USA, Europe (inc. Scandinavia and France), UK, South Africa, Australia and Iran. The conference generated a book of abstracts\nDuring the conference the International Committee met and discussed running the 4th conference at Denver Colorado in 2015 and achieved early negotiations on a merger between IHHN and American Humanities Consortium so as to move the conference cycle to annual events. The theme for the next conference at Denver in 2015, hosted by the University of Colorado is entitled: 'Pop (Bio) Cultures: Politics, Practices and Privilege' and will be hosted by Professor Tess Jones, Editor of Journal of Medical Humanities. Plans for hosting the 2016 are well-advanced and this will ensure a strong legacy for this exciting and groundbreaking scholarly network and collaboration. \nThe Third IHH Conference on 'TraumaTextualities' took place on 5-7 September 2014 at The University of Nottingham with keynotes from Professors Peter Meineck (New York) and Lars Wieseth (Oslo). The conference explored trauma and texts in the context of health humanities and with a foregrounded topic of warfare. The conference included a mask performance relevant to catharsis and a visual exhibition on World War 1 trauma. The coordinators have been commissioned to provide a special issue on this them for the US-based and prestigious Journal of Medical Humanities.\n\nThematic Advances\n\nThis project has delivered the second, third and planned for the fourth international health humanities conference, ensuring legacy value and continued development of this new and fast-growing academic field, bringing together for the first time an unusually rich and diverse body of scholars, clinicians and mental health service users to examine and test the boundaries of how humanities disciplines might be applied in society. \nIn terms of the conferences, what has been particularly striking is the broad and inclusive range of academic and non-academic speakers and attendees, marking a radical and groundbreaking evolution from the traditional medical humanities conference. \nThe conference programmes have been clearly diverse with medical concerns being only a part of rather than the whole focus in terms of content and delivery. Nursing and other allied health and social care professionals joined with mental health service users, carers, social scientists and a core body of scholars in humanities disciplines. \nThe theme of Health Humanities has become far more visible through www.healthhumanities.org and its sister website: www.madnessandliterature.org. Its membership reveals a global community of scholarship, information and ideas sharing in this area. The website has provided a fresh and informative resource, not least in its impact narratives to assist scholars in their work in this field, and in providing an opportunity for public access to information about particular applications of arts and humanities in terms of health benefits. Additionally, the podcasts or other materials of our eminent speakers have allowed people who were unable to attend the seminars to see the breadth of exploration undertaken. A links section enables individuals to access other resources on Health Humanities based material, and is proving to be an excellent route to collaborative project working. Indeed, the number of partners to the site is impressive and the International Board cohere rich expertise and have proved invaluable tin developing the resource.\nThe various discussions in the national seminars and at the sustained conferences revealed new and innovative ways of considering health humanities, in particular the value of music, ecology, language and film media. \nAs the AHRC revisits its impact agenda, with increasing calls on humanities disciplines to narrate how they contribute to society, this project stands out as a model for doing just that. Indeed, the project was one of only two chosen by AHRC for its POST/RCUK event, 'The Science of Health and Wellbeing', at the House of Commons on 4 June, 2013. IHHN also features in the AHRC publication: Health and wellbeing: The Contribution of the arts and humanities (AHRC, 2013). \nThe overall project has cultivated an exciting inter-animation of people and ideas from different fields of scholarship in the humanities and social sciences alongside key managers and clinicians working in health and social care as well as people who have experienced or continue to experience health challenges as service-users or carers. It has increased public access to non-positivist, interpretative and cultural consideration of health conditions and services through the lens of various arts and humanities. It has provided a legacy for engagement and social practices relevant to the field through a continuation of website-based networking and future conferences. It has demonstrated how quite different academic disciplines, healthcare organisations and the wider public can work together as stakeholders and beneficiaries of applied arts and humanities. Finally, the project has consolidated connections between US and UK researchers - and indeed to a global network in health humanities - something that AHRC strategy emphasises.\n\nFuture Initiatives and Collaboration\n\nFollowing the success of the International Health Humanities Network, Professor Crawford led a large team to a successful application to the large grant programme of Connected Communities, achieving a &pound;1.5m five year grant to investigate Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery. Professor Crawford was also invited to create and direct two new bodies at The University of Nottingham: 1. Nottingham Health Humanities (funded by the Centre for Advanced Studies), launched June 28th 2013 and already with a membership of over 75 scholars from diverse disciplines and faculties; 2. Centre for Social Futures at the Institute of Mental Health, to spearhead social and cultural research in mental health. This centre, established in December 2013 has already generated 10 Integrated Research Groups, with a team of over 50 researchers. Nottingham Health Humanities can be found at:\nhttp://www.healthhumanities.org/nottingham_health_humanities/view/home. The Centre for Social Futures can be found at:\nhttp://www.institutemh.org.uk/x-about-us-x/our-centres/centre-for-social-futures.\n\nDuring the project period, Charley Baker was appointed as Associate Editor of Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing. Professor Crawford has been invited to advise on the formation of various health humanities centres and programmes emerging globally. With the support of the Centre for Advanced Studies (CAS) at the University of Nottingham, Crawford extended the network of health humanities scholarship with appointment of two Visiting International Fellows: Professor Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu (Stanford University) and Professor Gail Horstein (Holyoke College, US), presenting multiple talks in the university and in local NHS Trusts, and, in addition, offering research advice/ surgeries to a range of scholars. \n\nProfessor Crawford, Professor Brian Brown, Charley Baker, Dr Victoria Tischler and Brian Abrams have written the first manifesto book for Health Humanities worldwide to be published by Palgrave London in January 2015.\n\nDuring the period of the award, Professor Crawford became Director of both the Centre for Social Futures, Institute of Mental Health and Nottingham Health Humanities. He won Internal Assignment of the Year 2013 for Health Humanities in recognition of 'outstanding temporary assignment' with Unitemps. He was appointed to the Advisory Board for Social Welfare, British Library, The Cultural Value Project, Assessment Panel (AHRC), Science in Culture Advisory Committee and Assessment Panel (AHRC). He was appointed as Adjunct Professor, Alesund University College, Norway, to the International Advisory Board of Medical School, Arts and Humanities, University of Colorado, Denver, and as International Supervisor to Citizenship: psychosocial processes, culture and diversity, University of Seville, Department of Psychology. He was also nominated for the Eileen Skellern Lecture for his work in advancing health humanities in mental health.
