The Photo display proved very popular with residents who uploaded over 1500 photos to the system across a range of categories, with the most popular being hitoric photos. Over the last six years the photo displays have been situated in key settings within the village including: the post-office; the village hall, the village pub (called the George and Dragon) and the village cafe. Feedback from design workshops (and a comments book placed next to the displays) have demonstrated the potential of situated displays and community generated content for supporting sense of community. However, feedback from the community also highlighted the need for tools to provide both greater inclusivity (e.g. for some of the more elderly members of the community) and also for enabling the community to share and co-curate digital narratives (the delightful &quot;The first chips in Wray&quot; story for example) and accounts/collections of local history relating to the village from a range of sources and perspectives. \n\nThe central aim of the proposed research is to co-design these tools with the community and, through longitudinal study, to explore their adoption and appropriation by the community.\n\nIt is important that the design of these tools is done in a participatory fashion to help ensure both their appropriateness to the requirements posed by the broad community (given the range of technical abilities for example) and also to foster a greater sense of ownership on behalf of the community. \n\nFurthermore, a 'one-size-fits-all' tool is unlikely to be appropriate given the range of contexts of use, e.g. curating content for consumption by established members of the village community vs. curating content for consumption by residents new to the village vs. curating content for consumption by visitors. Some tools may be mobile applications that support the capture of content in-situ, whilst others may involve the tailoring of existing technologies within the village, for example modifying the colour photocopier in the village Post Office in order to support the simple scanning of historic village newspaper articles.\n\nIn terms of tools to support the consumption of these narratives we envisage that situated displays provide suitable properties and affordances (based on our positive experiences with the Wray Photo Displays). Our experiences with situated displays have taught us that their placement is crucial (e.g. siting the display where the audience has due time to interact) and again needs to be done in collaboration with the community in order to promote sense of ownership and avoid inappropriate placements. But we also consider mobile tools as candidate technologies for supporting the consumption of locative media, e.g. enabling a member of the village, out on a ramble, to learn about the historic places she approaches. This could be through a push or pull based approach and involve viewing or listening to the narratives relating to the place. It is anticipated that while consuming such narratives, users will also wish to be able to respond, e.g. contributing stories/narratives of their own or by suggesting links with another related place or narrative. \n\nMcMillan, D. and Chavis, D.

The locative media produced using the SHARC web application can be downloaded and experienced by users via the SHARC mobile application which runs on Android based smartphones. Furthermore, users can respond to the experience through the same mobile application by submitting their own media, such as photos, audio comments, etc. The requirements and content used for driving the development of the framework have arisen from our longstanding work with the Wray village community. Although testing of the framework is still taking place we are confident that the framework will provide a useful tool for enabling non-technical users to share and co-curate digital narratives relating to their &quot;home town's&quot; local history from a range of sources and perspectives and that such activity will have a positive impact on sense of community.
