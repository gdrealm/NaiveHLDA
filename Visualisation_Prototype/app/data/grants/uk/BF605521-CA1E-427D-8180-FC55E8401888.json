The intention here is to gain an understanding of the attributes and changes are necessary for firms to effectively engage in these strategies so as to increase their value added.</li>\n</ol>\n<br />The research will involve analysis of existing survey data (the UK Innovation Surveys of 2005 and 2007) and original surveying with responses from 300 firms active in instrumentation, electronics and electrical machinery.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E019331/1","grantId":"ES/E019331/1","fundValue":"259016","fundStart":"2008-06-23","fundEnd":"2010-12-22","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Bruce  Tether","coPersons":["Jeremy  Howells"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
