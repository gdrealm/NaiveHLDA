The research aims to fill this gap in evidence with a module of questions on attitudes to Gaelic in the annual Scottish Social Attitudes Survey of 2012, measuring views about the use of Gaelic in public areas, the place of Gaelic in education, the use of Gaelic in broadcasting, the place of Gaelic in regional, Scottish and British identities, and the future of Gaelic.

An advisory group of 20 people represented the stakeholders in Gaelic in Scotland, and experts in research on attitudes to minority languages from Ireland and Wales. The group facilitated the development of a policy-relevant questionnaire, and the dissemination of results.\n\n\n\nSubstantive findings\n\n(For 1-3, see, eg, Output ‘Public Attitudes to Gaelic in Scotland’, seminar 14/04/2013.)\n\n\n\n(1) What is the perceived status of Gaelic?\n\n\n\nGaelic is accepted as part of Scottish life. Only 5% of people feel uncomfortable when they hear it spoken, 70% have heard it broadcast, and 68% think Gaelic speakers have some or a lot in common with others in Scotland. A minority has limited competence in Gaelic (beyond the 1% who are fluent): 25% understand, and 15% can speak, at least an odd word. \n\n\n\n(2) Do people in Scotland support recent policy developments concerning Gaelic?\n\n\n\nThere is support for current policy. 85% favour bilingual road signs at least in areas where Gaelic is spoken, and 61% do not think the government spends too much on encouraging Gaelic use. \n\n\n\nThere is support for measures that would go beyond current policy. For example, 49% would favour bilingual road signs throughout Scotland, and 48% say that Gaelic-medium education should be available throughout Scotland.\n\n\n\n(3) What are the views about the future of Gaelic, and about Gaelic language rights?\n\n\n\n42% would like there to be more Gaelic spoken in 50 years’ time than now; 39% would want the same number. Gaelic-speaking parents are the group most commonly thought (by 36%) to have the main responsibility for encouraging Gaelic use, followed by local communities (19%), the government (19%) and schools (17%). But 77% thought schools to be essential for ensuring future Gaelic use. 68% thought Gaelic broadcasting is similarly essential.\n\n\n\nAbout 30-40% of people believe that Gaelic speakers should have the right to use Gaelic in various social domains anywhere in Scotland – dealing with their local council, appearing as a witness in court, speaking to NHS medical staff, speaking at a public meeting, or writing to their bank. Between two thirds and three quarters favour such rights in areas where Gaelic is spoken.\n\n\n\n(4) Do people relate Gaelic to Scottish identity and political questions about the future of Scotland?\n\n\n\n(See Output ‘Public Attitudes to Gaelic and the Debate about Scottish Autonomy’.)\n\n\n\n76% regard Gaelic as important to Scottish heritage, and 86% see it as important to Highlands and Islands heritage, but only 24% see it as important to their own heritage, and only 3% see speaking Gaelic as very important to being Scottish.\n\n\n\nHopes that Gaelic will be spoken by more people than now is associated with being more likely to support Scottish independence, over and above other factors associated with support for independence. Achieved impact\n\n\n\nPublic impact that has already been achieved is described in a note included in the Research Outcomes System – for example, distributing a research briefing summarizing the results to every Member of the Scottish Parliament during Gaelic week, publishing results in the Gaelic- and English-medium broadcast and print media, and holding a one-day seminar at Edinburgh University in December 2013, attendance at which ranged from parents of pupils in Gaelic-medium education to the Consulate General for Ireland. The media and governmental contacts that were made as part of past impact activities will be used to seek to publicise the results of the new analysis that is noted under ‘exploitation routes’ above.\n\n\n\nFuture of UK and Scotland\n\n\n\nThe briefing noted under ‘exploitation routes’ [Public Item (2)] formed the basis of seminars offered to policy makers and politicians in the run up to the referendum.\n\n \n\nNext Gaelic language plan\n\n\n\nAdvice will be offered to B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig (which has statutory responsibility for promoting the use of Gaelic) on how the results of this research are relevant to its next Gaelic language plan, due to commence in 2017, and thus in preparation now.\n\n\n\nTeaching materials\n\n\n\nWe will investigate the possibility of a small grant from other sources to create resources for schools based on the research, perhaps in conjunction with Storlann (responsible for providing Gaelic educational resources) or Education Scotland (responsible for the Scottish school curriculum). \n Academic \n\n\n\n(1) The Scottish Social Attitudes Survey (SSA)\n\n\n\nOne paper is already published. A second is in press (on the public’s perception of the relative importance of two roles of Gaelic – as communication, and as cultural symbol). Two more are in preparation - one on perceptions of Gaelic as an instance of the linguistic landscape, and the second examines the public’s views about Gaelic in education.\n\n \n\n(2) International Social Survey Programme (ISSP)\n\n\n\nQuestions were included in the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey 2012 that were designed to be comparable to questions about language in the ISSP, which collects data on social attitudes from over 40 countries. When these ISSP data become available later in 2014, an academic paper and public briefing will be written comparing attitudes to Gaelic with attitudes to languages in other countries.\n\n\n\n(3) Teaching\n\n\n\nThe survey materials and data will be used to develop training in research methods for undergraduate students of teacher education at Edinburgh University, as part of the Edinburgh Q Step Centre. \n\n\n\nPublic\n\n\n\n(1) Rannsachadh na G&agrave;idhlig\n\n\n\nA paper wasgiven at the biennial conference on research related to Gaelic, in June 2014. It concentrated on the findings in (1), (2) and (3) in 'Summary' above.\n\n\n\n(2) Public briefing related to the referendum on Scottish independence in September 2014\n\n\n\nFollowing from the findings reported in (4) in 'Summary' above, a briefing waswritten to contribute to debate in the referendum (to be funded and published by Soillse (www.soillse.ac.uk)), and a blog was written for the ESRC-funded ‘What Scotland Thinks’ web site.
