The purpose of the programme is to try and engage these disciplines in multidisciplinary research which is important and relevant in tackling the catastrophic threat that antimicrobial resistance poses. The programme is principally designed to develop a cohort of interdisciplinary research fellows who through the programme, will develop a unique set of hybrid research skills, a positive attitude to multidisciplinary research and the ability to communicate across traditional academic boundaries. We aim that these individuals will become the potential future leaders in multidisciplinary research into AMR. Supporting this main aim, are a range of activities designed to bridge the gaps between disciplines, encourage researchers in different disciplines to engage in collaborative AMR research while also providing valuable learning experiences for the fellows. Activities include developing a virtual network for AMR research, organising conferences and seminars, a sandpit exercise and supporting pump-primed AMR projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M027007/1","grantId":"EP/M027007/1","fundValue":"749583","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Toumazou","coPersons":["Pantelis  Georgiou","Alan  Armstrong","Alison H Holmes"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
