Scientific partner organisations in the global North and in Africa stand to benefit by increased attention to the remains and aftereffects of infrastructural work in health and medical research. Heritage organisations will derive benefit from the documentation and conceptual work performed by the research team in recuperating significant sites and their social and material aspects, and reinserting them into conversations around commemoration and patrimony, and into circulation among cultural workers in museums and the arts.
