The research will collect and analyse new data using farm surveys and interviews with farm owners and employees, as well as analysing existing data.</p>\n\n<p>The three-year project will use a range of criteria of ‘farm viability’ to assess: the productivity of land, water, labour and capital at different farm scales; the impact of income from different scales of farming on livelihoods and wellbeing among rural communities; and the effects of sugar farming on political and institutional relations within rural communities, particularly with respect to conflict and cohesion over natural resource use. While the main policy lessons from this research will focus on the South African land and agriculture context, the research will also seek to identify lessons for policy on foreign financial investment in farmland in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0746","grantId":"RES-167-25-0746","fundValue":"234388","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Analysis of field data has been undertaken over the past nine months. During that time, preliminary results have been presented to small-scale sugarcane growers at a workshop in Nkomazi (in August 2014). They have also been discussed with, and comments received from, agencies involved in supporting small-scale growers, in particular Mpumalanga Canegrowers (representing sugarcane growers' interests) and TSGro (a service company jointly owned by small-scale sugarcane growers and the sugar company, TSB). The findings have also been presented at two conferences (one in South Africa, and one in the UK) and used to prepare a paper to be included in a proposal for a special issue of the journal 'Development and Change'.

In many cases, however, sugarcane growers will not be handing on their farms to their children, as they have become less productive due mainly to deteriorating irrigation infrastructure. Small-scale farmers have been unable to finance repair and maintenance. A minority (34%) of small-scale growers have increased their land holdings and now control half of the area under small-scale irrigation. Such farmers look capable of becoming medium-scale producers and able to earn a living from sugarcane. Many of the remainder will sell their land or become partners in newly formed 'cooperatives' directly managed by the sugar company who will pay the coop members a rent for their land. \nA large area of sugarcane land has been transferred into ownership of black communities via the land reform programme. Most of this land is farmed as 'joint ventures' between the sugar company and the trustees of the land-owning community. The joint ventures pay the community trusts for leasing the community land and 50% of the profit. In practice, only lease income is paid because, although productivity on these farms is very high, profit margins are very small (9%). Further, although lease income has been paid, the governance of the community trusts is not transparent and accounting for trust income is weak. Government agencies and the sugar industry in South Africa will need to review the governance of community trusts that now control farmland. Such a review will need to a) establish more transparent and accountable management of trust income; and b) establish a more diversified portfolio of land use options to enable a broader distribution of the benefits of land use.
