The challenge now is to predict the functions of these proteins and how they interact with each other to give the diverse biological repertoires observed in nature. The three dimensional structure of a protein is much harder to determine than its sequence explaining why fewer than 25,000 structures are known compared with ~2.5 million non-redundant sequences. However, structural data often gives more profound insights into the mechanisms by which proteins act and interact. Also, because structure is more conserved than sequence we can detect more distant relationships giving clearer insights into how proteins evolve. A number of structural classifications exist to group proteins by their structural similarity and are particularly valuable for understanding how changes in the sequences and structures of relatives can modify functions. Since we cannot experimentally characterise all proteins, being able to accurately predict functions from related proteins is essential for understanding biological systems and determining the causes of and remedies for disease. The CATH classification is one of the most widely used and comprehensive of these structural family resources. It has expanded 12-fold since it was established in 1993 and is now accessed by biologists nearly 1 million times per month over the web. The only other resource of this kind is SCOP, which classifies a similar number of protein structures. The two resources employ different approaches, SCOP relying largely on manual inspection for the identification of remote structural similarities whilst CATH applies automated algorithms and manual inspection to validate only the hardest cases. This use of carefully validated automated approaches will ensure that CATH can cope with the massive flood of data expected over the next decade. The worldwide structural genomics initiatives are currently solving the structures for protein families for which no structural information exits. Although these initiatives are very welcome because they are expanding our knowledge of protein structures, they are necessitating faster and much more sensitive automatic methods for CATH, as well as a greater degree of manual validation. In this project we will develop much more efficient ways of classifying these structures to keep pace with the structural genomics initiatives. Since very few proteins have known structures, CATH will bring much wider benefits to the biological community if structural data can be predicted for the millions of sequences not yet structurally characterised. We have already developed very robust technologies for predicting which genome sequences can be assigned to CATH structural families. International competetions have shown these to be amongst the best performing in the world. Using these techniques we can predict structures for up to 80% of proteins in some organisms. In this project, we therefore propose to develop an integrated resource that combines information on structural families with structural predictions for all sequences in the genomes. We also have methods to integrate any available functional information for the proteins. Furthermore, our in-house modelling techniques can provide reasonable 3D models for many of these sequences which will help biologists in understanding the functional properties of the proteins and in determining the functional networks in which they participate. The integrated CATH resource we plan will present biologists with structural data for any protein of interest, combined with comprehensive functional data and highly intuitive web pages that help them to view the structures in the context of all the available functional data. By integrating data in this way this resource will ultimately enrich our understanding of biological systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F010451/1","grantId":"BB/F010451/1","fundValue":"816263","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The CATH classification is widely used by biologists and biomedical researchers to understand the structure and functions of query protein sequences.

The main CATH paper has been cited 2300 times and all CATH publications cited more than 6000 times.

CATH-Gene3D groups together evolutionary related protein domains in order to analyse protein evolution and to inherit protein structures and functions for uncharacterised proteins. Protein domains are classified on the basis of similarities in their 3D structures and/or sequences. Nearly 26 million domain sequences had been classified in CATH-Gene3D by the end of the project. Comprehensive protein family data is valuable for understanding the evolution of proteins domains, which in turn is helpful for designing proteins that have modified functions. It is also valuable for predicting the functions of query proteins. This is important since fewer than 10% of the &gt;40 million protein sequences now determined have experimental characterisation. \n\nA novel algorithm was developed for sub-classifying relatives within a family into subfamilies of relatives with shared functional properties. These functional sub-families were found to be much more accurate in predicting the function of a query protein than assignment to the superfamily. They were also found to be useful for accurately modelling the structures of proteins. In collaboration with Janet Thornton at the EBI, protein family information in CATH-Gene3D was also integrated with functional data from the catalytic site atlas (CSA) and MACIE database of reaction mechanisms to provide a new web-based resource FunTree which displays phylogenetic data for each enzyme superfamily combined with information on ligands bound and chemistries performed by different relatives. \n\nDuring this project the number of proteins classified in CATH-Gene3D was significantly increased to capture nearly 90% of all known protein structures. All the major protein families in nature are now represented in CATH-Gene3D. Another output of the project was a much faster and more sensitive structure comparison algorithm and webserver (CATHEDRAL). This allows biologists to submit a query structure which is then searched against representative structures from CATH to determine to which family the query belongs. CATH-Gene3D is a member database in the widely accessed InterPro resource hosted at the EBI, which has more than 5 million webpage accesses per month. It is one of only two resources (out of 8 in InterPro) providing structural annotations and is therefore important for providing consensus information on predicted structural regions in protein sequences.\n \nCATH-Gene3D classification data is valuable for a number of general activities undertaken by other biologists/biomedical researchers:\n- assigning structures or functions to uncharacterised proteins (as mentioned above)\n- providing information on conserved and variable structural regions in domain families. This data is important information in drug design (ie for designing compounds that bind to proteins in pathogenic organisms but not in human).\n- the multiple alignment data in CATH is valuable for identifying highly conserved positions in a family and likely functional sites. This data is helpful in assessing the likely impacts of genetic variations, nsSNPs etc.\n\nThe structure comparison web-server is valuable for searching for structural analogs that may represent cross-hits for a drug designed to bind to a particular protein structure Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
