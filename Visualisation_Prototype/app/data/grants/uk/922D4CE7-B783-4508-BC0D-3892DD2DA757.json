In future years, older workers will constitute an increasing proportion of the labour force in both countries. Based on case studies of hotels and visitor attractions in UK and Australia, the project will examine the personal learning strategies of older workers as they negotiate the challenges of remaining in paid employment after the age of 50. It will theorise this learning in terms of the co-construction of older workers' skills and identities as they endeavour to sustain their employability through interactions with employers and co-workers in the context of an enterprise culture.&nbsp; The project will also explore employers' attitudes and policies towards older workers, placing these in the wider business context and interrogating them from the perspective of our theoretical model of older workers' learning. The research will improve understanding of this stage in the adult lifespan and inform government policy on how best to support older workers' learning and development.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F025858/1","grantId":"ES/F025858/1","fundValue":"80688","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  Boreham","coPersons":["Roy  Canning"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
