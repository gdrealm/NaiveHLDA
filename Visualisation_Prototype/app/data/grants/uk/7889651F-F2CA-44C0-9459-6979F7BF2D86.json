The Golgi apparatus is a sorting station of the secretory pathway from which proteins can be sorted in at least three directions, to the cell surface (secreted proteins), to the vacuole or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER can be compared to the manufacturing site for a range of products that will be shipped first to the Golgi for subsequent sorting and delivery. To stay in business, manufacturing sites require efficient transport routes to distribution centres. This also means that vehicles should not travel when they are not properly loaded, and they should be doing something useful when they return, such as bringing some mail back. This is not an easy task, and the same is true for the sorting of proteins in living cells. However, cells are very efficient at organising cost-effective supply chains and have developed very efficient transport processes in which no step is perfect but little is left to chance due to efficient back-up mechanisms. This includes the recycling of essential machinery so that they can be engaged in multiple transport reactions during their life-span.\n\nNumerous protein sorting signals (address labels) have been described in the last 20 years and in many cases receptor molecules (lorry drivers) have been identified that bind to the sorting signals and package them into transport vesicles (the lorries). It is however much less clear how the sorting receptors know how to find their way in the cell. In other words how exactly do the lorry drivers reach their right destination, who gives them their instructions and who sends them back for new jobs when they have delivered their cargo? In the cell, sorting receptors must not only bind to ligands in one compartment, they must also transport them to another compartment, release them there, and return back to the original compartment to select new proteins again.\n\nWe would now like to use our recent discoveries to shed light on the complete process of ER retention in plants. Many proteins exported from the ER are meant to be returned, just like the wooden pallets are not discarded in modern logistic firms but they are in fact recycled so that they can be used again to be packed with new cargo. One problem is that there are many more proteins to be recycled than receptors available. Receptors have to bind their cargo very efficiently in the Golgi and preferentially release them in the ER in a place where they will stay for a longer time, whilst the receptors move back to the Golgi using a frequent flyer ticket. This is why we find it exciting that ER import sites and ER export sites are physically separated from each other and we can now start to explore how this is achieved. \n\nWe have also discovered that plants contain two types of Golgi bodies. This is very exciting, because it suggests that instead of one basic distribution centre the plant uses at least two. It was always believed that the Golgi apparatus is a single organelle, so our finding is of major importance. The new Golgi type can be seen with fluorescently tagged receptors (lorry drivers) which represent a new class found in plants, algae and some unicellular organisms but is absent in animals and yeasts. We must first learn how this new class of receptors reaches the new class of Golgi bodies, and next we would like to see what happens if we eliminate this class of receptors and see why plants use these receptors.\n\nFinally, we need to identify more proteins residing in the new compartments that we have discovered to gain a better understanding of protein sorting to the plant vacuoles, which host the vast majority of edible protein on earth. Plant proteins constitute a major food source and must be harnessed as well as we can.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K007181/1","grantId":"BB/K007181/1","fundValue":"382092","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2016-09-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are currently producing transgenic plants with upregulated levels of recombinant HDEL protein levels.
