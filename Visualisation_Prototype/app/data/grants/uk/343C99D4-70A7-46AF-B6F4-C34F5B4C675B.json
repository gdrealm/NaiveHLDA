{"id":"343C99D4-70A7-46AF-B6F4-C34F5B4C675B","title":"FLIP: Developing biorenewables based feedstock and clean chemistry technologies for the pharmaceutical industry","abstractText":"Plants have evolved to produce a vast array of complex chemical structures to fight off attacks from herbivores and pathogens and to protect themselves from often hostile environments. These chemical structures also provide plants with medicinal properties that human civilisation has relied on for millennia. We now know the identity of the chemicals responsible for a number of these medicinal properties. The pharmaceutical industry has used these chemical structures to develop drugs either directly from the plant derived chemicals or by chemically synthesising related structures that mimic the plant chemical. The use of plants as a sustainable source of high value chemicals for industry has been recognised by the UK government as a key area for growth in the next decade. This interchange programme will establish much closer interactions between GlaxoSmithKline, a global pharmaceutical company headquartered in the UK, and the University of York, which has a critical mass of researchers in plant biochemistry, novel crop development, green chemistry and industrial biotechnology. Specific objectives include the identification of new plant derived feedstocks for high value chemicals, evaluation of technology platforms that use biocatalysis and fermentation based processes to modify chemical structures and lower input, more sustainable platforms for extraction and processing of chemicals from various plant feedstocks. The interchange also aims to train academic staff and students in the practices used by industry to select targets and projects for development and to increase awareness of how industry-academic partnerships can operate to mutual gain, allowing both the need of academia to publish and the need of industry to protect intellectual property to be met. Knowledge and technology will also move from academia to industry through the interchanger and also by direct engagement with key opinion formers from the company in an organised workshop, and follow up visits to industry by academics. Ultimate success of the interchange will be measured through the increased uptake of high value chemicals from plants by the pharmaceutical sector and overall contribution to the Government vision of the UK becoming a top 3 producer of high value chemicals from plants by 2025.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L004917/1","grantId":"BB/L004917/1","fundValue":"131807","fundStart":"2013-05-28","fundEnd":"2014-11-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Not applicable this year.

These opiates are presently obtained by extraction and subject to vagaries of increasing climatic risk or manufactured by chemistry routes using environmentally sensitive reagents. Multiple hosts were evaluated, mutant enzyme evolution explored and one application optimised then taken for scale-up evaluation to reduce reagent cost and increase concentration. A successful manufacturing route has been identified and is presently being scaled for commercial implementation in 2015-16.\n\no New supply chain process for production of Noscapine.\n\nKnowledge of available extraction technology was combined with laboratory experimentation to establish feedstock pre-treatment options, extractant (solvent) selection and examine downstream purification routes. Lab experimentation design was based on industrial knowledge combined with academic input. Pilot trials were conducted and critical initial feedstock pre-treatment options were evaluated at York's Biorenewables Development Centre (BDC) then tested at scale at the industrial site. An empirical scale model was used and a plant trial conducted with several issues identified (high salt loadings and lower than forecast yields). Additional laboratory trials led to a successful plant trial and then to the first commercial scale production after 14 months development. \n\no Industry / Academic Bi-directional Knowledge Transfer.\n\nA more rigorous extraction scale-up methodology was concurrently developed and this tool will be made available for future natural product scale-up work for high value chemicals from plants via both the BDC and HcCfP network. New academic-industry collaborations were established including one on Diterpeniods as platform molecules. Visits and seminar presentations were used to facilitate the knowledge transfer.\n\no New options for sustainable manufacture of Opiates.\n\nUsing input from the Green Chemistry Centre (University of York) a panel of bio-based solvents were identified including emerging materials and matched against an array of potential industrial applications. New collaborative programmes were established in order to evaluate these in specialist industrial applications. Industry / Academia bi-directional knowledge transfer will be made available to others through established networks from the University of York, Biorenewables Development Centre and the High Value Chemicals from Plants NIBB. This will include (1) biomass extraction scale-up model and review information (2) metabolite ranking aggregation bioinformatics. \n\nThe establishment of new industry-academic collaborations (e.g. diterpenoids), industry-industry collaborations (e.g. GSK and Circa) and academic- academic collaborations (e.g University of York Green Chemistry Centre and University of Melbourne) will further facilitate knowledge transfer and develop new pathways to impact.\n\nBy direct use of findings by GSK, for example the new manufacturing supply chain for the pharmaceutical noscapine, the industry first biotransformation of opiate alkaloids and the application of deep metabolite profiling coupled with the bioinformatics tool MRAS for line selection.
