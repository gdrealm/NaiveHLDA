{"id":"C234DA0F-B7A3-4A96-AF75-976F5FADF30A","title":"Public services: international comparison of responsiveness using anchoring vignettes","abstractText":"<p>Responsiveness to user preferences is a key concern of most public services. However, the concept of responsiveness, while embracing notions of user experience with accessing services, is often poorly defined and measured.&nbsp;Moreover, international comparisons of responsiveness are hampered by variations in measurement instruments and cultural interpretations of the concept.</p> \n<p>The most ambitious attempt to measure public service responsiveness is the World Health Survey (WHS), administered by the World Health Organization in 70 countries since 2002.&nbsp;Data was collected on respondents’ assessments of the responsiveness of their health system across a number of dimensions. Respondents were also asked to assess the responsiveness associated with a set of ‘anchoring vignette’, each describing a hypothetical situation.</p> \n<p>Drawing on data from the WHS, this research will examine the scope for developing international comparisons of public service responsiveness.&nbsp;The work aims to address the extent to which information provided in the responses to the vignettes is useful as a basis for adjusting individual assessments of health systems for the importance and cultural interpretations different population groups attach to aspects of responsiveness. The results will have wide relevance by informing survey design and analytic approaches in future international comparative surveys of public services.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-166-25-0038","grantId":"RES-166-25-0038","fundValue":"222389","fundStart":"2006-11-15","fundEnd":"2009-06-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This research provides methodological and policy insights. From a methodological perspective, the work makes a distinct contribution to the literature on performance measurement where data are self-reported and prone to systematic reporting behaviour. We have advanced the methodology of anchoring vignettes as a valid survey-based instrument to adjust self-reported data and we have undertaken methodological investigations of the underlying assumption of the vignette approach.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, the results provide national and international organisations and policy makers with a deeper understanding of potential variations in performance of public services across countries. They offer policy analysts a means to adjust and anchor comparative analyses to place them on a more equal footing. In addition, the work will inform the design of surveys aimed at establishing the comparative performance of public services. \n\nWe have disseminated the research to academic and policy audiences (World Health Organization, the Department of Health).

For comparisons to be credible the extent to which individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds differ in their reporting of objective levels of performance needs to be considered. Only after such differences have been accounted for can informative comparative analyses take place. The research informs comparison of public sector performance across countries, particularly where performance outcomes of interest rely on self-reported survey data such as user's ratings of healthcare received. Such measures are prone to systematic reporting behaviour such that a given level of care received is rated differently by different individuals. The research demonstrates how vignettes (descriptions of fixed levels of care) can be used to anchor an individual's reporting of the care they have received. This is crucial to understand better differences in performance, particularly across countries where preferences and norms may differ. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
