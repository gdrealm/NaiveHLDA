{"id":"F1FA7A8C-FD3C-44E4-9C51-EAD915045CF8","title":"Urban Transformations Co-ordinator","abstractText":"This proposal identifies a work programme that addresses the requirements of the work for the ESRC Urban Transformations co-ordinator. The programme of work aims to curate the portfolio of investments in urban research by the ESRC, develop a co-ordinating role in the ESRC call for grants under the urban transformations rubric and to identify future spending priorities in urban research linked to Newton funding and potential cross council research funding opportunities. The work is broken down into seven stages over a period of 18 months from December 2014 to May 2016.\n\n1. Inception. In the first stage of the programme the PI will focus on the identification of work priorities in tandem with the ESRC urban transformation team and senior academic and policy stakeholders.\n\n2. Consultation and gap analysis. In the second stage of the programme the PI will consult with ESRC urban investments to develop the most appropriate avenues for maximising knowledge exchange and research impact related to their work and refine the scoping work that identified profiles for future funding. \n\n3. Coordination and collaboration. In the third phase of the work programme the PI will commission and develop the knowledge exchange web platform, develop procedures for showcasing the ESRC urban portfolio and agree a communications strategy across the portfolio. This work will complement the PI's role in co-ordinating the ESRC research grants call for the urban transformations portfolio.\n\n4. Narrating the ESRC portfolio. In the fourth phase of the work programme the PI will develop a narrative that describes the urban portfolio of ESRC investments. This will be developed firstly internally with the senior ESRC commissioning team and subsequently as a public document.\n\n5. Knowledge exchange and communication. In the penultimate phase of the work programme the PI will launch the knowledge exchange web platform and develop a programme of blogs, academic synthetic pieces and policy commentaries and debates that maximise the interactive quality of the website.\n\n6. Maximizing impact. In the sixth stage of the work programme the PI will develop a series of five impact workshops with key ESRC investments to promote knowledge exchange and develop good practice in generating research impact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M010996/1","grantId":"ES/M010996/1","fundValue":"713139","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2018-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Keith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
