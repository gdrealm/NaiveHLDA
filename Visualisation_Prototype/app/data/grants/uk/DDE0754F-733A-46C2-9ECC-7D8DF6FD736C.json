Pain warns us of damage to our bodies. However, in many instances it would be desirable to reduce the pain we feel (like after surgical interventions, for example). In order to achieve that in an effective way, we would need to know how the brain generates the sensation of pain. We are able to perceive pain because the contact with potentially dangerous objects (like a hot saucepan) activates specific nerves that transmit the information regarding this danger to the brain. In the brain, this information is processed, leading to the awareness of the painful stimulus. We know from brain scanning experiments that large portions of the brain respond to pain. However, only a part of these process the /specific/ features of information regarding the dangerous stimulus (like how hot the saucepan is, or which hand has touched it). The aim of my research is to understand which activities in the human brain process these /specific/ aspects of the painful stimulus (like where it is, how it feels and how strong it is), as compared to brain activities responsible for processing other less specific aspects of the painful stimulus (for example, how much unknown, surprising or intolerable it is). Attempts at identifying, localising and understanding the brain activities responsible for processing specific aspects of painful information have not been successful. This information would enable us to produce better and more specific drugs for treating abnormal pain conditions, a considerable advance for both basic research and drug development. In addition, this would yield a robust 'objective' measure of pain perception, which is a highly-desired and still unavailable tool in research and clinical practice that, for diagnosis and monitoring of treatment efficacy, still relies too heavily on patients' 'subjective' reports of pain perception. Brain scanning techniques can show us which parts of the human brain are active when we experience sensations and feelings. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures small changes in oxygen concentration when parts of the brain become active, and can tell us accurately /where/ the active brain areas are. Another technique, known as EEG (electroencephalography), measures the electrical activity of cells in the brain, tells us accurately /how/ and /when/ different parts of the brain are active. Until now, EEG and FMRI had to be carried out separately. Technological advances now allow us to perform them at the same time. By combining the two we get much more information about how, where and when the brain reacts to a painful stimulus. To investigate how we feel pain I will cause painful sensations in normal volunteers by delivering laser stimuli to the skin of the hand. A laser stimulus produces a sharp burning sensation, like when a drop of boiling water falls on our hands while we are cooking pasta. Laser stimuli have revolutionised the study of pain because they activate only the nerves that convey the information of pain, without activating the nerves responsible for other information (touch, vibration, movement). This is a very clean and reliable way to study pain, since everything I will record from the brain (using EEG and fMRI) will not be confounded by all the brain activities that are not relevant. This proposal is divided in three experiments. In the first two experiments I will use multichannel EEG to define /which/ brain activities mostly reflect the processing of specific pain features, and /when/ they happen; painful and non painful stimuli will be delivered and compared, to unravel specific from non specific aspects of perception. In the third experiment I will combine EEG and fMRI to localise accurately /where/ in the brain these specific activities take place.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G01177X/2","grantId":"BB/G01177X/2","fundValue":"255682","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been published in several (&gt;12) scientific articles, in primary peer-reviewed journals.

From this discovery, we have identified some features of the brain response that reflect more faithfully the quality of a painful percept. The notion that the brain response elicited in the human brain by a sudden nociceptive stimulus is not specific for pain has profound implications in the way other research group design experiments and interpret collected data.
