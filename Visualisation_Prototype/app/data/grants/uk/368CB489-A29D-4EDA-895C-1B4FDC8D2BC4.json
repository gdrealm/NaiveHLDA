These features are of great importance in analysing and contributing to the development of modern linguistic theories. \\n\\nEach chapter will draw comparisons with other national dialectal varieties as reported in published literature.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E004873/1","grantId":"AH/E004873/1","fundValue":"35312","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Donall P.
