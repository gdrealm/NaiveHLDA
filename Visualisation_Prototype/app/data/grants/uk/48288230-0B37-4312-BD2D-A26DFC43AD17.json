This international collaborative study aims to develop new semiconducting polymers that enable photovoltaic cells with controlled morphology and interfacial properties. Novel materials will be developed that are compatible with soft nanoimprint lithographic methods and will be used to form nanostructured all polymer photovoltaic cells. Charge separation in organic semiconductors occurs at nanoscale molecular heterojunctions necessitating the need for control of both molecular structure and interfacial morphological structure. Crosslinkable semiconducting polymers optimized for nanoimprinting will be synthesized and used to form photovoltaics with structurally controlled heterojunctions. These nanostructures will also be used to guide formation of molecular interlayers that improve the charge separation process. Advanced x-ray scattering methods will be used to probe the resulting morphology in nanoimprinted polymers. Optoelectronic characterization of organic photovoltaic cells with controlled interfacial properties will reveal new insight into the charge generation process at organic molecular heterojunctions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I002936/1","grantId":"EP/I002936/1","fundValue":"241168","fundStart":"2010-10-04","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The grant has resulted in singificant understanding of the role of processing additives on the long term stability of organic solar cells. These results, recently accepted for publication in Adv. Energy Materials, are significant both in terms of academic understanding, and also for the fledgling organic solar cell industry, where stability is a big factor.

One supervised by Prof Heeney, the PI, and the other by professor McCulloch, the CI. Between the two students they have publised over 15 papers on their research. \nKey findings have been:\n1. The development of new types of donor polymer for organic solar cells, leading to high efficiencies of organic solar cells.\n2. The development of new types of semiconducting plastics. These may have application in the development of printable electronic devices.\n3. Understanding of the factors influencing stability in organic solar cells. Stability and lifetime are critical factors for organic solar cells, and here we developed initial approaches to improving lifetime.\n4. The development of scalable approaches to the synthesis of semiconducting polymers. The development of crosslinkable additives and polymers, which can improve device stability and lifetime is an important finding. We expect that other researchers or companies working in the area of organic solar cells can apply these results to their particular materials set in order to improve lifetime and device reliability.\nOur work on the development of scalable methods of poylmers synthesis by the use of flow reactors has potential application in other areas of polymer chemistry, such as the synthesis of di-block copolymers. We are applying for further funding to develop these techniques further, in collaboration with industrial partners. Chemicals,Electronics,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
