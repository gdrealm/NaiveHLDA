They are similar in some ways to electrons but they don't have any electric charge. It was recently found that neutrinos are not massless but have a very small mass. Super-NEMO is one of several planned future experiments to investigate the nature of the neutrino and in particular whether a neutrino is the same as its antiparticle or not.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G008914/1","grantId":"ST/G008914/1","fundValue":"24064","fundStart":"2009-01-23","fundEnd":"2009-07-22","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Julia  Sedgbeer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
