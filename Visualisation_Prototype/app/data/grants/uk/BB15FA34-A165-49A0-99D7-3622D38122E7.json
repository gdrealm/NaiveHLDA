This means that almost 30 % of the population, which makes up six million of the twenty million households in the UK, is directly affected by ageing and disabilities (sourced from UK National Statistics Website, accessed 2006). \nBy the year 2025, the over-65 population is anticipated to rise from 15.4% of the EU population in 1995 to 22.4%. There is a need therefore for electronic communications service providers to maintain an adequate level of service to this population and the imposition of Universal Service Obligation measures specifically targeting this segment of the population. As regards children, in recognition of the increased significance of determining appropriate policy for educating those children with special needs, a Government Select Committee on Education and Skills for special educational needs is currently consulting with the public and NGOs and other experts to help inform government policy in this area. \nThe Select Committee will inquire into the provision of special education needs in mainstream schools and special schools. The Committee will review availability of resources, expertise and different models of service provision. The planned research is therefore very timely in that it will feed into the Committees work and help inform government policy in the specialised area of determining the suitability of legislative provisions providing for access to appropriate technology for those with special needs. The research examines how two important bodies of UK law set out obligations on service providers to make access to technology &quot;user-friendly&quot; for those with special needs when accessing on-line services both in the public and private sector. The first body of law relates more generally to education, discrimination and mental health law. The second body of law relates to the regulation of technology, specifically: telecommunications; information technology; electronic commerce, and broadcasting law. The idea is to cover specifically UK law and European Commission policy that might influence UK law in this area. The novelty of the research therefore is to bring two very different bodies of law together for the first time (as far as the Author is aware) with the common focus of assessing the legal obligations for the provision of access to &quot;appropriate technology&quot; for those with special needs. The research will also look more broadly at the UK government's policy of inclusion for those (including adults) with disabilities/special needs. A more detailed description of relevant context is given in the attached Case for Support. Potential applications and benefits:\n\nAims: In summary, this would include reviewing specific legislation on children and young adults (special needs) in the UK and whether such legislation covers access to appropriate technology.\n\nPotential applications and benefits\nThe main application is to produce a set of conclusions and recommendations that will feed into UK Government's current policy on special needs provision in the UK with the specific aim of addressing the use of technology. The main benefits of the research include:\n(i) A cross-disciplinary assessment of law relating to special needs provision and current regulation of technology;\n(ii) Dissemination of the results of the research to a wide audience of government strategists, education, health and social service professionals;\n(iii) Forming the basis of a specialist teaching option for a new LLM in Healthcare and Human Rights that will attract professionals from the sectors listed in (ii) above in the UK and wider Europe;\n(iv) Responding to questions on the historical background to special needs law in the UK and other questions listed in the case for support","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E504760/1","grantId":"AH/E504760/1","fundValue":"17439","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rohan  Kariyawasam","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
