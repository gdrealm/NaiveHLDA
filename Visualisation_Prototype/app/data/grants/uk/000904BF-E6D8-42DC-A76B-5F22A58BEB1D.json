{"id":"000904BF-E6D8-42DC-A76B-5F22A58BEB1D","title":"Isolated Acts: Theatre in Asylums and Hospitals","abstractText":"Isolated Acts investigates the practice of theatre and performance in psychiatric environments. The twentieth century has witnessed manifold changes to the delivery of mental health care. This network is particularly concerned with the movement from asylums to hospitals to community based structures in relation to the theatre practice taking place therein. By drawing together a broad range of academics, clinicians, and practitioners this research network explores the plural ways in which theatre and performance have been used within psychiatric contexts. The network considers the performance histories of, and current practices within, these psychiatric care spaces. Moreover, it interrogates the changing patterns of care, the radical shifts in architectural environment, and the mutable understanding of psychiatric illnesses and how these have impacted on performance work in care settings. Concurrently, the network deliberates how professional theatre practice has sought to represent psychiatric environments in the same period. The network will excavate the largely overlooked theatre history of performance in psychiatric spaces and examine what is at stake ethically, politically, therapeutically in such work. The network will also rethink the manners in which practitioners have attempted to translate psychiatric spaces, and individuals' experiences of these spaces into theatre aesthetics. The network places the work that takes place within psychiatric contexts in dialogue with work that takes places about these psychiatric environments. In this way the network is able to reflect more fully on the practice of theatre and performance in psychiatric contexts. This project seeks to shed new light on notions of space, well being, and live performance. By bringing together figures from across seven academic disciplines from psychiatry to art history, as well as collaborating with international artists, health care professionals, and asylum archivists the project will investigate the history and politics of theatre and performance in controlled psychiatric environments. \\n\\nThe network will comprise two events in 2011: a practice-based one day symposium at the University of Exeter; and a two day conference at the University of Cambridge. These events will generate important new research in this field and sow the seeds for future research and collaboration. The network will produce a co-edited special issue of the journal Medical Humanities and also will also disseminate the research to a broader online community through a dynamic website. By attempting to understand an overlooked part of theatrical practice and explore its relationship to psychiatry this research network will contribute to a better understanding of performance, mental health, illness, and well being. Our collaborative investigations into the role and nature of theatre in and about closed environments will shed important light on how we understand, both historically and currently, the impact of the arts in mental health and care. This network departs from a keen sense that mental health matters. It seeks, therefore, to uncover the role of theatre in this context.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J001333/1","grantId":"AH/J001333/1","fundValue":"35110","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anna  Harpin","coPersons":["Juliet  Foster"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" The project had three key findings. Firstly, the project excavated a wealth of archival, ephemera, and other research materials relating to the history of performance in psychiatric asylums. These materials made luminous the need for further research in this area in order to uncover the full history of theatre and psychiatry in the twentieth century. The second finding was that this history was anything but 'isolated'. Indeed, the discovery of plural interrelationships between the asylums and the community via performance was an very valuable discovery. The third finding that was central to the project from its inception was the value of genuine interdisciplinary dialogue. The range of participants at both events - from artists to service users to psychiatrists to scholars - lead to dynamic and challenging dialogue. The participants were forced to examine the limits of their own languages and narratives in this field of study and engage with alternative modes of thinking. The two events have led to further networks of activity developing across fields. For example, British theatre maker and activist Julie McNamara is now collaborating with Professor Susan Cox from University of British Columbia, Department of Applied Ethics on a performance research project. Similarly, Stepping Out Theatre Company, a UK based service user collective, is now in coversation with Stand Up for Mental Health, a Canadian service user company, and discussing possible practice-led collaborations. Moreover, through the events I have made connections with other academics in the field and have become participants in related networks such as the International Health Humanities Network. There are examples of new relationships and practices for every member who participated. The network, in this way, has led to new research collaborations, new practice projects, and begun to foster a new dialogue in the field. In summary, the project discovered a wealth of historical material, identified striking relationships between communities and asylums, and fostered urgent new dialogue and projects in this interdisciplinary field of study. It represents the first step on a journey towards new thinking in the area of mental health and the humanities. The findings of the project have application in plural spheres outside the academy. Principally these are theatre practice, clinical practice, and public engagement. The website is particularly key in this latter strand of impact. I am also applying for support to develop the website into a more comprehensive research tool in the area of madness and representation. This will involve expanding the content but also, importantly, improving the production values of the site and its interactivity with the support of a web design team.
