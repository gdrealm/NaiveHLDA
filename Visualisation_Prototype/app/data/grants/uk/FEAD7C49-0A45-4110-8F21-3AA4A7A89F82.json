On the one hand the BBB is extremely efficient at preventing exposure of the brain to potentially harmful substances. On the other hand it ensures that nutrients essential for physiological functions can reach the brain. Permeability of substances across the BBB is regulated by many factors including size and lypophilicity (solubility in lipids). In general terms, small lypophilic molecules permeate better than large hydrophilic ones. Furthermore, some molecules can permeate the BBB via alternative mechanisms including being transported across by carriers, specific channels or by energy dependent mechanisms. Conversely, other compounds are not able to cross as immediately pumped out by certain specialised proteins. Drugs able to cross the BBB distribute widely across the body and exert their action both at the brain level as well as on the peripheral tissues. This can be a disadvantage as often only peripheral (or only central) effects are needed for the therapeutic action. In this project we suggest the use of nanotechnologies to restrict a drug action to the administration site. This technology has wide applicability and excellent potential for medical applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H021477/1","grantId":"EP/H021477/1","fundValue":"101141","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Francesca  Greco","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
