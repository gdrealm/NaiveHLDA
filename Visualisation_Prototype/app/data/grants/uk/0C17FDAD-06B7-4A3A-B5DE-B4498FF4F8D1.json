{"id":"0C17FDAD-06B7-4A3A-B5DE-B4498FF4F8D1","title":"Biomedical Catalyst â€“ Staphylococcus aureus Vaccine","abstractText":"S. aureus is a bacterium that colonises the nasal lining and skin of &gt;30% of people. Accidents, surgery or device implantation that breach natural barriers, allow invasion, which may result in life-threatening infections such as pneumonia and blood-borne infections particularly by the antibiotic resistant form (MRSA). Despite several attempts S. aureus no vaccine is yet available. All vaccine clinical trials have failed despite promising pre-clinical animal model data. The partners and subcontractors in this project led by Absynth Biologics Limited and the University of Sheffield are bringing together capabilities to address this problem namely: novel vaccine targets and technologies to more effectively stimulate the human immune system. This coupled with a greater understanding of the development of infection (physiological and immunological) will be used innovatively to select the best candidate vaccine for clinical development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_14090","grantId":"MC_PC_14090","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon J.
