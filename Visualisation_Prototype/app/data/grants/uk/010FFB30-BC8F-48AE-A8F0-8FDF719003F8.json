{"id":"010FFB30-BC8F-48AE-A8F0-8FDF719003F8","title":"CAPP: Combining Plant and Algal Photosynthesis","abstractText":"In most plants, growth rate is limited by the rate at which carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken up and converted to sugars in the process of photosynthesis. The enzyme responsible for the first step in this process, Rubisco, does not work at its potential maximum efficiency at the current levels of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere. If levels were much higher, photosynthesis would be faster and plants would grow faster. This speeding-up of photosynthesis will happen naturally over the next fifty years or so as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise due to human activities. However, there is an immediate requirement for increased crop productivity to provide food for the rising population of the planet. Our project addresses this problem. We are studying a mechanism present in tiny green algae that results in high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside their photosynthesising cells (called a Carbon Concentrating Mechanism, or CCM), enabling Rubisco to work at maximum efficiency. We have recently discovered important new information about this mechanism, and we have invented new and rapid methods to discover algal genes that contribute to it. We have two complementary and parallel aims. First, we will apply our new methods to identify all of the genes required by the algae to achieve high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside the cells, and we will discover exactly how these genes work. Second, we will transfer the most important genes into a plant, and study whether the same CCM can be recreated inside a leaf. If it can, we expect that our experimental plant will have higher rates of photosynthesis and hence a higher rate of growth than normal plants. This work will provide new insights into how plants and algae acquire and use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, of great importance in predicting and coping with the current rapid changes in the atmosphere and hence in climate. The work will also contribute to strategies to increase global food security, because it will indicate new ways in which crop productivity can be increased.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I024518/1","grantId":"BB/I024518/1","fundValue":"372138","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our work has been used by collaborators and additional external researchers because we have: (i) provided insights into the structural and regulatory components associated with the chlamydomonas carbon concentrating mechanism and immunofluorescence markers for sub-cellular localisation (Cambridge); developed a novel insertional mutagenesis method for use in algae, as well as unique nanosensor systems to demonstrate internal inorganic carbon pools and pH (Stanford) which are available for use in Education,Energy Societal,Economic","person":"Howard  Griffiths","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" In most plants, growth rate is limited by the rate at which carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken up and converted to sugars in the process of photosynthesis.

We are studying a mechanism present in unicellular green algae that results in high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside their photosynthesising cells (called a Carbon Concentrating Mechanism, or CCM), enabling Rubisco to work at maximum efficiency. During the initial CAPP1 programme, we discovered important new information about this mechanism, and using new and rapid methods we have identified novel algal genes and additional regulatory components which allow the CCM to operate in association with a specific micro-compartment called a pyrenoid. We have also successfully introduced some of these components into a model higher plant, Arabidopsis, and also successfully introduced a modified form of Rubisco which may facilitate aggregation into the pyrenoid. The ambitious goals of the CAPP2 extension will be to combine the expression of the CCM and pyrenoid in the Advanced Plant.\n\nSpecifically, we have made substantial progress towards our original CAPP1 goals of expressing correctly-localized components of the Chlamydomonas CCM into a model C3 higher plant (Arabidopsis). We have also identified previously unknown algal CCM components, acquired new understanding of CCM regulation during day/night cycles, and started to generate an in vivo sensor for HCO3-. By the end of CAPP1, we have (i) an extensive list of novel genes associated with the CCM in Chlamydomonas (Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, US); (ii) new insights into regulation of chloroplast pyrenoid formation, intrathylakoid membrane organization and post-translational modification of CCM components during day/night cycles (Cambridge, UK); (iii) physiologically characterised Arabidopsis plants expressing several CCM components (the Advanced Plant) (John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK). The collaborative nature of the programme means that our finding are being used by our research partners at JIC Norwich, Edinburgh University and the Carnegie Institution, Stanford US; meanwhile our research activities are enhanced by resources and techniques developed in Edinburgh and Stanford Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
