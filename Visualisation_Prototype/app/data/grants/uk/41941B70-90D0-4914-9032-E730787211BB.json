However life expectancy does not truly reflect the health of our ageing population. Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) adds a quality dimension to life expectancy and indicates how many remaining years are expected to be healthy ones. It is already known that life expectancy and HLE at birth and at age 65 vary considerably across England and Wales. Through three linked work packages this project will explore the reasons for these inequalities, specifically addressing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>how life expectancy and HLE at different ages in local authorities changed between 1991 and 2001, and the extent to which the changes were explained by variations in area-level social factors (deprivation, ethnic minority levels, unemployment, etc)</li>\n\n <li>the relative contribution of individual-level social, health and lifestyle factors to inequalities in HLE and which transitions (onset of ill-health, recovery, mortality) they affect.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The third work package will focus on evaluating the different methods for calculating HLE from cross sectional and longitudinal data and, in particular, which methods are most robust when there is missing data or when the time intervals between interviews are unequal.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2970","grantId":"RES-062-23-2970","fundValue":"475598","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We have produced an edition of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries' Longevity Bulletin on the topic of Healthy Life Expectancy that can be downloaded from their website and has received a lot of attention.\nWe have run four national and international workshops, three for early career researchers and one for UK local authority researchers on calculating healthy life expectancy. Each workshop used methodological and substantive findings from the project.\nFindings from the project on inequalities informed the debate on Scottish independence.\nFindings of the project sparked discussion about using DFLE instead of SMR in the NHS resource allocation formula.

We have clearly shown that using life expectancy as a surrogate for population health vastly underestimates health inequalities since inequalities between local areas in life expectancy are for the first time for decades slightly decreasing and are much smaller than inequalities in healthy life expectancy (which are increasing)\n2. Only more affluent areas seem to be responsible for the overall positive trend in DFLE since 1991\n3. Unemployment and social class are the main factors that explain variation in healthy life expectancy between areas but a further factor is the proportion of non-white people which has grown in importance over time\n4. Inequality in the very old population can is not explained by the same factors that impact health inequalities in the younger population\n5. We have produced the first estimates of disability-free life expectancy by ethnic group and have shown that most ethnic groups spend significantly fewer years free of disability. This is particularly the case for Indian women whose life expectancy at birth is similar to White British women but whose disability-free life expectancy is significantly less\n6. Unhealthy behaviours, particularly excess alcohol consumption and binge drinking, explains differences in healthy life expectancy between regions. InHALE strengthened the evidence base for using health expectancy rather than life expectancy (or SMR) in the resource allocation formula for the NHS.
