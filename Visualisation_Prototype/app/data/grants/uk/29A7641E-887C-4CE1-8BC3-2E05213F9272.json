{"id":"29A7641E-887C-4CE1-8BC3-2E05213F9272","title":"AlgaeFlow - Novel acoustic microalgae harvester for sustainable biomass production","abstractText":"Although microalgal systems offer many advantages for chemical production (e.g. higher productivities per acre, valuable co-products), industrial-scale manufacture faces significant techno-economic challenges that must be overcome before algal biomass can be produced sustainably. To address this important challenge, this study investigates a cost-effective, in-line cell harvesting system based on scale independent acoustic profiling, with a view to improving the efficiency and lowering the cost of commercial microalgae production by several orders of magnitude. This multi-disciplinary innovation is enabled only by converging world-leading bioprocess expertise from the University of Cambridge (UC) with LabXero's (LX) cross-sector bio-sample extraction IP leveraged from the medical diagnostic/agri-food domains and AlgaeCytes (AC) and Unilever (UL) end-user input. As a platform technology, applications exist beyond microalgal production for the wider benefit of industrial biotechnology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N010310/1","grantId":"BB/N010310/1","fundValue":"76653","fundStart":"2016-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Slater","coPersons":["Adrian Carl  Stevenson"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
