The overall aim of the project, RICEFUEL, is the pilot-scale development of a microbial based process able to convert rice straw-derived sugars into the advanced biofuels butanol and alkanes. The RICEFUEL proposal draws on the key strengths of the two research communities, and in particular INDIA's expertise/skills in rice straw pre-treatment and hydrolysis, process development and scale-up combined with UK skills/expertise in enzyme characterisation, systems/synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. The project will cement the growing collaboration between the two communities to the benefit of both parties, and provide a natural extension to outputs from the BBSRC Sustainable Bioenergy Centre (BSBEC).

It was notable that the Indian delegation offered a range of skills in process engineering and scale up, whereas the UK delegation was characterised by bringing cutting edge, genomic, systems and synthetic biology approaches to many areas of bioenergy development. This partnership emerged out of the discussions held at the workshop. By combining the respective strengths of the two communities, there is a real opportunity to make significant progress towards bacterial-based routes to chemicals and fuels from biomass. \nHaving formed the partnership, an opportunity arose to cement the collaboration with a programme of work within the BBSRC-DBT Sustainable bioenergy and biofuels (SuBB) programme between India (ICGEB, ICT and Jawaharlal Nehru and Madurai Kamraj University) and the UK (Universities of Nottingham, York, Oxford Brookes and Newcastle). The partnership funds were used to support the first meeting of the group in January 2013 where the forthcoming joint work was planned.
