Bizarrely designed and tuned (with 9 to14 strings), it makes an unearthly sound most appropriate for grief and lamenting. Invented in 1505 by a pupil of Leonardo, Atalante Migliorotti, it reached Rome just after 1600. By then its repertoire was beginning to show clear signs of the new Baroque style, in which the excesses and exaggerations of the counter-Reformation were in full force. \\n\\nI began playing the lirone in 1980, when I was virtually its only exponent. Today there are dozens of ensembles in the world who feature the instrument, but who carelessly splash its special colour around, so much so that its effect has become almost banal.\\n\\nIn 2007 I was awarded an AHRC fellowship to research the lirone, its repertoire and its cultural setting. Since then I have investigated historical sources and, most importantly, all positively identified repertoire for the lirone in order to decipher unfamiliar performance indications for dynamics, phrasing, ornaments and harmonies, as well as to find clues about Italian prosody and rhetoric. I have also been able to expand the repertoire considerably by applying principles from the identified works to select new repertoire, and I have investigated how best to use the lirone within the dramatic unfolding of the musical narrative.\\n\\nI have amassed a huge collection of manuscripts (funded by the Southampton music department), mainly from the Vatican Library. They contain over 1000 cantatas, many of them written by Luigi Rossi and Marco Marazzoli, prominent composers of several of the identified works. The material has had to be carefully sifted to identify music appropriate to the instrument. I have already transcribed and edited music, texts and translations for 14 cantatas; these will provide the basis of our first recording, and are to be published by Edition Baroque in Bremen.\\n\\nThis has been a tremendously exciting endeavour, from which I have drawn a wealth of material based on subjects from the ancient world and early Christianity. Works on Artemisia the Greek queen, whose excessive grief turns into a monstrous nightmare, the miserable and aging Helen of Troy, and Mary Magdalen, who struggles in solitude with her penitence, are but a few of the incredible treasures waiting to see the light of day. The remarkable poetry is the work of many distinguished Romans, several eminent cardinals, and a pope.\\n\\nIn order to create my own convincing performances of this repertoire, I have founded an ensemble, Atalante, which has a number of projects planned, all under the series title of Reliquie Romane. The first is a Purcell Room concert in October 2009 as part of a South Bank Centre early-music weekend. Following the concert we will record the material for the innovative new record company committed to effective marketing of their CDs and artists. Beyond this, there will be a second recording in the spring, related videos and several more concerts.\\n\\nConcert promoters and recording companies cannot cover all the rehearsal and artistic preparation time that this music requires. For this reason I am making the request for a small practice-led grant to fund two substantial rehearsal periods, travel and accommodation of foreign artists, instrument hire and moving, rehearsal-space hire, a share of the video costs and administrative assistance. \\n\\nAs wonderful as the music is, there are barriers of language and culture to overcome for it reach a wider public. Opera benefits from full staging and surtitles, but chamber music does not. For this reason our concerts will be semi-staged, with subsequent video recording of musical excerpts to illustrate the laments' rich narratives, to help market the CDs on the internet, and to enhance my lirone resource web pages, which will be linked to my Southampton website.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H018646/1","grantId":"AH/H018646/1","fundValue":"29072","fundStart":"2009-11-16","fundEnd":"2010-11-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Research concepts and materials have been enormously invaluable in the preparation of editions from manuscripts, in performance practice questions particularly with respect to Italian poetry and rhetoric, and in creating really effective programmes and videos to enhance listeners' experiences.
