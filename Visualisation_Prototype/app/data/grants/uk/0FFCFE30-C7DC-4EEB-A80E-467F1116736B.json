This process recycles carbon and is mediated by microbial enzymes called oxygenases. Many aromatic hydrocarbons / such as benzene and naphthalene / are priority pollutants in the environment and their remediation is mediated by such microbial enzymes. In addition, these enzymes have turned out to be very useful in producing high value compounds that are of potential value in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry. Such chemicals are extremely difficult to make chemically. This because the enzyme, unlike cruder chemical reactions, can accurately add chemical groups, in the case of di-oxygenases hydroxyl groups, to produce chiral molecules / that is either one of a pair of compounds that are mirror images on each other but are not identical. The current understanding is that microbial dioxygenases / that incorporate two oxygen atoms into aromatic compounds / employ an electron transfer process from cellular cofactors through a complex of proteins. Recent work here has indicated that we have discovered a very novel and potentially more efficient electron transfer system in soil bacteria called rhodococci. We intend to study the mechanism involved in this process in detail. Exploitation of this oxygenase system in these bacteria has significant implications for the efficient production of new chiral compounds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E013848/1","grantId":"BB/E013848/1","fundValue":"316989","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  There has been a considerable exchange of results from this project in relation to the environmental remediation activities of the QUESTOR Centre industrial membership (see http://questor.qub.ac.uk/).

A key step the recycling of natural and human made chemicals is reaction with oxygen. This is done by a wide range of oxygenase enzymes in bacteria found widely in the environment. This study specifically looked at a novel group of microbial oxygenases that &quot;fix&quot; molecular oxygen into aromatic compounds. The study focussed on investigating and engineering a novel naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) electron transfer system from a widely dispersed group of bacteria called Rhodococcus. This would demonstrate its general utility in many bioprocesses. This would also provide background understanding of how dioxygenase enzymes can be used to produce chiral compounds such as cis-dihdrodiols as synthetic pre-cursors in pharmaceutical development. Furthermore, there is a growing use of microorganisms in the clean-up of polluted environments where the precise biochemical mechanisms are not fully understood. The enzymes themselves consist of a complex series of proteins that are a technical challenging to study. We assigned the role of genes (nar genes) involved in functioning of the NDO complex for all of the proteins involved. This involved reductase activity exhibited by the second enzyme in the pathway. A further role for proteins such as Rub1, Rub2 and the NarK was shown by investigating all permutations and a wide range of molar ratios of protein with respect to the NDO protein (or Iron Sulfur Protein (ISP) NarAaAb complex). This in turn showed surprising peroxidase activity that holds out a promise of wider exploitation of NDO in biocatalysis. EPR spectra of the ISP (NarAaAb complex) also indicated the possibility of cycling of electrons between the components of the structure. We observed that the nar genes are conserved in many Rhodococcus strains. However it was surprising that the cluster does not encode reductase that was expected from studies on other bacteria. Instead the acquisition of these genes requires an exogenous (i.e not encoded within the cluster) reductase to mediate activity. These observations greatly inform our understanding of a novel mechanism that it is widespread in nature. The impact of the findings has been in two main areas of activity.\nFirstly, in studies of environment clean-up technology or bioremediation whereby microorganisms are deployed in polluted soils and ground waters. Secondly, in the exploitation of these enzymes in developing chiral pharmaceutical compounds. Both of these involve direct interaction with industry. These are summarised in the impact narrative.
