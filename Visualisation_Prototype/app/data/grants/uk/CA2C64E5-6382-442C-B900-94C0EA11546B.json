There needs to be a symbiotic relationship between the two disciplines and chemistry-based industry in the UK because the health of industry and academia are mutually dependent. The chemical industry is a major contributor to the UK economy but it faces unprecedented pressures (for example from global competition) which can only be countered by rapid and sustained innovation. However UK chemistry and chemical engineering departments simply do not currently have the interdisciplinary capacity to underpin this demand for innovation. Current progress is too slow and the UK lags way behind many countries, particularly USA, the Netherlands, Germany and Japan. DICE is a joint proposal from chemists and engineers which seizes the unique opportunity presented by the Science &amp; Innovation Call to create a completely new research environment with the potential to catapult the UK to the forefront of this field. DICE will immediately deliver 6 new young lecturers with the support needed to launch research at the Chem./Chem. Eng. interface. Over 5 years, DICE will reshape the whole academic supply-chain (from undergraduate to postdoctoral) to provide a stream of researchers to sustain the continuous UK expansion of academic and industrial innovation at this interface. DICE will deliver new science and new technology, bringing engineering into areas where it is underexploited. Our programme pulls new ideas and techniques into the UK from across the world to strengthen and re-invigorate the UK research base. DICE builds on internationally acclaimed research successes at Nottingham which cut right across the Chem./Chem. Eng. divide. The nucleus is a group of chemists and chemical engineers whose work spans pure and applied research and links academia with industry. The. group has achieved on a small-scale what must be achieved nationally in this area. DICE builds on and expands their approach to create a Chemistry/Chemical Engineering Partnership, with a range of skills unique on a world scale, capable of making a substantial impact on UK science. DICE will drive the dissemination of ideas to universities and industry across the UK. Our Proposal involves several radically new initiatives(I) Flexi-Chairs: a completely new type of post to enable internationally-leading chemical engineers with a track-record at the Chem./Chem. Eng. interface to make extended visits to the UK to inject ideas and best practice from overseas. The Flexi-Chairs will be given postdoctoral support to initiate new, cutting-edge research in the UK; researchers from the USA, Japan &amp; EU have already expressed great interest in the Flexi-Chairs. (ii) New research initiatives with high potential, including catalysis/biocatalysis, reaction chemistry, polymer synthesis and processing, instrumentation/process monitoring, photonics/devices, multi-scale modelling and education. (iii) Placement of Outreach Postdoctoral Researchers in leading chemical engineering departments at Birmingham, Imperial College, Newcastle and Sheffield, creating new partnerships to seed new research at the Chem./Chem. Eng. interface, and to train young researchers as candidates for the new generation of academics in this area. Each PDRA will work with a PhD student funded by the university hosting the placement. (iv) Flexible secondments to bring in key UK and EU industrial researchers to academia for both inward and outward knowledge transfer and to help the new staff in establishing their own industrial links.The University of Nottingham supports DICE very strongly and will commit more than 1M to fund two extra lectureships, additional Flexi-chairs, two technicians and a business development officer, all dedicated to this Project. In addition, the University will fund and provide dedicated flagship space to incubate the new research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D501229/1","grantId":"EP/D501229/1","fundValue":"3478060","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  There have been many successes of the DICE group. Here we highlight just four, which illustrate the variety of activities that the DICE funding has spawned:\n(i) Liquid surface science: DICE appointee, Licence has carried out ground breaking experiments on Ionic Liquids which have become the starting point for an entirely new discipline. He showed that, at ambient temperature, ionic liquids do not evaporate even when exposed to ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. This observation demonstrated that ionic liquids could be studied using the vast range of UHV based techniques that were previously limited to the study of solid materials and were typically the domain of Physicists and Surface Scientists, i.e. XPS, SIMS, Auger, LEED and a number of synchrotron based experiments Licence's breakthrough has allowed solution chemists to probe the structure and indeed the role of ionic liquids in chemical processes including catalysis, electrochemistry and the production of new materials. In collaboration with Nottingham surface scientist RG Jones, the Nottingham group have also investigated the nature of ionic liquids at high temperatures using UHV-based techniques including temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and mass spectrometry. They have shown that, at elevated temperatures, ionic liquids can be vaporised and have identified the vapour phase species as neutral ion pairs. The evaporative process has even been used to distil ionic liquids at synthetically useful scales. Since Licence's DICE appointment, his group has published &gt;35 peer reviewed articles including highly cited articles on XPS of Ionic Liquids, liquid surface science and indeed the vapour phase of Ionic Liquids, In 2010 Licence published the first review of on &quot;Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Ionic Liquid-Based Interfaces&quot;, in the high impact journal Chemical Reviews; it summarised &gt; 200 contributions to this rapidly growing field.\n(ii) Benign Production of Renewable Aerogels: Aerogels are highly porous materials (more than 90%) which exhibit unusual properties, such as high surface area, low density, and very good insulation properties. They can be produced from silica, alumina, tin oxide, chromia and carbon, with silica the most widely used. The unique properties associated with aerogels have led to their use in applications such as catalysts, catalyst supports, thermal and sound insulators, electronics, particle filters, in space and particle research and as a storage media for gases in fuel cells. More recently, cellulose has gained interest as a source material for the production of renewable and biodegradable aerogels. Currently, the largest commercial application of aerogels is their use as high performance insulation materials, as they display heat conductivities 2-10 times lower than common polyurethane and glass wool insulation materials. However, their cost, use of toxic precursors and centralised production (leading to the shipping of large volumes of air-rich materials) makes their wider take up problematic. Interdisciplinary research discussions inspired DICE appointee Wim Thielemans to invent a benign scalable method for producing cellulose-based aerogels that could lead to the production of aerogels at the site of their use. His method, published recently in the journal Green Chemistry, is based on the self-assembly of cellulose nano-whiskers in water using sonication. Subsequent solvent exchange with ethanol and supercritical CO2 drying gives high surface area, low density materials. The cellulose nano-whiskers are long rigid rods obtained from acid hydrolysis of cellulose fibres from plant material. \n(iii) Carbon Capture &amp; Storage (CCS): A chance conversation in the tea-room led to chemical engineer T Drage collaborating with PI Poliakoff and CI MW George to apply gas-liquid phase measurements to the problems of improving the efficiency and safety of the UK CCS programme. This collaboration has resulted in three major projects and nearly ?1M funding from industry and the EPSRC. The facilities in Chemistry at Nottingham are unique in the UK but would never have been applied to CCS without the catalysing effect of DICE. The current joint CCS project employs 2 PDRAs and a PhD student.\n(iv) Engagement with the Public: Modest DICE funding was an absolutely crucial factor in the setting up of our YouTube channel The Periodic Table of Videos, which has one video for each of the 118 elements of the Periodic Table, www.periodicvideos.com. The site involves collaboration with video journalist Brady Haran and three of the DICE appointees plus PI Poliakoff. Launched in July 2008, the now has &gt; 65k subscribers (more than the ledzeppelin or AmericasGotTalent YouTube channels !). It is the fifth highest book-marked chemistry website on the internet and is viewed by individuals and schools right across the world, attracting daily fan-mail and even occasional unsolicited gifts. It has received wide spread national and international press coverage and won the 2008 IChemE Award for Excellence in Education and Training, the SPORE Prize of the journal Science and M Poliakoff was awarded the 2011 RSC Nyholm Medal in Education, largely on the basis of Periodic Videos. In 2011, the website gave rise to invited articles in both Nature Chemistry and Science. A Brazilian museum exhibit based on the website won a prestigious international award in 2012. It was also praised for cost effectiveness in the EPSRC 2009 International Review of Chemistry. The channel currently posts 2 or 3 new videos each week including updates, molecules and chemistry in the news. It is currently supported by EPSRC, the University and outside donations which totalled ?94k in 2011.
