We are interested in processing of signals and images which have vector samples (for example, colour images have three numerical components at each pixel position representing the intensity of the red, green and blue components of the image at that pixel). Vector signals occur in seismic campaigns (used for oil prospecting) where each sample represents the strength of vibrations in the ground in 3 dimensions at each sample point in time. The particular aspect of our work which requires the use of hypercomplex techniques is that we process each sample (with three components) as a whole, and do not process each component separately - this would ignore some of the vital information about the relationship between the components which contains information about the 3-dimensional direction of the samples and the relationships between samples, and thus information about the signal or image as a whole. Over the last three years our work has benefited from modest EPSRC funding which has allowed the Visiting Fellow and the applicant to work together face-to-face for a week each year (the rest of the year we interact by email, but expect to use video-conferencing over the Internet shortly).Hypercomplex numbers are a higher-order form of complex number, with four components. Their particular usefulness in our work is that they can represent geometric information in 3 or 4 dimensions, and there are algebraic formulas corresponding to geometric operations. However, using these numbers algebraically in signal and image processing is not trivial. We have steadily built up and published formulas and ideas and produced computer implementations. This has lead us to quite a deep understanding of the algebra of hypercomplex numbers.Particular topics to be studied over the next three years include: the use of complexified hypercomplex numbers (in which each of the four components of the hypercomplex number is a complex number) and the geometric operations which can be represented by them; the properties of complexified hypercomplex Fourier transforms, and whether they can be used to implement colour image filtering operations more easily and elegantly. Using new knowledge of complexified hypercomplex numbers and geometry we expect to be able to establish the full set of possible geometric operations which could be used for vector signal and image processing, and thus develop filters systematically, by considering all the geometric possibilities. In the past we had to develop filters ad-hoc by trying to think of possible geometric operations, because we could not see how to do it more systematically.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E010334/1","grantId":"EP/E010334/1","fundValue":"30652","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen John  Sangwine","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
