{"id":"A832154E-C5EC-4353-9FEB-388EC155EC50","title":"Creating Sustainable Innovation through Design for Behaviour Change","abstractText":"The proposed project will result in the first holistic overview of design for behaviour change as a driver for sustainable innovation. This will provide a basis for developing successful strategies for the effective implementation of sustainable innovation through design for behaviour change by public and private service providers with focus on SMEs. \n\nDesign is a significant driver for sustainable innovation, because it is able to realise new insights and perspectives that are people-centred as well as manage uncertainty due to its catalytic multi-disciplinary nature. Recognised for some time, design for behaviour change is as yet lacking an overarching and coherent framework to include ecological, economic and social perspectives and approaches. The best-known area of design for behaviour change currently is sustainable design, followed by design for health and well-being, safety design, and social design. While research has shown significant opportunities, realisation in professional and public contexts is only emerging.\n\nThe project brings together a significant inter-disciplinary and multi-institutional network of key national and international academic partners and non-academic stakeholders with an interest in sustainable innovation through design for behaviour change. It will thus bring together two sets of stakeholders: key proponents of design for behaviour change from academic research, and relevant public and private service providers with an interest in facilitating behaviour change through design. This will allow the project uniquely to explore current key approaches to design for behaviour change in a wide range of applications, including safety design, design for health and well-being, and social design.\n\nThe investigation will focus on two main areas: \n\nThe review of current key models and approaches of design for behaviour change, comprising Design for Sustainable Behaviour Change, Persuasive Technology, Design with Intent, Mindful Design, Socially Responsible Design, Designing out Crime and Design against Crime, amongst others. Including proponents of several of these theories, the network offers the unique opportunity to provide an overarching review that is able to draw out commonalities and differences between the various approaches and practices in the different areas of design for behaviour change. This review will form the basis for establishing a holistic framework that can accommodate and provide strategic co-ordination of the current fragmented approaches.\n\nThe project will investigate current understandings, needs and gaps concerning sustainable innovation by public and private service providers, and how to address them more effectively through the use of design for behaviour change. For this purpose, relevant non-academic stakeholders will be engaged firstly through a broad online survey to elicit current knowledge and concerns, and from which secondly relevant interested non-academic stakeholders will be identified and invited to participate in a number of targeted focus group discussions to elicit key data concerning understanding, challenges and opportunities of adopting and implementing design for behaviour change strategies.\n\nThe network partners will utilise links into the most important Design Research Networks and Design Business Partnerships to explore the needs and opportunities for using design research to facilitate innovation businesses. In particular, we will focus on how public and private service providers, particularly SMEs, can benefit from this research.\n\nThe network will produce a range of strategic outputs including an interactive online project resource, a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the field drawing on both academic and non-academic stakeholder views and approaches, and an international network on design for behaviour change, using a results workshop and social media to engage and communicate the project results to a broad range of audiences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L013525/1","grantId":"AH/L013525/1","fundValue":"39586","fundStart":"2014-03-20","fundEnd":"2014-09-19","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  By the end of the project (19 September 2014), the project findings have been publicised through an international conference presentation and the summary report, and subsequently the full summary report, which has been disseminated widely to interested participants from the survey, on the project website, through the Design Lab, and through various social media channels, reaching in excess of 20,000 people. Further awareness will be achieved through publication in public fora, e.g. Wikipedia page. \n\nFuture impact, is anticipated will be achieved through raising awareness of design for behaviour change and its benefits, as well as of models and guides collected through the survey to aid implementation. Also, some of the findings of the survey are already being adressed: Some of the non-academic stakeholders who have participated in the project, are already taking some of the findings and recommendations of the project forward. For example, one of the non-academic stakeholders is developing a practitioner-led journal on design for behaviour change. This was one of the perceived needs of non-academic stakeholders, which the focus groups had revealed.\n\nOther projects concerning the implementation of design for behaviour change in social and sustainable contexts are emerging as a result of the project publications.

The project included an extensive literature review, a broad online survey and two focus groups with non-academic stakeholders, and and a public results workshop. The project has resulted in: \n- an overview map of approaches and examples of design for behaviour change as a guid for academic and non academic stakeholders;\n- a number of recommendations of how to advance the field of design for behaviour change and its implementation to enable sustainable innovation;\n- the building of a lasting network to promote design for behaviour change and its implementation.\n- the setting up of an online resource to enable access, interaction and dissemination of all project activities and findings. The findings have a wide application for anyone interested in design for behaviour change from within design and without, across the areas of health and wellbeing, sustainability, safety and social concerns.\n\nInterested stakeholders include for example people from industry, charities, policy makers, government agencies, and the academy, which have been reached through the online survey, as well as awareness raising publicity through the Design Council and various social media.
