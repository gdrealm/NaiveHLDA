The authors believe that the quality of a student's experience and engagement in mathematics in school is crucial to their disposition and identity and consequently has a great influence on their choices and future success in mathematically-demanding subjects at college. \n<br />\n<br />The project will pursue its objectives by means of:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ol>\n <li>Interviews with 20+ students about their background and experiences during their progression from GCSE into post-compulsory education. Students will be interviewed on two occasions: before they enter college and during their first days at college. These students will come from four feeder schools (two schools for each of two colleges) within diverse socio-economic areas and as far as possible reflecting diverse educational practices.</li>\n <li>Case studies of educational practices will be conducted in each of the schools and colleges.</li>\n</ol>The students and institutional case studies will provide rich accounts of how socio-cultural and educational factors can influence decisions and afford/constrain the students' identities as learners of mathematics.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G000174/1","grantId":"ES/G000174/1","fundValue":"78037","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Alberto Hernandez-Martinez","coPersons":["Julian  Williams"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
