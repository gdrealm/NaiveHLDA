We will bring leading international researchers to the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation to share their knowledge and expertise with staff, post-doctoral researchers and students, and enhance the quality and impact of our research. The programme will support existing collaborations and develop new lines of research in the following major areas of our research programme: (1) Experimental cosmology - the interface between observational data and theoretical models, with a special focus on dark energy, and relying partly on our membership of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. (2) Cosmological perturbations - how the ripples in matter and spacetime are generated and evolve and produce the structure in the universe. (3) Higher-dimensional gravity - what the ideas of string theory mean for our universe. (4) Gravity waves - calculating the gravity waves from black holes and from the early universe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D002141/1","grantId":"PP/D002141/1","fundValue":"15824","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Roy  Maartens","coPersons":["Robert  Nichol","Robert  Crittenden","David Graham Wands","Marco  Bruni","Bruce  Bassett","William James  Percival"],"organisation":"University of Portsmouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
