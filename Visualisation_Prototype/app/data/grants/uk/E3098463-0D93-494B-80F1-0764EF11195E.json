The greatest variations are observed in the dorsal cortex and near its junction to other structures (at the pallial/subpallial boundary). Dorsal cortex of avian and reptilian brains contains only a component of the six layered isocortex of mammals. Although fundamental structures of the isocortex are similar in all mammals, there is a drastic increase in cortical size and complexity in mammals culminating with the human brain. Comparative developmental studies suggest that the elaboration of the mitotic compartments might have been the drive behind mammalian cortical evolution (Rakic, 1995; 2006; Kriegstein et al., 2006; Molnar et al., 2006a,b). The mechanisms and genes responsible for generating these variations can be understood by studying cortical development in various different species. This proposal examines two groups of genes. (1) The first group consists of protein coding genes which are known to be involved in cortical neurogenesis, formation of layers, radial and tangential migration of neurons. (2) The second assortment includes non-coding so-called 'macro-RNA' genes that exhibit distinct signatures of purifying selection, suggestive of functionality. Using the tools of modern genetics and comparative genomics we shall sequence and compare selected groups of genes from both categories and test their function in knockout mice and in in vitro and in vivo experimental paradigms. Through the study of these coding and non-coding genes, we wish to determine, in various taxa, the context in which the most common cortical development genes operate. Comparative aspects of cortical development not only point to evolutionarily relevant changes, but they also draw our attention to the limitations of some of the model systems currently used to understand human cortical developmental abnormalities and indeed reveal the mechanisms responsible for these abnormalities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F003285/1","grantId":"BB/F003285/1","fundValue":"540596","fundStart":"2008-02-04","fundEnd":"2011-05-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Zoltan  Molnar","coPersons":["Kay  Davies","Chris  Ponting"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" This BBSRC funded project on &quot;the roles of non-coding and protein-coding genes in evolutionary expansion of the cerebral cortex&quot; has been completed and numerous publications disseminated the results.

Alter the regulatory elements in additional KOs. We have a manuscript almost completed on this area which shall be soon completed and submitted; Sirey et al.). Some of our databases: E.g. http://genserv.anat.ox.ac.uk/layers or http://genserv.anat.ox.ac.uk/brainevo. shall be of very general use for the neuroscience and comparative neurobiology community. The knowledge of the coding and non-coding genes during cortical development and adult could be fundamental in understanding normal and abnormal development and disease association. E.g. we provided the first transcriptomic atlas of cerebral cortex in mammals (see: http://genserv.anat.ox.ac.uk/layers from &quot;A transcriptomic atlas of mouse neocortical layers.&quot; Belgard TG, Marques AC, Oliver PL, Abaan HO, Sirey TM, Hoerder-Suabedissen A, Garc?a-Moreno F, Moln?r Z, Margulies EH, Ponting CP.
