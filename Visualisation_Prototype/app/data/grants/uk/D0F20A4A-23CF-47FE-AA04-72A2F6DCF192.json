To reach and grasp a tool appropriately for use requires not only that we reach accurately for a seen object but also that we access knowledge of how that tool is used. This research project will investigate&nbsp; how tool-use is affected in people who have suffered brain damage. There is&nbsp; evidence to suggest that access to knowledge of tool-use is disrupted in those with damage to the left side of the brain and diagnosed as having &quot;ideomotor apraxia&quot;, but previous research into this syndrome has relied on insensitive or uncertain methods of investigation. In the present project we will&nbsp; improve on this work by using sensitive measurement of hand movements during use of different sorts of tool under controlled experimental conditions. </p>\n\n<p>These experiments will not only add to our understanding of the processes involved in normal tool-use, but may also be of clinical value. Patients with ideomotor apraxia are disabled by their difficulties in manipulating tools and other objects. Improved knowledge of&nbsp; the nature of&nbsp; the ideomotor apraxia will provide a scientific foundation which will aid the design of new rehabilitation therapies.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3231","grantId":"RES-000-22-3231","fundValue":"83548","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Sunderland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" This project was concerned with the question of how humans are able to translate their cognitive knowledge of tools and other familiar manipulable objects in their environment into appropriate motor commands for reaching and grasping. This was addressed by working with stroke patients in whom this process was impaired (cases of ideomotor apraxia). A first achievement of the project was to devise and demonstrate a new method for measuring interactions with tools. This method uses sensitive measurement of hand rotation as an indicator of the application of tool-use knowledge, and this offers a significant advance on previous methodologies involving simple behaviour rating scales or over-complex measures of joint motion. A second contribution of the project was to test predictions from the two streams theory of action and perception (Milner &amp; Goodale, 2008) which suggests that there are separate brain systems for cognition and visual control of action, and that the two have to work in concert to allow normal purposeful behaviour such as use of tools. Consistent with this theory, we demonstrated that apraxic patients were selectively impaired in their interactions with familiar tools but not with simple geometric forms for which there was no need to apply cognitive knowledge. Furthermore we showed (as predicted) that this effect was specific to patients with damage to the left cerebral hemisphere. This has added to evidence for a special role of left hemisphere systems in representation of tool knowledge and opens the door to future research (with patients and normal participants) into how this information is encoded and utilised.\n\nSubsequent work with normal volunteers probed the limits of integration of action and cognition by requiring rapid reaching to tools or objects which changed their orientation as they were reached for. The timing and accuracy of these responses was consistent with the two streams model. There are potential applications in stroke rehabilitation where apraxia is a barrier to recovery. This project has provided new research tools for investigating how humans are able to skilfully manipulate tools or objects in their environment.\n\nIt has supported the influential two streams model, but also suggested new research questions which need to addressed.
