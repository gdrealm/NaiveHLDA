The proposed activity would develop a case study from an earlier collaboration which led to a HLF application and use this as a promising model to broker new relationships. We believe that this approach adds value to the Open Days by presenting research expertise in a context that will stimulate debate and the exchange of knowledge, while providing a springboard for new ideas. At the same time, it will have the indirect benefit of also deepening and enhancing the existing relationships.\n \nIn 2010, the University of Salford built a heritage-led, sustainable urban regeneration case study for culture-led sustainable urban regeneration as part of a Vice-Chancellor's Iconic City of Salford research project (http://www.rgc.salford.ac.uk/cms/news/article/?id=169). The project involved eight academics, The Hive at St. Johns, and thirteen other public, private, and third sector organisations in creating 'Building the Hive in Broughton', the four-year case study. The 'Building the Hive in Broughton' programme centres on the transformation of a Grade-II listed, redundant church into a centre for creativity, culture and the arts. It also includes a suite of creative learning/participation activities engaging with the diverse cultural heritage of Broughton, East Salford. In December 2010, The Hive at St. Johns submitted a &pound;1million stag-one HLF application for the 'Building the Hive in Broughton' programme, in which the University of Salford was a key named partner. March 2011 brought news of success at the stage-one phase and The Hive at St. Johns is currently working toward the stage-two application submission in June 2012 toward an October 2012 start for the programme. The timing of this Connected Communities call allows in-depth research development for the case study's final development and potential implementation, as well as building new partnerships for innovative community heritage design and delivery.\n\nThe University of Salford is committed to developing sustainable and mutually-beneficial partnerships both in and beyond the Salford community. The collaborative relationship between the University of Salford and The Hive at St. Johns will serve as a best-practice model to illustrate how partnership work can support and deepen the impact of community heritage actions by third sector organisations. \n\nThe 'Building the Hive in Broughton' research development programme will embed inter-disciplinary research in the very ways envisaged by the Connected Communities programme: capturing the &quot;potential for increasingly inter-connected, culturally diverse communities [for enhanced] participation, prosperity, sustainability, health and wellbeing&quot; within culture-led regeneration. Each member of the University of Salford's research team holds considerable experience with community partnerships and engagement activity. As a collective, their varied expertise encompasses the visual arts, performance, heritage and culture, design, creative documentary, archaeology, sociology, health and wellbeing, ecology, the natural and built environments.
