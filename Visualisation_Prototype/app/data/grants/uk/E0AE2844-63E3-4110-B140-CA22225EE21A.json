{"id":"E0AE2844-63E3-4110-B140-CA22225EE21A","title":"Understanding non-response and reducing non-response bias","abstractText":"<p>This study addresses the nature of the non-response process on social surveys and how this relates to bias in survey estimates. Specifically, the study examines aspects of the survey process that have the potential to be manipulated by survey researchers in ways that may lead to improved response rates and reduced non-response bias. In this way, the objective is to identify improvements to survey methods. A range of data sources&nbsp;are used, some of which are unique and have yet to be applied to non-response research. Several novel contributions of this project are evident. The study consists of five sub-projects:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Developing a structured framework of factors affecting non-response bias;</li>\n\n <li>Cross-national replication of non-response research;</li>\n\n <li>Interrogating call data to better understand links between field processes and non-response bias;</li>\n\n <li>The relationship between manipulable survey design features and non-response bias;</li>\n\n <li>Reducing attrition on longitudinal surveys.</li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-175-25-0005","grantId":"RES-175-25-0005","fundValue":"231148","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Lynn","coPersons":["Gerry  Nicolaas"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
