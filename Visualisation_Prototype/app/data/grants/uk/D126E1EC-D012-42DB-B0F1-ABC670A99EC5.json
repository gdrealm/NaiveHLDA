{"id":"D126E1EC-D012-42DB-B0F1-ABC670A99EC5","title":"Thermal Management of Industrial Processes","abstractText":"This research project addresses the process industry contribution to the UK government goals of tackling climate change and reducing dependence on imported fuel. This programme fills these nationally important objectives by investigating the short, medium and long-term provision of energy for the UK, based on thermal technologies that exploit low grade process heat that is currently not recovered by this industry. The results of this 'Whole Systems Analysis research will improve plant efficiency and displace a significant fraction of fossil fuel use, thus reducing UK carbon dioxide emissions, by using techniques that are secure, clean, affordable and socially welcome. This research involves collaboration between several highly relevant industrial partners (e.g. Corus Ltd, North East Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) Ltd, EON UK, Veolia (Sheffield Heat &amp; Power Ltd), Pfizer Ltd, etc) and four internationally leading academic centres of excellence (Universities of Sheffield, Newcastle, Manchester &amp; Tyndall Centre). The research programme targets a national problem by exploiting their complementary expertise through Whole Systems Analysis . Thus the objective of this research proposal is to investigate new and appropriate technologies and strategies needed for industry to exploit the large amount of unused low grade heat available. This will be achieved by providing a systematic procedure based on a comprehensive analysis of all aspects of process viability that will enable industry to optimise the management and exploitation of their thermal energy. This detailed procedure will be backed up by a sustained channel of communication between the relevant industrial and academic parties. This multidisciplinary work is thus applicable both to existing plants and the design of future plants. Please note that the establishment of an associated but separately funded EPSRC Network (e.g. PRO-TEM) is considered to be an integral part of this project, in order to satisfy the implicit role of technology transfer in both directions, between the process industry and the wider academic community. It will also provide access to industrial players who will provide essential case studies for the technical and socio-economic work. The case for an associated PRO-TEM Network is briefly discussed herein and the case is presented in detail in a separate proposal by Newcastle University.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G057133/1","grantId":"EP/G057133/1","fundValue":"330997","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Novel results obtained from this program have been widely used by UK local authorities i.e. Sheffield City Council, industry e.g. Veolia Environmental services, Forgemasters, EON UK Ltd etc. The work has also been published/presented at national and international events Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"V Nasserzadeh - Sharifi Sharifi","coPersons":["Jim  Swithenbank"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" Novel use of low grade heat for residential, domestic and district heating as part of low carbon city wide heat network The results from this study has already been used in order to investigate the next phase of Sheffield district heating network expansion as well as the potential for installation of heat storage units across the city Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
