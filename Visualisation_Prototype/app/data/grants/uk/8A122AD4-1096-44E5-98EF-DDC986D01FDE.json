We want to stimulate and inspire Science Communication and give scientists the tools they need to go about it. We aim to: \n\nAims\n\nEngage children with Science by:\n\n- Getting children excited about science\n- Linking exploration, imagination and fun with science in the minds of children\n- Engaging children long-term with the science curriculum \n- Explaining core principles in science, using a new and exciting method \n- Motivating children to study Science beyond 16, with a particular focus on the gender disparity in Physics at A-Level and beyond \n- Supporting teachers in delivering curriculum\n\nEngage children with STEM careers by:\n\n- Sparking children's interest in science careers\n- Linking the curriculum to frontier research \n- Demystifying science and routes into STEM careers\n- Combating stereotypes surrounding science and STEM careers\n- Presenting and promoting female role models in science\n- Initiating relationships between schools and ScienceGrrl scientists \n- Offering mentoring and work experience opportunities through ScienceGrrl schemes\n- Supporting schools in delivering careers advice\n\nStimulate and encourage Science Communication by:\n\n- Inspiring scientists to communicate their research to the public and educating them on how to go about it \n- Giving scientists tools to work with young people and facilitate workshops\n- Developing now&gt;press&gt;play's ability to work with experts to communicate complex scientific ideas to young people\n- Ensuring rigour in now&gt;press&gt;play's presentation of frontier scientific research and complex ideas\n- Developing a model for science communication which can be developed, built upon and repeated nationally","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L001535/1","grantId":"ST/L001535/1","fundValue":"8182","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Alice  Lacey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"now>press>play","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
