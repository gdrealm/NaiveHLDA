Plastic electronics is a rapidly developing field of research in which the individual devices are based on organic (e.g. polymer or plastic) materials. The advantages of such plastic circuitry is that it is relatively cheap to produce and it can be made in large area and flexible forms (e.g. suitable for displays). This project focuses on the development of memory elements for plastic electronics technology. The work will follow up a successful project at Durham in which the charge storage elements are small metallic particles (nanoparticles).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D039924/1","grantId":"EP/D039924/1","fundValue":"244789","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Charles  Petty","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" The aim of the grant was to explore two different strategies in order to develop memory devices based on organic materials. Specifically, our objectives were to: follow up our initial experiments with nanoparticle flash memory devices, and to provide an understanding of the underlying physics of operation; to extend the work to organic semiconductors; and to explore the use of metallic and semiconductive nanoparticles in resistive memories.\nThe first two areas formed a natural extension to our Further research is needed (further funding) to explore the implications of our findings. Electronics companies should then approached to see if these have any interest in taking the work forward to commercial development.
