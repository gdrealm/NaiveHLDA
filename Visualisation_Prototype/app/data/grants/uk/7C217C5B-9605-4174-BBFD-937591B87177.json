Quantum cryptography is one such technology:\ncommunication whose security is guaranteed by fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. The implementation of quantum\ncryptography relies on the ability to generate single photons of light on demand. Several different physical systems have\nbeen used to generate single photons, but very few of them are suitable for commercial production as they are impractical\nand inconvenient. An ideal single photon source should be fast, cheap, operate at room temperature, and emit photons at\nthe wavelengths used in existing optical-fibre based telecommunications systems. In fact, a practical single photon source\nis expected to look very like a type of semiconductor laser diode called a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). In\nthis year-long project we will assess the feasibility of mass-producing low-cost, room-temperature single photon sources\nwith telecom-wavelength emission by developing novel VCSEL devices whose active regions incorporate tiny\nsemiconductor nanostructures called self-assembled quantum rings. This will allow us to leap-frog a stage in the\ndevelopment of practical, i.e. commercial, single photon sources, and to make a realistic assessment of their commercial\npotential.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M50838X/1","grantId":"EP/M50838X/1","fundValue":"115052","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Manus  Hayne","coPersons":["Qian Dong Zhuang"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
