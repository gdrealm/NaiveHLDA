The instrument needs further development of the chemistry side of the instrument that detects the biomarkers. This grant provides funding for the Lead Institute and Principal Investigator to manage this work being undertaken at Cranfield University and Imperial College London. The Life Marker Chip instrument is being developed for a mission to Mars in 2018 as part of the joint ESA/NASA Mars Exploration Programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H003622/1","grantId":"ST/H003622/1","fundValue":"56801","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  This grant was part of a series to develop the Life Marker Chip instrument for Mars, for details please see ST/i00209X/1  ","person":"Mark Rayner Sims","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
