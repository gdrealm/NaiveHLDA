The study involves a nationally-representative sample of 5,000 households (some 10,000 individuals) in Britain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H00811X/1","grantId":"ES/H00811X/1","fundValue":"3377240","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The Centre produced many hundreds of outputs, and generated findings in many areas that are too numerous to document here.

This Strand examined the processes determining the life chances of children in the short- and longer-term, and also changes in the family itself, including fertility. We analysed the roles played by parental attitudes and behaviours, the home environment, social networks, and ethnic differences, considering socioeconomic outcomes in childhood, young adulthood and later life. These include educational and labour market achievement and also problematic outcomes such as risky and anti-social behaviours.\nStrand 2. Working lives. This Strand focused on individuals' attitudes, expectations and preferences in relation to education and work, and gauged how these factors shape lifetime employment careers and how the experience of education and work in turn influence attitudes. For young people, parental views and the family environment are of particular interest; for people of working age, the focus was on the relationships between career progress, changing attitudes to work, the experience of different working arrangements, and their working environment - the characteristics of the organisations they work for and the occupations they work in.\nStrand 3. Inequalities and opportunities Inequality and disadvantage at the aggregate level are the consequence of differences in social change processes at the individual level. This strand provided new work on the nature of social divisions and diversity. In addition to the focus on economic variables like wages and household income and their variation across social and ethnic groups, we examined differences in non-economic aspects of individuals' lives and investigated the theoretical underpinnings of distributional analysis.\nStrand 4. Advances in research methods. This Strand continued the development and application of methods for longitudinal analysis but also included new work on methods for international comparisons, survey measurement problems, methods for combining datasets and the linking of experimental and qualitative research to surveys. The Centre produced many hundreds of outputs, and generated findings in many areas that are too numerous to document here.
