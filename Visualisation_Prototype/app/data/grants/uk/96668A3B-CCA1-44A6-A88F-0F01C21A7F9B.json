The project findings will be disseminated by four journal articles, policy briefings and a co-authored monograph.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-181-25-0020","grantId":"RES-181-25-0020","fundValue":"177595","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Roland  Dannreuther","coPersons":["Luke  March"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
