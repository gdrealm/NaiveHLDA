Recent findings show that very high concentrations of NO3 are present away from the Earth's surface. In polluted environments, the main sinks are abundant but this is also where its formation may be most rapid and hence the NO3 turnover time is very fast. The importance of this behaviour is not as yet clearly understood, yet it may have a very large impact on atmospheric chemistry and ozone formation, regional transport and transformation of oxidised nitrogen and hence acidification and eutrophication, and may also significantly add to the regional burden of ammonium nitrate particulate, which has increasing climatic importance. To understand and predict these phenomena correctly there is a need to quantify the basic chemical processes controlling NO3 and its removal from the atmosphere; the impact of NO3 chemistry on volatile organic carbon chemistry and as a pathway for radical formation and propagation; its heterogeneous chemistry and its impact on the aerosol burden and composition; its influence on ozone formation on regional and global scales and its mediation of the atmospheric lifecycle of oxidised nitrogen. A consortium project is proposed that addresses these coupled questions using a combined programme of instrument development, airborne measurement, detailed process modelling, and regional and global modelling. The principal deliverables will be: a) Enhancements to the instrumental capability of the FAAM aircraft to include measurements of NO3 and N2O5. b) Comprehensive measurements of night time radicals, their sources and sinks, and aerosol composition in the boundary layer and free troposphere in a range of conditions. d) Quantification of the key processes which control night-time chemical processes. e) Assessment of the impacts of night-time chemistry on regional scales. f) An assessment of the global impacts of night-time chemistry in the current and future atmospheres.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F005466/1","grantId":"NE/F005466/1","fundValue":"830732","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The key outcome of this research is an improved understanding of the role of atmospheric chemistry, and in this specific example night-time chemistry, in the ozone budget of the atmosphere. This information is used in numerical models which attempt to reproduce past atmospheric changes, as well as predict future changes associated with climate change as well as increasing urbanisation and the development of megacities.\nThese results are expected to improve air quality predictions and thereby future human exposure and health impacts.

The analysis points to the important role played by ammonium nitrate and particulate water content in controlling the heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 in NW Europe.\n\nDetection of an active nighttime chemistry, including the generation of HOx species and a range of nitrate species under different chemical conditions.\n\nThe results will improve understanding of the NOx budget of the troposphere in the UK European sector, and hence the global O3 budget.\n\nWider significance:\nRelated to this work, there have been a number of additional/anciliary activities\n\nFirstly there have been several papers outlining the now proven designs for instruments for measuring both radical species (NO3, N2O5 - the BBCEAS instrument) and an LIF instrument to measure a range of NOx containing species. These are important papers outline capability for future experiments, and have lead to the BBCEAS being deployed as part of the NERC/USA coordinated CAST campaign to measure IO in the low troposphere.\n\nThe BBCEAS instrument has also been used for a series of related laboratory studies, most recently on the role of Criegee intermediates in night-time chemistry.\n\nFinally, the work has provided the backdrop for general studies of the fundamental limitations of cavity enhanced techniques. Improved understanding of the tropospheric O3 budget and its likely future change is an important aspect of understanding the impacts of climate change and once incorporated into assessment reports is thus of interest to the wider non-academic community.\n Improved scientific understanding of the tropospheric O3 budget, understanding past changes as well as future climate related changes.\n\n\n\nThe BBCEAS instrument is now integrated into the NERC CAST project (Harris et al., 2014).\n\n\n\nSeveral papers have been published, and a series of others are in the final stages of preparation as part of a joint Atmospheric Measurement Technology/Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics special issue.
