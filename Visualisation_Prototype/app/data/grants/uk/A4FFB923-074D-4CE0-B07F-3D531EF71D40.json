{"id":"A4FFB923-074D-4CE0-B07F-3D531EF71D40","title":"Criminalization","abstractText":"It is often said that contemporary liberal democracies such as Britain and the USA face a crisis of over-criminalization: too much conduct is criminalized, too hastily, without adequate thought about the principles that should guide criminalization or the aims it should serve; the result is a disorganized, unprincipled criminal law, which subjects too many people to the threat of arrest and punishment. But normative theorists of criminal law, who have made major advances in systematic work on such issues as punishment and criminal responsibility, have made comparatively little systematic progress on this central problem of criminalization. This project will remedy that lack.\\n Our ultimate aim is to develop a normative theory of criminalization: an account of the principles and values that should guide legislators in deciding what should be criminalized, and of the principles and values that should guide the officials whose responsibility it is to enforce and administer the law; for criminalization is a matter not simply of legislation (the 'law in the books'), but also of enforcement (the 'law in the streets'). The central questions for legislators are: what counts as a good reason to criminalise something, and how should crimes be defined? The central questions about enforcement are: what kind of discretion should officials have in enforcing the law, and how should they exercise that discretion?\\n To achieve that ultimate aim, we will pursue several further inquiries. We will explain the distinctive character of criminal law as a particular type of regulation: starting with the idea that the criminal law aims to identify, define and condemn wrongs which are 'public' in that they properly concern all citizens, we will examine the distinctions between criminal law and other kinds of legal regulation. We will discuss the way in which the content of the criminal law should be structured: what principles should guide legislators in defining crimes; how should those definitions be structured; how should offences be classified? We will discuss the relationship between criminal law and the state: if we understand the state in terms of an ideal of liberal democracy that gives citizenship a central role, what kind of criminal law is appropriate for citizens of such a state? (This will also involve examining the relationship between domestic, transnational and international criminal law.) We will attend to the historical development of the criminal law: a normative theory of how our institutions and practices ought to be structured must be based on an understanding of their history.\\n Our research will result in the publication of a book (and articles) by each of the investigators, tackling different aspects of the overall project; the research assistant will also publish her/his research. We also aim to engage a wide range of theorists from different countries and disciplines in a systematic approach to the problem of criminalization. We will do this by holding six workshops and a major conference, as well as smaller meetings between the investigators and invited experts. The workshops and the conference will produce four volumes of papers, which together will provide an authoritative representation of current thinking, from a range of perspectives, on the complex problem of criminalization. They will also promote ongoing discussion between theorists from different disciplines, countries and legal traditions (and between theorists and policy makers): they will thus help to break down some of the barriers to fruitful criminal law research that disciplinary and jurisdictional boundaries can create. The project's benefits will thus consist not simply in the published work that it produces, but in the way in which it will promote such debates across traditional boundaries, and help to build an informal network of theorists who can bring their different perspectives to bear on the common problems of common law.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E007821/1","grantId":"AH/E007821/1","fundValue":"565548","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Antony  Duff","coPersons":["Victor  Tadros","Lindsay  Farmer","Massimo  Renzo"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":" Our ambition in starting this project was to work towards a normative theory of criminalization--a systematic account of the principles that ought to guide legislative decisions about what kinds of conduct should be criminalized. The project's outcomes will not include such a theory: partly because the investigators have developed different views on the issues involved and how they are best tackled; partly because it is not clear that we should be looking for such a systematic theory, as distinct from a more discursive, more complicated and nuanced discussion of the range of different, often conflicting aims and principles that bear on the various processes through which conduct comes to be defined and treated as criminal. The work produced so far (in particular the two volumes of papers from our first two sets of workshops) has begun on this task, which will be carried on in our further planned publications (see below).\n\nA related aim was to encourage a deeper and wider set of discussions about criminalization and its processes--discussions that need, if progress is to be made, to reach across traditional disciplinary and national boundaries. We achieved this through six workshops in the UK (a linked pair of workshops in each of our first three years); a major international conference in our fourth year (seven plenary papers, forty six submitted papers from around the world); thirty monthly meetings, to many of which we invited small interdisciplinary groups of researchers whose work we discussed; and further workshops that we co-organised in Kingston (Ontario), Helsinki, Oslo, Uppsala and Frankfurt.\n\nWe also contributed to capacity building. Our research assistant obtained a permanent post in the Law School at the University of York, and is moving to a promoted post in the Philosophy Department at the University of Warwick; one PhD students completed and passed his PhD, and has now been appointed to a permanent post in the Law School at the University of Edinburgh; the other PhD student has just submitted her dissertation.\n\nThe project cannot yet claim determinate impact on the world of policy and practice, but the discussions that we have initiated should feed gradually through into the policy world, and we have been active in responding to consultations by the English and Scottish Law Commissions, and on government bills; we have recently had fruitful discussions with civil servants in the Scottish government about the Offensive Behaviour at Football Bill. Two of the investigators also gave a seminar on criminalization at the Victoria Ministry of Justice in Australia.\n\nPublished outputs are listed elsewhere. Still to come are two further volumes of papers from the year 3 workshops and from the 2011 conference, and monographs from three of the investigators (Duff on The Realm of Criminal Law; Farmer on The Institution of Criminal Law; Tadros on Wrongs and Crimes), all to be published by Oxford University Press; and a number of further papers from the 2011 conference to appear in Criminal Law and Philosophy and the New Criminal Law Review. Our discussions of the processes of criminalization, of the values, aims and principles that should guide those processes, and of the role that the criminal law should be expected to play in a contemporary democracy, should be able to feed into policy discussions about the reform of the criminal law.
