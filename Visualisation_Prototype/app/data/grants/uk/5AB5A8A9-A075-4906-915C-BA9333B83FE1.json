It is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 100 children and is characterised by a range of behavioural excesses and deficits in the areas of social imagination, communication and social interaction. These behaviours often pose significant challenges to parents or caregivers and affect the development of positive and adaptive skills.\n\nA number of approaches exist that aim to reduce such socially challenging behaviours while increasing socially significant ones. The most notable evidence-based approach is Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA). Using the core principles of ABA, Behaviour Analysts (BAs) aim to increase/decrease behaviours through a process of understanding the events that occur before and after a behaviour. By understanding these events (the function), procedures can be implemented, which attempt to modify the behaviour. As a result, maintaing careful data collection are essential in order to identify the causes and effects surrounding behaviours. \n\nAs the emphasis is on early intervention, children are usually of a pre-school age when they commence home-based intervention programmes. During these programmes, parents typically carry out their own behavioural collection procedures due to the predominant lack of availability and high cost associated with BAs. Subsequently, a typical care model involves parents taking a pivotal role in their child's development by 'learning' to deliver autism intervention programmes supported by home-based therapists, under the direction of a BA.\n\nAlthough paper-based methods exist for supporting data collection, such records are commonly misreported. Reasons for this include the workload involved in implementing and coordinating ABA programmes that do not afford much time to record specific events as they happen and manual collection is cumbersome and impractical especially for those behaviours occurring outside of the home environment. Additionally, parents/therapists often find it difficult to accurately identify the triggers surrounding a behaviour. As a result, there is often missing/incomplete data, which in turn leads to delays in understanding the function of a behaviour.\n\nAs a consequence of the issues surrounding behavioural monitoring, a partnership has formed between the University of Ulster and PEAT, a Northern Ireland Autism charity dedicated towards supporting home-based autism intervention. Together, we believe that a Connected Health care model similar to that, which has been applied to support conditions such as dementia and chronic disease management can help to improve home-based autism intervention, particularly in the area of behavioural data collection and analysis. \n\nUsing a clinically-led and user-driven design methodology we aim to investigate and develop a suite of ICT services. Specifically, we will build upon developments in smart-phone technology to provide a touch-based interface for parents/therapist that supports fast data entry. An underlying decision support algorithm will guide Users through the recording process, thus permitting the flagging of specific behaviours. Furthermore, a clinical web-portal will be developed to allow BAs to remotely assess the progress of ABA programmes and to respond to queries and provide feedback to the smart-phone users. Surrounding these services will be a central data repository to store all of the information recorded and linked to this will be a set of data mining algorithms which will inform BAs about any underlying correlations between behaviours and their respective causes and effects. In this way, we aim to provide a knowledge-base that will reduce the time required to determine the function of a behaviour.\n\nAddressing this aim will allow the project to support improved compliance, accuracy and user satisfaction among all users and ultimately serve to promote improved autism intervention.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K014420/1","grantId":"EP/K014420/1","fundValue":"98680","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project targeted outcomes that would provide potential impact within short-term, medium-term and long-term timeframes. \n\nReviewing the short-term impacts, Behaviour Analysts (BAs), therapists and parents have benefited from the computerisation of existing paper-based data collection methods (ABC charts), used for maintaining a record of observable behaviours. Paper-based methods have been reported as being both error-prone and cumbersome, and often contribute directly to 'gaps' in the maintenance of complete data. The outcomes of this research have provided key stakeholders with a convenient method for recording and storing observable behaviours. Reflecting upon the achievements within the research, in terms of providing a fully operational connected health care model, the short-term outcomes have been successfully achieved. \n\nIn addition, the research effort has implemented data-mining algorithms that provide an additional layer of support to caregivers and Behaviour Analysts, which were not easily interpreted from paper-based records. Specifically, association rule modelling has been employed to determine the antecedent-consequence relationship for particular behaviours, based on the population of data stored in the repository. The results from this analysis are visually represented within the web-portal in a manner that clearly presents links in behavioural causes and effects.\n\nIf used responsibly by BAs, in the medium-term, visualisation of these patterns offer the potential to accelerate home-based intervention by assisting BAs to identify those antecedent-consequence relationships that appear / predict rises in challenging episodes of behaviour. The identification and management of behaviour is key to successfully helping children with autism to develop their skills and improve their quality of life. By providing a digital history of a child's progress through the provision of a data repository, the project outcomes offers the potential for improved examination of behaviour trends, which are supported through the provision of querying and graphing functionality, delivered via a clinical web portal. \n\nLonger-term, the outcomes from this project will continue to feed into ongoing projects (please refer to Further Funding section) as well as supporting the opportunity to integrate with existing products, such as SimpleSteps. Given that the demands for home-based autism intervention far exceed the number of qualified ABA professionals, the provision of key-training, tools to provide improved monitoring of behaviour, while promoting the provision for ongoing remote support, is necessary to increase the capacity of parent/therapists to understand the evolving function for their children's behaviour. \n\nBMAC advances the toolset available to the existing service provision by supporting caregiver's ability to maintain detailed recorded of behaviour. Consequently, BA's treatment review can be based on quantitative metrics that help to streamline the evolution of home-based intervention, thereby offering the potential for both societal and economic impacts. New findings from this research will be reported in subsequent submissions to the Research Council over the next five years.

Of central importance to supporting the ongoing assessment of a child is a systematic and rigorous approach to data collection. \n\nConsequently, this research aimed to introduce a low-cost, readily available assistive technology solution to improve upon existing paper-based data collection and analysis methods. Over a period of 16 months, the project adopted the notion of a Connected Health service (called BMAC) to support caregivers of children with autism and Behaviour Analysts (BAs) with the task of recording, storing, retrieving and interpreting behaviour data exhibited by their children.\n\nTo complement these core services, the project undertook an investigation into the potential benefits of employing data mining and decision support algorithms to facilitate the automated analysis of behaviour data. This research was undertaken with a view to identify and present correlations indicating relationships existing between particular behaviours and the associated causes and effects. \n\nThe research project involved the participatory design and development of four core software components: (1) a smart phone app for use by parents / teachers and extended family to provide an efficient modality for recording behaviour details; (2) a clinical web-based portal where BAs and caregivers can gain access to previously recorded behaviour and visualise the data from different perspectives (based on incident rate, duration or behaviour causes and reported outcomes etc.); (3) a central anonymised data repository containing behaviour references with clinically validated cause and effect factors that can be downloaded by any registered user; (4) the implementation of a set of data mining algorithms to support the analysis and identification of patterns emerging from recorded behaviours in terms of their correlated causes and effects. \n\nThe outcomes from this research have been realised through the delivery of a fully functional suite of technology prototypes. These prototypes have evolved over the course of two separate technology evaluations.\n\nIn the Phase 1 technology evaluations, six parents of children with autism were recruited to participate. Screening, consent and recruitment was supported by PEAT (Parents' Education as Autism Therapists); a Northern Ireland based autism charity that provided in-kind support to this research (please ref to collaborations and partnership section for more information). Each participant enrolled into the study was provided with a smart phone running the developed BMAC application. Initially, participants were invited to use a clinically validation paper-based method of data collection, routinely recommended for data collection at home, for a period and five days. Consequently, a second five-day period of data collection ensued involving use of the developed BMAC app. Following this 10-day evaluation period, participants were asked to complete post evaluation questionnaires, used to ascertain parent's perceptions on the usability and usefulness of the developed solution, and thereafter returned their devices to the researchers for off-line analysis of recorded data.\n\nFeedback from participants highlighted that BMAC offered the potential to improve the overall process of collecting and maintain accurate behaviour data. Nevertheless, the use of technology was reported to have some limitations, for example, an inability to detail 'specifics' about a behaviour i.e. additional information on the event. Based on the feedback from Phase 1 evaluations, the BMAC prototype was evolved and the web-based portal infrastructure was prototyped. The web-portal was required for servicing the backend provision of the connected health care model. \n\nPhase 2 evaluations recruited participants (five in total) to engage with the BMAC application over a longer period of time. One of the main goals in undertaking a longer evaluation was to generate a sufficient volume of data to evaluate the data-mining component (to determine if behaviour correlations could be automatically identified) of the developed system. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the data-mining and web portal components a short evaluation was also undertaken with BAs. BAs were invited to analyse 57 behaviour events, first using a paper based record and consequently, using the tools developed within the web portal. BAs reported that they were able to draw comparable conclusions from both approaches. Following this evaluation, the data-mining component was executed to produce a set predicted patterns emerging from the behavioural events. The BAs reviewed these results and reported that they would be sufficient to support them with the preparation of a behavioural intervention programme. The results from this work have been presented at the 12th International Conference On Smart home and health Telematics (ICOST), held in Denver, USA. Please refer to the Engagement Activities section for more information.\n\nOverall, qualitative feedback from the evaluations undertaken over the duration of the project was positive and now serves as a catalyst for driving the technology towards a commercially viable product. Nevertheless, the research undertaken has a number of limitations mainly in relation to the duration of the evaluations and the small numbers of participants involved. As such, it is not possible at present to determine if the developed BMAC technology offers real potential to accelerate autism intervention. \n\nThrough consolation of the experiences gleaned from this project, combined with outcomes from previous research projects that employed technology to support individuals with cognitive impairments and other chronic diseases, a technology roadmap has been drafted for publication. The roadmap provides a key set of recommendation for future development of assistive technology to support caregivers with delivering home-based autism intervention. Collaboration with the local Northern Ireland autism charity (PEAT) has resulted in funding being awarded (Big Lottery Fund, UK) in order to support the development of self-management application for young individuals with Asperger's. The strength and maturity of the collaboration is directly linked with this RCUK funded project (EP/K014420/1). As part of our commitments to Big Lottery Fund, we have committed towards delivering a personalised version of the connected health BMAC service, which is further tailored (from a usability and user experience perspective) to the needs of young people who are themselves able to record details of their behaviour episodes. This will be realised through a mobile life-logging service.\n\nThrough continued collaboration with PEAT, exploitation of the services provided by BMAC will be examined, leveraging PEAT's SimpleSteps product. SimpleSteps provides a series of materials to support parent / therapist education. Specifically, SimpleSteps (available as both online and offline versions) aims to teach parents about home based ABA intervention through step-by-step processes using information leaflets, instructional videos, case study reports and through the provision of downloadable resources. SimpleSteps is now available in seven different languages (German, Norwegian, Spanish, Portuguese, Icelandic, Swedish, and Dutch). It has always been envisaged that the outcomes from this project would be used to build upon this model and, in collaboration with PEAT, future activities will plan to leverage upon the success of SimpleSteps in order to market and generate awareness for the suite of ICT services that will be developed. To support this, the project team are exploring the possibility to acquire funding for a Proof of Principle project, supported by the University of Ulster's department for Research and Innovation.
