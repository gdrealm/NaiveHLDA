Although linguists have studied adjectival constructions and possessive constructions there has been very little research on the (very tricky) question of how adjectival and possessive constructions relate to each other. We will survey previous research on the ways nouns can be modified across languages and we will provide a preliminary conceptual analysis of the problem.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119393/1","grantId":"119393/1","fundValue":"43458","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  To further our theoretical research into the possessive-modification constructions and into attributive modification generally Other Cultural","person":"Andrew  Spencer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":" In English we can express the notion 'food belonging to a/the cat' in several ways: 'the/a cat's food', 'the food of the/a cat' or 'cat food'. In some languages it's possible or even necessary to turn 'cat' into an adjective to achieve this, along the lines of 'feline food'. We looked at a whole range of languages to see what strategies they use for expressing possession and how those strategies relate to other constructions, such as ordinary adjective+noun combinations ('good food'). We found that if a language can use, say, the adjective strategy for possession and also the &quot;apostrophe 's&quot; strategy then it can also use the compounding strategy (catfood). A number of other relationships between other types of possession construction were also uncovered. We have already been developing our ideas ourselves in a variety of conference presentations and drafts. We are currently writing a book which summarizes some of these findings. Two papers are available which bear directly on this grant, available from the PI's academia.edu site: 'The Possession-Modification Scale' and 'Possession and Modification' (both with I.
