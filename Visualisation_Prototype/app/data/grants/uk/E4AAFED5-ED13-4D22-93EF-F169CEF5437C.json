We are trying to understand how different parts of this protein machinery work together. \nOur work is focused on a conserved protein called Mcm10, which connects parts of the DNA replication machinery and is vital for the DNA copying process. We have recently solved the molecular structure of human Mcm10. The structure is a ring formed by six Mcm10 molecules. This gives us a very good idea of how this important protein may connect parts of the DNA copy machinery and DNA at the same time. The structure and a powerful multidisciplinary approach give us an excellent starting platform for molecular and cell biology studies of Mcm10. \nRecent advances show that proteins, which form DNA replication machinery, are attractive targets for the development of new treatments against human disease such as cancer. Understanding the Mcm10â€™s molecular blueprint and its role in DNA copying process will help in designing novel therapeutic agents, which will selectively target and eliminate cancer cells without damaging normal healthy cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700001","grantId":"G0700001","fundValue":"398803","fundStart":"2008-03-31","fundEnd":"2011-06-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrei  Okorokov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
