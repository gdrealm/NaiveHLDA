These emissions are carried towards the Pacific Ocean mixing with dust from the Asian deserts. The subsequent deposition of this material can impact on ocean productivity and the transport of ozone damaging chemicals southwards allows them to enter the equatorial region with rapid transfer to the stratosphere with attendant threats to stratospheric ozone. A recently developed Taiwanese sampling station offers an ideal location to study this Asian outflow as it starts its journey and hence to better understand its current and potential future impacts in the region and globally. This grant aims to develop links between a leading UK research group and colleagues in Taiwan in preparation for a major grant application for fields studies in this region.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N006836/1","grantId":"NE/N006836/1","fundValue":"37454","fundStart":"2016-01-22","fundEnd":"2017-07-21","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"David  Oram","coPersons":["William Thomas Sturges","Johannes Christian Laube","Alexander Roberts Baker","Timothy  Jickells"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
