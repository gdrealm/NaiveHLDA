Adequate physical models and simulation tools are necessary to address this issue.collaborative research involves four partners: 1) Pisa : Atomistic modelling of ballistic transport in gated structures with contacts. (2) Vienna: Effective mass approach to transport inclusive of scattering.(3) De Montfort University : Characterisation, parameter extraction and defect analysis of devices fabricated at Cambridge. The parameters will be fed into the modelling at Pisa and Vienna.(4) Cambridge University : Fabrication of devices.overall goal of the project is to carry out a comprehensive analysis linking theory with experiment to enable some fundamental design rules for fabrication of such technologies in future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D064465/2","grantId":"EP/D064465/2","fundValue":"411272","fundStart":"2007-10-28","fundEnd":"2010-10-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria Merlyne De Souza","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
