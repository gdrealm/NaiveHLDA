{"id":"905271EE-6099-4B50-9F7B-5622246D6D76","title":"Proposal for continuation of the Front End Test Stand","abstractText":"Protons, subatomic particles that are one of the building blocks of matter, can be given large amounts of energy by passing through a machine called a proton accelerator. Such high energy protons can be used in a wide variety of applications, from the production of radioisotopes for the treatment of disease, to the investigation of the structure of matter that benefits both industry and science. The first step in any proton accelerator complex is the so-called proton driver. The Front End Test Stand (FETS), being built at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the UK, is a project to create a new state-of-the-art proton driver that will be needed in order to provide proton accelerators with more intense, higher energy beams for future applications. \n\nThe FETS produces a beam of negatively-charged hydrogen ions that is chopped up into smaller bunches. This chopping is needed in order to make it safer and easier to accelerate the protons that are obtained by removing the electrons from the hydrogen ion beam. The FETS collaboration involves a dedicated team of scientists and engineers from the UK, and has stimulated collaborations with leading international accelerator institutes such as CERN, FNAL, ESS and CNS.\n\nIn this proposal, we seek to complete the construction of the FETS in a timely manner. The hydrogen ion source and initial beam focusing components have already been built and successfully commissioned. The remaining work is to install, test and commission the accelerating structures and chopper systems, and to evaluate the performace of the complete test stand. Upon successful completion of this project, the FETS can be used as a proton driver for further developments in proton accelerator systems for a wide range of applications in industry, medicine and science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J001902/1","grantId":"ST/J001902/1","fundValue":"84855","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The Front End Test Stand (FETS) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) is the UK's contribution to worldwide research into High Power Proton Accelerators (HPPAs). \n\nThe main impact is that the methods and results from this research will be used to improve the proton driver for the ISIS accelerator facility at RAL, delivering a more intense proton bream that will produce higher neutron and muon fluxes in order to advance the research output in many scientific disciplines. ISIS is the world's leading neutron spallation source, supporting an international community of more than 2000 scientists who use the facility to perform ground-breaking research in physics, chemistry, materials science, geology, engineering and biology.\n\nFurther uses of HPPAs will directly benefit the health and energy sectors. The technology from FETS will be needed for the development of future hadron therapy centres, as well as for future accelerated-driven sub-critical reactors (ADSRs), which use proton beams to safely control when nuclear reactions occur, in order to generate energy for the national grid or for transmuting radioactive materials into safer alternatives.

Specifically, this work has laid the foundations for demonstrating whether intense beams of protons, which are the building blocks of ordinary matter, can be chopped into smaller bunches on very short (nanosecond) timescales, which will be required for improving the performance of existing and future HPPAs.\n\nOriginally conceived simply as a chopper beam test, the FETS has since expanded its mission to become a generic test stand for technologies related to the front end of several proposed projects which require a high-power proton beam. This includes upgrades to neutron source facilities (such as ISIS at RAL) that are used to probe the properties of materials used in various physical and life science disciplines. In addition, precise and reliable beam delivery is required for future hadron therapy medical treatment centres, as well as for accelerator-driven sub-critical reactors, which generate energy via nuclear reactions that can be safely stopped when the proton beams are turned off.\n\nA secondary objective of FETS has been to encourage the study of accelerator technology by a new generation of accelerator engineers and physicists in UK universities. FETS has also resulted in a fruitful collaboration between RAL/ISIS and the ESS-Bilbao project in Spain. The exchange of ideas, experience and hardware has proven extremely beneficial to both sides. The work undertaken has also contributed to the UK's continuing international reputation as a centre of excellence, and has stimulated on-going collaborations with several leading international accelerator institutes: CERN, FNAL, and ESS. The techniques and methods used in FETS can be applied to improve the performance of other high power proton accelerators around the world, such as providing more intense protons beams for neutron spallation sources that are used to advance the research output in many scientific disciplines, or for creating precisely controlled proton beams that are required for hadron therapy medical treatment centres or accelerator-driven sub-critical reactors.
