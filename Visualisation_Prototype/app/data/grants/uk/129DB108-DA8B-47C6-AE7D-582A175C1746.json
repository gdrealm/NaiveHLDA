{"id":"129DB108-DA8B-47C6-AE7D-582A175C1746","title":"A Radar Satellite Early-Warning System for Tropical Deforestation","abstractText":"The market assessment research will review potential users of information services on deforestation, patterns of activity, the ways in which they buy and the motivations for purchase of forest monitoring data and analysis. It will provide an overall picture of demand whilst highlighting markets to prioritise and target (based on size, accessibility, demand). In addition, competitors and substitute products will be analysed. The information will be synthesised to create a picture of markets to target and required features of the product and service.\nThe work will inform our understanding of which segments of the market to target (countries, NGOs) it will also inform on the basics details of product &amp; service design and delivery. This will be of vital importance as we decide of the nature of the service, the extent to which the product needs to be refined and developed. At present it is envisaged that a stand-alone commercial entity will be created providing both data and consultancy services to global users of the data. The follow on funding will support the planning for the organisational model and structure for delivery, through the development of a hard evidence base to support decisions on investment and resources allocation. It will subsequently guide the development of a marketing plan.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M007839/1","grantId":"NE/M007839/1","fundValue":"8046","fundStart":"2014-12-12","fundEnd":"2015-06-11","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Heiko  Balzter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
