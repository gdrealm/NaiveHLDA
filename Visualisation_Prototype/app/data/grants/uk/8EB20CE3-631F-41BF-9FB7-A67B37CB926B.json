The greater the proportion of hypoxic cells in tumours the greater chance of resistance to therapy in the clinic and the bigger chance of the development of metastatic disease. The Stratford/Williams group are working towards understanding the mechanistic basis of these hypoxia-mediated processes. In achieving this they are identifying new molecular targets which can be used for drug therapy.\n\nTo achieve these objectives this group combines the expertise of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology with molecular, cell and tumour biology","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500366","grantId":"G0500366","fundValue":"1209870","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Stratford","coPersons":["Kaye  Williams","Rachel  Cowen"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
