The disease is caused by absence or malfunction of a protein called CFTR. CFTR is a channel protein: a specialized machine that allows movement of ions into and out of cells. It consists of several parts, or domains. One part, the transmembrane domain, is embedded in the cellsâ€™ membrane and forms a pore, a pathway through which the ions can flow. A molecule called ATP remotely controls access to the pore by binding to CFTR at its nucleotide-binding domains (or NBDs). What shape changes occur in the NBDs when ATP binds or when it is cleaved? How are these shape changes transmitted to the transmembrane domain, where the pore opens or closes? Answering these basic questions could suggest new ways of treating some cystic fibrosis patients. Many other proteins, related to CFTR, have NBDs. We will use the evolutionary record of this family, as well as sensitive recordings of tiny electrical signals generated by CFTR molecules, to probe the general mechanism by which NBDs drive the changes in shape of adjacent domains -- in CFTR itself and in other, harder to investigate, members of the same protein family.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501200","grantId":"G0501200","fundValue":"311433","fundStart":"2006-06-19","fundEnd":"2011-03-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paola  Vergani","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
