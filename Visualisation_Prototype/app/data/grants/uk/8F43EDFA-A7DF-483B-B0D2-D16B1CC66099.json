{"id":"8F43EDFA-A7DF-483B-B0D2-D16B1CC66099","title":"Extent and impact of distal ash fallout from the May 2008 eruption of Chaiten, Chile.","abstractText":"The current major explosive volcanic eruption in southern Chile presents an immediate opportunity for scientists to measure the impact of fine ash fallout during and after an eruption. We wish to use this opportunity to collect detailed measurements of the thickness and grainsize of ash which has fallen from Chaiten across a very large area of prime grazing land in southern Argentina. It is important that this work is carried out quickly - before the ash has been moved around on the ground by winds, and before the ash has been leached by rain water. Ash fallout is the major hazard from volcanic eruptions to humans, and their life-support systems (agriculture, transport, communications). Even only a thin deposit of ash can have a devastating effect on grazing animals, since they either refuse to eat ash-dusted grasses (and starve); or they consume the toxic salts deposited along with the ash (and die of fluorosis). At the moment, we so not have sufficiently sophisticated models of where fine ash ends up after eruptions - mainly because we do not have the measurements to test these models. Eruptions such as this, which are major explosive eruptions and which deposit fine ash across accessible land areas (rather than the sea), only happen about once in a decade or more. This is the first such opportunity since the major explosive eruptions of Pinatubo (Philippines) and Hudson (Chile) in 1991.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G001715/1","grantId":"NE/G001715/1","fundValue":"24149","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This funding allowed us to make a rapid response visit to map the extent of the ash fallout following a major explosive eruption in southern Chile. This dataset has been made widely available, following publication, and has helped to make this eruption a valuable case study of explosive volcanism. Our work has also helped to build relationships with researchers in Chile and Argentina.

This project was completed in 2009. Volcanic ash collected shortly after deposition are now being used in studies to help to improve satellite-remote-sensing techniques for the measurement of volcanic ash in the atmosphere. This will contribute to improved techniques for ash tracking and detection, which will be of interest to airlines and national agencies responsible for hazard assessments. This work has helped to sustain new collaborations with volcanic hazards specialists in the Chilean Geological Survey, and has contributed to new work on the impacts of ash from explosive volcanic eruptions in Latin America, Europe and elsewhere.
