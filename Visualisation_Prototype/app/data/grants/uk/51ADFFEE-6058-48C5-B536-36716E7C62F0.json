We believe that among the main issues that slow down the process of retail innovation, there is the difficulty of predicting how certain technologies will impact the consumers' experience and, as a consequence, how the related investments will affect revenues. Indeed, even though the unrelenting diffusion of Internet connectivity and smartphones adoption is undoubtedly transforming the consumer-retailer relationship by empowering consumers' rationality, both scientific research and retail practice provide extensive evidence as to the major role played by emotions, experience and engagement on consumer's preferences, choices and even technology adoption. The retail brand, its target audience, as well as the physical and virtual contexts where both shopping and its experience take place, all have critical influence on the impact that a certain innovation strategy might have on the consumers' perceptions and, finally, sales. \n\nRetail is context-specific and retail innovation should be informed by an in-depth contextualized knowledge of consumers. At the same time, big data and consumer analytics represent an important potential for retailers but without theories to explain the observed patterns of relationships and to inform related queries, this potential will remain unexploited. Mobile technologies provide the novel opportunity to gather and merge big data on socio-demographics, shopping behaviors, spatial movements, individual differences and even real-time data on emotions and experience. Consumer research usually conducted on small sample sizes, in laboratory settings, and with self-report questionnaires collected far from both the time and the context of consumption is likely to be transformed by the mobile and big data revolution. \n\nThis research project will provide a first contribution for the integration of different types and sources of consumer data while testing the impact of mobile technology on the consumer experience, and it has the ultimate goal of establishing a new code of practice of 'research and development' for retail innovation. Our work will extend on previous literature on various levels: (1) it will improve the understanding of experience by examining the relative impact of individual differences, socio-demographics, motivation, emotions; (2) it will show the role of experience and its predictors on technology acceptance and satisfaction; (3) it will show the impact of technologies on the consumer experience and provide indications for a consumer-centered-contextualized approach to technology design and implementation; 4) It will advance consumer behaviour models by adding spatial movements data.\n\nWe will develop a longitudinal system for the real time gathering and integration of consumer data within the retail space. The system will be based on the management of a 'mobile and location-based' panel of consumers that will be both an innovative source of primary data and at the same time a future test bed for the experimentation of novel concepts and technologies for consumer experience strategies, location based communication, mobile-based consumer research. The project will involve the development of mobile apps and the recruiting of panel participants based on state of the art statistical representation of the client base of Sainsbury's. A first study will be carried out for the test of a mobile application and the integration of 'attitudes and behaviours' with 'real-time consumers' experience and feelings' with 'spatial movements' with 'personality and individual differences' and 'socio-demographics'. This first study will provide the basis for further methodological and technological developments with the aim of advancing consumer analytic applications based on context-specific strategies of the retail partner.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L005174/1","grantId":"ES/L005174/1","fundValue":"157446","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nadia  Olivero","coPersons":["Hannah  Fry"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
