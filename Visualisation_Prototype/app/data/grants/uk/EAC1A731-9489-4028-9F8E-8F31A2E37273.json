The Centre runs both introductory and advanced courses in psychometrics, ranging from short practitioner courses such as the BPS Certificates of Competence in Testing to its postgraduate programme and postdoctoral ‘training the trainers’ seminars.</p>\n\n<p>Psychometrics is currently undergoing very rapid advancement at a time when expertise is in increasingly short supply. Skilled psychometricians are sought globally by test publishing companies, examinations boards and, increasingly, by applied research programmes.</p>\n\n<p>This ESRC Research Development Initiative will develop and deliver workshops, a web presence and a summer school programme that will enable statisticians, psychologists and other quantitative social scientists to develop their skills within a shared framework that encompasses both classical and modern psychometrics. Software based training will present illustrations from our applied research programmes, showing how a variety of models can be estimated. Developments in statistical theory, estimation methods (computer intensive and traditional) mean that many more software procedures are now available to users.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-035-25-0066","grantId":"RES-035-25-0066","fundValue":"80364","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Rust","coPersons":["Timothy James Croudace","Susan Esther Golombok"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
