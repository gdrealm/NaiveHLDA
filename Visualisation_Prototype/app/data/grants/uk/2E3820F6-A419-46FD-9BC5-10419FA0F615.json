At their most extreme these difficulties involve high levels of criminal offending and violence. For over 200 hundred years efforts have been made to diagnose these individuals as though they suffer from a mental disorder with various labels being used such as 'moral insanity', 'psychopathy' and 'Antisocial Personality Disorder'.</p>\n\n<p>The series is driven by the belief that there is considerable benefit to be gained by encouraging cross disciplinary perspectives.There is a danger that currently prevailing practices and policies are too focused on individual psychopathology. Whilst there is no doubt benefit in understanding the psychology of such individuals, for example, there is a danger of too little attention being paid to the social and cultural contexts that produce and sustain these problems. </p>\n\n<p>This seminar series will bring together perspectives from a range of academic disciplines along with professionals representing different aspects of the health and welfare services, and with service users who had direct experience of living with these difficulties.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000911/1","grantId":"ES/L000911/1","fundValue":"27549","fundStart":"2014-01-13","fundEnd":"2017-07-11","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David W Jones","coPersons":["Christopher  Scanlon","David  Gadd"],"organisation":"University of East London","findingsText":" It is very early in the life of this grant. We have held one very successful day in collaboration with the 'Centre for History of Emotions' that brought together academics, clinicians and service user groups. This involved an international call for papers and invitations to particular speakers. This first event in the series was devoted to historical perspectives. We had speakers from the USA, Netherlands, Finland and Denmark. \n\nWe are now putting together the 2nd seminar on philosophical perspectives which will again involve international participants. We are succeeding in our aims to provoke discussion and build the capacity for further work in this area. Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
