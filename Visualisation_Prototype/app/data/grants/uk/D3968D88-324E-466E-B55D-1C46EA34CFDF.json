{"id":"D3968D88-324E-466E-B55D-1C46EA34CFDF","title":"The GARNet Transcriptomics and Bioinformatics service III","abstractText":"This grant application requests a continuation and enhancement of previous work extending back for many years where NASC has acted as a public data warehouse and service for the model plant - Arabidopsis. For several years, the UK Arabidopsis community has had access to a variety of technological and informatic (database and computational) services that were provided for it by NASC under the umbrella of a multi-site consortium called GARNet. These included very large numbers (thousands) of GeneChip results that had recorded information on what all of the 22,000+ genes in a plant were doing at various times and under defined conditions. This GeneChip data from NASCarrays has been disseminated to the plant user community through an open website with no restrictions for use or location. The GARNet service also made it possible to maintain, develop and renovate the much older NASC database and user catalogue relating to seed and DNA stock data and distribution of seed stocks. In addition the programme has allowed NASC to co-operate with all of the appropriate and relevant international bodies in order to build better, more useful and more open services. As part of this, NASC has adopted the common languages (also known as ontologies and controlled vocabularies) that have been internationally defined to make interchange between widely distributed databases possible and precise. NASC is spplying for support to continue this integrated information services under the guidance of the democratically elected Arabidopsis community advisory body / GARNet. NASC also wishes to extend the service to include stronger and more user-friendly analysis tools for all users of GeneChip data on arabidopsis regardless of their location or local facilities. This last approach is in response to specific needs identified by users from the plant community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E01772X/1","grantId":"BB/E01772X/1","fundValue":"791919","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sean Tobias May","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
