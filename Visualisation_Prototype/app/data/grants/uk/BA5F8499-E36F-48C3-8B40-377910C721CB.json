This work will look at their chemistry under realistic environmental conditions and how this relates to aggregation and sedimentation, which are key processes in environmental transport. Their chemical behaviour is also key to understanding their ecotoxicological effects","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E014496/1","grantId":"NE/E014496/1","fundValue":"48327","fundStart":"2007-08-20","fundEnd":"2008-04-19","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Jamie  Lead","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
