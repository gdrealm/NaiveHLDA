In addition detailed interviews&nbsp; of&nbsp; IP management practices in UK firms based on similar surveys conducted in the US will enable a deeper understanding of the organisational issues and practices regarding IP valorisation in&nbsp; UK firms. We expect that this understanding and analysis of the survey data will be a valuable input in training programmes to raise awareness about patent use in small and medium firms and can also inform policy on intellectual property in the UK and the UKâ€™s position on patent use legislation at the EU-level.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000756/1","grantId":"ES/K000756/1","fundValue":"68073","fundStart":"2012-09-27","fundEnd":"2013-09-26","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The question used by us in the SIPU survey to assess patent propensity have been adopted in the latest Community Innovation Survey questionnaire which has been finalized last week. Based on our analysis we also suggested that a question assessing the regularity of R&amp;amp;amp;amp;D activity be included in the CIS questionnaire which too has been accepted. In order to probe the role of MNE and other group companies and also to understand the characteristics of a firm's most valuable innovation, the IPO expects to commission a telephone interview based almost entirely on Section B &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; C of our developed questionnaire.

Based on analysis of the Survey of Innovation and Patent Use (SIPU), led by Brunel \nUniversity, commissioned by the Intellectual Property Office (IPO), and implemented by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), we show that whilst only 3% of all firms \ntake advantage of patenting, when looking at those firms which innovate this number rises to 40%. The research shows that the size of the organization does not influence the likelihood of patenting; rather the strongest factor that determines whether a business is likely to patent is the ability to create novel innovations and volume of R&amp;amp;D undertaken. \nAnother key finding of the research is that firms are relying more often on technology licensing (underpinned by patents) to keep up with the market especially when innovation is limited by constraints on resources. Between 2009-2012 the study estimated that expenditure on technology in-licensing was around ?6.9 billion a year in the UK. This equates to almost 40% of the total business enterprise spending on \nR&amp;amp;D, and over 3% of gross investment in the UK. Industries where innovation rates \nare low were most likely to use technology licensing in a bid to keep up with the market. In contrast, industries with high rates of innovation were less likely to use licensing possibly due to the desire to maintain exclusivity and avoid having to share a technology with competitors. We also studied open innovation practices and their relationship to patent propensity distinguishing between the different sources of knowledge. We found that collaboration with competitors and value chain partners (clients and suppliers) were less likely to be patented but collaboration with Universities was more likely to result in a higher share of patented innovations. Our analysis has important implications for patent policies. First, it points to the need to distinguish between patenting and the proportion of innovations patented. Large firms have more patents because they have more innovations but truly innovative small firms can also benefit from patenting. With our partner the UK IPO we have made this point to the Statistics department of the BIS who have accordingly amended the wording of questions in the CIS 2015. Second, our more recent analysis points to the link between the type of knowledge and patent propensity. More basic knowledge such as that available in collaboration from Universities is more likely to be patented. This finding needs to be assessed using project-specific data. This is something Innovate UK could take on board when they develop metrics to measure the impact of their project funding. Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
