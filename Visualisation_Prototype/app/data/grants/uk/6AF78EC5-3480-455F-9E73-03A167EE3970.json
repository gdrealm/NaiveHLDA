Since there are literally millions of different invading proteins, B cells have evolved a way of making millions of different antibodies. One each of three different kinds of gene segments V, D and J are cut and pasted together to make an immunoglobulin (antibody) protein, using two specialized enzymes called Recombinase Activating Gene 1 and 2 (Rag 1 and 2). There are several D and J and 200 V genes, thus many different combinations can be made and this process, called V(D)J recombination, ensures that the immune system produces a sufficient diversity of antibodies to fight infection. However this process can go wrong. Defects in the Rag enzymes cause immunodeficiency and in some cases the reason is unclear. Conversely, the Rag enzymes can cut and paste the immunoglobulin genes to an incorrect DNA sequence on another chromosome, causing a chromosomal translocation, the principal cause of lymphomas. Further, DNA byproducts called excision circles can be reinserted into the genome in aberrant locations, also causing lymphomas. It is unknown how the V, D and J genes find each other in the nucleus, or how the Rag enzymes find them. Understanding this is key to understanding normal antibody production and the mistakes that can be made. We propose that the genes find each other because they go to a specialized site within the nucleus called a transcription factory to transcribe, and that the Rag enzymes recognize and bind structures found there. We have developed novel assays to visualize the Rag enzymes and DNA excision circles in the nuclei of single cells for the first time, in combination with the genes they are cutting and pasting. We hope to discover which genes other than immunoglobulin genes are targeted by the Rag enzymes as this will provide insight into how chromosomal translocations occur. We will track where the excision circle byproducts go in the nucleus, and use large-scale genome sequencing to discover where these byproducts have reintegrated in the genome, to identify ?hotspots? of reintegration. This research will help us to understand how B cells make antibodies and may also identify molecules or processes that are involved in human diseases including immunodeficiency and lymphomas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901034","grantId":"G0901034","fundValue":"476993","fundStart":"2010-08-02","fundEnd":"2013-11-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Corcoran","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Babraham Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
