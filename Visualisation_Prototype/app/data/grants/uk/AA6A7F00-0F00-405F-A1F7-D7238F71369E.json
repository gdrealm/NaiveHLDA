The approach pursused here is for improved cooperative monitoring of nuclear reactors, as required by the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. The IAEA have endorsed research into this anti-neutrino detection technology, which is currently ongoing in Europe and the USA.\n\n The main objective is to build a proof-of-concept, detector for remote continuous monitoring and plutonium accounting of reactor cores using the neutrino flux based upon T2K ECal technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J002909/1","grantId":"ST/J002909/1","fundValue":"87875","fundStart":"2012-07-08","fundEnd":"2014-01-07","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathon P Coleman","coPersons":["Christos  Touramanis"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
