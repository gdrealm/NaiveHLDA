Part of the project comprises an extensive critical biographical study, as no substantial account of his life is presently available. The main thrust of the project, however is analytical and concerned with Skalkottas's twelve-note compositional process. Overall, the study attempts to establish, for the first time, a coherent and authoritative approach to Nikos Skalkottas and his musical language, which will allow him to be properly contextualised within the western art music canon.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112753/1","grantId":"112753/1","fundValue":"6306","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Eva  Mantzourani","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Canterbury Christ Church University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
