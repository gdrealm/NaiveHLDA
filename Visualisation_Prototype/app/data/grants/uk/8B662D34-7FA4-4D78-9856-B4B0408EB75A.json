{"id":"8B662D34-7FA4-4D78-9856-B4B0408EB75A","title":"Investigating the fabrication and dipole characteristics of complex ferroelectric nanoshapes","abstractText":"The traditional view of the ordering of polarisation or magnetisation in both ferroelectrics and ferromagnets is that local dipoles or magnetic moments are arranged into neat rows and columns, and that boundaries between neatly arranged groups must strictly conform to the crystallography of the host material (conventional stripe domains). However, recent experimental research in three-dimensionally size-constrained soft ferromagnets has revealed the existence of completely different domain states which form into vortices. As with many aspects of behaviour in ferromagnetism, analogous properties in the behaviour of the electrical polarisation in ferroelectrics is often seen, and recent modelling strongly suggests that such vortex domain states should also exist in ferroelectrics. Differences in the energetics between ferromagnets and ferroelectrics means that such unusual behaviour is only expected to dominate whenever ferroelectric dimensions are reduced to the order of ~10 nm. The creation of such small structures and the characterisation of their domain states represents a serious challenge to experimentalists involved in ferroelectric research and yet the potential for new discovery is immense. Further, simple vortex structures may only be the tip of the ice-berg, as much more exotic domain patterns have been postulated: for example some theorists have suggested the possibility of an electrostatic solenoid-analogue. Given the research performed to date, and the postulations made by theorists, the creation of three-dimensionally constrained nanostructures in ferroelectrics, and the subsequent analysis of their domain characteristics, clearly represents an exciting and challenging problem. This project will address this area of research by combining expertise in nanoscale ferroelectric fabrication with specialist characterisation techniques such as electron holography, second-harmonic near field optics, nano-Raman spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy. The programme builds on an already established successful collaboration between ferroelectric activities in Queen's University Belfast and Cambridge, and this is augmented by international experts in specifically chosen characterisation techniques.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F004869/1","grantId":"EP/F004869/1","fundValue":"537459","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  To date, the findings from this blue-skies research programme have only been used within academia to my knowledge.

These insights were published in detail in Nano Letters (for PZT nanodots in 2011) and in APL (for BTO nanodots in 2011);\n(ii) when nanodots or nanobars of ferroelectric are cooled through the Curie Temperature in vacuum under the electron beam in the TEM, then flux closure patterns do NOT form; instead, highly ordered domain patterns which appear to have some kind of radially symmetric polarisation occur (published in PRL in 2013 and in Nano Lett in 2009), although the centre of the radial pattern shifts as morphology is altered in a way that can be understood as a shape-induced phase transition in the domain patterns (published in PRB in 2011);\n(iii) complex flux-closure and quadrupole dipole chains can spontaneously appear during cooling in nanoshapes or near the edges of single crystal lamellae in both BTO and in PZN-PT. These fascinating structures were mapped using both TEM and PFM and findings published in Nano Letters (2010 and 2013). The possibility of using ferroelectrics in both memory applications and in complex nanoelectronic devices makes the understanding of the way that domains behave at the nanoscale absolutely critical. The discoveries made in this grant represent some of the clearest nanoscale domain behaviour information ever obtained.
