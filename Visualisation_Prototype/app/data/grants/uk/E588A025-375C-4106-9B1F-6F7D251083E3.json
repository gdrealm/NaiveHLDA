The popularity of the subject is related to its potential impact as a major determinant in lexical processes. Evidence of the AoA effect on lexical and non-lexical tasks is abundant (Juhasz, 2005). However, the difficulty of taking the AoA variable apart from its interconnected factors (eg, concrete, familiar and frequent words tend to be learned earlier in life) is the main source of criticism towards the AoA effect.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this project is to explore the possibility of simulating the AoA effect on monolingual speakers by teaching them foreign language vocabulary at different times in the course of a series of training sessions. If this is achieved, simulations will offer an effective way to investigate the AoA effect allowing the experimental manipulation of AoA while controlling co-occurring factors. Each experiment will consist of two phases. A learning phase and a test phase where the influence of the manipulated variables will be assessed by measuring reaction times and accuracy to name or recognize pictures or words in the foreign language.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E02016X/1","grantId":"ES/E02016X/1","fundValue":"72517","fundStart":"2007-03-26","fundEnd":"2008-09-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Cristina  Izura","coPersons":["Andy  Ellis"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
