To further understanding of disorders such as schizophrenia and depression we need to be able to watch the human brain at work. There are techniques which can image function in the living brain such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). However, these techniques are based on the metabolic changes that accompany brain activity rather than measuring brain activity itself. These metabolic demands are satisfied by increased blood flow to active areas of the brain in much the same way as increased muscular activity involves increased blood flow to the muscles. Changes in the proportions of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood produce changes in the magnetic resonance BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signal which is then used to identify active brain regions. The interpretation of experiments conducted with this technique are hindered by a lack of understanding of the relationships between brain activity, blood oxygenation and the magnetic resonance signal. Although progress has been made in understanding these relationships there are many aspects that remain unresolved. How the relationship between brain activity and imaging signals changes during different ?brain states? such as those produced by attention or arousal is poorly understood. This is the purpose of the proposed research. The results of the proposed experiments will be used to inform the design and analysis of fMRI studies in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501127","grantId":"G0501127","fundValue":"197257","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Myles  Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
