It asks: what new hardships and vulnerabilities have been created by changes to housing welfare? The research focuses upon a specific policy that solely impacts on the lives of single people: the changed age threshold regarding eligibility for Local Housing Allowance (LHA). This is a form of housing benefit (HB) for people who are living in the private rental sector and who cannot afford their rental payments. From 2012 onwards single people (without dependents) aged between 25 and 34 were only entitled to a Shared Accommodation Rate (SAR) of LHA - whereas previously they could claim for a 1-bedroom property. This meant that single people under 35 could only claim enough support to cover the cost of a single room in a shared property. The change to LHA has become one of the most severe cuts in HB, resulting in making certain areas of the country entirely unaffordable. In some areas, these changes mark a extremely significant reduction in the amount of support to which a person is entitled- e.g. in central London the SAR is &pound;126 per week, whereas the 1 bedroom rate is &pound;255 (Valuation Office Agency, 2013), marking an over 50% reduction in benefit. Increasing the SAR rate to the age of 35 is seen to have increased demand for an already limited pool of available shared properties (Rugg et al, 2011). \n\nWhile existing research (Beatty et al 2012; Rugg et al, 2011) has provided important insights into the impact these changes to LHA have had on claimants, my research will be the first to look at these changes specifically through the lens of equalities legislation. In the Equality Impact Assessment (DWP, 2011: 14), the government noted the need for further quantitative and qualitative research to assess the unintended adverse impact that these changes may have had on protected groups. Accordingly, the aim of the research is to assess what iact these changes to LHA have had on groups who are protected under the 2010 Equality Act (women, ethnic minorities, LGBT people and disabled people). This research asks: what housing options do these people now have, and at what risk? Have these changes to LHA led to a lack of safe and secure housing options for protected groups? Above all the research is concerned with people's lived experiences of these changes to LHA - and the research sets out to explore what impact this change in policy has had on their everyday lives.\n\nThe first stage of the research involves a quantitative survey of 500 people who have been affected by these changes. The survey will provide a large-scale dataset that will enable identification of the effects of these changes on protected groups. The second stage of the research involves in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 50 people. The interviews will ask participants to talk about their housing biographies, and to discuss what impact these changes in housing benefit have had upon their everyday lives. The interviews will discuss people's experiences of trying to find affordable housing, in particular looking at the availability and appropriateness of shared housing for protected groups. Ultimately, this research will produce important new quantitative and qualitative data about people's experiences of these changes to LHA. The project will integrate and illuminate key debates, adding new empirical material and new theoretical insights. The rich empirical data will then be used to feed into existing policy debates, and the research is designed to have direct policy impact. The findings will be important to a number of non-academic groups, such as housing charities, equalities groups, public sector workers, and policy makers concerned with the disproportionate effect of welfare reform on protected groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L010569/1","grantId":"ES/L010569/1","fundValue":"236226","fundStart":"2015-01-26","fundEnd":"2018-01-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Eleanor  Wilkinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
