During this period Professor Korshunov would give a short course on Stationary distribution approximations for Markov chains motivated by applications to systems modelling and to risk at Heriot-Watt University, and would hold an intensive exchange of ideas with the proposed Investigators and their colleagues as an initial phase of proposed collaboration. He would also visit other UK Institutions to give seminar talks and to hold further scientific discussions with colleagues at those places.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G036810/1","grantId":"EP/G036810/1","fundValue":"16168","fundStart":"2009-01-28","fundEnd":"2009-04-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A better understanding among mathematicians and statisticians of the properties of heavy-tailed probability distributions, and of their impact in the modelling of extreme events in nature and the man-made world.
