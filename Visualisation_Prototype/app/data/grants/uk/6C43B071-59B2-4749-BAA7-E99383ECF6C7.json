In addition to fully characterising and optimising these crystals for UV/visible and near/mid-IR wavelength ranges, I also wish to evaluate their applicability towards the realization of compact laser sources for these wavelength ranges. The overall objective of this work is to produce diode-laser-driven, compact UV/visible (370-600nm) and near/mid-IR (1.3 - 35 um) sources having 10's mW output power and broadband tuning over 1000 nm at room temperature.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E005381/1","grantId":"EP/E005381/1","fundValue":"367627","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Edik U Rafailov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
