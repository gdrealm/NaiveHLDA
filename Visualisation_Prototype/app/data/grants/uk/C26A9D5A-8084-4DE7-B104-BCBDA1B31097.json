The blood circulates through vessels that are lined by specialised cells called endothelial cells. These cells have a key role in maintaining the health of blood vessels. Endothelial cell function is affected in many different diseases such as diabetes, thrombosis, inflammation, atherosclerosis and cancer. Here, we propose to study the mechanisms that control endothelial cell-cell adhesion, proliferation and migration known to be dysfunctional or aberrantly activated during such pathological conditions. To understand how these different endothelial cell functions are regulated is fundamental to develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent or inhibit such conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900098","grantId":"G0900098","fundValue":"422579","fundStart":"2010-02-22","fundEnd":"2013-02-21","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria Susana Balda","coPersons":["Karl  Matter"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
