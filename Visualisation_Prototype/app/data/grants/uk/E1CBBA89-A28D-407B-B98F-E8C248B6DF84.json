The sound structure of words can undergo dramatic changes when they are produced in different utterance contexts. For example, the sentence &quot;do you like her&quot;, could be articulated as a single phonological word eg, &quot;je-lie-ker&quot;; a prosodic unit with one main stress. </p>\n\n<p>These structural changes are systematic and are governed by strict, language dependent phonological rules. The aim of the present research is interdisciplinary in nature: it is an experimental investigation of the role of prosodic structures suggested by linguistic theory in the restructuring of lexical representations during speech production.</p>\n\n<p>Recent research has suggested that phonological word structure has implications for both the planning of speech output and the articulatory nature of the speech produced (Wheeldon and Lahiri, 1997, 2002). The experiments are designed to relate the planning of speech output to the timing of the articulatory processes. Two reaction time experiments will investigate the production of simple sentences (eg &quot;I like to swim&quot;). The effect of the prosodic structure of the sentences on their speech onset latency and the acoustic properties of the speech output will be determined.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G030987/1","grantId":"ES/G030987/1","fundValue":"80102","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Linda  Wheeldon","coPersons":["Aditi  Lahiri"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
