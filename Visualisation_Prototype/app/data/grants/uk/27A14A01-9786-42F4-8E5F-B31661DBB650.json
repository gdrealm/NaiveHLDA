People will be forced to respond to it in ways that either mitigate loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services or that ex-acerbate losses. An unprecedented extinction of species is underway, and climate change is af-fecting species' range and phenology, leading to new species configurations that affect ecosystem services in unpredictable ways. With climate change and continued habitat alteration entailed in human population growth, 'novel' ecosystems will become even more prevalent. In the UN Interna-tional Year of Biodiversity, scientists and policy makers must recognise that humans, biodiversity, and ecosystems must co-evolve and co-adapt. However, Human Adaptation to Biodiversity Change is not considered as theme in any international, regional, or national science or policy for-ums. There is a dearth of scientific research about HABC, so scientists and policy makers lack mandates, conceptual frameworks, knowledge, and tools to project or predict human responses and their actual or potential outcomes, synergies, and feedbacks. Indeed, 'A significant new re-search effort is required to encourage decision makers to consider biodiversity, climate change and human livelihoods together' (Royal Society 2007). At the same time, there is a call for a 'para-digm shift' in adaptation thinking away from top-down planning and toward supporting local adapta-tion. Local adaptation efforts go unnoticed, uncoordinated, and unaided by outsiders and, unless policy makers become aware of the importance and extent of autonomous adaptation processes and understand what influences their outcomes, adaptation and mitigation policies may be ineffec-tive or counter-productive. This project's aim is to kickstart the development of appropriate conceptual frameworks, methods and integrated models for understanding human adaptation to change in biodiversity and related ecosystem services that can eventually be used to predict outcomes for biodiversity, eco-system services and human well-being in highly biodiversity dependent societies, and provide evi-dence for the utility of these outputs to a new network of researchers and policy makers. The build-ing blocks for development of concepts, methods, tools and models are a) local information or knowledge systems and monitoring capacity, b) local valuation of biodiversity and related ecosys-tem services; c) integrating biological resources and ecosystem services into an understanding of livelihood processes, d) assessing perceptions, risks, needs, and ability to respond, and e) under-standing biological and welfare outcomes and feedbacks. The project joins partners from anthro-pology, economics and ecology/biology at Oxford, Kent and SOAS, with partners from South Africa and India. Partners will jointly elaborate the conceptual framework in a first intensive workshop us-ing a scenario building protocol. Then, teams incrementally develop and evaluate research proto-cols and methods and collect primary data in a field research site in the Western Ghats, and re-sults are initially modeled. A second workshop revises the scenarios and prepares a second field data collection phase. This iteration permits further grounding of the conceptual framework and methods, and development and testing of a stronger, less aggregative model based on much bet-ter decisions about how different variables interact. After the second field research phase, scenar-ios are revised and integrated analysis and modelling of the data is done, and variables, variable sets, or system state indicators that are useful for monitoring biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being with biodiversity/ecosystem change are identified. A science-policy network is kickstarted (see impact plan).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I004149/1","grantId":"NE/I004149/1","fundValue":"129087","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Patricia  Howard","coPersons":["Michael Denley Fischer","Rajindra Kumar Puri"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
