However, some symptoms like loss of balance, resulting in falls, and gait dysfunction are amongst the most debilitating and also the most refractory symptoms to current treatment. Presently PD surgery involves electrical stimulation, called deep brain stimulation (DBS), of two deep seated structures within the brain. These are the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Therefore, recent research has focussed on alternative areas in the brain as potential interventional sites for improving mobility and stability in PD sufferers. \n\n\nOne of these structures is the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), a small nuclear structure in the brainstem, located about a centimetre deeper than the STN. Over the last few years, we have demonstrated in experimental animal models of PD that stimulation of the PPN leads to significant improvement in both postural control and gait. This approach has been rapidly developed in the clinical environment, so that small groups of patients in specialist functional neurosurgical centres in Rome, Bristol and Brisbane have received PPN stimulation, with encouraging results. However, these pioneering studies involve small numbers of patients and do not have the benefit of detailed quantitative analysis and documentation of the principal symptoms being addressed, namely postural control and gait dysfunction. The aim of our study is to perform a prospective, controlled, double-blinded systematic analysis of the relative and combined effects of STN and PPN DBS on the mobility, stability and quality of life of people with PD. We hope that this study will help establish a rational approach for selecting the appropriate DBS target for individual patients with PD.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701698","grantId":"G0701698","fundValue":"376824","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dipankar  Nandi","coPersons":["Michael Andrew Gresty","Sean  O Riordan","Adolfo M Bronstein","Peter G Bain","Xuguang  Liu"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
