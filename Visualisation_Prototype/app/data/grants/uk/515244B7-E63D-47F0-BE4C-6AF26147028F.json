One type of Salmonella called Salmonella Enteritidis has the ability to infect the eggs of chickens that are infected with Salmonella bacteria. If infected eggs are eaten raw or poorly cooked, there is a chance that the person may become ill. In most cases this results in diarrheoa and a short term illness but in young children, the elderly or people with immune systems that do not work well, Salmonella infection can be very serious. In some case it may result in death. In recent years vaccination has been used as part of the control of Salmonella in chickens. However just before hens begin laying eggs (point-of-lay), their immune system becomes suppressed or less effective. This may mean that even vaccinated chickens are more likely to catch a Salmonella infection at this point. This research will find out which parts of the immune system do not work well at the point-of lay. We will then test Salmonella vaccines and measure how well they stimulate the immune system at point-of-lay and whether these vaccinated birds are more likely to get Salmonella at this time.The research will allow us to improve how and when we vaccinate chickens against Salmonella so they are protected when they start to lay eggs. It will also help us make better vaccines that protect chickens better and for longer than current vaccines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D007542/1","grantId":"BB/D007542/1","fundValue":"199158","fundStart":"2006-07-03","fundEnd":"2010-04-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Maintenance/enhancement of high biosecurity through point-of-lay in egg production\n\nDevelopment of the laying hen as an infection model for invasive salmonellosis Agriculture, Food and Drink,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Economic","person":"Paul  Wigley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" Through this work we found:\n1. Immunosuppression in laying hens is due to a drop in CD4 lymphocytes\n2. There is an organised lymphocytic structure in the reproductive tract that changes over development\n3. Birds show increased susceptibility to salmonellosis due to immunosuppression\n4. Vaccine protection is significantly reduced due to immunosuppression\n5. Adjuvants that drive cellular responses increase protection to salmonellosis 1. Understanding the nature of immunosuppression means that control strategies in egg production can be developed that take this into account either through biosecurity and/or modification of vaccination strategies\n2.
