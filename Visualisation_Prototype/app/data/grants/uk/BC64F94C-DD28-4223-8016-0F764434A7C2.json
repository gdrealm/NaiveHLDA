Thus microRNAs directly affect cell function, and potentially offer a new target for therapeutic intervention. MicroRNAs have recently been shown to be necessary for normal cartilage development in the mouse; however, their role in human cartilage is completely unexplored. From recent microarray experiments we have identified a specific microRNA in healthy human chondrocytes which regulates expression of the most important cartilage matrix protein, collagen type II. Thus this potentially represents a new mechanism regulating cartilage matrix expression. The proposed project will explore this in detail, and thus has the potential to identify novel therapeutic intervention points for cartilage repair.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G006555/2","grantId":"BB/G006555/2","fundValue":"122313","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Luke Murphy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
