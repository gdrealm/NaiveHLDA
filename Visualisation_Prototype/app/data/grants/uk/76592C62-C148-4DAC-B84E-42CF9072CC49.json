One of the major problems in modern theoretical physics is the extrapolation of physical laws to new length or energy scales. We wish to push our understanding to ever more extreme situations such the collisions of heavy nuclei, the centres of neutron stars, or the very early universe. Our research will develop our theoretical tools and extrapolate the theories of the strong interactions (QCD) and gravity to regimes of high density, of high temperature, and high energy. Particle astrophysics and cosmology Perhaps the most active area of research in the past decade has been at the interface between particle physics and cosmology. In order to understand the history of the universe we must understand physical laws in the first moments of the Big Bang, when temperatures and particle energies were huge. Conversely, by detailed observations of the universe today we can trace back the conditions and make deductions about physical laws at high energies. Our research will tackle three of the three questions about the universe: why is there more matter than antimatter; is there any evidence out there for strings or string theory; and why is the expansion of the universe accelerating. The Terascale and Beyond The Terascale is the frontier of particle physics, where we collide elementary particles with velocities so close to that of light that their effective mass grows by a factor of a billion. At this frontier there are new discoveries to be made, new theories of physics to test. One of the recurring themes in particle physics is the proposition that the universe has more than three space dimensions: there may be more hidden from us either because they are curled up so small we don't notice them, or because we are trapped on a three-dimensional 'surface' in a higher dimensional space. We will work out how to test these these theories at the latest and biggest particle physics laboratory - the Large Hadron Collider, which will start running this year.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G000573/1","grantId":"ST/G000573/1","fundValue":"267046","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Hindmarsh","coPersons":["Martin Kurt Kunz","Daniel  Litim","Stephan Johann Huber"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
