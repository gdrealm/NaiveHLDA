It was founded on the hypothesis that the interrelated histories of clothes and labour were central to group identity formation within emerging structures of industrial capitalism. Institutional and operational changes in the clothing industry (e.g. accelerated modes of production, Taylorism, Fordism) facilitated mass-production of less individualised and cheaper clothing that could be distributed to growing numbers of consumers through department stores, co-operative societies and mail order companies. The increased uniformity of these ready-to-wear clothes helped to establish and shape communal identities for professionals (e.g. textile workers, soldiers, medical practitioners, shop girls, clerks). For those within these groups, this uniformity of dress could assist in strengthening group identities and thus facilitate attempts to gain political representation (e.g. trade unions, suffragettes, young wage earners and new workers). At the same time, clothes and other sartorial markers assisted in indicating and establishing hierarchies within professional communities. In the context of the increased professionalisation of British society after 1880, clothes obtained a wide range of complex cultural meanings in relation to group identity politics. Network activities address the still under-researched question of how clothes contributed to shaping professional communities in the time before the British war effort curtailed consumption in an unprecedented manner in 1939 (e.g. rationing, fair share). In doing this, our research aims to challenge academic debates focusing exclusively on the role of clothing as commodities or as markers of individual identity. We anticipate that the network's interdisciplinary approach, the planned collaboration with the listed cultural heritage institutions as well as our aim to engage the public in current academic debates will generate radically new ways of studying the history of professionalisation, the socio-psychological underpinnings of identity politics as well as the semiotics of material culture. \n\nThe rationale of the proposed research is built directly into the network's structure. Necessary to the project is the exchange of knowledge across different subjects in the humanities (literary criticism, social and economic history as well as fashion and design history). Themed academic workshops (Dress: Art and Industry; Working with Textiles; Uniforms and Identity; Women, Clothes and the New Workforce) and public outreach events systematically work towards the organisation of a conference on Clothes, Working Lives and Social Change (1880-1939). Moreover, the network's focus on material artefacts (especially textiles and fabrics) requires collaboration with our two partner institutions (Bishopsgate Institute and People's History Museum) that hold extensive archives and collections related to working lives connected to the British textile industry. The location of both partner organisations is of strategic importance to the success of the network. The Bishopsgate Institute is situated in a community with strong historical ties to the East London garment industry. The People's History Museum in Manchester reflects the history of the Manchester cotton and textile industry. It also houses the Labour History Archive containing unique collections from the labour movement (including trade unions and the co-operative movement) as well as one of Britain's only Textile Conservation Studios - repositories pivotal to the proposed research. The concluding network conference benefits from collaboration with the John Lewis Partnership, a retail business operating as a worker co-operative. Its rich Cummersdale Design and Textile Collection will be the base for future research projects aiming to strengthen links among academic scholars, the cultural sector and the wider public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013064/1","grantId":"AH/J013064/1","fundValue":"27953","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  To date, we have had confirmation that our network website has been used by other academics as a model of good practice for the inclusion of digital sources in teaching and learning.

Network events (academic workshops, public lectures and school study days) have investigated the complexity of different aspects of this historical debate, consistently asking how the study of an earlier period is relevant for contemporary understandings of identity construction. The network website includes recorded lectures from network events as well as a digital museum of images and other sources relevant for this project.
