For example, expression of genes whose products are needed at early stages of the development of embryos but not in adult cells will be switched on and off only at the right time. There are many mechanisms involved in regulating the switching on or off of gene expression and we have recently uncovered a new set of players in these processes-the variant U1 snRNPs. These novel complexes contain the nucleic acid, RNA together with proteins and there are indications that mis-regulation of the components of these complexes is associated with some neurodegenerative disease, including Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and some cancers, including Wilms' Tumour. Using the latest experimental techniques, we aim to fully characterise the composition of these complexes and identify which genes they regulate. This is a critical step towards understanding the exact roles these complexes play in human cells and how mis-regulation of the RNA or proteins could cause disease. The long-term goal of our studies is to develop therapies to combat the diseases associated with mis-regulation of these complexes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M010716/1","grantId":"MR/M010716/1","fundValue":"450888","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Shona  Murphy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
