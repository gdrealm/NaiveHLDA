The incorporation of sustainability into an urban regeneration program, such as Birmingham Eastside, appears best conceptualised as a complex decision-making process carried out by stakeholders who are embedded within the development process. The barriers to and enablers of sustainability (as identified in Phase I of this project) appear at various moments or locations within this complex. The timing and context of decisions are critical (examined in Phase II), and can cause path-dependency which then limits how sustainability features in final development plans. In Phases I &amp; II, the research set in place a framework of cross-disciplinary knowledge and key partnerships; highlighted the importance of coherent integration of the three pillars of sustainability to enable the complexity of achieving urban sustainability to be sufficiently grappled with; gained access to key decision-making forums in Eastside; built strong links with key stakeholders in the area; and firmly integrated into the policy agenda for Eastside. In addition, researchers are working to establish a cross-cutting baseline dataset of developments in Eastside rigorously to measure change over time and the impact of particular decisions on the sustainability of the overall urban regeneration programme. In so doing the foundations for a zonal urban regeneration case study site are being established, augmented by the creation of a study facility, with library and hot desking, now available for researchers from SUE / IEP consortia, to study the application of research to practice. The emerging findings of Phase II have allowed researchers to develop a series of hypotheses about the timing of decisions for sustainability in a range of decision-making forums, and the extent to which path-dependency becomes problematic. In Phase III, a suite of innovative analytical tools will be employed to elucidate further the complexities and interactions of the key elements of the sustainability vision for Eastside. First, a Development Timeline Framework (DTF), a multi-disciplinary tool that makes explicit the path dependency of decisions toward achieving sustainability goals, and the conflicts and synergies between different sustainability objectives, will be used as the basis for further research. Second, a cross-cutting Sustainability Checklist (SC) applied to the DTF will allow each researcher to analyse the impact of timing and context of decisions for each sustainability element (e.g. biodiversity, public participation, space utilisation, local sourcing, and recycling). Third, an Industrial Ecology (IE) analysis will follow particular resources (e.g. water, aggregates) thus highlighting their interdependence, while a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) approach will enable assessment of the socio-cultural aspects of sustainability (not covered by the IE approach). This suite of tools underpins the delivery of the work package aims. This analysis will be undertaken on a case history site basis, using development sites within Eastside that are all currently 'live,' each site representing a different conceptualisation of sustainability. This provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the specific impact of early thinking about sustainability in the planning and design stages, and the impact of this timing and path-dependency on sustainability performance in the final built form.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E021603/1","grantId":"EP/E021603/1","fundValue":"512891","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher David Foss  Rogers","coPersons":["Ian  Jefferson","Austin  Barber","Mark Robert Gaterell","John R.

What is ‘sustainable’ is determined locally: local conditions set local priorities.\n\n\n\n2. The past and the present must be incorporated to achieve more sustainable regeneration.\n\n\n\n3. Early involvement in the development process is central to advancing the sustainability agenda.\n\n\n\n4. Individual design decision influence the ability to meet very different sustainability objectives.\n\n\n\n5. Sequencing activities correctly in the development process keeps sustainability– related options open.\n\n\n\nFour themed work packages have explored some more specific questions:\n\n\n\n1. Lack of information and guidance within the decision-making process was highlighted as a significant barrier to achieving sustainable utility infrastructure.\n\n\n\n2. There is a key ‘window of opportunity’ for ecological mitigation at the site scale. Mitigations must be specified early during the design stage. Seeking the inclusion of ecological design features after outline proposals have been prepared may be more difficult and/or expensive. \n\n\n\n3. Policy makers need to develop an early understanding of an area’s social and economic fabric, including the use of well designed public participation initiatives, if the regeneration process is to be sustainable in the widest sense. \n\n\n\n4. Timing and sequencing of design decisions are critical to realise specific sustainable solutions and determine the resultant spatial form.
