{"id":"DF93E689-CE3C-4D06-A245-61454D7C6654","title":"Luxembourg Income Study","abstractText":"This application seeks continued financial support from the ESRC for LIS (formerly the Luxembourg Income Study), a cross-national data archive and research institute. LIS is a data infrastructure of income and wealth data whose primary purpose is to enable cross-national, interdisciplinary primary research into socio-economic outcomes and their determinants. Whilst LIS is physically located in Luxembourg, users of the LIS microdata come from 70 countries including the UK. \n\nThe work of acquiring, harmonising and documenting diverse datasets from multiple countries is labour intensive, requiring 10 or more full-time staff. In order to avoid having to charge individual user fees, LIS is seeking financial support to be able to continue providing researchers with access to high-quality data. This application seeks support from ESRC to help cover LIS' basic operating costs, which primarily consists of staff salaries and computer equipment.\n\nLIS, the institution, houses two databases - the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) and the Luxembourg Wealth Study (LWS). LIS datasets include income, employment, and demographic variables at the person- and household-level. Since its founding, LIS datasets have been used by 4,300 researchers from around the world to analyse economic and social policies and their effects on outcomes including poverty, income inequality, employment status, wage patterns, gender inequality, family formation - and when combined with other datasets - child-wellbeing, health status, immigration, political behavior and public opinion. The newer LWS datasets enable research on wealth portfolios, asset levels, and the interplay between household income and wealth. \n\nThe microdata contained in LIS and LWS are not accessible directly for reasons of confidentiality, and cannot be removed from the LIS office in Luxembourg. Therefore, only registered users may query the microdata via email to the remote-execution system, LISSY, a system-specific job submission interface. The users send programs and receive statistical summaries as the end product of their request. \n\nLIS is a unique resource, whose primary function is to facilitate research by providing controlled public access to household data. LIS is the only data archive in existence that includes income, wealth and labour market data, over time and in one place from such diverse geographic regions and at such varied income levels. LIS also provides a high level of user support and hands-on assistance to LIS and LWS researchers - through its online learning materials, user-support staff, and training workshops. LIS has also long operated as a venue for researchers and practitioners to exchange research ideas, results, and methods. These exchanges take place through the widely accessed Working Paper Series, the Visiting Scholar program, pre- and postdoctoral postings, annual workshops, conferences, and virtual venues. \n\nThe participating countries are high-income and middle-income countries. LIS will continue to grow to include many more middle-income countries' datasets, enabling greater comparative opportunities in income, demographic, and labour market research. Additionally, LWS will continue to develop and grow, adding more countries and years, and thus facilitating new and expanded lines of research related to wealth.\n \nThe UK was one of the initial participants in both LIS and LWS. Individuals and organisations in the UK have been actively engaged with LIS for three decades, providing data, contributing financing and serving as board members. Since LIS' inception, researchers in the UK have queried the microdata; produced publications, government reports and working papers using the LIS data; attended summer workshops; participated in the Visiting Scholar program; contributed to research conferences and conference volumes; and provided invaluable intellectual guidance and direction regarding LIS' activities and products (names available upon request).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L016273/1","grantId":"ES/L016273/1","fundValue":"236026","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2020-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank Alan Cowell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
