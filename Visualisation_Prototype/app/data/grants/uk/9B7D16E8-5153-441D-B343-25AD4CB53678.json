{"id":"9B7D16E8-5153-441D-B343-25AD4CB53678","title":"Making Law in rural Kenya","abstractText":"<p>This project aims to contribute to political anthropology and policy through ethnographic research into community policing initiatives in rural Kenya. Problems of governance have become a focus of attention in Africa. At the local level, the lack of capacity and/or the systemic corruption of the official agents of law enforcement, the police and judiciary, have spawned a mass of vigilante-type movements. This proposal focuses on one such movement in Kenya known as sungusungu. Research will concentrate on the modus operandi of this movement and its complex relationship to the state. A major part of the project will be to make a film/DVD as an instrument of the research involving the active participation of one such group in Kuria District. This film will complement the academic writing and be widely available as a research resource and for engaging with policy makers. Collaboration between the anthropologist and a documentary film-maker will also involve an element of mutual training and aims to make a contribution to visual anthropology through ethnographic film.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2973","grantId":"RES-000-22-2973","fundValue":"71016","fundStart":"2008-09-12","fundEnd":"2011-12-12","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Suzette  Heald","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
