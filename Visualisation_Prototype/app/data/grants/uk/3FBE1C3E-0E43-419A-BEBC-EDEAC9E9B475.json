{"id":"3FBE1C3E-0E43-419A-BEBC-EDEAC9E9B475","title":"Glycoenzymes for Bioindustries","abstractText":"There are a wealth of glycoenzymes in nature but only a small number of enzymatic activities are used in industrial processes, primarily carbohydrate degrading enzymes used in high volume manufacturing such as amylases/xylanases/cellulases/oxidases used in baking/detergents/biofuels. Even fewer examples exist in high value manufacturing applications such as biologics: one example is the production of the therapeutic Cerezyme where alpha-neauramindase is used to deglycosylate exposing terminal Man residues improving its targeting. A major hurdle is the availability of appropriate enzymes which can limit utilisation in the early stage of process development thus reducing the number of successful processes involving glycoenzymes. The present project aims to overcome the current limitations of glycoenzyme availability by bringing together a number of innovative high-throughput approaches to biocatalyst discovery. We have assembled a list of 20 different glycoenzyme activities including various glycosyltransferases, polysaccharide-modifying enzymes, glycosidases and sugar oxidases that will form the basis of the research. Through iterative rounds of biocatalyst discovery, characterisation and development we aim to bring to market panels of different glycoenzyme classes that are readily available for screening by end users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M029034/1","grantId":"BB/M029034/1","fundValue":"1243310","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2020-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sabine  Flitsch","coPersons":["Nicholas John Turner"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
