These drugs have important side effects and we currently don?t have means to know how much treatment each patient needs.\n\nWe have recently defined a series of tests that may allow us to identify which kidney transplant recipients do not reject their grafts when taken off immunosuppression. These are very preliminary results. We need to perform several studies to confirm them. \n\nThus, we are proposing to repeat the study in new groups of patients. If validated our tests could be used to safely minimise or remove immunosuppression in those kidney transplant recipients that don?t need it.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801537","grantId":"G0801537","fundValue":"1134840","fundStart":"2009-07-15","fundEnd":"2013-02-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Lechler","coPersons":["Vicki  Seyfert-Margolis","Graham Michael Lord","Laurence  Turka","Maria Puerto  Hernandez-Fuentes"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
