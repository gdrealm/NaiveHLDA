We predict that the baby’s genes do this by causing alterations in how well their mothers respond to insulin and glucose and in her blood pressure. We plan to test this directly in two mouse models (as it is not possible to do this in humans): (1) where pups are born small due to the removal of the placental insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene, (2) where pups are born large due to the removal of the H19 gene which usually reduces IGF2’s activity. We plan to accurately measure how well insulin is working in the body, how the body responds to a glucose load and the blood pressure in pregnant mice carrying offspring with these genetic changes and then compare these to measurements from normal controls. These experiments should provide important information about potential causes of gestational diabetes and high blood pressure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500733","grantId":"G0500733","fundValue":"170386","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Brian Dunger","coPersons":["Wolf  Reik","Mark Lewis  Evans","Ken  Ong","Miguel  Constancia"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
