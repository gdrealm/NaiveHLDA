BRAHMS (http://herbaria.plants.ox.ac.uk/bol/) is a flexible database management system for botanical researchers and herbaria. Developed at Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, it provides wide-ranging and innovative functionality to gather, edit, analyse and publish botanical data, optimizing its use for the widest possible range of curation services and research outputs.\n\nAs a result of this project, we have developed a new framework to underpin the future development of the database. This migrates the entire system from Microsoft Visual FoxPro (no longer supported by Microsoft) to a highly flexible, modular system using the .NET framework. The new system is constructed with 9 infrastructure projects dealing with data management, core services and user interface. Collectively, these constitute the core system.\nA majority of coding thus far is in C# although different languages may be used; data storage is flexible but defaults to PostgreSQL; the system can be installed and scaled for personal use through to full Enterprise systems. The infrastructure is in place to support globalization, for example by using language resource files. \n\nData in all existing BRAHMS systems are transferable to the new system The new system, when completed, will replace all existing BRAHMS installations in approximately 60 countries. Existing modules can be customized and the entire system can be extended by user institutions who can plug-in their own modules.\n\nTo expedite the development of BRAHMS and to increase the sustainability of the project, development is being contributed to by a number of institutions who may join a formal ‘consortium’. The source code is held in a sub-versioned repository and will be made available to developers.\n\nThe BRAHMS system, developed over the last 25 years, will be upgraded and modularized in stages, building mostly on the functionality of the existing system. Work is now underway to migrate all existing tools and functionality to the new framework. Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
