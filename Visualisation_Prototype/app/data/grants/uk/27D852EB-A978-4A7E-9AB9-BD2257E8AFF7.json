This proposal is therefore concerned with the generalisation of a mathematical approach known as the full Lagrangian approach (also known as the Osiptsov-Lagrangian method) to enable it to model vortex ring-like structures in two-phase mixtures. The main focus of the project will be on the development of this approach to enable its use in the modelling of three-dimensional processes within a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) framework. The project will also investigate the possibility of constructing new mathematical models of vortex ring-like structures, to take into account additional complications relevant to certain engineering applications such as the effect of an elliptical core. \n\nThis new approach to the modelling of multiphase flows will incorporate the jet and droplet break-up models developed through a currently active EPSRC project EP/F069855/1. Where appropriate, predictions resulting from the new models will be compared with predictions based on three dimensional numerical simulations of transient vortex ring-like structures, based on the conventional research CFD code KIVA 3 and commercial CFD code FLUENT. \n\nA feasibility study will also be performed into the modelling of these vortex ring-like structures based on the combination of the full Lagrangian approach for the dispersed phase and the vortex method for the carrier phase to examine the advantages and limitations of the different mathematical approaches. \n\nFinally, predictions from numerical and analytical models will be validated against in-house experimental results obtained in gasoline engine-like conditions allowing an assessment to be made into the applicability of using the models for the characterisation of processes in gasoline engines.\n\nThis will be a collaborative project involving external consultants Professor A. Osiptsov (Lomonosov Moscow State University, Russia) and Dr. F. Kaplanski (Tallinn Technical University, Estonia), whose expertise is mainly focused on the development of the full Lagrangian method for multiphase flows and semi-analytical vortex ring models. It will be led by Professor S. Sazhin, whose expertise includes the development of new physical models of fuel droplet and spray processes as applied to modelling internal-combustion engines. The co-investigators Dr. S. Begg and Professor M. Heikal will advise on the relevance of the models to automotive applications and provide the experimental data required for the validation of the models. A Research Fellow will be included in the project. This project will ensure a qualitatively new level of physical and mathematical models, developed in the previously funded EPSRC project EP/E047912/1, supporting the collaboration between the PI, co-investigators and Dr F. Kaplanski, and the currently active project EP/F069855/1.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K005758/1","grantId":"EP/K005758/1","fundValue":"346506","fundStart":"2013-05-20","fundEnd":"2016-09-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project started about 1.5 years ago, and we can talk only about the preliminary impact. In a nutshell, the project is focused on tackling a problem of producing homogeneous distribution of droplets in direct injection gasoline engines. The modelling of this distribution using conventional methods is a very time consuming task. The predictions of the models developed so far have not been very reliable. It is anticipated that the new approach to be developed as a result of this project will produce a reliable and CPU efficient model. The preliminary results are encouraging, but it is too early to talk about specific results. The project is based on close collaboration between a mathematicians and experimentalists.

A new theoretical model for a confined axisymmetric vortex ring is developed. The predictions of this model were shown to be in agreement with available experimental data and numerical simulations. Using the power-law assumption for the time variation of the viscous length of the vortex ring, the time variations of the main integral characteristics, circulation, kinetic energy and translational velocity, were obtained. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) were used to test the range of applicability of the model and to investigate new physical features of confined vortex rings recently reported in the experimental study by Stewart et al. (2012). The model was shown to lead to a very good approximation of the spatial distribution of the Stokes stream function, predicted by DNS. A meshless method for modelling of 2D transient, non-isothermal, two-phase flows with phase transitions, based on a combination of the viscous-vortex and thermal-blob methods for the carrier phase with the Lagrangian approach for the dispersed phase, was developed. The one-way coupled, two-fluid approach, when the effects of droplets on the carrier gas are ignored, was used in the analysis. Since the analytical model for deformed vortex rings was verified based on DNS data, this model can be directly applied to the analysis of the results of measurements in direct injection gasoline engine (the paper is submitted to J Fluid Mechanics). A combined viscous-vortex, thermal-blob and Lagrangian method for non-isothermal, two-phase flow modelling could also be used for the analysis realistic flows including the ones in internal combustion engines.
