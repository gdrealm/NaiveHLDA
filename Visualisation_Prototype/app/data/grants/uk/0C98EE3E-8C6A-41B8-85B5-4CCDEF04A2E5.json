It does so in order to understand the possibilities at such times for embedding robust, long-term responses to relevant social problems. The research focuses on the major floods which hit the UK during the winter of 2013/14, taking the Somerset Levels and Moors as a case study for examining governance processes and their outcomes in the aftermath of crises. The prolonged nature of these recent floods within Somerset has brought high levels of political, media and wider public attention. There is evidence of conflicting positions and viewpoints on the causes of the floods and the most socially, environmentally and economically appropriate response measures across various stakeholders and flood affected publics. The research will examine this dynamic and evolving context of solution and problem framing in order to build understanding of the immediate aftermath of floods as a key period in which policy change happens and particular solutions emerge. The primary objective will be to show how this initial period of response impacts on the kinds of policy solutions that are put forward and subsequently delivered over the longer term. Our research will be guided by these specific research questions: \n\n1) Do the periods following major national crises offer potential for initiating change in policy and response approaches to floods? \n \n2) What framings are identifiable across the wide range of actors affected by and involved with the 2013/14 floods and how are they linked to specific solutions and outcomes? \n\n3) Which framings dominate or become marginalised over time and with what implications for longer-term responses? \n\n4) How are longer-term issues such as land use, agricultural policy, climate change adaptation and sustainability, incorporated and addressed? \n\nThe project will use innovative qualitative and quantitative methods to look in-depth at the perspectives and experiences of those that have been directly affected by flooding and those in positions of responsibility for responding and managing floods. Using repeat interviews and a locally representative survey instrument, as well as visual methodologies (i.e. photo-elicitation), the project will generate a rich data set that will be used to interrogate the important questions about governance in periods after crises that the research addresses. The lessons learned from this case study will inform the processes of policy-making as they unfold and contribute to the development of robust, long-term responses to floods that are attuned to the values, perspectives and world views of the different social actors affected.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M006867/1","grantId":"ES/M006867/1","fundValue":"160607","fundStart":"2014-06-10","fundEnd":"2015-06-09","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Christina Butler","coPersons":["Saffron  O'Neill","Neil  Adger","Louisa  Evans"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
