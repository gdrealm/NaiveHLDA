{"id":"93C3F5BC-1D9D-4081-B2F5-6BDB380BC65C","title":"Support for Enhancement of Soft Magnetic Materials Conference SMM18","abstractText":"The Soft Magnetic Materials Conference (SMM18) is the 18th conference in the biennial series of international meetings devoted to production, characterisation and applications of soft magnetic materials with particular emphasis on industrial applications in areas as diverse as energy, sensors and medical equipment and therapy. It will be held at Cardiff University in September 2007. One aim of the conference is to bring together engineers and scientists from universities, research institutions and industry who are active in research, development and industrial applications of these materials. The proposed EPSRC grant will enable the organisers to enhance the value of the meeting by bringing in extra prestigious international guest speakers, to introduce speakers to give up to date accounts of related research activity in China, to encourage participation of research students and to set up a special panel session to discuss present and future challenges in research on bulk soft magnetic materials. As in previous SMM conferences, the programme will comprise invited lectures, experts, oral presentations and poster sessions for regular contributions.The grant would be used to enhance the conference as described above in ways which have not normally been possible in previous SMM conferences. It is also hoped that these added features of SMM 18 will ensure that the conference will demonstrate a showcase of UK interest and prominence in the area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E061222/1","grantId":"EP/E061222/1","fundValue":"10183","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony John Moses","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
