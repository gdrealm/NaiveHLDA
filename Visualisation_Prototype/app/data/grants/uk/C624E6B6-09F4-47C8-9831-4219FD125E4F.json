A creature's genetic sequence is a long string of symbols. But how can we discuss common ancestors if, instead of knowing strings of symbols about each creature, we only have information about their shapes? Though this is a particularly difficult situation, it is very common. Many objects in the world around us evolve and change their shape but do not have a genetic sequence. For example, the shapes of consumer items, from toothbrushes to cars, are under continual shape evolution but no-one supposes they have genomes. The challenge of making inferences about the past evolution of shapes, and of making guesses about which shapes have recent ancestors in common, is well established. The standard approach to this challenge is to extract sets of numbers that describe the shapes of interest and to use these summary sets to make guesses about the past. This proposal takes a different approach. We aim to develop mathematical techniques that use the shapes themselves, rather than summaries of them, to make inferences about the past. This approach has some advantages: it uses more of the information that we have; it allows us to characterize the process that yields shape evolution; and it allows us to make guesses about the shapes of unseen ancestors (rather than guesses about a restricted set of their features).This proposal aims to advance the study of shape evolution by considering the evolution of mathematical functions. A functional phylogeny is akin to a genetic evolutionary tree where it is a mathematical function, rather than a genetic sequence, that changes through time. We will test our theory by: using computer generated data; performing `Spatial Chinese Whispers' experiments; and investigating how the pronunciation of words has evolved in Romance languages. Our `Spatial Chinese Whispers' experiments will involve the task of drawing curves, one after the other, so that small errors in copying yield a slow drift in curve shape. Our investigation of speech sound evolution first converts the sounds of modern speakers into shapes and then exploits the fact that we are confident about the evolutionary tree of Romance languages. Just as information about current genetic sequences allow us to make guesses about the sequences of past organisms, this approach might allow us to test hypotheses about the sounds of languages we can no longer hear.This work has relevance to those interested in designing shapes for the future, as well as those interested in past shapes. By understanding past shape evolution one can use this to generate reasonable shape transformations which might help in product design. This work aims to take sets of shapes and to make guesses about which is most related to which: this can be very useful in areas which have nothing to do with shape evolution. The ability to detect unusual or familiar shapes has relevance to numerous public and commercial challenges from spotting unusual vehicles to guessing the shapes of letters.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H046917/1","grantId":"EP/H046917/1","fundValue":"27493","fundStart":"2010-07-21","fundEnd":"2011-07-20","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A description of the impact of our work.\n\nThis work was attempting to develop a new direction of academic inquiry: how to reason probabilistically about our past shapes and functions. Given that it was a one year project we were successful in communicating our work to a large audience: we were able to publish our work in the most read journal in evolutionary studies (as well as developing the relevant technical details in another paper) and we organised two meetings at which world leaders in the study of the evolution of shapes and sounds were exposed to our work. We have also presented our work at a number of oher conferences and meetings and have been able to attract other talented researchers to join our team. Some feel for the local impact of the work can be seen in that the work was connected to at least four projects at masters and PhD level.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned elsewhere, our project opens up new avenues for design and new computational methods for automatic identification of plants and animals. Norman Macleod (Natural History Museum) who joined our team is very interested in how our evolutionary approach can be used to improve taxonomic identification. John Coleman (Oxford Phonetics) joined our team and is very excited in our work because of the possibility of allowing philology to have an aspect of speech and to offer the prospect of reconstructing past speech sounds. Colin Cotter (Imperial Phonetics) joined our team and is very interested in how our work might allow probabilistic extensions of the deterministic approaches currently used in shape morphing. This has implications for biomedical image analysis (registration and tracking shape change).\n\nBeneficiaries: Natural History Museum\n\nContribution Method: The statistics of shapes and functions is a growth area: in our papers we defined and developed a new vista of problems. We think that our work puts the UK at the front of world efforts in the statistical study of object oriented data.

This is typically done by using genetic sequences (strings of symbols) we wanted to extend this to the situation where each creature is described by a mathematical function. \n\nWe approached this challenge by using an area of mathematics called Gaussian processes. We produced a technical paper explaining how they can be used and applying them to preliminary data. At the same time we organised two meetings which were designed to identify expertise in functional approaches to evolved data. We thus expanded our team to include experts from Computational Geometry, Phonetics, Linguistics and Animal Morphometrics. All of us then wrote a paper &quot;Phylogenetic inference for function-valued traits: speech sound evolution&quot; in the most widely read journal in Evolutionary studies. In this we argued that we have the right set of tools to be able to not only construct candidate evolutionary trees connecting speech sounds in different languages but also to put probability distributions over possible ancestral sounds.\n\nWe also considered 1) simple situations in which we could morph one sound into another 2) a unified view that reveals equivalences between a Gaussian process view and the idea that evolution mixes source functions. Our work was presented at a number of conferences, generated associated publications, and inspired several school engagement projects including a video. At its conclusion we had a clear framework in which to develop our ideas about speech sound, and shape, evolution and the team with which to make this progress. As noted above this work has relevance for applied taxonomy (identifying pests, weeds, rare species...) and for design. This was a scoping grant so the major way that this work will progress will be by finding follow-on funding. This will allow us to go beyond the proof of principle work that we have undertaken for functions and to extend our explorations to shapes.\n\n\n\nOur work will be useful to allow us to reason probabilistically about unseen ancestral shapes and sounds. This will be relevant for linguistics, phonetics and the diverse uses of evolutionary biology. The idea that we might be able to hear the sound of dead languages is very appealing and small successes in this area would likely attract attention to the power of statistical approaches benefiting both linguistics/phonetics and mathematics and statistics. This work might lead to improvements in automated species identification - something which has substantial implications where-ever applied taxonomy is required.\n\n\n\nWe finally note that a way of inferring ancestral shapes and sounds also offers the prospect of being able to evolve a set of shapes and sounds forward in time: this could be a useful tool in design of products.
