The complementary sector contributes to educational achievement and social integration of ethnic minority children in the UK but has received little attention from policymakers and mainstream educators. The seminar series was set up by researchers from three ESRC-funded projects concerning complementary schools, to share their findings with relevant UK policy makers and educational practitioners, and to draw in the perspectives of international experts on complementary schooling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Through four seminars and a final conference, a body of evidence was collected concerning curriculum and teaching approaches in complementary schools, the social and educational experiences of students in these schools, and current policies affecting the sector at national and local levels. Dialogue was facilitated between participants from different academic and practice-based backgrounds, thus raising awareness amongst policymakers and mainstream educators about the significance of complementary schooling. A critical approach to policy was developed, highlighting the lack of resources that often prevented government initiatives from being put into practice.&nbsp; The series also raised wider debates over the education and development of Britain’s multilingual children and youth from minority ethnic backgrounds.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0494","grantId":"RES-451-26-0494","fundValue":"3415","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Wesley MartinCharmian  Kenner","coPersons":["Jim  Anderson","Louise  Archer"],"organisation":"University of East London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
