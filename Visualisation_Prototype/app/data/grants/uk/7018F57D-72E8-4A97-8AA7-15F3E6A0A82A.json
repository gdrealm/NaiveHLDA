Identifying and studying the divergence of such genes is a key priority of contemporary evolutionary genetics. In a series of QTL studies of divergence of song traits between and within species of the fruit fly Drosophila, the gene fruitless (fru) has been implicated in the control of variation in this classic trait. Much is known about the structure and function of this gene in controlling song production in D. melanogaster, but little if anything about its role in influencing natural variation in song. We propose a) developing a combination of advanced 'gene swap' techniques to move exons of the gene from a range of species into D. melanogaster b) studies of the molecular evolution of fru within and between natural populations and species c) association analysis of variation in fru and traits in natural populations and d) examination of the evolution of regulatory regions to assess in detail the role of fru in natural variation at multiple levels. This will represent a uniquely detailed examination of the evolution of a candidate locus for a complex behavioural trait.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J023647/1","grantId":"NE/J023647/1","fundValue":"350354","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Goodwin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
