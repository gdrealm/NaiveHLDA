A key component in OCT is a laser with a rapidly tunable (swept) laser source. This project will develop a new type of swept laser source, offering low costs and therefore increased use of this imaging technique.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H008004/1","grantId":"EP/H008004/1","fundValue":"113230","fundStart":"2010-01-31","fundEnd":"2011-05-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Andrew Hogg","coPersons":["Stephen  Matcher"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
