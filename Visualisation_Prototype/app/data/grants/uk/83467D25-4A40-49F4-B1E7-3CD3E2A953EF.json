{"id":"83467D25-4A40-49F4-B1E7-3CD3E2A953EF","title":"Efficiency of Visual Statistics","abstractText":"The merest glance is usually sufficient for an observer to get the gist of a scene. That is because the visual system statistically summarises its input. For example, the observer may infer a forest scene if there are significantly more than 20 trees in the picture. If most of those trees aren't within a few degrees of vertical, the observer may infer that the camera was tilted. Our interest is primarily the efficiencies with which statistics like these are calculated. For example, how many trees can the observer use to estimate camera angle? Certain pictorial details are also inaccessible when observers do not look directly at an object. Like brief glimpses, our peripheral vision is often merely statistical. We will compare the efficiencies with which central and peripheral vision are capable of computing various image statistics, like orientation, position, and size. We will also investigate claims of greater efficiency for noticing differences in humanoid images. In fact, we now know that the visual system tends to exaggerate image differences. Happy or dark faces can appear less happy or dark, when surrounded by even happier or darker ones. We will test how well the amount of exaggeration can be predicted by visibility of the difference. To insulate our results from bias, we will focus on pictorial differences that cannot be so easily described.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H033955/1","grantId":"EP/H033955/1","fundValue":"432942","fundStart":"2011-02-14","fundEnd":"2014-02-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Joshua Adam Solomon","coPersons":["Michael  Morgan"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
