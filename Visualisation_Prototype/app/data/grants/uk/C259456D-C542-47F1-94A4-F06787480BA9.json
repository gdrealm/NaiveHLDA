Recent work by the project directors shows that what children say when they are asked at the age of 11 if they plan to stay in education post 16 is a very good predictor of what they actually do five years later.&nbsp;The research aims to investigate the processes behind this important finding and to locate it within a broader consideration of the place of school in children’ lives, responses to various aspects of the experience of school, aspirations and expectations of their personal futures and their sense of the role of school and education in their futures.</p> \n<p>Questionnaire data will be gathered from a representative sample of 1000 Year 7 pupils in 20 schools and detailed interviews will be conducted with 30 of these.</p> \n<p>It is intended that the research should contribute to our understanding of young people’s responses to school and its place in their lives.&nbsp;It is also intended that it should support the development of policies which engage potentially disengaged young people through listening to their voices and understanding their attitudes and orientations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E005187/1","grantId":"ES/E005187/1","fundValue":"186308","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Croll","coPersons":["Gaynor  Attwood"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
