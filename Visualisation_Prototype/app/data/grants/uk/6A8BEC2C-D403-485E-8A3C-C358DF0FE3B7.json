{"id":"6A8BEC2C-D403-485E-8A3C-C358DF0FE3B7","title":"Follow On: Commercialisation of Nanotube-based Mode Lockers and Ultrafast Fibre Lasers","abstractText":"The aim of this follow-up project is to develop a range of packaged carbon nanotube based mode-lockers and compact ultrafast fibre lasers utilizing these mode-lockers, with the aim to bring to market exploitation the fundamental results of the previous EPSRC grant. To do so we will first optimize polymer-nanotube composites aiming at long-term and high-fluence stability. We will then produce engineered devices with performance suitable for demonstration to target manufacturing companies. Nanotube-based photonic devices are expected to find a wide range of applications not only in optical communications but also in bio-medical instruments, chemical analysis, time resolved spectroscopy, electro-optical sampling, microscopy and surgery. Given the wide range of derivative technologies, to guide our development efforts we will carry out market surveys to identify key applications and target specifications. This will guide the technology marketing at the end of the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E500935/1","grantId":"EP/E500935/1","fundValue":"89269","fundStart":"2007-03-22","fundEnd":"2008-03-21","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This research has significant implications for applications of nanotubes in lasers, detectors and photovoltaic devices.
