The project will focus on how the presence or absence of routes, infrastructures and flows has been seen to affect the connectivity of communities, strengthen or weaken social, cultural, political, economic, spatial and temporal ties, and enable or constrain alternative connective relations. The project will assess research undertaken on the role of infrastructures in nation-state formation, transnational enterprises (e.g. European routes), imperial configurations, and practices of dissent and protest against these. The project will also comprise of a scoping study for a follow-on project on the role of transport infrastructures in uniting and dividing communities within a particular sub-state national territory: Wales. This will look at the perceived role of transport infrastructures in either strengthening Welsh national cohesiveness or in weakening its internal ties through closer links (conceived at the British national scale) with adjacent regions of England. As part of the research review a workshop will be organised with eleven world-leading experts working on themes of mobility, transport history and the networking of communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011207/1","grantId":"AH/J011207/1","fundValue":"25323","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Richard Merriman","coPersons":["Rhys Alwyn Jones"],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
