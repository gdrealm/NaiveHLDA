{"id":"8A875D63-2FC9-477A-B215-E3A3709AC747","title":"Breaking the walls to wake-up bacterial cells","abstractText":"Bacteria can survive harsh environmental conditions by slowing down their major living processes. They look like normal cells but behave like the dead ones until stimulated by proteins called the Resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs). Rpfs are constantly sectereted by normal growing bacteria and play an important role in making of cell envelope. However, sleeping or dormant bacteria do not produce the Rpfs. The main goal of this project is to find out how Rpfs wake-up sleeping cells. Rpfs are enzymes which digest bacterial cell wall (like lyzosyme) but unlike the latter they don't kill cells and somehow modify their envelope. Rpfs may simply break quite inflexible cell wall of sleeping cells and make them 'free' to grow and expand. In more sophisticated model fragments of cell wall, released by Rpfs during digestion, have a very special function as signalling molecules. In other words they are waking-up messages for dormant cells. These 'signals' bind to other molecules on the bacterial surface and initiate a complex system called a protein kinase cascade, a well described mechanisms of cell regulation in multicellular organisms. To address both hypotheses the investigator will isolate the major part of bacterial envelope, called murein and digest it with different Rpfs. The resulting products will be used for resuscitation of dormant cells and their composition will be analysed and characterised. Other experiments will be designed to establish what bonds the Rpfs cut in murein and how this cleavage influences the structure of bacterial cell envelope. In separate part of the project the investigators will attempt to understand how bacterial cells control the enzymes which able to destroy them by 'eating' bacterial envelope. Rpfs proteins will be applied as an example of such cell-wall degrading enzymes. The results of the project will not only satisfy scientific curiosity on bacterial cell function but also provide novel methods for manipulating of physiological condition of bacteria and further improving their application in biotechnology, medicine and specifically for combating of persisting infections caused by dormant bacteria.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H008586/1","grantId":"BB/H008586/1","fundValue":"314941","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings on generation of Rpf-dependent mycobacteria stimulated our discussions with clinicians on potential application of Rpf for improvement of diagnostic tools.

Demonstration of muralytic activity by all five Rpfs (RpfA-E) using zymography and artificial lysozyme substrate. Demonstration that glycolylation of peptidoglycan by NamH Rieske monooxygenase does not influence Rpf activity. Generation of muropeptides and their application in resuscitation and growth assays as well in PknB activation assays. Muropeptides do not resuscitate dormant mycobacteria. \n2. Development of in vitro and in vivo models for generation of Rpf-dependent mycobacteria. Treatment of M. smegmatis with meropenem resulted in rapid reproducible generation of non-culturable and Rpf-dependent mycobacteria. In separate experiments we demonstrated that the in vivo environment accelerates formation of Rpf-dependent mycobacteria.\n3. Generation of mycobacterial strains over-expressing L,D-transpeptidases and PknB which can be used for drug screening Development of strains over-expressing Rpfs into E. coli periplams; demonstration of reliable lysis of E. coli. Tuberculosis remains one of the greatest challenges for the Global Health system. Moreover bovine tuberculosis affects production animals in the UK and other European countries. Our findings provide novel insights into mechanisms of persisting mycobacterium bovis infection and suggest that significant proportions of mycobacteria generated during infection in animals cannot be detected using standard media. Therefore our in vivo model for generation of Resuscitation-promoting factor dependent M. bovis BCG can be used for investigation of molecular markers of latent/persisting infection and drug design. Generation of Rpf-dependent mycobacteria may also explain previously published data on detection of mycobacteria in environmental samples using molecular techniques. Our data suggest that the existence of Rpf-dependent mycobacteria should be taken into consideration for development of diagnostic methods. \nWe have also developed molecular tools and strains which can be used for scientific research and for education purpose. The results obtained within the project contribute to our current understanding of bacterial dormancy and resuscitation. Finally we demonstrated that the strain over-expressing Rpfs can be employed ad host for production of other recombinant proteins. These strain do not require specialized methods of disruption as they easily lyse upon induction of Rpf expression. This concept can be used for other industrially important microorganisms (for example, Corynebacteria and Streptomyces).
