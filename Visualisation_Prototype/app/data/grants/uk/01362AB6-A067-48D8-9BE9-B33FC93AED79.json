{"id":"01362AB6-A067-48D8-9BE9-B33FC93AED79","title":"Romantic Readers and Transatlantic Travel","abstractText":"This project explores how travel narratives shaped British people's outlook on the USA and Canada in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It is both a study of travel literature, at a formative time in the evolution of that genre, and a study of the growth of transatlantic interests and perspectives during a particularly turbulent period in Anglo-American relations.\\n\\nTravel writing remains a genre with significant commercial appeal. In today's society, however, ideas and images of distant lands come from a wide range of sources, including television, films, and the Internet. During the Romantic period - for the purposes of this project, the years 1760-1840 - the appetite for knowledge of foreign places and peoples was fed almost exclusively by the literary genre known as 'Voyages and Travels,' encompassing the writings of explorers, travellers, emigrants, and tourists. The continent of North America was a major focus of this literary output, unsurprisingly in a period that spanned the trauma of the War of Independence and the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, American entanglement in Britain's confrontation with Revolutionary France, political controversies over transatlantic emigration, and the renewal of armed conflict in the War of 1812, not to mention major advances in European geographical and scientific 'discovery' of the subcontinent. The reading public, most of whom were armchair travellers or whose expeditions were limited to Britain or to a well-trodden Continental itinerary, were avid consumers of accounts of British North America and Arctic exploration as well as of the USA - already viewed in the early 1800s as destined to become a global superpower of the future.\\n\\nWhat remains obscure is exactly how readers responded to these textual American imports: how they sifted, sorted, interpreted, and evaluated the steady flow of information and opinions. Generalisations about British attitudes to America and Americans in this period have been based exclusively on the accounts of travellers themselves rather than on the attitudes of their readers, who vastly outnumbered them. The latter area - studying the experiences of actual historical readers, rather than some model reader imagined by the critic - is a notoriously elusive and problematic branch of the history of books. It is even more challenging if one tries to go beyond the evidence of formal reviews to the impressions made by books on the minds of 'ordinary' readers. Most studies of literary reception to date have been preoccupied with the major genres of poetry, fiction, and drama; no attempt has been made to investigate the historical reception of travel literature. This project aims to fill that gap, in this specific geographical context, by undertaking a thorough exploration of the contemporary British reception of North American travels and explorations. It will contribute to our understanding of travel literature, the history of reading, and the early development of Anglo-American relations.\\n\\nThe project relates to a diverse research context. In recent times Christopher Flynn has studied the representation of Anglo-Americans in British Romantic literature, while Tim Fulford and Troy Bickham have explored the portrayal of Native Americans across a wide range of media. Anthony Pagden, Stephen Fender, Bruce Greenfield, and Ian MacLaren have offered different perspectives on travel and exploration narratives set in North America, while James Chandler, Tilar Mazzeo, Joel Pace, Fiona Robertson, and Michael Wiley are among those who have examined transatlantic perspectives in literature of the period. However, the coalition of interests in travel literature and reception history embodied in this project is unique. In addition to revitalising academic debates in the areas outlined above, the project will enlighten opinion-formers and policy makers as to the cultural origins of Britiain's so-called &quot;special relationship&quot; with America.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H005110/1","grantId":"AH/H005110/1","fundValue":"30638","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin  Jarvis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
