Recognising this unique development, my research explored the conditions which have facilitated the integration of women into formerly exclusively male combat units and analysed the experience of female soldiers on the frontline. \n\nWomen's exclusion from the infantry has typically been justified by reference to their physical weakness and to their presumed effect on cohesion among the male soldiers. Females threatened the combat performance of male troops. The research demonstrated that soldiers in mass conscript armies of the 20th century were poorly trained and generally performed badly in combat. Precisely because of this poor training, from the First World War to Vietnam, cohesion was encouraged primarily (and often not very successfully) through appeals to extraneous social values; masculinity, ethnicity or nationalism. There was little room for women in these groups precisely because masculinity was so critical to combat motivation and performance. \n\nBy contrast, in the professional armies of the 21st century, cohesion and combat performance has been generated in an alternate way. Professional armies now prioritise training and drills. Cohesion is now based primarily on practical competence, not social criteria; skill not social homogeneity is regarded as paramount. The research showed how this new form of cohesion has had important sociological consequences. Crucially, in the light of this professionalization, it is becoming acceptable for women to operate with infantry soldiers on the front line and, in some cases, to perform as infantry soldiers themselves - as long as they are competent. There has been a fundamental shift in the ways in which combat soldiers unite and perform their roles in battle, allowing individuals who were once excluded from the front-line to become members of these highly cohesive groups. Through evidence gathered from the armies of Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, the UK, the US and Australia, this research explored the possibilities and limits of women's participation in the infantry. It demonstrated that on a professional basis, competent women had been and could be accepted into combat units by male soldiers.\n\nAlthough the research was international and comparative, the impact of the research has mainly occurred in the UK because, uniquely of all western nations, there is a very significant anomaly in current defence policy. Although women have fought with British forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan, the UK alone has retained its gender restrictions on females: formally female soldiers cannot serve in ground combat units - although they have in fact done so for the last decade. This research has highlighted that disparity to encourage a change of policy, aligning gender regulations with reality. It has proposed that, recognising certain conditions, females should be allowed in the combat arms and that no gender restriction should operate in the armed forces; all arms and branches should be open to women. In recommending this position, I sought to ensure the impact of the research in two areas: 1) Policy Change: lifting the ban; and 2) Policy Implementation: integrating women into combat units.\n\nImpact:\n1) Policy Change: lifting the ban\nIt is possible to influence policy only through engagement with key institutions and opinion formers. To this end, I produced articles in the prime defence policy publications both in the UK and the US, namely RUSI Journal, British Army Review and Parameters, in order to precipitate and inform the debate about gender restrictions in the military. Specifically, I used the US Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta's decision to rescind gender restrictions in the US armed forces in January 2013 as a way of raising the debate in the UK. A joint international academic-military conference Frontline: combat and cohesion in Iraq and Afghanistan, which I had already organised for March 2013 and in which the gender question was a major theme, coincided with Panetta's decision; from that conference I wrote and circulated a final report to the British Army and to NATO, in which the gender question was prominent. \n\nFollowing these publications, in April 2014, the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Peter Wall, announced that the policy on female restrictions in combat units would be re-examined (with every likelihood of a lift of the ban). In May 2014, Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, affirmed that current MOD gender restrictions would be re-considered. It seems certain that in 2016 when this process is complete that all gender restrictions in the armed forces will be lifted; women will be allowed in the combat arms as I have recommended. \n\nWhile a number factors were relevant, there is evidence that my research and publications exerted some influence on these announcements. Following Panetta's announcement, General Wall commissioned a report by Professor Christopher Dandeker on gender policy in the army. Professor Dandeker attended my conference in March 2013 and drew heavily on my final report from that conference in his report to General Wall to argue that the restriction should be lifted.[1] My report had a traceable influence on his decision to review Army policy. My RUSI journal article was cited in an official House of Parliament briefing paper on the gender policy question in March 2014 just before Philip Hammond's announcement [2]; Mr Hammond was likely, therefore, to have been aware of it and the British Army Review article.\n\n2) Policy Implementation: successfully integrating women into combat units\nOn the basis of my research, I suggested policy recommendations on how to integrate women into ground combat units in the Final Report from the Frontline Conference. These recommendations included two central policies: \n\ni) Since, due to the physical demands of the role, only a very small minority of women will be capable of performing as combat soldiers, it was proposed that females are not simply incorporated into infantry training along with young male volunteers; in the light of the immaturity of young recruits, this is likely to prove unsatisfactory (in terms of pass rates) and problematic (in terms of sexual fraternisation/harassment). \n\nii) Accordingly, the report proposes that the best women candidates are selected for infantry duties after 3 to 5 years of service (as corporals or captains). It was recommended that these women are then put through a specialist infantry cadre (which enforces generic infantry standards), with a view to assigning these women as medics, radio-operations, machine-gunners, intelligence officers or commanders into the infantry. These recommendations are being considered by the Army and the Royal Marines, with whom I am collaborating. \n\n\na) The Army:\nFollowing the announcement by the Chief of the General Staff that gender policy would be re-examined (with a view to lifting the ban), I have begun to collaborate with the Army Manning Department, Headquarters Land on the implementation of these measures in anticipation of a policy change. The Army is considering this model. One officer has confirmed the influence my work has exerted: 'His subsequent work, building on the conference discussions, has laid out some draft policy guidelines and thoughts that will add significant value to those that might be called upon to enact any future change. In summary the value he has added on this topic and others has been genuinely invaluable'.[3] \n\nb) The Royal Marines\nI have a long-standing relationship with the Royal Marines out of which an engagement, likely to be formalised in the coming months, to provide advice and guidance on the gender integration issue has emerged. In anticipation of a policy change, the Royal Marines have already begun to develop a plan for the successful integration of females into the Corps. Because of the Royal Marines' relatively small numbers, the organizational challenges of integrating women is more difficult. In the Army, women might be given a specialist infantry course and then transferred horizontally into the infantry from another regiment at the rank of junior officer or junior non-commissioned officer. In the Royal Marines, it is deemed essential for all recruits and officers to undergo full Commando training in order to be accepted into the organization. This presents significant challenges for gender integration, not only because Commando training is recognised to be among the most demanding basic training in the world but also because Royal Marine recruits live in intimate proximity each other for their entire training process. It is essential to mitigate the risk of fraternization/harassment/abuse during training, the opportunity for which might be considerable. \nI am currently working with the Royal Marines and specifically with the Brigadier responsible for the issue, who attended the Frontline conference and was a recipient of its final report, to refine their integration policy. This officer has confirmed the potential impact of my research for the Royal Marines: 'Professor Anthony King has been closely associated with the Royal Marines since 2004, when he wrote a paper on the Royal Marines Ethos, which had a profoundly positive impact on the self awareness of this elite but understated organisation. Since then he has worked with the Royal Marines extensively, both in UK and on operations in Afghanistan. His work on The Combat Soldier has also informed Defence Policy on a range of issues surrounding small team cohesion in combat conditions, based on his first hand knowledge and understanding of The Combat Soldier in all his/her forms and his experience of combat operations at a particularly violent time in Afghanistan. This work included consideration of the role on Women in Ground Close Combat, which is, as a result, being reviewed by the Ministry of Defence ahead of schedule, informed to a significant degree by Professor's King's previous studies and his ongoing engagement. This is a particularly challenging and sensitive issue which spans the physiological, the psychological and the sociological disciplines. Professor King's continued engagement is deemed essential to the successful implementation of Women into Ground Close Combat roles, should UK Government policy change'.[4] One the basis of this evidence, it seems plausible to claim that my research is likely to have considerable impact on Royal Marines gender integration policy.\n\nReferences to corroborate impact\n1.
