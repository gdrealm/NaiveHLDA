{"id":"0AF27C3F-F4ED-4D21-83DA-0A50EAA2AF8F","title":"Polycomb repressive complex 2 regulation of neurogenesis","abstractText":"A large number of processes that do not directly change genes, &quot;epigenetic mechanisms&quot; affect embryonic development and disease. One set of epigenetic proteins (PRC2) are central players in development. PRC2 controls stem cell development into many different cells and tissues of the body. Scientists do not know how PRC2 regulates embryonic or adult stem cells to make neurons. In this project, we propose to combine the Shen laboratory expertise in PRC2 biology with the Szele laboratory expertise in adult brain stem cells. We will investigate how PRC2 normally works and how it works after brain injury. We believe our collaborative work will discover epigenetic regulation of stem cells in nerve cell generation, and provide novel insights into stem cell therapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K008927/1","grantId":"MR/K008927/1","fundValue":"38540","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Francis George Szele","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
