Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the focus of this grant is no exception and the virus is reported to kill some 15,000,000 poultry annually with associated economic impact. Previous research suggests that many viruses can exploit the cells they infect to help in the growth and production of new viruses. As a result of previous BBSRC funding we have found that IBV also hijacks the host cell to fine tune its infectious cycle. One of the ways it does this is to manipulate what is called the cell cycle by interfering with the very molecules that control this vital cellular pathway. The cell cycle is a mechanism by which normal cells control their growth and production of new cells. The focus of this research proposal is to investigate how IBV interferes with the cell cycle by identify the virus protein(s) responsible and determining the precise mechanism involved. By doing this we aim to develop an in depth understanding of this process that will have broad application to similar viruses and exploit these findings in the development of new vaccines to aid in the control of IBV.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F019904/1","grantId":"BB/F019904/1","fundValue":"373395","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Julian Alexander Hiscox","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" The avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) coronavirus is one of the major threats to the poultry industry in the UK and worldwide. New strains are constantly emerging and the need for new vaccines and therapeutic strategies is constant. In order to better understand the pathogenesis of IBV we investigated the interaction of the virus with the host cell, focusing on a process known as the cell cycle and how this affects virus biology. The cell cycle is a series of steps and events that governs the growth and division of cells. As part of this project we characterised how and why IBV interacts with the cell cycle and subverts host cell function to increase the production of new virus particles and control cellular anti-viral signalling. This research could be used by industry in a generic manner for boosting the production of virus vaccines in cell culture. Many viruses, including IBV, exploit and alter the cell cycle in order to boost virus productivity and the ak]mount of output infectious virus. As many virus vaccines are now being (or planned) to be produced in cell culture the ability to manipulate the cell cycle exogenously ready for virus infection would lead to an increase in productivity of the virus. There are two exploitation routes one is designing strategies to prevent IBV interacting with the cell cycle to promote virus biology. The other is to exploit this benefit for virus growth for increasing the production of virus in cell culture. Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
