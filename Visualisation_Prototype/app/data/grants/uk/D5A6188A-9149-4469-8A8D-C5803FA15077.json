If so, what does this mean for neuroscience -&nbsp; the study of the structure and function of the brain? Gradually, the influence of neuroscience is increasing, with important implications for how we live our lives. This project will examine what different people - patients, health care and other professionals and scientists themselves - think about neuroscience. What are the benefits to society, and what are the risks? What can - and should - we do about them?&nbsp; The project's key objectives are to: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Determine what neuroscientists, research participants and (potential) users of research think about the benefits and risks of neuroscience. </li>\n\n <li>Analyse how ethical issues are ascribed to these new developments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Fifteen small focus groups will be used&nbsp;in order to enable a dialogic approach to examining how understandings about expertise and identity might be challenged by developments in neuroscience.&nbsp; A discourse analysis of key documents relating to neuroscience and society will also be undertaken.&nbsp; Analysis will explore important themes such as ethics, culture and health and illness.&nbsp; The project will contribute across disciplines, as well as to the policy arena. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G041415/1","grantId":"ES/G041415/1","fundValue":"79958","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Cunningham-Burley","coPersons":["Martyn David Pickersgill","Paul  Martin"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
