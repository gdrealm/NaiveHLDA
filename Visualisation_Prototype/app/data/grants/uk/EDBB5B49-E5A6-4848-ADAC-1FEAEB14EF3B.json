Provision of new NMR equipment will support research at the forefront of modern chemistry in diverse areas such as: development of NMR techniques (Morris); synthetic organic chemistry (Thomas, Clayden, Sutherland, Dixon, Procter); synthetic inorganic chemistry (Winpenny, Collison, Heath, McInnes, Faulkner, Coe); organic materials (Turner, Yeates, Skabara); mesoporous materials (Anderson). Goals include making the smallest possible magnets - individual molecules in which many electrons line up in parallel - for storage and processing of information; new NMR methods for analysing mixtures, for detecting brain damage in stroke patients, and for studying biomolecules; new synthetic organic chemistry designed to give us, amongst many other things, improved antibiotics and other drugs; studies of the molecular origin of life, and of the ways in which enzymes speed chemical reactions; designing and making new porous inorganic materials for fuel cells and environmentally-friendly catalysts; making molecules whose properties are changed by light, to make more efficient fuel cells; and measuring NMR spectra in solids to learn about the active sites in solid catalysts, gas sensors, and systems for cleaning waste water and nuclear effluent.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D05592X/1","grantId":"EP/D05592X/1","fundValue":"975907","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth Alun Morris","coPersons":["Michael L Turner","Michael William Anderson","Richard Eric Winpenny","Eric James Thomas"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is our main way of identifying new chemical substances, and is an essential tool for modern chemistry.

Achievements include new NMR methods for analysing mixtures; progress in the development of single molecule magnets; new synthetic organic chemistry designed to give us, amongst many other things, improved antibiotics and other drugs; new insights into the origin of life, through prebiotic chemistry (reported on the front pages of The Independent and the New York Times, and in other publications across the world); chemical routes to new materials such as polymers and nanoparticles; new applications of lipid vesicles, analogues of living cells; new methods for controlling chemistry over long distances; new methods for making organic transistors; and new insights into how crystals grow. \n\n\n\nOver 200 papers were published during the grant period describing work that made direct use of the NMR facilities provided. Too numerous to list, with over 40 academic staff involved and a large number of individual projects. Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
