To survive the parasites need to escape the human immune system, and so they have evolved to secrete proteins that interfere with immune responses. If we could understand how these proteins work we could use the knowledge to treat diseases caused by an overactive immune system such as arthritis, eczema, asthma and irritable bowel syndrome. Towards this, we have made significant progress in understanding the mechanism of action of one of these proteins called ES-62. This progress has been made possible because we can make this protein in the laboratory from Acanthocheilonema viteae, a parasitic nematode worm that grows in gerbils. However, we need to sacrifice hundreds of lab rodents each year for this work, and it is also both expensive and time consuming. Moreover, a much larger number of animals would have to be sacrificed to produce enough ES-62 to be able to undertake a clinical trial. We propose to replace the use of the rodents by producing this protein using a free-living nematode called Caenorhabditis elegans. This worm can be grown in a lab in large amounts simply by culturing it with bacteria as a food source. C. elegans is used widely for biological research and there are established methods to introduce genes into it capable of producing proteins from other animals. This works particularly well with proteins from related animals such as other nematode worms. Furthermore we have developed a new method that should facilitate ready purification of ES-62 from C. elegans and we will check to ensure that the protein we produce has the same properties as the protein made from the parasitic worms. Our proposal is not only to directly replace laboratory animals in the manufacture of ES-62 but also to show that it is possible to produce the protein in large enough quantities to be used for therapeutic and commercial purposes. Furthermore, the technology will not be limited to manufacturing ES-62 as our strategy also has the potential to produce immunosuppressive proteins from worms that are human parasites such as those that cause the diseases referred to above. Overall our research will enable proteins from these parasites to be produced and characterised, leading to further understanding of how the immune system can be modified for therapeutic purposes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/L000660/1","grantId":"NC/L000660/1","fundValue":"74223","fundStart":"2013-09-02","fundEnd":"2014-10-01","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"David  Weinkove","coPersons":["William  Harnett"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
