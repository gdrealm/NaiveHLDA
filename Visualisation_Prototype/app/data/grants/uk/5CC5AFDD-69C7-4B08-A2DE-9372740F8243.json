The strategy will be revised and extended to cover the period 2013 - 2016. Particular attention will be paid to longitudinal data resources, assisting with the creation and implementation of a long term strategy to identify and fund a range of longitudinal data resources for biomedical and social research. </p>\n\n<p>Other areas which will be explored as potential research resources include new types of data, particularly transactions data and developments in social networking. Plans will also be made and taken forward with EU partner organisations for new European data infrastructures for support via the European Union and the European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally and through a close working relationship with the OECD, steps will be taken to identify and coordinate actions by relevant organisations in other countries and international bodies to improve knowledge about and access to data resources outside the UK.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-501-34-0001","grantId":"RES-501-34-0001","fundValue":"634671","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Elias","coPersons":["John Nicholas  Hobcraft"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
