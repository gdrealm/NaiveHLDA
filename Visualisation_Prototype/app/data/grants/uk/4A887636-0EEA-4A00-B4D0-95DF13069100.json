The communication between these nerve cells (neurons) occurs via specialized structures called synapses. When an electrical signal (action potential) travels along the neuron and reaches the synapse then a messenger substance is released from the synapse. This messenger substance is received by a receptor protein in the membrane of the adjacent nerve cell. In general nerve cells can be grouped into ?Yes-neurons?, which activate other neurons via their messenger substance and communicate information between different brain regions, and ?No-neurons?, which inactivate the ?Yes-cells? and thus regulate the flow of information. Dysfunction of subclasses of ?No-neurons? leads to pathological information-processing in psychiatric disorders. Recent studies have indicated that one particular sub-type of the ?No-neurons?, the so called CCK+ interneurons might be very important for controlling the flow of information related to the formation of memories and the regulation of mood and anxiety. We want to directly test the function of these particular ?No-neurons? in memory formation and fear/anxiety. To this end we are developing new methods that allow us to functionally remove specific nerve cells and messenger substances in model systems to test their behavioural relevance - similar to an electrician who goes through the components of a circuit board to identify a problem. Understanding how ?Yes neurons? and ?No-neurons? interact to generate memories and emotions will help to understand what is going wrong in memory and anxiety disorders and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat such diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100546","grantId":"G1100546","fundValue":"602059","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-10","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peer  Wulff","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Kiel University","findingsText":" Our goal is to investigate the behavioural relevance of CCK-positive interneurons. To do this we require to selectively target these neurons, which is complicated by the fact that principal cells also express CCK. We have used various approaches to target CCK-positive interneurons.\nWe have tried published short sequence promoters in AAV viruses, which however showed non-specific expression. We have tried an intersectional approach based on CCK-Cre and interneuron Flp mice. Here we found that previously published floxed stop sequences did not inhibit transgene expression, which was unexpected. We developped a new expression control system based on the use of heterotypic sets of antiparallel FRT sites, which shows no leakiness and finally allowed to selectively target expression to neurons that express both Cre- and Flp-recombinase. Using this system in compound CCK-Cre/ interneuron Flp mice we found that only about 50% of interneurons really expressed Flp in interneurons. Accordingly we have now changed the strategy to express Flp from an AAV, which only expresses in priincipal cells. In this scenario Flp expression prohibits transgene expression from a second AAV. We are hopeful that this approach will finally permitt cell-type-selective targeting of these interneurons. First results are promising. We are currently working on a confirmation of these results and will then proceed with the proposed program of work. We have spent much time on the development of molecular/viral tools and have not produced much data regarding the original question yet. The tools will be useful for the scientific community. We hope to soon produce data on the behavioural function of CCK-positive neurons, which may be relevant to psychiatry. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
