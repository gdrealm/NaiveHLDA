{"id":"5783D2FD-B5BC-4E3C-93D0-A2F56EAC276A","title":"The Reduceron: high level symbolic computing on FPGA","abstractText":"Symbolic computing is a key technology with programs often written in very expressive high level languages. The Reduceron is a custom processor for executing such symbolic programs by a technique called graph reduction. It is built on an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array), a medium that allows rapid exploration of alternative designs. The current prototype was developed in just 2--3 months as a case-study in the closing stages of a PhD. Early results are sufficiently promising that we propose a 15-month feasibility study researching the potential of a special-purpose processor based on an advanced Reduceron. Results will be immediately applicable in FPGA-based systems and could inform the future design of a SPU (Symbolic Processing Unit) analogous to current highly successful GPUs for graphics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G011052/1","grantId":"EP/G011052/1","fundValue":"100364","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Runciman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
