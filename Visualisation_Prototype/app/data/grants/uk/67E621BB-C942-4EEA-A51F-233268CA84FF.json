{"id":"67E621BB-C942-4EEA-A51F-233268CA84FF","title":"CRIMSON Study: RCT of Joint Crisis Plans to Reduce Compulsory Treatment of People with Psychosis","abstractText":"Background: Mental health policy in England emphasises that service users should exercise choice and be treated in the least restrictive way. Despite this, use of compulsory admissions under the Mental Health Act continues to rise. The Joint Crisis Plan (JCP) is so far the only structured intervention shown to reduce compulsory treatment. It aims to empower the holder and to help early detection and treatment of relapse of mental illness. Study design: A multi-site randomised controlled trial of Joint Crisis Plans compared with treatment as usual for people with a history of relapsing psychotic illness. The intervention: The JCP is developed by a mental health service user in collaboration with staff and an independent facilitator. The plan contains information including early warning signs of relapse, details of medication and treatment preferences. Outcomes assessed: (i) Proportion of service users admitted or detained under an order of the Mental Health Act during the follow-up period; (ii) Costs; (iii) Perceived coercion. (iv) Engagement with mental health services; (v) Therapeutic relationship; and (vi) reduced use of the Mental Health Act for the black service users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601660","grantId":"G0601660","fundValue":"2142570","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Thornicroft","coPersons":["Kim  Sutherby","Max  Birchwood","Richard  Gater","George  Szmukler","Martin Richard Knapp","Claire  Henderson","Graham  Dunn","Morven  Leese","Max  Marshall","Diana  Rose","Sarah  Byford","Helen  Lester"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
