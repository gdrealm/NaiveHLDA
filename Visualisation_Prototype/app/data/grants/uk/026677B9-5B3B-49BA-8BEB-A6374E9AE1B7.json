The complement cascade provides a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity: it destroys bacteria directly via innate processes and helps to direct and stimulate an effective adaptive response. Because of its central role, complement dysfunction is associated with a range of human diseases, including severe bacterial infections, kidney disease and autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. One of the main pathways of complement activation is known as the classical pathway, in which complement proteins bind to bacteria and set off a chain of reactions directed at killing them. In this grant proposal, we aim to develop a thorough understanding this pathway by studying the way in which the components interact with each other to initiate the reaction cascade. We have already established methods for producing key elements using recombinant DNA technology so that their mode of action can be investigated in a systematic way. As well as providing novel information that will help us to understand how complement works, this project will also foster the development of novel reagents which can be used to change complement activity. For example, inhibitors of complement could be used to prevent tissue damage in conditions where complement activates at the wrong time or place. Similarly, modified components can be used to bind and neutralize specific targets such as antibiotic resistant bacteria or diseased cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000191","grantId":"G1000191","fundValue":"438794","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Russell  Wallis","coPersons":["Wilhelm  Schwaeble","Peter Charles Moody"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
