One particular type of immune cell, called a T cell, controls these tissue-damaging responses. This proposal aims to find a way to switch off the disease causing T cells by targeting a molecule on their surface in such a way as to render the cell inactive.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800746","grantId":"G0800746","fundValue":"293149","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tom  MacDonald","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
