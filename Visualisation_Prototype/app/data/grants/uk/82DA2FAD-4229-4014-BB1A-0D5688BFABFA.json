This work aims to explore a possible long term and adaptable treatment route via the exploitation of standard silicon and Micro-Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) manufacturing methods to form micron scale electrode arrays formed alongside micro-capillaries with the intention of implanting these electrodes in the brain and spine for localized stimulation and sensing. The materials and sizes will be chosen to have the least possible adverse effects and it is hoped that this can provide a long term means of receiving, stimulating and control of nerve signals after trauma such as spinal cord injury or stroke.This is technically challenging and novel and would also permit for the first time a much more detailed and comprehensive study of neuronal signals with micron precision within the spine. External stimulation both electrical and pharmacological (using directed picolitre quantities of drugs), together with electrical sensing and feedback, is unique, allowing a hitherto impossible level of manipulation, understanding and thereby control, of neurological behaviour, and without the drawbacks of systemic drug treatments. Ultimately the aim of the work will be to control pain and motor responses (and smart prosthetics) using adaptable electronic and pharmacological signals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M019187/1","grantId":"BB/M019187/1","fundValue":"120083","fundStart":"2015-06-29","fundEnd":"2016-12-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Paul Steenson","coPersons":["Samit  Chakrabarty"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
