We will port pathways into Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris for production of two valuable compounds from glycerol: chiral amino-alcohols (CAA) and 1,2-propanediol (PDO).\n\nCells will be characterised with high throughput micro-scale process techniques and at scale. Transcriptomic and metabolomic data will be combined with process insights to dictate refactoring of both pathways and host 'chassis'. These steps will be repeated for second-iteration cells, driving better performance. New strains, processes and integrated methods will be of use to biodiesel and Industrial Biotechnology sectors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M004872/1","grantId":"BB/M004872/1","fundValue":"213654","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian  McNeil","coPersons":["Linda May  Harvey"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
