It is well recognised that they may exist in many different functional states: they not only detect and kill invading organisms but are involved in tissue repair. In the brain there is a population of resident tissue macrophages known as the microglia, which is normally kept under tight control by the brain microenvironment. However, during brain injury and disease they become activated. As the population of the UK and developing world lives longer so the prevalence of chronic neurodegenerative diseases is increasing with profound social and economic consequences. The most common form of chronic neurodegenerative disease, Alzhemier?s disease, is associated with accumulation of misfolded protein in the brain, widespread neuronal degeneration and activation of microglia. It is not clear whether the observed increase in microglia activation has beneficial effects by preventing misfolded protein accumulation or whether their activity contributes to the pathology of the disease. Recent data suggests that systemic inflammation caused by bacterial or viral infections in individuals with Alzheimer?s disease is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and exacerbation of behavioural problems. It is known that signalling of systemic inflammation to the brain involves microglia. In this proposal we will use our well-defined laboratory model of chronic progressive neurodegeneration, prion disease in mice, to investigate how a systemic viral infection impacts on the activated microglia in the diseased brain and whether this affects the progression of neurodegeneration. We will use behavioural assays and neuropathology to investigate how the viral infection alters disease progression. We will use molecular, cellular and biochemical techniques to study how the viral infection alters the state of activation of the microglia in the brain. We will use state of the art bio-information techniques to compare our data on microglia activation states with data about genes that make individuals susceptible to Alzheimer?s disease. In understanding the role of microglia we can help to establish the mechanisms causing brain damage thus facilitating development of future therapeutic approaches for chronic neurodegenerative disease involving the accumulation of misfolded protein disease. If systemic infections are driving disease progression they can be treated to delay disease progression and improve the quality of life of patients with neurodegenerative disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100591","grantId":"G1100591","fundValue":"558176","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jean  Manson","coPersons":["Tom Charles Freeman","John K Fazakerley","V Hugh  Perry"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
