Methods of delivery include delivering the cells through the vascular system to tissues through the capillary bed and direct injection to the site of repair. Fluid mechanical stimulation to the stem cell during such delivery processes is critical to the cell integrity and viability. Indeed the role of shear stress in influencing a variety of cell types has been increasingly documented. In our proposed research, we will apply a new optical, mechanical tool for manipulating stem cells in microfabricated channels and study how the cells respond to such fluid mechanical stimuli. In particular, we will carry out a range of feasibility studies based on quantitative biochemical analyses of these cells after exposure to various flow conditions. We aim to bring together biologists, engineers, physicists and mathematicians in Keele and from other institutes to explore new strategies of stem cell delivery via circulation or injection. In the long term, these new delivery approaches will be useful for the advancement of cell therapy to various diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D014786/1","grantId":"BB/D014786/1","fundValue":"347381","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Isaac Kuo-Kang  Liu","coPersons":["Yibin  Fu","Alicia  El Haj"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
