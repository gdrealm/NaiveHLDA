{"id":"2DC26EF2-B533-40EB-BD00-5F1F56986EA6","title":"The Effects of Ethnic Parties on National Unity: Polarisation vs Inclusion","abstractText":"The political mobilisation of ethnicity has led to tensions between ethnic groups in, for example, Belgium and Canada, and to violent conflict with disastrous consequences in such diverse cases as Cyprus, Rwanda, and Sri Lanka. Some observers point to the particularistic politics of ethnic parties as fomenting ethnic tensions and call for their regulation. Others argue that ethnic parties may be valuable vehicles in solving such tensions because they contribute to the integration of diverse ethnic groups. However, both views are so far based on assumptions rather than empirical evidence; to date, the effect of ethnic parties on ordinary people within society has not been examined directly.\n\nThe proposed project will fill this gap, contributing to a better understanding of the links between ethnic parties and national unity within the population: Does the presence of ethnic parties affect the way people perceive the ethnic &quot;other&quot; or the nation? Is this effect positive, because ethnic parties as emancipatory vehicles increase the inclusion of ethnic minorities within the population? Or is it negative, because ethnic parties raise awareness of ethnic differences? To answer these questions, the project will first conduct a global comparative analysis of 105 diverse countries, using a new multilevel dataset. It will then conduct in-depth studies of two countries to examine the nature of these links. Both the quantitative and in-depth analyses are needed to better understand whether there are general links between the presence of ethnic parties and diminished national unity throughout different contexts and to identify the nature of this link in important cases.\n\nThe project will provide both methodological and substantive contributions. Methodologically, the project will provide two main innovations. First, it will integrate multiple quantitative and qualitative methods and techniques, currently under-used in UK social science research on ethnic politics, and in doing so provide a new, extensive multilevel dataset for further research. Second, the project will forge new links between the project team and international experts working in democracy promotion and, in particular, party assistance. Stakeholders will be involved in the design, execution, and dissemination of the research at different stages throughout and after the project, including an expert survey in the first phase of the project to inform data collection and compilation, consultation on case selection, interviews of experts and local stakeholders during the in-depth case studies, as well as a workshop to identify the contributions of the research to the stakeholders.\n\nSubstantively, the research will shed light on the compatibility of diversity, democracy, and social cohesion and thus address the ESRC priority &quot;A Vibrant and Fair Society&quot;. The findings will inform research not only on ethnic parties and ethnic conflict management but also more broadly on the interaction of power, political rhetoric, and identity. In doing so, the research will advance our understanding of the behaviour of people, social groupings, and organisations, and of how to influence them, deepening the evidence base that can inform policy and practice in the UK and internationally. Both local actors as well as international organisations have become increasingly active in the field of political party regulation and engineering in order to support democratisation and democratic consolidation. Examining the effect of ethnic parties within the population can provide valuable lessons for party assistance strategies to reduce the likelihood of ethnic tensions in diverse societies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L008947/1","grantId":"ES/L008947/1","fundValue":"235006","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anaid  Flesken","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
