The research would also abstract key constructs (of entities, links and flows) for the visualisation that allow 'non-obvious' representation that is parsimonious and powerful. We will develop a skeletal representation and demonstrator that could have richness and layers added over time, beyond the current project scope. The project will also devise ways of extracting (queries), from the visualisation, ways it can be used, e.g. value risk, how to value stewardship, security, privacy, contingent values, trust and if there are useful inter-, intra-layer notions of 'trust domain' that can help us organize the architecture of the ecosystem to enable interactions, transactions, and ecosystem development. This queries would help support decisions, resulting in a tool that can be used by the policy makers, business leaders, and law enforcement officers to make intelligent decisions. The SeRTES project proposes to represent a 'tool of tools' that is truly trans-disciplinary and cross-cultural. Finally, the project sees its research as a seed-corn project and expects to seek more funding to add to the richness of the representation and develop a network of studies complementing this project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J021601/1","grantId":"EP/J021601/1","fundValue":"199705","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Irene Cheng Ng","coPersons":["M  Rajarajan","Chris  Speed","David  Pym","Ashley Duncan  Lloyd","William James Venters","Kevin James Brown"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
