Three principal cross-cutting research strands will exploit existing high-quality data resources: <strong>Education and Social Stratification</strong> will focus on social class differences in entry to, progression in and attainment at tertiary education and how they affect individuals' labour market outcomes and their civic participation; <strong>Crime and Victimisation</strong> will explore the dramatic change in crime rates in Scotland and other jurisdictions and examines the determinants and impact of criminal careers amongst populations of offenders; and <strong>Urban Segmentation and Inequality</strong> which will create innovative new measures of social segmentation and combine these with cutting-edge longitudinal and sorting-model techniques to explore the causes of neighbourhood segmentation, household location choice and neighbourhood inequalities. Five additional projects will focus on the referendum on Scottish independence, location dynamics and ethnicity and exploiting existing datasets. The research will fed into training activities and knowledge exchange events aimed at boosting capacity in quantitative methods amongst the UK social science community.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006460/1","grantId":"ES/K006460/1","fundValue":"3787300","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  McVie","coPersons":["Paul  Nieuwbeerta","Brian  Francis","Graeme Thomas Laurie","Emer  Smyth","Duncan Paul Lee","Stephan  Heblich","Jon  Bannister","Selina  McCoy","Nema  Dean","Lindsay  Paterson","Paul Andrew Norris","Gwilym Benjamin Pryce","Cristina  Iannelli","Leslie Neal Humphreys","Adam  Gamoran","Christopher  Timmins","Nick  Bailey","Marita  Jacob","Christopher John Dibben"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
