{"id":"B22052CD-8E9F-48E8-8FC0-0A5251840A79","title":"Lexico-syntactic text simplification for improving information access","abstractText":"Text simplification is the process of reducing the grammatical and lexical complexity of a text, while\nretaining its information content and meaning. The main goal of simplification is to make information\nmore accessible to the large numbers of people with reduced literacy. The National Literacy Trust\n(www.literacytrust.org.uk) estimates that one in six adults in the UK have poor literacy skills. There is\ntherefore a need to make information available in simple English, as advocated by organisations such as\nthe Plain English Campaign (www.plainenglish.co.uk). This need for text simplification is likely to\nbecome more acute for a variety of reasons; for instance, a growing aging population with language difficulties\narising from neurodegeneration and other causes, children accessing information on the internet or lay\nreaders trying to access technical writing online (perhaps, to research an illness or treatment). \n\nOne of the most popular information sources online is Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org), a free-content\nencyclopedia written collaboratively by internet volunteers. The Simple English Wikipedia\n(simple.wikipedia.org) initiative to make information more accessible contains over 60,000 articles in\nSimplified English. However, these are only a fraction of the 3.3 million articles in the main English\nWikipedia and further, the simplified articles tend to be very short (often just the first paragraph). Our\ngoals in this proposal are twofold. From a theoretical perspective we want to gain an understanding of\nthe text revisions humans perform to simplify text, and learn rules for simplification from corpora. From\nan applied perspective, we want to implement a system for automatic text simplification that can perform\nthe wide range of revisions that humans perform. We will make this system available to the Simple\nEnglish Wikipedia community as a tool to expand the content available in simplified form.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J018805/1","grantId":"EP/J018805/1","fundValue":"97364","fundStart":"2013-02-28","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project has resulted in software for text simplification and compression. We have begun to lease with practitioners involved with creating simplified material for teaching English as a second language to incorporate this software into the workflow. We have received some preliminary evaluations of the software and will be providing a web interface to the software to facilitate uptake.\n\nNote: No impact has been achieved yet, but a pathway has been created.
