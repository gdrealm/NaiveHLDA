This builds on our success during the first phase of the project, and we will work closely with our partners across a range of time periods and themes. Community groups will receive tailored advice from a member of the research team on their specific needs and projects, as well as accessing a variety of skills-based training sessions offered by the University of East Anglia on a range of topics, such as copyright, the use of digital media, database management and similar themes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007777/1","grantId":"AH/K007777/1","fundValue":"65722","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The second phase of the Ideas Bank project allowed us to support successfully funded All Our Stories projects across the eastern region, providing a vehicle for all the stakeholders to take their engagement to another level. The emphasis for our Phase 2 project was on 'realising your idea', based on training and advice from the project team based on feedback from the final workshop of our Phase 1 project and from individual All Our Stories projects. Our activities during Phase 2 took the form of a series of generic workshops for the project, direct support and advice to individual projects by the project team, and the creation of online resources via a new project blog aimed at the groups. All the provision and support reflected the needs of the projects as identified in Phase 1 and via further dialogue. \nDuring Phase 2 we worked closely with 14 All Our Stories projects. Eight of these projects had received advice from the project team during Phase 1, and the remaining projects had not received support from any institutions.

The project team also provided tailored support to All Our Stories projects based on their own research expertise and experience of public engagement. A series of films that can be shared with the wider community (both inside and outside academia) demonstrated the strong links between community groups and the UEA generated by the project. A particular achievement of the project has been to consolidate the relationships between university researchers and the wider community, and to build new relationships both with community groups and partner organisations around the region. The findings from this phase of the project could be used by academics interested in the role and value of heritage within local communities, and by anyone interested in developing close working relationships between community groups and universities. Our final evaluation found that funding is important for community groups, in part because it makes some activities possible, but more importantly because it signals recognition from outside the community. While the work of a group of enthusiasts is essential, recognition by an outside body makes the work more objective and more valuable in the eyes of participants. The work of volunteers is essential to success. Their levels of motivation and commitment are variable and learning how best to manage their involvement is critical.
