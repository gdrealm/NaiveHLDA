{"id":"A3CB9D0B-4E87-429B-A8C3-A26CD162A364","title":"Warwick Symposium: Probability","abstractText":"This is a proposal for a symposium to be held during the academic year 2011 - 2012 at the Mathematics Research Centre (MRC), of the University of Warwick. The overall theme of the symposium is probability, which plays a fundamental part in our understanding of the world, with applications to almost all branches of science and engineering. It is also a core mathematical discipline in its own right with deep connections and relevance across the spectrum of pure and applied mathematics. The symposium will facilitate a year-long sustained research activity across several important strands in modern probability. The various focus areas of the symposium reflect a combination of the most important recent developments in probability theory worldwide, and the areas which are currently most active in the UK. These include areas where probability interacts with other areas of mathematics, such as analysis, geometry, and algebra, as well as important application areas, such as mathematical physics and mathematical finance.In practical terms, the symposium will be structured around the following three main activities: A number of week-long workshops in various research areas of international significance pertaining to the general theme of the symposium. The topics for the research workshops have been chosen to provide a wide coverage of various aspects of modern probability theory and to foster interaction between researchers working in related but not always overlapping areas.The 2012 edition of the UK Easter Probability Meeting, a tradition that was revived at the University of Warwick in 2008 and will provide a capstone to the symposium.A visitors programme which will provide continuity between the workshops and the Easter meeting.This symposium will allow the UK and international research community to come together to exchange knowledge and ideas, explore new directions and deepen our understanding of this important and challenging subject.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I014969/1","grantId":"EP/I014969/1","fundValue":"11310","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This was a grant for a series of workshops in Warwick.
