Surface spectroscopy methods will be used to assess the attachment of the coupling agents to the glass surface. Interfacial shear strength studies will assess the effectiveness of the agents in coupling the glass and matrix materials. Samples will also be aged over a period of weeks in order to determine the durability of the interface when exposed to hydrolytic attack. These studies will provide a suitable primary candidate coupling agent that would be used in the larger FaCCTA project in order to produce effective biodegradable composite materials","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F02407X/1","grantId":"EP/F02407X/1","fundValue":"37992","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The work allowed us to explore the development of composites using degradable glass fibres coupled to a polymer Healthcare Economic","person":"Jonathan Campbell Knowles","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" This was an exploratory grant to investigate the development of high strength composites, using coupling agents.
