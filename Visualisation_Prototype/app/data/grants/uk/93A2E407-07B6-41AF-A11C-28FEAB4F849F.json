Using a methodology ( ‘backward&nbsp; mapping’) that compares the actual practices of users expected by policy/ corporate strategy to adopt low-carbon technologies with those as imagined by such high-level actors, a more informative picture is furnished about what, how and why low-carbon innovations are succeeding or failing.<br /><br />This project explores three domains: energy (solar PV vs. solar thermal), urban mobility (electric vehicles vs. electric bikes) and agriculture (GM vs. agro-ecological maize), in each case comparing the globally-dominant model of high-technology, IP-intensive innovation favoured by current Chinese 'indigenous innovation' policy and an alternative model successfully mobilizing other indigenous innovation resources, but without such government support.<br /><br />The project aims to improve understanding of: strengths and weaknesses of different low-carbon policies and strategies; the qualitative nature of socio-political change associated with such innovation; and possible effects of emergent Chinese low-carbon innovation on the UK.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006002/1","grantId":"ES/K006002/1","fundValue":"493293","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  UrryDavid Peter Tyfield","coPersons":["Frauke  Urban","Ping  Li","Yu  WANG","Adrian Vincent  Ely","Yiching  Song"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
