The majority of the activities can be grouped together within one of three broad themes:\n- The development of novel physical science methodologies and analytical techniques and their application to the biological sciences and medicine.\n- Quantum phenomena and systems, including research into superconductors and other quantum materials, and the development of quantum circuits and quantum computing devices.\n- Advanced materials engineering. Key areas of activity include metalorganic frameworks (including methodologies for synthesis of new MOFs and the design of novel polymer nanocomposites containing MOFs) and structural engineering materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031503/1","grantId":"EP/K031503/1","fundValue":"500000","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Alexander Walmsley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
