{"id":"A3DD1A3B-AE61-4B26-BB3F-010613A8ACE4","title":"Robust testing for unit roots in the presence of multiple breaks in trend and volatility","abstractText":"<p>It is widely recognised that structural change is commonplace in macroeconomic and financial time series variables. The failure to allow for such changes leads to misspecified econometric models with the potential for misleading inference and inaccurate forecasting of the variables.&nbsp; Empirical evidence strongly suggests that these structural changes frequently take the form of multiple breaks in the deterministic trend component of the series, and/or changes in the volatility of the stochastic element of the series.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The principal objective of this project is to devise powerful, size-controlled tests of the unit root null hypothesis, that are robust to uncertainty over the number and timing of possible breaks in trend, and also to the presence or otherwise of non-constant volatility.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>An integral component of this research will be to devise break date estimators which, in large samples, correctly identify the number and timing of breaks irrespective of whether the volatility in the series is constant or otherwise. These will then be fed into unit root testing procedures based on applications of the wild bootstrap principle. Simulation evidence will be used to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods, and empirical examples will be used to display practical relevance.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3882","grantId":"RES-000-22-3882","fundValue":"63738","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Michael Taylor","coPersons":["David  Harvey","Stephen  Leybourne"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
