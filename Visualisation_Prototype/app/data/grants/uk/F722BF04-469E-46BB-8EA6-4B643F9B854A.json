{"id":"F722BF04-469E-46BB-8EA6-4B643F9B854A","title":"State strategies of governance in global biomedical innovation: the impact of China and India","abstractText":"<p>Innovation in biomedicine is a global enterprise with an increasingly important contribution being made by the Rising Powers, especially China and India.&nbsp; However, the policy directions and institutional configurations for fully exploiting the scientific and innovation efforts on the global stage are currently unclear and unstable.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>National and international innovation in biomedicine challenges conventional modes of governance, including industry structures, sector organisation, and geographical locations. Given this context and challenge, the aim of the project is to establish a network to develop, test and refine with academics and policy makers a robust interdisciplinary framework for the analysis of competing state strategies of governance in global biomedical innovation capable of illuminating the position of China and India and the policy implications for the UK.</p>\n\n<p>A series of three workshops will be held in China, India and the UK, drawing on their academic and policy catchment areas to test the analytical framework, explore the dimensions of a project proposal that utilises this framework, and secure potential academic and policy partners for the subsequent project proposal. A fourth and final workshop for UK policy makers will consider the implications of the Rising Powers analysis for the UK governance of biomedical innovation.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H032398/1","grantId":"ES/H032398/1","fundValue":"58836","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian  Salter","coPersons":["Alex  Faulkner","Pranav  Desai","M  Ramesh"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
