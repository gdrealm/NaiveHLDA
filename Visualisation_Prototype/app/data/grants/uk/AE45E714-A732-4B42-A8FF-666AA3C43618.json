The proposed project aims to determine whether individuals carrying the MTHFR 677C to T mutation have different patterns of DNA methylation and uracil misincorporation (a form of DNA damage) in the colon compared with those who do not carry the mutation. An intervention study will then be carried out in healthy volunteers to determine whether increasing folate intakes (400 micrograms/d for 3 months) can alter DNA methylation and uracil misincorporation in the colon and whether this response differs according to MTHFR 677C to T genotype. Subjects for the intervention study will be recruited from the Department of Colorectal Surgery, King&iquest;s College Hospital NHS Trust, London. The DNA methylation analyses will be undertaken at King&iquest;s College London and LGC Ltd. The proposed research programme will exploit genomic approaches to assess the role of diet in the development of colorectal cancer, which places a high burden on healthcare resources in the UK. The results from this project will be relevant to both public health and consumer interests, particularly in view of the proposed folic acid fortification programme in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D523178/1","grantId":"BB/D523178/1","fundValue":"263753","fundStart":"2006-06-19","fundEnd":"2009-06-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Pufulete","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
