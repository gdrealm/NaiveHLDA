{"id":"09FC332A-D1C9-47D4-BC0A-4D05D1624C42","title":"Spreading the Light: Mapping the Vernacular Elucidarium in Medieval England","abstractText":"The project explores the production and transmission of the vernacular Elucidarium in England, using manuscript evidence to determine how the text was produced and disseminated between the 12th and 15th centuries, and to explain its place in the broader context of late medieval pastoral care. Some seventy extant manuscripts in English, Anglo-Norman and French will be examined, and data collected relating to centres of production, patrons and owners. The data will be collated and analysed in order to establish patterns of textual production, transmission and ownership, and the ways in which these changed over time. The project also tracks changes in the form and content of the text, and considers the extent to which these can be linked to culturally specific historical moments. A particular concern of the project will be to establish points of contact between the physical texts and named people and places, in order to identify real reading and writing events.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I02545X/1","grantId":"AH/I02545X/1","fundValue":"173995","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  We produced a small exhibition of manuscripts and early printed books relating to the project at Canterbury Cathedral Library in November 2013. We hope to build on this and produce a larger exhibition to coincide with planned activity to commemorate the 800th anniversary of the 4th Lateran Council in 2015.

Contrary to previous scholarly understanding, the manuscript evidence has revealed an audience which comprises both clergy and laity, and which extends across social classes from the wealthy elites to manual workers such as carpenters. It has not always been possible to understand how individual manuscripts came to be in such diverse hands, however. When the website goes live, it will make the manuscript catalogue avaiable to other researchers, enabling them to undertake substantive work on this corpus electronically.\n\nThe evidence of wide readership is of significant interest in reconfiguring our understanding of the dissemination and use of texts in medieval England and also in France.
