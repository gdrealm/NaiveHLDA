{"id":"D8384C87-EB95-4476-9E5B-2C7EB1817B4C","title":"Arithmetic applications of Kudla-Millson theta lifts","abstractText":"This proposal is motivated by the Langlands programme, a series of conjectures made by the mathematician Robert Langlands in the 1960s and 70s. They predict precise links between three seemingly unrelated classes of objects. These come from representation theory (in the form of modular forms), number theory (Galois representations) and algebraic geometry (motives e.g. elliptic curves). For each of these disparate objects you can determine something akin to an underlying DNA, the so-called L-function. (The most famous example of an L-function is the &quot;Riemann zeta function&quot;, which contains a host of arithmetic information about prime numbers). You can use this DNA to match the objects, e.g. for every modular form there should be a Galois representation with the same L-function. Establishing these links enables mathematicians to understand more deeply the properties of the objects involved and allows them to prove theorems, such as the famous example of the proof of Fermat's last theorem by Wiles and Taylor in 1994. \n\nAutomorphic forms (examples of which include modular forms) are special kinds of analytic functions and can be studied for groups of matrices with entries in different fields. Fields are typically sets of &quot;numbers&quot; in which the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are defined. An example is the field of rational numbers but there are many other fields besides this. \n\nMuch progress has been made in the theory of automorphic forms over the rational numbers (and other totally real fields) in the last two decades. This has led to successes such as the proof of the Sato-Tate conjectures for elliptic curves. This proposal wants to move to new ground in the hope that it will prove similarly fertile. New phenomena occur with Bianchi modular forms (automorphic forms for 2x2 invertible matrices over imaginary quadratic fields), a considerably different case in which previously developed tools from algebraic geometry are not applicable. This case is therefore an important testing ground for finding new techniques that could apply in the general context of the Langlands programme. \n\nSo what techniques will I try? Recent progress in the theory of Siegel modular forms (4x4 symplectic matrices over the rational numbers) has led me to consider Kudla and Millson's theta lift. This is a construction that can be used to transfer Bianchi modular forms to Siegel modular forms. I propose to study the finer properties of this theta lift with the goal of applying it to answer questions about Bianchi modular forms. In particular, I want to prove results about their associated L-functions and Galois representations. \n\nSpecific aims of the proposal include proving a relation between L-values of Bianchi modular forms and the squares of Fourier coefficients of the Kudla-Millson theta lifts (an analogue of a famous formula by Waldspurger); proving one direction of the Bloch-Kato conjecture for the Asai Galois representation (a result explaining the significance of the value of a particular L-function); and studying the theta lift in the context of a &quot;p-adic Langlands functoriality&quot; conjectured by Calegari and Mazur.\n\nThis proposal will lead to a much better understanding of Bianchi modular forms and will help other members of the large community of mathematicians working on the Langlands programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K01174X/1","grantId":"EP/K01174X/1","fundValue":"72264","fundStart":"2013-07-07","fundEnd":"2015-07-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tobias Theodor Berger","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" My research project studies applications of a theta lift from Bianchi to Siegel modular forms. During the first half of this grant, my work on the third objective led to an exciting (and unexpected) application of this theta lift to the modularity of abelian surfaces (the next case beyond elliptic curves, for which modularity is known by the work of Wiles, Taylor et al.) A paper about this result has been submitted for publication (joint work with Dembele, Pacetti and Sengun), in which we provide evidence for the Brumer-Kramer paramodular conjecture and also give the first example of associating an abelian surface to a Bianchi modular form (Eichler-Shimura conjecture). I have also made good progress on the first two objectives (Asai and Waldspurger) and I am currently writing up my results. As outlined in my grant application I organized a workshop on Bianchi and Siegel modular forms from 14-16 July 2014 (extra funding was secured from the LMS to extend the workshop to 3 days and allow funding for PhD students). This brought together 26 researchers from different disciplines and promoted the important connections between both types of modular forms, the key point of my grant. The PI has also given talks at seminars and conferences in the UK, US, Denmark and Bulgaria to disseminate his findings. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
