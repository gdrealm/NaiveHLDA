The research team will offer an array of open day and outreach activities geared towards capturing the role of community heritage in the present lives of young people at risk of social exclusion. Two Open Day events and a Roadshow event will be organised and delivered by a team of ten researchers who have expertise in a wide range of disciplines. The events will take place in May and June 2012 and will include exhibitions, performances, videos, readings, workshops and discussions, with emphasis on the participation of young people. Examples of previous work with young people will be showcased, including the following: oral histories, photographic projects, digital documentary production, research training for young people, use of different archives, sport, drama performances, poetry writing and co-evaluations of projects and services. Workshops will be offered in drama, poetry, media production, photography, several aspects of sport, 'Becoming a researcher', 'Piecing the Past Together', 'Amazing Archives' and blogging. Emphasis will be placed on connections to community activities and the ways in which the skills presented in the workshops will enable groups of young people to focus on their heritage. These events will be publicised widely using a range of means. In addition to newsletters, blogs, discussion forum, websites and other electronic forms of communication will be used as active communication tools. The team will follow-up contacts which are made by meeting with community groups, their co-ordinators and external bodies to discuss the potential for application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and to consolidate links once decisions are made about HLF funding applications. In-line with the commitment, skills and experience base of the team, involvement will be based on the principles of participatory research, centred on an empowering, enjoyable and flexible approach to collaborative co-production and co-delivery of activities with young people.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013692/1","grantId":"AH/J013692/1","fundValue":"19543","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2013-01-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Leslie  Hicks","coPersons":["David  Piggott","Ann  Gray","Erin Alison Bell","Jenny  Dagg","Si√¢n  Adiseshiah","Adam  O'Meara","Joss  Winn","Janice  Kearns"],"organisation":"University of Lincoln","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
