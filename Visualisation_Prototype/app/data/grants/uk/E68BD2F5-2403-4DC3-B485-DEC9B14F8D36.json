For this question we will analyse the efficacy of punishment strategies of the creditors.&nbsp; </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-165-25-0006","grantId":"RES-165-25-0006","fundValue":"109542","fundStart":"2006-10-16","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Amrita  Dhillon","coPersons":["Javier Ignacio Garcia Fronti","Samuel Kern Alexander"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
