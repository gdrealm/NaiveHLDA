These proteins are commonly involved in regulating cell growth and function and their inappropriate activation can cause disease such as cancer. Studies in yeast have recently provided clues to the identity of the enzymes that attach these fatty molecules to the proteins. We will identify the human enzymes that carry out this process and use molecular and cellular techniques to study their function. Ultimately, by understanding and interfering with these enzymes it may be possible to treat diseases that are caused by inappropriate activity of their target proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400710","grantId":"G0400710","fundValue":"217306","fundStart":"2005-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Ian Magee","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
