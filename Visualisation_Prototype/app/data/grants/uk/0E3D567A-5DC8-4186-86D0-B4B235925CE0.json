This will be achieved through R&amp;D activities in\ngraphene inks production and integration of graphene inks into electrodes for subsequent manufacturing of supercapacitor\ncoin and pouch cells. The specific application of such devices is in energy storage for low carbon vehicles. The project\ndirectly answers the key question of whether graphene will retain its novel properties when manufactured into real products\nfor practical applications. Research activities are targeted at identifying the choice and quality of graphene, manufacture\nand optimise graphene inks and electrodes for a real supercapacitor device. A Key innovation will be an integrated material\nsciences and scale-up engineering approach from materials to manufacturing in order to translate the performance benefits\nof graphene from lab discovery into real products.\nThe Warwick University contribution cross-cuts the complete project programme and aims to deliver a fundamental\nadvancement in the strategic integration of material science and manufacturing capability within the UK. A key contribution\nis the development of a comprehensive methodology for the high throughput assessment of graphene cells, which will\nrelate the graphene grade and manufacturing method with the energy and power density characteristics of the graphene\ndevices. Through the unique facilities and industry/academic networks within the WMG High Value Manufacturing (HVM)\nCatapult, a real-world demonstration of the successful scale-up and subsequent characterisation of new graphene based\nenergy storage devices (button cells and supercapacitor cells) will drive confidence within keys sectors (e.g. transport and\nenergy), accelerate graphene research and stimulate a UK supply-chain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507738/1","grantId":"EP/M507738/1","fundValue":"98561","fundStart":"2015-05-13","fundEnd":"2016-09-12","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chee Tong John  Low","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
