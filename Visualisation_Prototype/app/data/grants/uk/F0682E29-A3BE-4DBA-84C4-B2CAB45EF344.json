With the availability of genome sequences much attention has focused on analyzing the changes in gene expression/transcription profiles during these adaptive responses. The translation of mRNA into protein is a fundamental component of the gene expression pathway. However, relatively little is known regarding the role of translational control mechanisms in the response to stress conditions, which is the focus of this proposed study. Our preliminary data have shown that protein synthesis in yeast is rapidly and reversibly inhibited in response to hydrogen peroxide stress. Paradoxically however, certain mRNAs are resistant to inhibition and continue to be translated during stress conditions. Our data show that translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is phosphorylated in response to oxidative stress. eIF2 serves as a focus for translational regulation in all eukaryotic species. In the past, most work has focused on the kinases which mediate phosphorylation of eIF2. In this current work programme, we will study both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of eIF2. This is critical in order to understand the co-ordinated regulation of protein synthesis that is observed in response to oxidative stress.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E00623X/1","grantId":"BB/E00623X/1","fundValue":"365486","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  To provide a general understanding of the control of translation during stress conditions Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology ","person":"Christopher  Grant","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" 1) We have shown that translation initiation is subject to oxidant-specific regulation of initiation, primarily mediated by Gcn2-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2a. We have found that H2O2 stress depletes cellular methionine and our model is that an accumulation of uncharged tRNAMet is the signal which activates Gcn2. We are currently working up the methodology to examine tRNA charging levels to confirm this model, and a manuscript is in preparation pending these final experiments. This is a particularly interesting finding since methionine is the only amino acid which is utilized during both translation initiation and elongation and hence its depletion is likely to inhibit both stages of translation.\n\n2) We have defined the role of the Sit4-Sap185 phosphatase in moderating eIF2? phosphorylation during oxidative stress conditions. Our data indicate that over-expression of SAP185 and SAP190 increases resistance to hydrogen peroxide and reduces phosphorylation of eIF2??during hydrogen peroxide stress. Given that oxidative stress does not appear to affect Sap185 protein levels, we have focused our analysis on the interaction between Sit4 and Sap185. We found that less Sap185 is bound to Sit4 following oxidative stress conditions. Our model is that Sap185 interacts with another phosphatase to control eIF2?? phosphorylation. We are currently performing experiments to confirm the kinetics of the Sit4-Sap185 interaction, and a manuscript is in preparation pending these final experiments.\n\n3) We originally proposed that SAP185 translation is induced in response to hydrogen peroxide stress as a protective response. This was based on our finding that the SAP185 mRNA shows increased polysome-association in response to hydrogen peroxide stress. However, our Western blot analysis has revealed that Sap185 protein levels are not increased under these conditions. This suggests that SAP185 mRNA become associated with ribosomes under oxidative stress conditions, but translation is still inhibited at the elongation phase. This would provide a pool of SAP185 mRNA which is poised to rapidly resume translation once the stress is resolved. This research has increased our understanding of how gene expression is regulated at the posttranscriptional level. This is a research area, which is of particular relevance to the yeast community, given the current interest in how yeast cells respond to stress conditions. Importantly, most stress protective systems are highly conserved and so the work will be applicable for studies in other fungal and higher eukaryotic cells. In addition, they will be medically significant, since knowledge of cellular control mechanisms may lead to a greater understanding of disease/pathology states and potentially lead to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
