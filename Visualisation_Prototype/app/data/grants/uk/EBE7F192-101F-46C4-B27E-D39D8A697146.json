Limited battery life and excessive internal power densities limit the number of transistors that can be active simultaneous in a silicon chip. Energy and power reduction in conventional computing is limited by the inability of modifying the architecture or adapting to changes in the fabrication process, temperature or application requirements after chip fabrication. When these changes are possible are limited by the need of &quot;margining&quot; that introduces safety margins so devices operate under worst conditions. Worst conditions are rarely the case an important energy and performance gains are possible if technology can adapt to the real conditions of operation. This research addresses this challenge by investigating energy proportional computing with a novel voltage, frequency and logic scaling triplet to adapt to changes in applications, fabrication or operating conditions. The results from this research are expected to deliver new fundamental insights to the question of: How future computers can obtain orders of magnitude higher performance with limited energy budgets?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L004232/1","grantId":"EP/L004232/1","fundValue":"348326","fundStart":"2014-01-06","fundEnd":"2017-07-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The ENPOWER project team at Queen's University of Belfast has initiated an impact activity through collaboration with Credit Suisse, an international investment bank.

ENPOWER contributes novel power-capped performance optimisation methods via fine-grain power modelling in conjunction with intelligent workload allocation between software and hardware.\n\nENPOWER is also the first project to construct and validate detailed models of the energy consumption of data transfers through memories and system-level interconnects.\n\nThe key findings during the first year of the ENPOWER project are presented in the IEEE FPT'2014 paper. Power capping methods developed within the ENPOWER project have also been deployed in experiments to reduce the energy consumption of real-time financial analytics workloads (WHPCF'14 paper), computational science software (Computer Science R&amp;amp;D paper), Recognition Mining and Synthesis applications (ICCD'14 paper), and multi-tenant heterogeneous many-core platforms (IC-SAMOS'14 paper). The findings of the ENPOWER project provide pathways to cap the energy consumption of computing systems designed for both the embedded systems market and the server market. Importantly, ENPOWER will enable on-demand energy capping with performance guarantees set by the platform user or operator, in response to the application's computational and data access requirements.
