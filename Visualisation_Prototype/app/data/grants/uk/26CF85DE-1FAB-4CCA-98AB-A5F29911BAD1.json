{"id":"26CF85DE-1FAB-4CCA-98AB-A5F29911BAD1","title":"NGWCP - Atmospheric model dynamical core","abstractText":"At the heart of a weather prediction or climate simulation model is a `dynamical core' that solves the equations describing the fluid dynamics and thermodynamics of the atmosphere on the scales that can be resolved. The dynamical core of the current Met Office Unified Model for weather and climate prediction (the `New Dynamics') and its planned successor (`ENDGame') use highly efficient and accurate methods that exploit the structure of a longitude-latitude grid. However, several aspects of these schemes involve non-local data communication, particularly near the poles of the grid. Such non-local communication is expected to become a serious performance and scalability bottleneck on future massively parallel computer architectures, for which communication between processors is disproportionately slow compared to the calculation itself. It is therefore imperative to examine alternative, quasi-uniform, grids, with much reduced communication demands, as a potential basis for a future atmospheric model dynamical core. The proposed project will examine some of the leading candidate alternative grids. The properties of the candidate grids will be examined through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical calculations using simplified equation sets. One requirement is for accurate wave propagation. The ideal scheme should capture the frequencies of all resolved waves as well as possible and should not support any unphysical `computational modes'. This will be examined theoretically in idealised cases where the calculation is tractable, and numerically in more complex cases. If a candidate scheme is found to support computational modes, methods for controlling them will be examined. Another set of essential requirements relate to conservation of mass and energy, and that the scheme should respect basic geometrical requirements such as the fact that the gradient of the geopotential should generate no local rotation (vorticity) in the fluid. Also among these requirements is the need for the scheme to be able to support balanced flow, since the atmosphere is observed to be close to balance on large scales. Again, these requirements will be examined through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical testing. Finally, all of the candidate alternative grids have the potential for the numerical approximations to lead to the grid structure being reflected in persistent errors in the numerical solution, so called `grid imprinting'. Test cases will be developed and applied to quantify the grid imprinting tendencies of the various candidate grids.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I021136/1","grantId":"NE/I021136/1","fundValue":"135726","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The findings of part I of the project form the foundation for Part II, to develop a three-dimensional atmospheric dynamical core for a future Met Office forecast system.

On such machines, a traditional longitude-latitude grid is expected to be inefficient, and a more uniform grid will be needed.\n\n\n\nThe paper by Staniforth and Thuburn reviews various schemes for gridding the sphere, and the challenges of obtaining properties such as balance and conservation that are essential for accurate simulation of the atmosphere on such grids. Some key issues requiring further research were identified.\n\n\n\nThe paper by Thuburn and Cotter proposed a new mathematical framework for developing models on exotic grids with the potential to achieve those essential properties. A shallow-water model based on this framework was subsequently coded and tested on a `hexagonal-icosahedral' grid and a `cubed sphere' grid. In an outgrowth of this work, a modified framework giving the same essential properties but with greater accuracy, based on a finite-element approach, was developed. A shallow-water model based on the modified framework was also coded and tested. This finite-element approach is one of the most promising for further development in phase II of the project.\n\n\n\nThe paper by Weller et al. examined the accuracy of shallow-water models based on several candidate quasi-uniform spherical grids using a range of test cases and diagnostics. Of the grids tested, a hexagonal-icosahedral grid was the most promising.\n\n\n\nOne candidate numerical scheme for use on certain quasi-uniform grids is the spectral element method. Melvin et al. examined the simulation of wave propagation using the spectral element method but found that its handling of short waves is inaccurate. It was concluded that the spectral element method would not be pursued for the development of the dynamical core. This project is carried out in direct collaboration with the Met Office. If phase II of the project is successful then the exploitation of the research to provide higher resolution weather and climate forecasts on further generation computers will take place directly through the Met Office.
