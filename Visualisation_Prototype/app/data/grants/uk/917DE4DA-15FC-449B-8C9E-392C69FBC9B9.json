{"id":"917DE4DA-15FC-449B-8C9E-392C69FBC9B9","title":"Using implementation intentions to modify attentional biases in social anxiety","abstractText":"<p>Social anxiety is a prevalent and problematic disorder where people are highly sensitive to information which suggests that they are being evaluated negatively (eg, a frowning face) or that others can see their anxiety (eg, blushing). Attention is quickly drawn to this information and, as a consequence, the person's feelings of anxiety are initiated, maintained, or escalated. The proposed research aims to supplement existing interventions for social anxiety by providing a fast and simple way to prevent these unwanted attentional responses. We hypothesize that socially anxious individuals who supplement their goals (eg, 'I do not want to appear anxious') with specific if-then plans designed to control their attention (known as ‘implementation intentions’; eg, 'If I feel like I am blushing, then I will ignore the sensation in this [specified] way!') may experience less anxiety and perform better in social situations than socially anxious individuals who do not form plans. The proposed research investigates how well two different kinds of implementation intention (‘anxiety inhibiting’ vs. ‘task facilitating’) can help to disrupt two different attentional processes (orienting vs. disengagement) using computer-based tasks, eye-tracking software, and observer ratings of anxious behaviour.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D004276/1","grantId":"ES/D004276/1","fundValue":"21912","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2006-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas Llewelyn Webb","coPersons":["Margarita  Ononaiye","Paschal  Sheeran","John Glenn Reidy"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
