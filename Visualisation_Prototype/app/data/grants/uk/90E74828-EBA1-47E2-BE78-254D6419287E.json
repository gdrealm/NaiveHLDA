The landscape you pass through is rich in historical meaning, yet the knowledge of this history is compartmentalised: some lies in everyday experiences and memories, some lies in scholarly monographs, some is found on display (and even more, behind the scenes) in our great museums. We live in an old country - but its meaning can be disconnected and hidden. Surprisingly this situation is true even for the aspects of our lives that seem so modern, so vivid, so everyday: the communications technologies that we use to organise our lives.\\n\\nLocating Communications Heritage aims to reconnect the history of communications and relevant information technologies to the mobile user. What if we go on our journey again but this time a mobile application can tell us about the history of communications around us? As your train arrives in Paddington station the application pulls up an image of a telegraphic apparatus held in the Science Museum, and relates the story of a crime solved by the rapid exchange of information. Passing down the Oxford Road in Manchester would reveal that only a hundred yards west lies a room in which one of the first electronic stored-program computers operated. The application brings up an image of the object and - drawing on the best scholarship and curatorial insight - its meaning is illuminated. Object, history and place are brought together. \\n\\nLast but not least a channel will be opened up so that the public's experiences and memories of communications and information technologies can contribute to the ongoing reinterpretation of their histories. An aim is that the full potential of citizen mobile in the cause of history of communications will be tapped.\\n\\nLocating Communications Heritage will pilot a project to make this journey possible. \\n\\nLocating Communications Heritage is a collaborative project between an academic historian of science and techology, the curator of computing and information at the Science Museum, and commercial partners, British Telecom and Illumina Digital. It seeks the understand what needs to be accomplished to make the mobile application described above possible. The application will be designed. A pilot project will be run, revealing the potential strengths and weaknesses of the application. Finally, we intend to reflect on the experience for the benefit of academic audiences, exhibit design, object interpretation, and future application development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H018247/1","grantId":"AH/H018247/1","fundValue":"11792","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project was to design, build and user test a prototype app for history of telecommunications.
