This project will establish and evaluate a desing feedback process which can protect and perhaps enhance the natural environment, which allowing energy extraction to be maximised.\nEngineers will work with project and device developers to establish approriate development scenarios which will then be considered using state of the art modelling techniques to assess the levels of ecological impact across a range of key ecological parameters. This modelling will establish the levels of impact and the sensitivity of key impacts to changes in array and device design parameters. Stakeholders will be involved in assessing the acceptablity of predicted ecological changes and the prospects of ecological benefit being enhanced.\nThe process loop will be completed by feeding the impact analysis findings back into the array design process to start a further iteration of the desing, impact and acceptability assessment process.\nIt is anticipated that typically three iterations will be needed for the development scanarios to establish and refine the process to the benefit of the broader marine energy sector.\nThis project crosses borders from research led-engineering design, offshore engineering and marine operations to ecological science, measurement and physical modelling expertise within the consortium. The parallels between wind and wet renewable will be utilised to link from early development shallow water wind and tidal streams to floating wave and wind in deeper water. The consortium will engage with Marine Scotland and MMO from the start of the project and at key intervals through the project\nThe project will proceed by interactive collaboration between: system designers; physical modellers and ecologists; regulators and project developers.\nAppropriate response models will be established based upon direct involvement and interaction with cutting edge research being conducted within NERC, EPSRC; ETI and CEC funded research programmes. \nA clear imperative for the first stage is to refine the choice of criterion from which to judge environmental benefit, particularly when upscaling, e.g. fisheries enhancement, acoustics, animal movement corridors.\nThese will then be used by the physical and ecological modellers to produce a series of configuration scenarios.\nThe engineering specialists in the project will identify portfolios of appropriate case studies of array developments and state of the art array modelling tools. \nCase studies will be developed and interpreted using the techniques established above . The engagement of developers, trade associations, EMEC and Wave Hub is fundamental for specialist input and dissemination and the results will be interpreted in association with these broader stakeholder communities. This will be through workshops arranged to coordinate structured debate and cross consortium feedback.\nThis process will be, fundamentally an iterative procedure, with effective closure of the design, ecological assessment and constraint quantification process loop requiring multiple circuits prior to acceptable compromises being reached.\nManagement Plan\nA steering committee drawn from the investigators and incorporating representatives from wind, wave and tidal developers and invited representatives from the regulators will assess and guide progress.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J004243/1","grantId":"NE/J004243/1","fundValue":"125349","fundStart":"2011-11-28","fundEnd":"2013-05-27","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  So far they have not been used by the wider stakeholder community. \nA spin off from the study has been the observation that some seals use marine wind turbine arrays as preferred foraging sites.

This method is being developed into a simulation tool based on real marine mammal behaviour data and planned development programmes to assess and minimise the negative impacts of man made sound from marine renewable arrays. The results of a programme of telemetry work funded by DECC in collaboration with this project mean that the data to test the methods are now available. Two papers looking at the effects of large wind farm arrays are in review and will be included in the 2015 reporting exercise. These will be used to generate a simulation method/tool to predict sound exposure levels from planned turbine arrays using real seal track data. This tool will be available to operators/regulators to assess optimum operation schedules. A peer reviewed version of the tool will be available by the next reporting round.
