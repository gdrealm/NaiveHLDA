{"id":"9091B9E0-BE6B-4C7E-A150-FC6ED8E2502F","title":"Vector-borne disease systems: from mapping to understanding","abstractText":"Vector-borne disease systems are complex. This means that they are dynamic and involve many interacting components and feedback mechanisms. In particular, vector-borne disease systems involve a parasite which moves between animals and humans via a vector (e.g., a mosquito or fly). This makes their modelling difficult and limits comprehensive understanding, while at the same time presenting challenges to the scientific community. \nThis project focuses on sleeping sickness (SS) in Uganda as an exemplar of a vector-borne disease system in which the animal is cattle and the vector is the tsetse fly. A serious problem in Uganda is that there are two forms of the disease (Rhodesian SS and Gambian SS) that are currently separated, but are moving closer together. Overlap would cause serious problems because diagnostic and treatment methods differ between the two forms and differentiation between them is very difficult. \nTo increase understanding of the disease system, to predict the risk of overlap of the two forms of disease and to develop control strategies that mitigate the risks effectively, an integrated approach is required. This project will combine mathematical and statistical modelling, extensive data collection and a range of collaborating experts including end users at the Ministry of Health, Uganda. \nRisk mapping uses cutting edge spatial statistical approaches to model the relationships between the spatial distributions of (i) SS prevalence (or density) and (ii) vector density, and a range of environmental, biological, ecological, social and climatic spatial covariates (or factors). By doing this, we can predict susceptibility to SS spatially, identify areas at risk of overlap of the two forms and forecast the changing susceptibility to SS under future climate change scenarios. \nAgent-based modelling can represent explicitly the processes of animal, vector and human movements, contact, transmission and development of parasite and disease in humans. This type of model accounts for both large scale and local processes (e.g., movement of cattle between markets infrequently and across farmsteads daily). While difficult to calibrate because of the requirement for many forms of intensive data that are expensive to acquire, the advantage once calibrated is that the model can be used to test what-if scenarios including a range of different intervention and control strategies. \nA range of experts will consider these and alternative approaches, assess the data requirements and create an integrated solution to the SS problem in Uganda that should be applicable to vector-borne diseases generally.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902445","grantId":"G0902445","fundValue":"49005","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Michael Atkinson","coPersons":["Sue C.
