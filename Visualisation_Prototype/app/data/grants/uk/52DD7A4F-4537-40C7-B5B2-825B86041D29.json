Working on several major pathogens of cattle and poultry, IAH has an excellent infrastructure for studying diseases in their natural hosts. IAH has recently invested heavily on areas such as transcriptome analysis, proteomics and bioinformatics to underpin the research efforts on studying the complex pathogen-host interactions in important diseases of animals. These recent advances have generated a growing requirement within the IAH to get to grips with cell biology, particularly methods allowing the cellular localization of host and pathogen proteins to be determined with precision, using recent advances in Bioimaging techniques.Image analysis by fluorescence microscopy is becoming a powerful tool for visualising the dynamics of intracellular networks and molecular host-pathogen interactions during infection by pathogens. The current proposal is to obtain funds to purchase a new confocal microscope for the Compton Laboratory to undertake research projects in different groups working on various pathogens. Some of the examples of research projects that would benefit from the confocal microscope are (a) Marek's disease in chickens to examine the complex interactions of MDV and host in cell-to-cell spread and the unique ability of the feather follicel epithelium to support cell-free virus production (b) Analysis of the repertoire and function of bacterial Type III secreted effector proteins (c) Host cell invasion of Eimeria tenella (d) dynamics of cell types and interactions in mycobacterial granuloma in cattle (e) Coronavirus-host proteins (f) biology of avian dendritic cells and (g) examining the role of chicken toll-like receptors. Availability of the confocal microscope with facilities for live cell imaging is vital for the success of many of these projects and for the fundamental understanding of the molecular interactions of several pathogens with their natural hosts","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E012795/1","grantId":"BB/E012795/1","fundValue":"195335","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Venugopal  Nair","coPersons":["Paul  Monaghan"],"organisation":"The Pirbright Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
