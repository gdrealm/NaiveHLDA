User communities can collaboratively produce (co-produce) and actively support, vote and enjoy products, and experience co-created product value, though this predominantly resides in a digital media and virtual environment. Many users have yet to interact with manufacturers to co-produce tangible physical products largely because of design and production complexity issues, although this is an area of rapidly growing interest and one which are seek to address in this project. This project aims to break down these barriers, and implement and evaluate user based design, production and web service tools for users and manufacturers to co-produce physical products and co-create user added value and bring these tools to a viable commercial exploitation position. The project will utilise a flexible chocolate Additive Layer Manufacturing (ChocALM) technique and integrate it with mass production technology, thereby engaging a large numbers of users to support co-design and co-production of chocolate gift products. This would help to invigorate a substantial UK share in this global market. This project therefore will boost our experience of a sustainable digital economy, grow the service capability of manufacturers, and bring creativity and innovation to a user society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I006885/1","grantId":"EP/I006885/1","fundValue":"365236","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project has developed technology tool and understanding for the co-creation of physical products. Its research via a case study on 3D chocolate printing resulted in the broad dissemination via public release (i.e. BBC news) and media (i.e. over 1 millions views on youtube). A spin off company - Choc Edge - was formed to exploit the outcome commercially.

The finding reveals that both the technology tools such as easy-to-design tools and 3D printing technology and business methodology such as community co-creation play an important role for the co-creation of physical products. The findings have been widely disseminated to general public for them to understand and appreciate the potential of co-creating physical product via new 3D printing and design technology and business models.
