Despite predictions to the contrary, presidents have been remarkably successful at winning legislative support from fragmented parliaments.The project aims:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to identify the tools that presidents use to govern in concert with multiparty legislatures</li>\n\n <li>to assess the effects of these tools on horizontal accountability in new democracies.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The findings of the existing literature accept that the survival of multiparty presidentialism hinges on coalitional politics, but the research moves beyond this in two important ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>&nbsp;by striving to identify a much broader array of tools that allow presidents to build interparty coalition</li>\n\n <li>by asking whether the provision of these governing tools to executives undermines key elements of accountability to parliament.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Through a comparative analysis of presidential-legislative relations in Armenia, Benin, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Kenya, Malawi, Russia and Ukraine, it is shown how strategies of coalition management vary across cases and the impact that this has on the trade-off between policy decisiveness and horizontal accountability. Ultimately, the findings will help to improve the approach of policy makers and politicians working to strengthen legislative capacity and deepen processes of democratisation.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I008241/1","grantId":"ES/I008241/1","fundValue":"580888","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy  Power","coPersons":["Nic  Cheeseman","Paul  Chaisty"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
