{"id":"F8BB2A40-30F3-4AE7-A306-D1014F72A042","title":"Drama and the Transfer of Power in Renaissance England","abstractText":"The research project will examine a series of rare and lost dramatic works written and produced at historical moments between the English Reformation and the\\nEnglish Revolution when power was transferred from one monarch to the next. \\n\\nMany of the works to be studied are not extant as texts, so the first research objective will necessarily be to ascertain their nature and content from surviving evidence, such as dramatic records and contemporary accounts. Some of these works have hitherto been unidentified.\\n\\nThe monograph will focus on seven specific transitional moments at which the crown and its agents promoted, intervened in, or ignored drama at key transitional moments in order to assert or lubricate the transfer: the promulgation of the Royal Supremacy in 1535, the accessions of the five succeeding monarchs (Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth I, James I, and Charles I), and the outbreak of the English Revolution in 1642. The research will highlight the significance and function of drama at these precise moments. This will vary from case to case according to the evidence: some works were used to assert power, some to bid for it, and on other occasions the crown intervened to restrain dramatic activity or even ignored it altogether.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F005148/1","grantId":"AH/F005148/1","fundValue":"27147","fundStart":"2008-01-15","fundEnd":"2008-05-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Wiggins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
