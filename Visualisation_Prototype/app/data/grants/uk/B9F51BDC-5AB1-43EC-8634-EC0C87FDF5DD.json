{"id":"B9F51BDC-5AB1-43EC-8634-EC0C87FDF5DD","title":"The role of translational control in the natural history of measles virus","abstractText":"Fever in humans is generally unwelcome and we try to alleviate it by taking drugs and shedding clothes. Our study centres on measles virus (MV) which induces a high fever. Viruses evolve alongside their hosts; so whenever the host tweaks its immune system to fight the virus the virus responds by collecting additional genes or mutating existing ones to circumvent this assault. Understanding this race is vitally important. MV has two proteins which are essential for growth and when the virus replicates at 37&deg;C the proteins are produced. However, when MV grows at 39&deg;C, a similar temperature experienced during fever, these proteins are not made. This potentially gives the virus an advantage during fever, since when these proteins are not made the virus can hide within cells and evade detection by the immune system. The work will be led by Bert Rima, who has worked for over 30 years on MV, and Paul Duprex who has genetically modified viruses to study links between their genes and proteins. We are in an ideal position to address this problem because we can both manipulate the virus and have established animal models which allow us to differentiate between disease-causing and non-disease-causing viruses.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501427","grantId":"G0501427","fundValue":"633184","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Bertus Karel  Rima","coPersons":["W Paul  Duprex"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
