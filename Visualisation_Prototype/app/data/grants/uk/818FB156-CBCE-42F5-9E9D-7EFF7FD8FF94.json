We will develop tractable and effectivetechniques for the integrated end-to-end treatment of uncertainty incontext-aware SDS, using learning algorithms combinedwith Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Thisrequires us to develop effective methods for training and testing suchsystems. We will also determine, through system tests withreal users, whether the end-to-end statistical treatment ofuncertainty improves SDS for users, in comparison to rulebased and standard MDP-based techniques.No current SDS treats dialogue processing as an end-to-endintegrated statistical system, constrained by context, whereuncertainty in one process feeds into other processes, whereuncertainty in one dialogue state feeds into the nextdialogue state, and where this whole system is constrained viacontextual feedback. It is still standard practice to ignore theuncertainty in the output of a lower-level process by passing only asingle best analysis to higher-level processes, with the sideeffect that lower-level processes do not take into account importanthigh-level constraints. For example, contextual features ofdialogues such as user goals or previous speech acts are notsystematically exploited in speech recognition or utteranceinterpretation. This is a serious shortcoming for current SDS, given that uncertainty pervades and proliferates throughevery level of dialogue processing, from speech recognition errorsthrough interpretation ambiguities, to uncertain dialogue states andcompeting strategies. These problems lead to the currentsituation where SDS are not robust or efficient enoughfor any but very simple tasks.We will build and evaluate SDS which usestatistical processing end-to-end, and which use contextrepresentations to constrain the uncertainty inherent in dialogue. Wewill build on exisiting knowledge and techniques developed in the TALKproject, and well as recent corpora (COMMUNICATOR, TALK, AMI). TheSDS development tools, components, and environments usedand developed at Edinburgh's HCRC (e.g. DIPPER, HTK, Festival) alsoprovide a number of exisiting dialogue systems (FLIGHTS, TALK, WITAS), forming a platform to be extended usingthe new methods developed in the project. These systems can then beused for testing, evaluation, and further data collection.The proposal thus aims to improve dialogue system robustness andefficiency, and allow SDS to be developed and optimized usingdata-driven approaches. There is much user frustration with currently deployed SDS, so there is much to be gained from improved robustness andefficiency. Data-driven optimization will also lead to decreaseddeployment and development costs for industry. Thus the beneficiaries ofthis research will potentially be all futureusers of IT (including the illiterate andIT-illiterate, also in the developing world). In the short tomedium term, commercial applications include: interactive SDS, dialogue and meeting summarisation, interactiveentertainment, intelligent tutoring systems, intelligent personalassistants, and dialogue supported question-answering and search.With recent advances in speech recognition, parsing, context-sensitivestatistical dialogue management, the theory of learning with PartiallyObservable states, the availability of new,large, and richly annotated dialogue corpora, we are now in a position to treat dialogueprocessing as an end-to-end context-aware statistical system. Webelieve this model will lead to a breakthough in robust, efficient, and natural human-computer SDS, andhas the potential to radically improve the state-of-the-art indialogue management.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E019501/1","grantId":"EP/E019501/1","fundValue":"266907","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Applications of the this work include: interactive spoken dialogue systems, dialogue and meeting summarisation, interactive entertainment, intelligent tutoring systems, intelligent personal assistants, and dialogue supported question-answering and search on mobile devices -- such as Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google Now.

We published 5 journal papers, 8 conference papers, and 5 workshop papers on these issues (all peer reviewed). We also gave several invited talks on this research (e.g. Oxford University 2008, King's College London 2008, International Conference on Human-Computer Conversation 2008). \n\nWe developed tractable and effective techniques for the integrated end-to-end treatment of uncertainty in context-aware SDS, using learning algorithms combined with Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). This required us to develop effective methods for training and testing such systems. We also investigated, through system tests in more than 400 test dialogues, whether this end-to-end statistical treatment of uncertainty improves SDS for end users. We have shown that our proposed model has specific benefits: for example a 5% reduction in Word Error Rates using a memory-based learning context-sensitive speech recognition method (Lemon &amp;amp; Konstas EACL 2009). This is an example of reducing uncertainty in the output of a lower-level process by taking into account high-level contextual constraints in an end-to-end statistical model.\n\nThe project achieved its planned milestones (M1 - M4). The first end-to-end statistical system was built by month 10 (the &amp;quot;Q-MDP system&amp;quot;: M1). This system was evaluated in simulation and with real users at the start of year 2 (M3), and year 2 then focussed on the creation of a POMDP SDS within this framework (M2). This system was completed towards the end of 2008, and refined and evaluated (in simulation and with real users: M4) in early 2009.\n\nIn summary, we built and evaluated one of the first SDS which used statistical processing end-to-end, and which used context representations to constrain the uncertainty inherent in dialogue. We have shown that this model produces more robust and efficient SDS, especially as noise increases.\n\nWe have therefore shown how to improve dialogue system robustness and efficiency, and developed a methodology allowing SDS to be developed and optimized using data-driven approaches. \n\nWe have shown that such an approach can ultimately lead to a breakthrough in robust, efficient, and natural human-computer SDS, and has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in dialogue management. Applications of the this work include: interactive spoken dialogue systems, dialogue and meeting summarisation, interactive entertainment, intelligent tutoring systems, intelligent personal assistants, and dialogue supported question-answering and search on mobile devices -- such as Apple's Siri.
