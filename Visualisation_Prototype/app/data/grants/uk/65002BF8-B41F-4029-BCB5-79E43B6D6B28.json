In the meantime, phosphate esters are also utilised for the generation, distribution, and application of energy throughout the living systems by the manipulation of anhydrides of phosphoric acid and its esters, notably adenosine triphosphate. The solution to the paradox between the remarkable chemical stability of phosphate mono- and di-esters and their facile manipulation lays in the catalytic power of so-called phosphoryl transfer enzymes to make and break P-O-C and P-O-P bonds rapidly, which gives rise to some of the largest enzymatic rate accelerations yet identified. Despite this central position for phosphoryl transfer enzymes in biological systems, the source of catalytic power and how it is regulated is understood only at a relatively rudimentary level. One of the principal reasons for this is that it is difficult to observe the enzymes in the fleeting moments of catalysis, since the lifetimes of the relevant species are so short. The most informative experimental approaches to unravelling this conundrum are where a chemical that provides a close mimic of the fleeting populated species, but which is stable for far more extended period, is inserted into the enzyme. We have discovered a new type of inorganic species that performs this role far better than any previously identified for phosphoryl transfer enzymes, whereby magnesium and fluoride combine in the active site of the enzyme to make an excellent mimic of a phosphate group being transferred. This exquisite trap of the enzyme, which catches it as if in the act of transferring a phosphate group, enables us to measure how the enzyme is able to impart the enormous stabilisation required to make phosphoryl transfer occur at a rate that is useful for biological systems. We will analyse the trapped enzyme using a combination of experimental and computational methods that we have also developed, in a synergistic and interdisciplinary research programme. The development of this understanding will enable us to guide the evolution of compounds that modulate the activity of phosphoryl transfer enzymes, which are targets for therapeutic and biotechnological intervention in a broad range of important processes from heart disease and cancer to crop protection. The work matches the stated aims of BBSRC in moving towards a more mathematical and physical understanding of biological processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I002146/1","grantId":"BB/I002146/1","fundValue":"464275","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The primary publications from this study have already been cited over 10 times (Nov 2014) even though the grant has just finished.

The specific questions focused on how enzymes are organized to allow efficient approach of a negative polarized group to a predominantly negatively charged target and how they manage charge distribution during this process. The key findings were:\n1. We established how an archetypal phosphoryl transfer enzyme solves the severe energetic problem of attacking a highly negatively charged target with a nucleophile, in particular how the enzymes steers the alignment of the nucleophile with the electropositive phosphorus atom. We observed that near-attack conformations used by enzymes are best divided into two classes, depending on the nature of the interactions between the attacking group and the target.\n2. We determined how the transition state of an archetypal phosphomutase is organised to deliver effective catalysis for two similar but chemically distinct native reactions. \n3. We applied the technology developed using PGM to a distantly related enzyme - protein kinase A - where we showed for the first time the importance of charge balance in an enzyme that utilises two essential magnesium ions during catalysis. These studies provide a firmer foundation upon which to accelerate progress in synthetic biology and enzyme-based biotechnology. The primary industrial beneficiaries of this work are in the biotechnological and pharmaceutical sectors. \n1. This work will benefit researchers in the biotechnological industries by providing a firmer footing from which to reposition enzymes for industrial use. The specific issues to be addressed in the work packages are common issues with many enzymes and are often limiting factors in the efficiency of redesigned systems. \n2. This work will benefit researchers in the pharmaceutical industry by providing a better understanding of the functioning of enzymes, thereby helping them to develop more specific, targeted drug treatments.
