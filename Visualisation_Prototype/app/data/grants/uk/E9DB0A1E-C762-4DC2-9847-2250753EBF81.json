However, we lack the most basic information on which to base decisions about investigation and treatment of patients, local service provision, or national health policy. Indeed, it is this lack of data, rather than a lack of treatments that is the greatest barrier to effective prevention of stroke. This proposed programme covers five linked projects that collectively will provide some of the data required by clinicians and managers to substantially improve the effectiveness of the secondary prevention of stroke. A particular concern is the lack of recognition by the public of the symptoms of TIA (!?mini-strokes!?) and the need to seek medical attention urgently. We recently studied the delay to first call for medial attention in 377 consecutive patients attending three TIA clinics. About 40% of patients with minor stroke and 50% with TIA delayed seeking medical attention for !Y24 hours, and over 90% contacted their GP practice rather than emergency services. Only 41% of patients with minor stroke and 37% with TIA correctly recognised their symptoms and only 45% thought the event was an emergency. Time to seeking medical attention was shorter in those who correctly recognised their symptoms. In related studies, funded by the Stroke Association and the BUPA Foundation, we are doing qualitative research with TIA patients, their relatives and other members of the public to determine how best to increase knowledge and understanding of TIA and stroke. An important part of the research in this current proposal is the identification of the types of clinical presentations of TIA that identify individuals at highest early risk of stroke and which should therefore be given prominence in public education campaigns. Public education has been difficult thus far because of the wide variety and the sometimes non-specific nature of the symptoms of TIA. However, our preliminary data show that the vast majority early strokes occur after TIAs with specific and clearly definable characteristics (especially focal weakness and speech disturbance). Reliable identification of these high-risk !?mini-strokes!? will facilitate public education and public engagement with research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500987","grantId":"G0500987","fundValue":"546304","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter M  Rothwell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
