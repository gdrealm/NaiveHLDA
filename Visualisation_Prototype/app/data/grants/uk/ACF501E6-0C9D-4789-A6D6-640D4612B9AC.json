{"id":"ACF501E6-0C9D-4789-A6D6-640D4612B9AC","title":"Multi-level modelling of mitochondrial energy metabolism","abstractText":"The cells that make up our bodies themselves contain smaller structures that carry out specific tasks in the cell. The mitochondria are one of these components, and they are the main site in the cell where the oxygen that we breathe is used and the carbon dioxide is produced. As part of this process they generate most of the cell's energy and send it out in the form of the chemical ATP for the rest of the cell to use. It is possible to isolate working mitochondria from cells and to study them in the laboratory, so we know a lot about what substances they take up from the cell and how they are used in energy production. Mitochondria can also be taken apart, and we now have detailed knowledge of the components they are built from and the enzymes that bring about the energy production. What remains difficult is building a detailed description of how mitochondria work in the cell from all these isolated bits and pieces. The purpose of this project is to make computer models that will help us to do this. Understanding how mitochondria work is important in itself, but they can develop faults that cause a number of diseases, so the models will also help to understand these diseases better, and maybe help to design treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F005431/1","grantId":"BB/F005431/1","fundValue":"250188","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Andrew Fell","coPersons":["Michael Kenneth Pidcock"],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
