Accordingly, this research focuses on shared households, private lodging arrangements, small housing cooperatives, and cohousing projects (resident-controlled developments combining private dwellings with shared facilities), and will explore the intersections of four distinctive aspects of communal living - economic, spatial, temporal and ideological - in each of these contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 80 individuals living in communal contexts (20 per type), exploring their housing histories and their current living arrangements. The allocation and use of physical space will be explored using spatial mapping techniques, and three further methods - object inventories, time-use diaries, and network mapping - involving targeted sub-samples of participants will explore the use of 'communal' versus 'private' material resources, the use of shared time in communal contexts, and the impact of living communally on the nature of residentsâ€™ personal networks.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006177/1","grantId":"ES/K006177/1","fundValue":"435368","fundStart":"2013-05-31","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sue  Heath","coPersons":["Gemma  Edwards","Katherine  Davies"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
