Data gathered from selected teachers will help us to determine the extent to which teachers succeed in transforming their standard pedagogy.&nbsp; Pre and post-data gathered from the students will show whether this approach has led to significant changes in student achievement and engagement with school science.&nbsp; Comparing this data with that gathered from a set of control students will enable us to test whether the changes can be ascribed to intervention.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0571-A","grantId":"RES-062-23-0571-A","fundValue":"196427","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Osborne","coPersons":["Shirley  Simon"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
