{"id":"7E8267E1-5D8D-473E-8746-94FFDE9519C0","title":"Fantastic Plastic - back by popular demand","abstractText":"This highly respected and popular talk was the product of an original EPSRC grant (GR/N67794/01). Further EPSRC funding was granted for the academic years 2003/4 and 2004/5.The Fantastic Plastic talk explores polymers, their form and nature through to the most up to date applications from disposable nappies to fuel cell cars and polymers with a shape memory. The environmental impact of plastic waste is discussed with the latest ideas for separation for recycling using electrostatics and the importance of biodegradable polymers. All audience members are given a pencil made from a recycled pencil to remind them of the talk and to inspire them to get involved in the development of even more innovative materials research and developmentThe talk was so successful that it was adopted by the Institute of Physics as its prestigious annual Schools and Colleges Lecture for the academic year 2002/3. It was invited to the Royal Institution in 2003 and 2004 and to the Cheltenham Science Festival in 2005To date is has been seen by over 20,000 students, mainly Year 10 (age 14/15), with unanimously positive feedback from teachers and many invitations to return to schools to give the lecture to the next Year 10 cohort. (See letters of support from some of these schools, attached).Funding is now sought to allow it to continue throughout the academic year 2005/6.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D507545/1","grantId":"EP/D507545/1","fundValue":"7128","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  As a PPE project, the objective was to affect a target audience. The concept of using polymer science as a vehicle to enthuse initially school children but, subsequently, other publics about research has demonstrably been highly effective.
