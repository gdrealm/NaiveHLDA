Although largely curable, optimising treatment for individual patients is an important clinical issue. \n\nFor some patients it is currently difficult to predict whether their tumours have spread microscopically and need more treatment compared to those that will be cured with less treatment. As treatments can have serious long-term side-effects such as heart problems and risk of developing other cancers, unnecessary over-treatment of patients should be avoided. On the other hand, if patients are under-treated and their cancers reoccur, further more aggressive salvage treatment, with the associated long term side-effects, is required. \n\nBased on the underlying molecular biology of these tumours our pilot work at The Institute of Cancer Research suggests a promising biomarker to predict otherwise undetectable tumour spread. In our proposed study we will test particular testicular cancer samples from former patients who either did or did not require additional treatment. This will allow us to determine whether our marker, and another promising candidate from available reports, can accurately predict which patients had undetectable tumour spread. A marker would allow optimised patient treatment. Whilst maintaining cure, this would avoid the potentially serious health problems later in life that are associated with over-treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801477","grantId":"G0801477","fundValue":"218043","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Janet  Shipley","coPersons":["Robert  Huddart","Daniel  Berney"],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
