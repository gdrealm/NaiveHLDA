Furthermore, welfare policies differentially affect housing careers by gender and parenthood status and this project will explore the potential impact of recent welfare reforms such as the extension in the age range affected by the limit to housing benefit resulting from the shared accommodation rate for men and women.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K003453/1","grantId":"ES/K003453/1","fundValue":"145551","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Impact from the project is on-going but our findings are informing the assumptions being used in National Population Projections made by the Office for National Statistics, and in the Department for Communities and Local Government 's Household Projections.

We have examined how economic uncertainty relates to the housing transitions of young adults, in particular their ability to leave the parental home. We have also identified young adults' aspirations for their learning - for example aspirations of teenagers to go on to college/education and how these differ by gender, class and race.\nWe have also examined how second generation minority youth differ from the white majority in their anticipated timing and form of their future family formation. Impact is on-going, but already our findings are feeding into ONS and DCLG population and household projections. We have also presented our work to think tanks e.g. Resolution Foundation, and to academic and policy audiences.
