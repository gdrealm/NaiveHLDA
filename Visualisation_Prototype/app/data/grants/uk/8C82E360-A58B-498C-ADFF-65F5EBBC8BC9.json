{"id":"8C82E360-A58B-498C-ADFF-65F5EBBC8BC9","title":"BMT-CES: Biofuel Micro-Trigeneration with Cryogenic Energy Storage","abstractText":"This proposal is concerned with developing a trigeneration system (power, heat and refrigeration) which is fuelled by renewable fuels and can be used in the domestic environment or scaled up to be used in larger, industrial based environments. The system would allow heat, power and refrigeration to be produced locally, where it is needed, using a novel energy storage system and a novel control and optimisation system to produce high efficiency operation.A power generator will be used to generate power using renewable fuels (biofuels). Waste heat from the generator would be collected and used to supply heating and hot water. The waste heat would also be utilised to drive an absorption/adsorption refrigerator. Off peak electricity energy generated but not used will be stored in the electrical storage systemThe project will link together specialised personnel in the UK and China who have the critical expertise necessary to bring together all aspects of this challenging project. The project will also benefit research links between the UK and China. There is substantial potential demand for the system in the UK, China and other parts of the world as the results would provide benefits to government, academia, manufacturers and consumers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F061471/1","grantId":"EP/F061471/1","fundValue":"117762","fundStart":"2008-11-30","fundEnd":"2012-04-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil James  Hewitt","coPersons":["David  McIlveen-Wright","Ye  Huang"],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
