{"id":"06E1A0C1-F354-4EFC-B1B3-04ABD9B7510D","title":"The Million Women Study","abstractText":"We actively involve participants and the public in various stages of our research, using focus groups when designing questionnaires and including lay members in our Steering Committees. The views of members of the public are invited via our study websites and free-phone lines. To date, we have responded to over 6000 enquiries.\n\nWe regularly update our websites, summarizing our results in lay language, and frequently discuss our work at public meetings. We will continue to disseminate our findings widely, since our research is aimed primarily at providing reliable information on modifiable factors that directly affect the health of the public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700474","grantId":"G0700474","fundValue":"3896440","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Valerie  Beral","coPersons":["Jane  Green","Richard  Peto","Gillian  Reeves","Mark  Lathrop","Naomi  Allen","Andrew  Roddam","Elizabeth  Spencer"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
