{"id":"FDD12303-0C34-400C-97AE-E0AA2D0E3678","title":"Reduction in antenatal and early life exposure to secondhand smoke among Chinese children","abstractText":"China has been labelled the &quot;smoking dragon&quot;. However, while most men smoke, women rarely do so. Therefore, secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is highest among women and young children. In China, 180 million children and 360 million adults are exposed to SHS. SHS exposure increases the risk of pregnancy complications, childhood illness and death. Most studies aimed at reducing pregnancy and early childhood exposure to SHS have been conducted in western countries and have focused on encouraging smoking women to quit. In China, where few women smoke, interventions need to influence the behaviour of partners. Most women receive antenatal care. This provides a unique opportunity to address the issue of SHS exposure in the home. The aim of this study is to develop an effective intervention that could be embedded in antenatal care in China.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M009807/1","grantId":"MR/M009807/1","fundValue":"126756","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jill  Pell","coPersons":["Wei-Qing  Chen","DANIEL FRANCIS  MACKAY","Sean  Semple","Sally  Haw","David  Tappin"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
